16175,routine monitoring for harmful algal blooms habs is generally undertaken at low temporal frequency e g weekly to monthly that is unsuitable for capturing highly dynamic variations in cyanobacteria abundance therefore we developed a model incorporating reverse time attention with a decay mechanism retain d to forecast habs with simultaneous improvements in temporal resolution forecasting performance and interpretability the usefulness of retain d in forecasting habs was illustrated by its application to two sites located in the lower sections of the nakdong and yeongsan rivers south korea where habs pose a critical water quality issue three variations of recurrent neural network models i e long short term memory lstm gated recurrent unit gru and reverse time attention retain were adopted for comparisons of performance with retain d input features encompassing meteorological hydrological environmental and biological factors were used to forecast cyanobacteria abundance total cyanobacteria cell counts and cell counts of dominant cyanobacteria taxa incorporation of a decay mechanism into the deep learning structure in retain d allowed forecasts of habs on a high temporal resolution daily without manual feature engineering increasing the usefulness of resulting forecasts for water quality and resources management retain d yielded a high

irregularities in the time series retain d showed higher accuracy than retain except for comparable accuracy in forecasting microcystis abundance at the nakdong river site and outperformed lstm and gru across all model outputs and sites ambient temperature had high importance in forecasting cyanobacteria abundance across all model outputs and sites whereas the relative importance of other input features varied by the output and site increases in contributions with increasing irradiance decreasing flow rates and increasing residence time were more pronounced in summer than other seasons differences in the contributions of input features among different time steps 1 to 7 days prior to forecasting were larger in the yeongsan river site retain d is applicable to a wide range of forecasting models that can benefit from improved temporal resolution performance and interpretability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse time attention mechanism decay mechanism recurrent neural network explainable artificial intelligence harmful algal bloom cyanobacteria 1 introduction cyanobacteria can develop massive harmful algal blooms habs in inland coastal and marine waters generating unsightly odorous scum and toxic substances huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 as they may degrade aesthetic economic and functional values of aquatic ecosystems habs have been considered a critical issue for water quality and resources management hamilton et al 2014 sanseverino et al 2016 however a growing volume of evidence points toward alarming global increases in the frequency duration and magnitude of habs associated with anthropogenically derived eutrophication and climate change burford et al 2020 carey et al 2012 therefore predictive models that quantify the relationships between cyanobacteria abundance and their controlling factors provide a useful basis for decision making furthermore accurate forecasts prior to the occurrence of habs enable preventive measures to be implemented to minimize the financial and ecological consequences of the blooms davidson et al 2016 persaud et al 2015 however high accuracy in forecasting habs can hardly be ensured because numerous drivers e g nutrient inputs carpenter et al 1998 schindler 1977 meteorological paerl et al 2011 hydrological cha et al 2017 and biological factors ger et al 2016 interactively influence cyanobacteria abundance and the formation of habs across differing spatial and temporal scales moreover interannually and seasonally habs show uneven distributions with extremely large variability in magnitude making it more challenging to predict their sporadic occurrences and peak magnitudes accurately cha et al 2014 shin et al 2021 nonetheless routine monitoring operations for habs are generally executed at low temporal frequency generally weekly to monthly coad et al 2014 which by itself is insufficient to capture highly dynamic temporal changes in habs and their controlling factors therefore further modeling efforts are required to address the difficulties associated with hab forecasting deep learning dl is an artificial neural network ann based machine learning method with multiple hidden layers dl has shown success in learning complex characteristics from multivariate or high dimensional voluminous data in a wide range of applications across many fields goodfellow et al 2016 among dl approaches recurrent neural networks rnns with cyclic feedback have a structure that accounts for the temporal dependencies of sequential data making rnns suitable for modeling time series data williams and zipser 1989 furthermore variations of rnns based on a gating mechanism e g long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 reduce the problem of vanishing gradients and showed improved performances when predicting long sequences kim et al 2021 accordingly rnn based models particularly lstm and gru have been increasingly used to forecast algal blooms and cyanobacterial blooms hill et al 2020 lee and lee 2018 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 the vanishing gradient problem associated with time series was further addressed by incorporating an attention mechanism into rnns whereby models are allowed to concentrate on important segments of input data when making predictions niu et al 2021 this technique was proven successful in many applications including machine translation bahdanau et al 2014 speech recognition graves et al 2013 and medical and health care choi et al 2017 in contrast to date only a few hab forecasting models exploited an attention mechanism in their dl structure a dual stage attention based rnn da rnn using high frequency 30 min data yielded enhanced performance in forecasting habs in marine environments wang and xu 2020 pyo et al 2021 also reported accurate forecasts of cyanobacteria abundance in inland waters using a convolutional neural network cnn with an attention mechanism in addition to improving performance dl models with an attention mechanism show enhanced interpretability via attention weights that can inform what the model focused on while making predictions niu et al 2021 providing interpretations based on attention weights afforded a breakthrough that extended the applicability of black box dl models to domains such as hab forecasting where model interpretability is essential to increase insights and disentangle complicated tasks however feature level interpretations provided by attention based dls i e the contributions of input features to predictions have limitations in effectively addressing the abruptly occurring and highly dynamic nature of habs to overcome these limitations reverse time attention retain includes two separate attention mechanisms at the feature and time levels generating time specific contributions of input features to predictions choi et al 2017 consequently compared to standard attention mechanisms retain provides interpretations that are more useful to initiate preventive strategies for the management of habs while exhibiting computational stability in attention generation by exploring input features in a reverse time order choi et al 2017 rasmy et al 2018 therefore this study builds on a retain framework in an attempt to achieve both performance accuracy and interpretability when forecasting habs despite the advantages of retain forecasts and interpretations using the model can be made only as often as the frequency of time series data however monitoring habs using conventional methods e g measuring cell counts biovolume or cyanotoxins incurs substantial costs and time chang et al 2012 mishra et al 2019 accordingly routine monitoring campaigns for managing water quality and resources especially those on large spatial scales national to regional are generally conducted on a weekly to monthly basis coad et al 2014 when cyanobacteria abundance exceeds established threshold criteria some of these monitoring schemes increase the temporal frequency of monitoring which introduces irregularity to time series and adds another difficulty from a modeling perspective cha et al 2014 shin et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 furthermore multivariate data for input features encompassing meteorological hydrological and environmental factors are usually obtained from different monitoring schemes which lead to differing temporal frequencies and temporal mismatches among the features in such cases existing modeling practices involve manual feature engineering such as data matching aggregation or interpolation lee and lee 2018 obenour et al 2014 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however the validity of interpolation is limited for data with long term missing periods for example when the number of missing values exceeds the number of measured values and manual feature engineering can be a lengthy process for a large data set to resolve these difficulties low temporal frequency and the requirement for manual feature engineering we propose the use of automated feature engineering using a recently developed decay mechanism che et al 2018 in this mechanism trainable decays characterize missingness patterns from the multivariate time series in order to model the missing values of the input features when incorporated in dl models such a decay mechanism generates complete time series at the temporal frequency that corresponds to the resolution of the most frequently monitored features in the dataset therefore for hab forecasting in this study we integrated retain with a decay mechanism to develop time attention with a decay mechanism retain d retain d performs automated feature engineering forecasting and interpretations at time and feature levels simultaneously in a single model framework unlike any hab forecasting models to date furthermore applying retain to a regression task rather than classification is rare across all domains and is considered more challenging due to the temporally dynamic nature of the outputs as illustrated in the current study by the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria abundance we illustrate the usefulness of retain d with its application to two different sites located in the lower section of nakdong and yeongsan rivers in south korea fig 1 during the study period 2016 2020 and 2013 2020 for the nakdong and yeongsan rivers respectively meteorological and hydrological features such as ambient temperature irradiance and flow rates were monitored daily whereas other features such as upstream and tributary nutrient concentrations and zooplankton abundance were monitored less frequently and on differing temporal scales through retain d these differing resolutions were enhanced to exhibit a daily scale across all input features and outputs and one day forecasts of habs and their interpretations were produced the objectives of this study were 1 to examine whether retain d successfully captured the temporal characteristics of cyanobacteria abundance namely large variability duration and peak magnitude 2 to evaluate the overall forecasting performance of retain d in comparison to three different rnns lstm gru and retain and 3 to identify time variant contributions of input features to forecasts of cyanobacteria abundance at the two study sites we aim to show how the results of this study can be used to develop hab alert systems for effective water quality and resources management based on data from conventional monitoring schemes furthermore retain d may be applicable to a wide range of domains that could benefit from forecasting with increasing temporal resolution 2 methods 2 1 study area and data description four major rivers han geum yeongsan and nakdong rivers in south korea are heavily engineered with interventions including the construction of 16 weirs across the rivers between 2009 and 2011 three in han three in geum eight in nakdong and two in yeongsan park 2012 in the recent decade an increase in the occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs during summer months has been reported in the nakdong and yeongsan rivers cha et al 2017 pyo et al 2021 the nakdong river has a length of 510 4 km and watershed area of 23 647 km2 in which forested agricultural and urban areas account for 66 4 16 3 and 5 0 respectively the yeongsan river has a length of 136 7 km and watershed area of 3467 8 km2 in which forested agricultural and urban areas account for 43 9 27 7 and 13 2 respectively egis 2020 in this study two downstream sites in the mainstream of the nakdong 35 23 22 n 128 26 22 e and yeongsan 34 58 44 n 126 38 04 e rivers were selected as the study areas fig 1 the cumulative effects of nutrient loads from the upstream watersheds contribute to eutrophication and resulting habs at these sites the dataset for modeling habs in the yeongsan and nakdong rivers consisted of environmental hydrological and meteorological variables provided by multiple data sources table 1 cyanobacteria cell counts cells ml an indicator of the magnitude of habs were defined as the total cell counts of the most commonly occurring four cyanobacteria taxa microcystis aphanizomenon anabaena dolichospermum and oscillatoria nier 2021 cyanobacteria cell counts for the study site in the nakdong river herein referred to as site n located 4 km upstream of the water intake facility were monitored regularly at least once a week as part of the implementation of the harmful cyanobacteria bloom alert system in comparison cyanobacteria cell counts for the study site in the yeongsan river herein referred to as site y located 500 m upstream of the juksan weir were monitored biweekly until 2015 and weekly from 2016 onwards for evaluating the effects of weir construction on aquatic ecology in streams cyanobacteria cell counts collected between 2016 and 2020 at site n and between 2013 and 2020 at site y were used in the study input variables associated with habs were included in the dataset for the corresponding periods water temperature c upstream nutrient loads kg day and nutrient loads from the adjacent tributary the nam river for site n and the munpyeong stream for site y were considered as environmental variables for both site n and site y fig 1 total phosphorus tp mg l and total nitrogen tn mg l concentrations in the upstream and tributary sites were multiplied by concurrent daily flow rate m3 sec to calculate the load on a daily scale kg day nutrient concentrations for the tributary sites and upstream of site n and flow rates for all upstream and tributary sites were monitored weekly nutrient concentrations upstream of site y were monitored monthly until 2014 our preliminary analysis was based on samples for which both nutrient concentrations and flow rates were measured the results suggested that upstream tp 81 4 for site n and 99 7 for site y and tn loads 82 5 for site n and 99 7 for site y accounted for substantially larger proportions of total nutrient loads compared to tributary loads for both sites n and y during the study periods table 1 the effects of point source effluents were not considered in the study because of the absence of point sources such as wastewater treatment plants directly discharging into the mainstream between the study and upstream sites in our study areas daily flow rate was used as a hydrological variable for site n whereas water residence time days calculated as daily storage water volume divided by daily total outflow was used as a hydrological variable for site y for both sites ambient temperature c daily precipitation mm and irradiance mj m2 measured at the nearest automated surface observing system station were included as meteorological variables in addition for site y where biological data such as zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages were available the population abundance of cladocera individuals l was included as a biological variable to account for interactions for example grazing effects between zooplankton and cyanobacteria ger et al 2016 cladoceran abundance was calculated as the sum of densities for individual species that were commonly observed 1 individuals l sample during 2013 2020 at site y the commonly occurring cladocera included moina rectirostris bosmina longirostris and daphnia galeata 2 2 model development in the present study one day forecasting models for habs in the lower river sites were developed using retain d aiming for simultaneous feature engineering and model interpretation section 2 2 1 also three variations of recurrent neural networks rnn for modeling time series i e lstm gru and retain were employed and their model performances were compared with the performance of the retain d model section 2 2 2 the modeling procedure fig 2 included feature selection data preprocessing model training validation and testing hyperparameter tuning using bayesian optimization section 2 2 3 and performance evaluation section 2 2 4 2 2 1 the reverse time attention model with trainable decays retain d attention in neural networks is a mechanism that allows the model to selectively concentrate on relevant parts of sequential data the incorporation of an attention mechanism into the deep learning architecture addresses the long range dependency issue while also providing interpretations of a deep learning model by evaluating the relative importance of features based on attention weights building on this retain adopts the attention mechanisms at two levels i e time level and feature level to evaluate the relative importance of features at different time points also based on a reasonable assumption that recent measurements are worth more attention than old ones retain explores input features in a reverse time order improving computational stability in the process of attention generation choi et al 2017 we developed retain d by combining retain with a decay mechanism fig 3 to model missing values based on a decay mechanism and interpret model outcomes based on retain simultaneously in retain d complete daily sequential data were generated through the decay mechanism and were used to train retain making it possible to generate forecasts and evaluate the importance of time specific features on a daily scale the decay mechanism modeled the unmeasured values of an input feature by fitting the feature s decay rates that account for correlations with other features and missing patterns the decay rates were learned by assuming that the unmeasured value estimated close to the most recently measured value shifts toward the overall measured mean value as the missing period lasts long che et al 2018 this assumption accounts for the temporal autocorrelation the degree of correlations among measurements as a function of the time lag between them of time series data while also reflecting natural purification processes and resilience of ecosystems bowie et al 1985 chapra 2008 the detailed descriptions for calculating the decay rates are provided below a multivariate time series x with d features and t time steps is denoted by x x 1 x 2 x t r t d while the tth element of the dth feature in x is denoted by x t d for incomplete x with missing values missing patterns can be characterized by masking and time intervals a masking vector that distinguishes missing values m t d 0 from measured values m t d 1 is expressed as m m 1 m 2 m t 0 1 t d while time intervals defined as the time elapsed between the latest measurement and currently missing are expressed as δ δ 1 δ 2 δ t r t d a multivariate time series data z that corresponds to the output y of length n is denoted by z x n δ n m n n 1 n in the study unit time and the time step were set at 1 day and 7 days respectively thus rnn models employed in this study forecast yt 1 using week long data z for modeling unmeasured values of an input feature a decay mechanism characterized missing patterns i e masking and time interval to reflect diminishing effects of the latest measurement and shifts toward the overall measured mean over time che et al 2018 decay rates a parameter for the decay mechanism account for correlations among features while at the same time differ by features among which characteristics of missing patterns may be different a vector of decay rates γ is expressed as 1 γ t exp max 0 w γ δ t b γ during the model training fitted w γ and b γ parameters and δ t estimates based on the most recent measurement were combined to learn γ t eq 1 the exponentiated negative rectified linear unit relu was used to ensure the consistent decrease in γ t by the reasonable step within the range 0 1 further missing values were modeled by accounting for the most recently measured value x t d for t t and the arithmetic mean x d of all measured values for the dth feature as follows 2 x t d m t d x t d 1 m t d γ x t d x t d 1 γ x t d x d x d n 1 n t 1 t n m t n d x t n d i 1 n t 1 t n m t n d by applying eq 2 to the time series unmeasured values for all features and points in time were modeled to generate complete daily time series it is noted that missing patterns of input features influence each other s learned decay rates as can be seen in eq 1 consequently the lower the decay rates the closer the missing values are to the recently measured values and the higher the decay rates the closer the missing values are to the overall measured mean values further to generate attention weights at both time level and feature level a linear embedding of the input vector a complete daily sequence generated through the decay mechanism x t r d was performed as follows 3 v t w e m b x t where v t r v and w e m b r v d indicate the embeddings and embedding matrix respectively retain uses two rnns i e r n n α and r n n β to generate attention weights separately at time level α α 1 α 2 α t and feature level β β 1 β 2 β t these are calculated corresponding to the time embedding v v 1 v 2 v t and each coordinate of time embedding v 1 1 v 1 2 v 1 v v t 1 v t 2 v t v respectively fig 3 this process can be expressed as follows 4 g t g t 1 g 1 r n n α v t v t 1 v 1 e t w α t g t b α f o r t 1 t α 1 α 2 α t s o f t m a x e 1 e 2 e t h t h t 1 h 1 r n n β v t v t 1 v 1 5 β t tanh w β h t b β f o r t 1 t where g t r p and h t r q denote the hidden layer of r n n α and r n n β at the time step t respectively also w α r p b α r w β r v q and b β r v are learned parameters hyperparameters p and q determine the hidden layer size of r n n α and r n n β respectively as in eqs 4 and 5 time embedding is fed to rnns in a reverse time order to generate attention vectors α and β because these vectors are allowed to respond sensitively to different time steps during the model training the reverse attention mechanism facilitates stable attention generation further the context vector c t at the time step t and the sum of c t over time steps c n are calculated based on weight vectors and embeddings as follows 6 c t α t β t v t 7 c n t 1 t c t by including c n in the fully connected layer fc at the end of retain corresponding predictions y n were made as follows 8 y n f c c n finally the contribution ω of input features at each time step to the prediction was modeled as follows 9 ω y n x t d f c c t d f c α t d β t d w e m b d x t d retain d was developed and implemented using pytorch paszke et al 2019 and sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 libraries in python 3 6 8 van rossum and drake 1995 2 2 2 rnn models for comparison three different rnns lstm gru and retain were employed in this study and their performances were compared with that of retain d lstm and gru are commonly used variations of rnns in contrast to the conventional rnn lstm consists of four gates input forget update and output gates among which necessary information for the long term is selectively transferred lstm has shown success in training long sequences by addressing the vanishing gradient problem greff et al 2017 gru while retaining the advantages of lstm further simplifies the structure into two gates reset and update gates therefore resulting in faster model training than lstm chung et al 2014 the details for retain are described in section 2 2 1 as lstm gru and retain do not involve the decay mechanism these baseline models were developed and implemented on a weekly resolution unit time 1 week therefore the values for input features were temporally matched with output values on a weekly basis because the harmful cyanobacteria alert system monitored semiweekly in response to cyanobacteria cell count exceeding the alert level of 10 000 cells ml until the cell count reduced 1000 cells ml for such days the weekly average was used as the output value after the matching missing values were imputed using a kalman filter welch and bishop 2006 the baseline models forecast one week ahead with the time step being set at 1 two hidden layers were included in lstm and gru to match the depth of retain lstm gru and retain were developed and implemented using the pytorch paszke et al 2019 and pykalman duckworth 2015 libraries in python 3 6 8 2 2 3 model implementation cyanobacteria cell counts were forecast on a daily scale using retain d whereas they were forecast on a weekly scale using the three baseline rnn models lstm gru and retain in addition cell counts of the dominant cyanobacterial taxa microcystis and aphanizomenon for site n and microcystis and anabaena for site y were forecast as input features upstream tp and tn loads tributary tp and tn loads a hydrological factor flow rate for site n and water residence time for site y daily precipitation irradiance and ambient temperature were included since ambient temperature showed high correlation with water temperature pearson s correlation coefficient 0 96 for site n and 0 97 for site y and was measured daily compared to weekly measured water temperature ambient temperature was selected as an input additional to these cladoceran abundance was included as an input for site y the dataset for site n was divided into training 70 jan 2016 jul 2019 validation 15 jul 2019 mar 2020 and test 15 apr 2020 dec 2020 periods table s1 the data for site y were similarly divided into training 75 jan 2013 dec 2018 validation 12 5 jan 2019 dec 2019 and test 12 5 jan 2020 dec 2020 periods but with slighly altered proportions due to its longer modeling period log transformation natural base was applied to the input features except for ambient temperature and irradiance based on the training data each input feature was scaled to range from 0 to 1 using min max normalization to avoid the effects of the differing scales among the features on parameter learning for retain d time step was set at 7 days reflecting the travel time from upstream and tributary sites to the study sites 1 95 and 0 43 days from the upstream and tributary sites to site n and 3 69 and 0 48 days from the upstream and tributary sites to site y based on median flow velocity and the hab monitoring frequency weekly in general the time step for the baseline rnn models was set at 1 week consistent with the time step for retain d hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model performance during the model training mean squared error mse was used as the loss function for backpropagation while the number of epochs was set at 2000 the tree structured parzen estimator tpe bergstra et al 2011 one of the popular bayesian optimization methods was used in this study for hyperparameter tuning the tpe sequentially reflects the results of previous trials in hyperparameter optimization and identifies candidate sets of hyperparameters that have the greatest expected improvement ei 10 e i y x y y y p x y p y p x d y where x is the set of hyperparameters y is the loss function value and y is the threshold for pre defined quantile γ 0 15 herein when p y y γ tpe defines p x y using two estimated densities from a set of hyperparameters that make loss function lower or greater than the threshold as follows 11 p x y l x i f y y g x i f y y based on this ei can be re expressed simply as follows 12 e i y x γ g x l x 1 γ 1 therefore the optimization process focuses on the trials with lower loss higher performance and converges to the optimal set of hyperparameters table 2 the search space for seven hyperparameters activation function hidden dimension batch size dropout rate in the embedding layer dropout rate in the fully connected layer learning rate and weight decay of retain d was explored using the tpe table 2 of the seven hyperparameters of retain d batch size and dropout embedding layer were excluded from lstm and gru while batch size was excluded from retain mse was used as the loss function for hyperparameter tuning on the validation set during both model training and hyperparameter tuning the mse was calculated using measured data only that is imputed data from the decay mechanism were excluded from the calculation of mse a set of hyperparameters that resulted in the minimum mse was applied to the retain d and baseline rnn models the tpe based hyperparameter tuning was implemented with 100 iterations using hyperopt bergstra et al 2015 library in python 3 6 8 van rossum and drake 1995 2 2 4 performance evaluation using the measured test set that is excluding the data that were imputed using the decay mechanism the performances of retain and other rnn models were evaluated based on four different metrics root mean squared error rmse coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape the formulae for these evaluation metrics are as follows 14 r m s e i 1 n y o b s y p r e d 2 n 15 r 2 1

test set and y o b s and y p r e d denote the measured output value and forecast output value respectively also y o b s indicates the mean of measured output values 3 results 3 1 seasonality of cyanobacteria and hydrometeorological factors sites n and y located in the lower part of the nakdong and yeongsan rivers showed apparent seasonality in meteorological and hydrological factors during the study period as can be seen in the wide ranges of these factors in table 1 summer june to september was characterized by high ambient temperature median 23 8 c at site n and 23 8 c at site y high irradiance median 5 35 mj m2 at site n and 17 03 mj m2 at site y and large amounts of precipitation median 0 mean 7 01 mm at site n and median 0 mean 5 24 mm at site y for details of other seasons please see table 1 accordingly flow rates at site n were substantially larger in summer median 228 9 m3 s than in other seasons median 125 76 m3 s whereas water residence time during summer median 5 63 days was significantly shorter than that during other seasons median 9 91 days at site y sites n and y experienced severe habs during the study period with the maximum cyanobacteria cell counts exceeding a hundred thousand at both sites 134 670 cells ml at site n and 357 600 cells ml at site y the measured cyanobacteria abundance also showed distinct seasonality with cyanobacteria cell counts being substantially higher in summer months june to september median 8404 5 cells ml at site n and 481 5 cells ml at site y than in other seasons median 69 cells ml at site n and 0 cells ml at site y table 1 fig 4 although summer proliferation of habs was common to sites n and y the two sites showed differing temporal patterns in other seasons at site n cyanobacteria abundance exceeding the attention level cyanobacteria cell counts 1000 cells ml of the harmful cyanobacteria bloom alert system persisted from late spring may through early winter december with its duration substantially varying by year fig 4a whereas at site y this level of abundance occurred mainly in summer except for 2020 when cyanobacteria abundance was higher in fall october november than summer fig 4b moreover hab events exceeding the warning level 10 000 cells ml occurred 51 times in summer and 11 times in spring march may and fall at site n whereas such events occurred 26 times in summer only at site y for both sites n and y microcystis dominated the cyanobacteria community during summer reaching the maximums of 133 750 cells ml at site n and 357 600 cells ml at site y table 1 in contrast cyanobacteria community composition differed between the two sites in seasons other than summer at site n aphanizomenon tended to dominate among the cyanobacteria taxa with cell counts of aphanizomenon dominating in 73 4 of total samples monitored during non summer seasons with the maximum cell count of 26 610 cells ml whereas at site y the dominance of microcystis persisted 57 1 maximum 91 540 cells ml and that of anabaena 21 4 maximum 1275 cells ml increased during non summer seasons 3 2 modeling unmeasured values the incorporation of a decay mechanism in retain d generated a complete multivariate data set with an enhanced temporal resolution in contrast to existing modeling practices that involve manual feature engineering such as temporal aggregation by calculating monthly means matching values among temporal mismatches and interpolating missing values in this study unmeasured values of all input features and outputs were modeled using retain d to consistently exhibit a daily scale consequently the percentages of modeled values in the entire time series were largely determined by the monitoring frequency of the feature fig 5 therefore for both sites n and y major proportions 84 46 89 93 of values were modeled for environmental upstream and tributary nutrient loads and biological cell counts of cyanobacteria taxa factors that were monitored weekly with time variant frequency in contrast the percentages of modeled values accounted for insignificant proportions 0 0 49 of the time series for the daily monitored meteorological and hydrological factors for which only missing values were modeled 3 3 performance evaluation the model outputs were cyanobacteria cell counts and cell counts of dominant cyanobacteria taxa microcystis and aphanizomenon for

feature levels based on the entire data set including all measured training validation and test sets relative feature importance based on overall mean absolute feature level attention weights of each feature over all instances and times steps t 1 to 7 days indicated that ambient temperature was the most important feature in forecasting most outputs with one exception namely for cyanobacteria cell counts at site n where the cyanobacteria abundance during the past week appeared to be considerably more important than other input features fig 8 at site y a hydrological factor residence time was consistently the second most important feature for all outputs whereas the relative importance of the hydrological factor flow rates for site n varied depending on the output in general irradiance showed relatively high second to fifth highest importance across model outputs and sites we evaluated seasonal differences in the contributions of hydrometeorological factors that were monitored daily and showed generally high importance to forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts fig 9 for site n the mean contributions of increasing temperature to the forecast cyanobacteria cell counts tended to increase over all time steps regardless of seasons with pronounced increases in summer whereas for site y these contributions either increased or remained low across seasons fig 9a d the mean contributions of irradiance and flow rates for site n or residence time for site y to the forecast cyanobacteria cell counts over all time steps revealed apparent seasonality for both sites n and y increases in irradiance were associated with significant increases in the mean contributions in summer slope 0 005 p 0 05 for site n slope 0 013 p 0 05 for site y in other seasons increases in irradiance were associated with decreases in the mean contributions for site n slope 0 0004 p 0 05 and smaller increases in the mean contributions for site y slope 0 004 p 0 05 fig 9b e also for site n the mean contributions of flow rates decreased as flow rates increased and this was more apparent in summer slope 0 001 p 0 05 than in other seasons slope 0 000 p 0 899 for site y the mean contributions of residence time increased with increasing residence time and this was more apparent in summer slope 0 030 p 0 05 than in other seasons slope 0 001 p 0 05 furthermore time variant contributions of hydrometeorological features to forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts are illustrated in fig 10 across all time steps the mean contributions of all these hydrometeorological features to forecast cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml exceeding the warning level were positive and higher than those to forecast cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml for site n temporal changes in the contribution of each feature were generally marginal except for a slight increase in the contribution of irradiance with a shift from time step 4 to 3 at cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml fig 10b for site y variations of feature contributions at different time steps were larger compared to site n for forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml with the time steps 2 4 making greater contributions than other time steps fig 10d f 4 discussion 4 1 effects of automated feature engineering habs can form and develop rapidly in response to interactions among numerous drivers with cyanobacteria abundance increasing by several orders of magnitude within days havens 2008 therefore reliable short term forecasts of habs at locations of concern e g stagnant water or high importance e g upstream of water supply intakes can be useful to assist decision making and formulating advice about how to prevent or mitigate habs associated risks and costs rousso et al 2020 however the temporal resolution of multivariate data sets used for forecasting habs often weekly to monthly scales is usually unsuitable to ensure the efficacy of developed models and can differ among input features despite the success that rnn based dls showed across various domains low temporal frequency of data and temporal discrepancies among features may hamper the improvements that can potentially be achieved by these approaches our forecasting results showed that retain d addressed these hurdles successfully generating complete time series with increasing data volume and temporal resolution generally the greater accuracy of forecasts using retain d compared to those using retain with a sole exception of forecast microcystis cell counts for site n table 3 suggested that the decay mechanism generated multivariate synthetic time series data that well reflected reality and the resultant increase in data volume led to improved parameter learning in fact retain d tended to capture the magnitude of peak and low cyanobacteria abundance accurately figs 6 and 7 whereas retain underestimated the overall degree of variability in cyanobacteria abundance figs s2 and s3 however due to the different temporal resolutions and time steps of the retain d and baseline rnn models comparisons of performance among them should not be considered in parallel also because model outputs cyanobacteria and microcystis cell counts for site n included occasional semiweekly data during the testing period see section 2 2 2 for weekly baseline models including retain those semiweekly output data were averaged over a week and used as output values this manual feature engineering likely decreased the degree of variation in measured and forecast outputs from the baseline models slightly affecting the magnitude of deviations and evaluation metrics in several studies synthetic data were generated using the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for the purpose of data augmentation before forecasting habs using anns or rnn based models park et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 despite advantages such as performance improvements and provision of spatial representation from using a hybrid of process based and data driven models developing a separate process based model requires additional effort moreover implementation of the resultant hybrid models requires additional work such as manual feature engineering and rescaling of temporal resolution and is based on multiple processes in contrast retain d was implemented in a single step process 4 2 effects of using a reverse attention mechanism retain d and retain outperformed lstm and gru across all model outputs and sites table 3 suggesting that the use of a reverse attention mechanism was effective in improving forecasting performance compared to retain d and retain lstm and gru frequently failed to capture the timing and magnitude of sudden changes in cyanobacteria abundance at both sites figs 6 7 and s2 s3 most apparently lstm and gru substantially overestimated cyanobacteria abundance during the lasting non bloom seasons for site y fig s3 the relatively low performances of lstm and gru shown in this study appear inconsistent with many studies that presented superior performance of rnn based models in predicting chlorophyll a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms cho and park 2019 lee and lee 2018 and other water quality parameters jiang et al 2021 kim et al 2021 these published results confirm that the recurrent architectures which allow rnn based models to retain and use past information to forecast future outcomes are advantageous for modeling sequence data however our results suggest that these rnn based models have limited capability in forecasting temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria cell counts that typically include many zeros and have several orders of magnitude larger variance than other water quality parameters our results suggest that despite the difficulty in modeling cyanobacteria abundance feature level and time level attentions enabled the models retain and particularly retain d to accurately forecast consecutive zeros and closely reflect extremely large variances of measured cell counts of cyanobacteria and dominant taxa figs 6 7 and s2 s3 the use of time level attentions allowed retain d to concentrate on important time steps for parameter learning in contrast to the rnn based models that considered all steps of the input sequence equivalently bahdanau et al 2014 choi et al 2017 also feature level attentions in retain d allowed for a weighted focus on important features among inputs choi et al 2017 some recently developed models dual stage attention lstm da lstm e g qin et al 2017 include feature level and time level attention mechanisms similar to those in retain d these models also reported positive effects of using dual attentions in performance improvements however whereas feature and time level attentions in da lstm have serial architecture those in retain d have parallel architecture where feature and time level attention weights are retained separately thus yielding more explicit interpretations at the feature and time levels furthermore training the model in reverse time order facilitates stabilized attention generation and efficient parameter learning choi et al 2017 the temporal distributions of the contributions of input features especially daily monitored important features such as ambient temperature irradiance residence time and flow rates to individual forecasts illustrated that high contributions were clearly distinguished from low contributions in general agreement with model outputs indicating the efficacy of using reverse attentions for capturing the temporal dynamics of habs figs s4 s5 noticeably based on generated attentions retain d successfully modeled cell counts of different cyanobacteria taxa despite markedly differing temporal characteristics among them e g longer proliferation durations for aphanizomenon fig s4c than microcystis fig s4b and substantially higher peak magnitudes for microcystis fig s5b than anabaena fig s5c 4 3 validity and limitations of interpretations in the forecasts of habs using retain d the overall mean contributions of each input feature over all measured instances and time steps provided a basis for evaluating the relative importance among input features our forecasts generally indicated the foremost importance of ambient temperature in determining the magnitude of habs fig 8 consistent with numerous published reports of strong positive associations between temperature and habs cha et al 2017 elliott 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 the only exception was that in forecasting cyanobacteria cell counts for site n the magnitude of cyanobacteria cell counts in the past seven days was substantially more informative than other input features including temperature fig 8a this result may have arisen in part from the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria abundance in site n where dominance of microcystis in summer and that of aphanizomenon in late spring and fall through early winter account for increases in cell counts of cyanobacteria over different seasons fig 4a these temporal patterns contrast with those for site y for which the duration of high abundance is usually shorter and more pronounced fig 4 therefore for site n a high cyanobacteria abundance persisting over a wide range of ambient temperatures may decrease the relative importance of temperature while increasing that of past cyanobacteria abundance in forecasting cyanobacteria cell counts furthermore the high importance of past cyanobacteria abundance may also reflect the movement of hab biomass from the upstream area of high concern in the nakdong river ahn et al 2021 the relative importance of a hydrological factor flow rates for site n and residence time for site y differed between the sites for site n flow rate was less important than was residence time for site y and its relative importance varied among different model outputs fig 8a c whereas for site y residence time was consistently the second most important feature across model outputs fig 8d f these differences can be explained by different hydrological conditions between the sites site n is located 12 km distant from the downstream changnyeong haman weir with an overall mean flow velocity of 0 11 m s one standard deviation 0 20 m s in contrast site y is located proximate to 500 m upstream of the juksan weir with overall slower flow velocity mean 0 05 m s one standard deviation 0 11 m s in addition highly dynamic changes in outflow due to weir gate operations may have increased the importance of the hydrological factor in determining the magnitude of habs at site y changes in magnitude and direction of contributions mean values over all instances and time steps of 1 to 7 days of meteorological and hydrological factors i e ambient temperature irradiance and flow rates or residence time generally agreed well with seasonal patterns of cyanobacteria cell counts fig 9 in addition these contributions indicated the interactions among these features demonstrating that during summer concurrent increases in temperature and irradiance and decreases in flow rates and increases in residence time in the past week likely increased cyanobacteria cell counts at both sites figs 9 s4 and s5 furthermore temporal variations in contributions mean values over all instances at each time step of these hydrometeorological features among different time steps showed differing patterns between the two sites fig 10 at site n the differences in contributions of hydrometeorological features among different time steps were marginal fig 10a c while these differences were more pronounced at site y especially for forecast high cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cell ml fig 10d f generally long durations longer than several months of habs at site n may lead to similar contributions among different time steps within a span of seven days whereas greater temporally varying contributions for site y were attributable to relatively shorter durations of habs at this site moreover across the hydrometeorological features contributions to forecasts for site y at time steps 2 4 were larger than those at the proximate time step time step of 1 day fig 10d f these lagged responses likely indicated the accumulated effects of input features on habs at site y where flow velocities were was generally slow in addition to their overall temporal trends the contributions of input features to individual forecasts showed large variations for example contributions of hydrometeorological features to forecasts that captured the initial timing of cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml were consistently positive with large variations over time steps fig s6 the effects of nutrient loads davis et al 2009 mcdonald and lehman 2013 paerl et al 2016 and biological factors gliwicz 1990 smayda 2008 on habs have been widely studied in this study upstream and tributary nutrient loads tp and tn and cladoceran abundance showed varying degrees of importance in forecasting habs fig 8 however interpretations of their feature importance especially temporal variations in their contributions were limited by the large proportions of modeled values 84 46 for all these features relative to the entire time series to address the limited interpretability increases in monitoring frequency for nutrient concentrations and biological factors are required particularly in tributaries prone to data scarcity but changing the monitoring schemes at a large spatial scale is accompanied by substantial increases in costs alternatively developing variations of decay mechanisms and multiple interpretable methods to complement the lack of measured data and comparing them in future studies can enhance the reliability of modeled values and interpretations 5 conclusions retain d was developed to forecast habs daily at the downstream sites in the nakdong and yeongsan rivers south korea in this study retain d generated complete time series data without manual feature engineering processes such as temporal aggregation matching and interpolation while increasing the temporal resolution of forecasts from weekly to daily retain d yielded high forecasting accuracy across all model outputs and sites and substantially outperformed other rnn based models i e lstm gru and retain retain d represented the temporal patterns of habs well with timely forecasts of abundance peaks and sustained low and high cyanobacteria abundance therefore forecasting results using retain d provide a useful quantitative basis for decision making for managing water quality and resources furthermore considering that temporal changes in cyanobacteria abundance can occur rapidly further increases in the temporal resolution of forecasts hourly basis could potentially increase the usefulness of such hab forecasting models in contrast absence of input features monitored at high frequency can restrict the forecasting models from achieving improved temporal resolution despite the use of retain d temperature was of prime importance in determining the magnitude of cyanobacteria abundance according to the interpretations of the retain d forecasts at time and feature levels furthermore the contributions of input features to individual forecasts displayed seasonality during summer increases in ambient temperature and irradiance concurrent with decreases in flow rates or increases in residence time led to pronounced increases in abundance of cyanobacteria in future efforts extending the time steps for example to account for a monthly scale may improve the delineation of such temporal variations in feature importance although the interpretability of attention based dls is generally not fully understood among researchers in this study the interpretations derived from retain d generally had high environmental relevance leading us to advocate the use of attention generation to improve interpretability declaration of

16175,routine monitoring for harmful algal blooms habs is generally undertaken at low temporal frequency e g weekly to monthly that is unsuitable for capturing highly dynamic variations in cyanobacteria abundance therefore we developed a model incorporating reverse time attention with a decay mechanism retain d to forecast habs with simultaneous improvements in temporal resolution forecasting performance and interpretability the usefulness of retain d in forecasting habs was illustrated by its application to two sites located in the lower sections of the nakdong and yeongsan rivers south korea where habs pose a critical water quality issue three variations of recurrent neural network models i e long short term memory lstm gated recurrent unit gru and reverse time attention retain were adopted for comparisons of performance with retain d input features encompassing meteorological hydrological environmental and biological factors were used to forecast cyanobacteria abundance total cyanobacteria cell counts and cell counts of dominant cyanobacteria taxa incorporation of a decay mechanism into the deep learning structure in retain d allowed forecasts of habs on a high temporal resolution daily without manual feature engineering increasing the usefulness of resulting forecasts for water quality and resources management retain d yielded a high degree of accuracy rmse 0 29 1 67 r 2 0 76 0 98 mae 0 18 1 14 smape 9 77 87 94 for test sets on natural log scales across model outputs and sites successfully capturing high variability and irregularities in the time series retain d showed higher accuracy than retain except for comparable accuracy in forecasting microcystis abundance at the nakdong river site and outperformed lstm and gru across all model outputs and sites ambient temperature had high importance in forecasting cyanobacteria abundance across all model outputs and sites whereas the relative importance of other input features varied by the output and site increases in contributions with increasing irradiance decreasing flow rates and increasing residence time were more pronounced in summer than other seasons differences in the contributions of input features among different time steps 1 to 7 days prior to forecasting were larger in the yeongsan river site retain d is applicable to a wide range of forecasting models that can benefit from improved temporal resolution performance and interpretability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse time attention mechanism decay mechanism recurrent neural network explainable artificial intelligence harmful algal bloom cyanobacteria 1 introduction cyanobacteria can develop massive harmful algal blooms habs in inland coastal and marine waters generating unsightly odorous scum and toxic substances huisman et al 2018 paerl and otten 2013 as they may degrade aesthetic economic and functional values of aquatic ecosystems habs have been considered a critical issue for water quality and resources management hamilton et al 2014 sanseverino et al 2016 however a growing volume of evidence points toward alarming global increases in the frequency duration and magnitude of habs associated with anthropogenically derived eutrophication and climate change burford et al 2020 carey et al 2012 therefore predictive models that quantify the relationships between cyanobacteria abundance and their controlling factors provide a useful basis for decision making furthermore accurate forecasts prior to the occurrence of habs enable preventive measures to be implemented to minimize the financial and ecological consequences of the blooms davidson et al 2016 persaud et al 2015 however high accuracy in forecasting habs can hardly be ensured because numerous drivers e g nutrient inputs carpenter et al 1998 schindler 1977 meteorological paerl et al 2011 hydrological cha et al 2017 and biological factors ger et al 2016 interactively influence cyanobacteria abundance and the formation of habs across differing spatial and temporal scales moreover interannually and seasonally habs show uneven distributions with extremely large variability in magnitude making it more challenging to predict their sporadic occurrences and peak magnitudes accurately cha et al 2014 shin et al 2021 nonetheless routine monitoring operations for habs are generally executed at low temporal frequency generally weekly to monthly coad et al 2014 which by itself is insufficient to capture highly dynamic temporal changes in habs and their controlling factors therefore further modeling efforts are required to address the difficulties associated with hab forecasting deep learning dl is an artificial neural network ann based machine learning method with multiple hidden layers dl has shown success in learning complex characteristics from multivariate or high dimensional voluminous data in a wide range of applications across many fields goodfellow et al 2016 among dl approaches recurrent neural networks rnns with cyclic feedback have a structure that accounts for the temporal dependencies of sequential data making rnns suitable for modeling time series data williams and zipser 1989 furthermore variations of rnns based on a gating mechanism e g long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and gated recurrent unit gru cho et al 2014 reduce the problem of vanishing gradients and showed improved performances when predicting long sequences kim et al 2021 accordingly rnn based models particularly lstm and gru have been increasingly used to forecast algal blooms and cyanobacterial blooms hill et al 2020 lee and lee 2018 shin et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 the vanishing gradient problem associated with time series was further addressed by incorporating an attention mechanism into rnns whereby models are allowed to concentrate on important segments of input data when making predictions niu et al 2021 this technique was proven successful in many applications including machine translation bahdanau et al 2014 speech recognition graves et al 2013 and medical and health care choi et al 2017 in contrast to date only a few hab forecasting models exploited an attention mechanism in their dl structure a dual stage attention based rnn da rnn using high frequency 30 min data yielded enhanced performance in forecasting habs in marine environments wang and xu 2020 pyo et al 2021 also reported accurate forecasts of cyanobacteria abundance in inland waters using a convolutional neural network cnn with an attention mechanism in addition to improving performance dl models with an attention mechanism show enhanced interpretability via attention weights that can inform what the model focused on while making predictions niu et al 2021 providing interpretations based on attention weights afforded a breakthrough that extended the applicability of black box dl models to domains such as hab forecasting where model interpretability is essential to increase insights and disentangle complicated tasks however feature level interpretations provided by attention based dls i e the contributions of input features to predictions have limitations in effectively addressing the abruptly occurring and highly dynamic nature of habs to overcome these limitations reverse time attention retain includes two separate attention mechanisms at the feature and time levels generating time specific contributions of input features to predictions choi et al 2017 consequently compared to standard attention mechanisms retain provides interpretations that are more useful to initiate preventive strategies for the management of habs while exhibiting computational stability in attention generation by exploring input features in a reverse time order choi et al 2017 rasmy et al 2018 therefore this study builds on a retain framework in an attempt to achieve both performance accuracy and interpretability when forecasting habs despite the advantages of retain forecasts and interpretations using the model can be made only as often as the frequency of time series data however monitoring habs using conventional methods e g measuring cell counts biovolume or cyanotoxins incurs substantial costs and time chang et al 2012 mishra et al 2019 accordingly routine monitoring campaigns for managing water quality and resources especially those on large spatial scales national to regional are generally conducted on a weekly to monthly basis coad et al 2014 when cyanobacteria abundance exceeds established threshold criteria some of these monitoring schemes increase the temporal frequency of monitoring which introduces irregularity to time series and adds another difficulty from a modeling perspective cha et al 2014 shin et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 furthermore multivariate data for input features encompassing meteorological hydrological and environmental factors are usually obtained from different monitoring schemes which lead to differing temporal frequencies and temporal mismatches among the features in such cases existing modeling practices involve manual feature engineering such as data matching aggregation or interpolation lee and lee 2018 obenour et al 2014 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however the validity of interpolation is limited for data with long term missing periods for example when the number of missing values exceeds the number of measured values and manual feature engineering can be a lengthy process for a large data set to resolve these difficulties low temporal frequency and the requirement for manual feature engineering we propose the use of automated feature engineering using a recently developed decay mechanism che et al 2018 in this mechanism trainable decays characterize missingness patterns from the multivariate time series in order to model the missing values of the input features when incorporated in dl models such a decay mechanism generates complete time series at the temporal frequency that corresponds to the resolution of the most frequently monitored features in the dataset therefore for hab forecasting in this study we integrated retain with a decay mechanism to develop time attention with a decay mechanism retain d retain d performs automated feature engineering forecasting and interpretations at time and feature levels simultaneously in a single model framework unlike any hab forecasting models to date furthermore applying retain to a regression task rather than classification is rare across all domains and is considered more challenging due to the temporally dynamic nature of the outputs as illustrated in the current study by the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria abundance we illustrate the usefulness of retain d with its application to two different sites located in the lower section of nakdong and yeongsan rivers in south korea fig 1 during the study period 2016 2020 and 2013 2020 for the nakdong and yeongsan rivers respectively meteorological and hydrological features such as ambient temperature irradiance and flow rates were monitored daily whereas other features such as upstream and tributary nutrient concentrations and zooplankton abundance were monitored less frequently and on differing temporal scales through retain d these differing resolutions were enhanced to exhibit a daily scale across all input features and outputs and one day forecasts of habs and their interpretations were produced the objectives of this study were 1 to examine whether retain d successfully captured the temporal characteristics of cyanobacteria abundance namely large variability duration and peak magnitude 2 to evaluate the overall forecasting performance of retain d in comparison to three different rnns lstm gru and retain and 3 to identify time variant contributions of input features to forecasts of cyanobacteria abundance at the two study sites we aim to show how the results of this study can be used to develop hab alert systems for effective water quality and resources management based on data from conventional monitoring schemes furthermore retain d may be applicable to a wide range of domains that could benefit from forecasting with increasing temporal resolution 2 methods 2 1 study area and data description four major rivers han geum yeongsan and nakdong rivers in south korea are heavily engineered with interventions including the construction of 16 weirs across the rivers between 2009 and 2011 three in han three in geum eight in nakdong and two in yeongsan park 2012 in the recent decade an increase in the occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs during summer months has been reported in the nakdong and yeongsan rivers cha et al 2017 pyo et al 2021 the nakdong river has a length of 510 4 km and watershed area of 23 647 km2 in which forested agricultural and urban areas account for 66 4 16 3 and 5 0 respectively the yeongsan river has a length of 136 7 km and watershed area of 3467 8 km2 in which forested agricultural and urban areas account for 43 9 27 7 and 13 2 respectively egis 2020 in this study two downstream sites in the mainstream of the nakdong 35 23 22 n 128 26 22 e and yeongsan 34 58 44 n 126 38 04 e rivers were selected as the study areas fig 1 the cumulative effects of nutrient loads from the upstream watersheds contribute to eutrophication and resulting habs at these sites the dataset for modeling habs in the yeongsan and nakdong rivers consisted of environmental hydrological and meteorological variables provided by multiple data sources table 1 cyanobacteria cell counts cells ml an indicator of the magnitude of habs were defined as the total cell counts of the most commonly occurring four cyanobacteria taxa microcystis aphanizomenon anabaena dolichospermum and oscillatoria nier 2021 cyanobacteria cell counts for the study site in the nakdong river herein referred to as site n located 4 km upstream of the water intake facility were monitored regularly at least once a week as part of the implementation of the harmful cyanobacteria bloom alert system in comparison cyanobacteria cell counts for the study site in the yeongsan river herein referred to as site y located 500 m upstream of the juksan weir were monitored biweekly until 2015 and weekly from 2016 onwards for evaluating the effects of weir construction on aquatic ecology in streams cyanobacteria cell counts collected between 2016 and 2020 at site n and between 2013 and 2020 at site y were used in the study input variables associated with habs were included in the dataset for the corresponding periods water temperature c upstream nutrient loads kg day and nutrient loads from the adjacent tributary the nam river for site n and the munpyeong stream for site y were considered as environmental variables for both site n and site y fig 1 total phosphorus tp mg l and total nitrogen tn mg l concentrations in the upstream and tributary sites were multiplied by concurrent daily flow rate m3 sec to calculate the load on a daily scale kg day nutrient concentrations for the tributary sites and upstream of site n and flow rates for all upstream and tributary sites were monitored weekly nutrient concentrations upstream of site y were monitored monthly until 2014 our preliminary analysis was based on samples for which both nutrient concentrations and flow rates were measured the results suggested that upstream tp 81 4 for site n and 99 7 for site y and tn loads 82 5 for site n and 99 7 for site y accounted for substantially larger proportions of total nutrient loads compared to tributary loads for both sites n and y during the study periods table 1 the effects of point source effluents were not considered in the study because of the absence of point sources such as wastewater treatment plants directly discharging into the mainstream between the study and upstream sites in our study areas daily flow rate was used as a hydrological variable for site n whereas water residence time days calculated as daily storage water volume divided by daily total outflow was used as a hydrological variable for site y for both sites ambient temperature c daily precipitation mm and irradiance mj m2 measured at the nearest automated surface observing system station were included as meteorological variables in addition for site y where biological data such as zooplankton and phytoplankton assemblages were available the population abundance of cladocera individuals l was included as a biological variable to account for interactions for example grazing effects between zooplankton and cyanobacteria ger et al 2016 cladoceran abundance was calculated as the sum of densities for individual species that were commonly observed 1 individuals l sample during 2013 2020 at site y the commonly occurring cladocera included moina rectirostris bosmina longirostris and daphnia galeata 2 2 model development in the present study one day forecasting models for habs in the lower river sites were developed using retain d aiming for simultaneous feature engineering and model interpretation section 2 2 1 also three variations of recurrent neural networks rnn for modeling time series i e lstm gru and retain were employed and their model performances were compared with the performance of the retain d model section 2 2 2 the modeling procedure fig 2 included feature selection data preprocessing model training validation and testing hyperparameter tuning using bayesian optimization section 2 2 3 and performance evaluation section 2 2 4 2 2 1 the reverse time attention model with trainable decays retain d attention in neural networks is a mechanism that allows the model to selectively concentrate on relevant parts of sequential data the incorporation of an attention mechanism into the deep learning architecture addresses the long range dependency issue while also providing interpretations of a deep learning model by evaluating the relative importance of features based on attention weights building on this retain adopts the attention mechanisms at two levels i e time level and feature level to evaluate the relative importance of features at different time points also based on a reasonable assumption that recent measurements are worth more attention than old ones retain explores input features in a reverse time order improving computational stability in the process of attention generation choi et al 2017 we developed retain d by combining retain with a decay mechanism fig 3 to model missing values based on a decay mechanism and interpret model outcomes based on retain simultaneously in retain d complete daily sequential data were generated through the decay mechanism and were used to train retain making it possible to generate forecasts and evaluate the importance of time specific features on a daily scale the decay mechanism modeled the unmeasured values of an input feature by fitting the feature s decay rates that account for correlations with other features and missing patterns the decay rates were learned by assuming that the unmeasured value estimated close to the most recently measured value shifts toward the overall measured mean value as the missing period lasts long che et al 2018 this assumption accounts for the temporal autocorrelation the degree of correlations among measurements as a function of the time lag between them of time series data while also reflecting natural purification processes and resilience of ecosystems bowie et al 1985 chapra 2008 the detailed descriptions for calculating the decay rates are provided below a multivariate time series x with d features and t time steps is denoted by x x 1 x 2 x t r t d while the tth element of the dth feature in x is denoted by x t d for incomplete x with missing values missing patterns can be characterized by masking and time intervals a masking vector that distinguishes missing values m t d 0 from measured values m t d 1 is expressed as m m 1 m 2 m t 0 1 t d while time intervals defined as the time elapsed between the latest measurement and currently missing are expressed as δ δ 1 δ 2 δ t r t d a multivariate time series data z that corresponds to the output y of length n is denoted by z x n δ n m n n 1 n in the study unit time and the time step were set at 1 day and 7 days respectively thus rnn models employed in this study forecast yt 1 using week long data z for modeling unmeasured values of an input feature a decay mechanism characterized missing patterns i e masking and time interval to reflect diminishing effects of the latest measurement and shifts toward the overall measured mean over time che et al 2018 decay rates a parameter for the decay mechanism account for correlations among features while at the same time differ by features among which characteristics of missing patterns may be different a vector of decay rates γ is expressed as 1 γ t exp max 0 w γ δ t b γ during the model training fitted w γ and b γ parameters and δ t estimates based on the most recent measurement were combined to learn γ t eq 1 the exponentiated negative rectified linear unit relu was used to ensure the consistent decrease in γ t by the reasonable step within the range 0 1 further missing values were modeled by accounting for the most recently measured value x t d for t t and the arithmetic mean x d of all measured values for the dth feature as follows 2 x t d m t d x t d 1 m t d γ x t d x t d 1 γ x t d x d x d n 1 n t 1 t n m t n d x t n d i 1 n t 1 t n m t n d by applying eq 2 to the time series unmeasured values for all features and points in time were modeled to generate complete daily time series it is noted that missing patterns of input features influence each other s learned decay rates as can be seen in eq 1 consequently the lower the decay rates the closer the missing values are to the recently measured values and the higher the decay rates the closer the missing values are to the overall measured mean values further to generate attention weights at both time level and feature level a linear embedding of the input vector a complete daily sequence generated through the decay mechanism x t r d was performed as follows 3 v t w e m b x t where v t r v and w e m b r v d indicate the embeddings and embedding matrix respectively retain uses two rnns i e r n n α and r n n β to generate attention weights separately at time level α α 1 α 2 α t and feature level β β 1 β 2 β t these are calculated corresponding to the time embedding v v 1 v 2 v t and each coordinate of time embedding v 1 1 v 1 2 v 1 v v t 1 v t 2 v t v respectively fig 3 this process can be expressed as follows 4 g t g t 1 g 1 r n n α v t v t 1 v 1 e t w α t g t b α

time step t respectively also w α r p b α r w β r v q and b β r v are learned parameters hyperparameters p and q determine the hidden layer size of r n n α and r n n β respectively as in eqs 4 and 5 time embedding is fed to rnns in a reverse time order to generate attention vectors α and β because these vectors are allowed to respond sensitively to different time steps during the model training the reverse attention mechanism facilitates stable attention generation further the context vector c t at the time step t and the sum of c t over time steps c n are calculated based on weight vectors and embeddings as follows 6 c t α t β t v t 7 c n t 1 t c t by including c n in the fully connected layer fc at the end of retain corresponding predictions y n were made as follows 8 y n f c c n finally the contribution ω of input features at each time step to the prediction was modeled as follows 9 ω y n x t d f c c t d f c α t d β t d w e m b d x t d retain d was developed and implemented using pytorch paszke et al 2019 and sklearn pedregosa et al 2011 libraries in python 3 6 8 van rossum and drake 1995 2 2 2 rnn models for comparison three different rnns lstm gru and retain were employed in this study and their performances were compared with that of retain d lstm and gru are commonly used variations of rnns in contrast to the conventional rnn lstm consists of four gates input forget update and output gates among which necessary information for the long term is selectively transferred lstm has shown success in training long sequences by addressing the vanishing gradient problem greff et al 2017 gru while retaining the advantages of lstm further simplifies the structure into two gates reset and update gates therefore resulting in faster model training than lstm chung et al 2014 the details for retain are described in section 2 2 1 as lstm gru and retain do not involve the decay mechanism these baseline models were developed and implemented on a weekly resolution unit time 1 week therefore the values for input features were temporally matched with output values on a weekly basis because the harmful cyanobacteria alert system monitored semiweekly in response to cyanobacteria cell count exceeding the alert level of 10 000 cells ml until the cell count reduced 1000 cells ml for such days the weekly average was used as the output value after the matching missing values were imputed using a kalman filter welch and bishop 2006 the baseline models forecast one week ahead with the time step being set at 1 two hidden layers were included in lstm and gru to match the depth of retain lstm gru and retain were developed and implemented using the pytorch paszke et al 2019 and pykalman duckworth 2015 libraries in python 3 6 8 2 2 3 model implementation cyanobacteria cell counts were forecast on a daily scale using retain d whereas they were forecast on a weekly scale using the three baseline rnn models lstm gru and retain in addition cell counts of the dominant cyanobacterial taxa microcystis and aphanizomenon for site n and microcystis and anabaena for site y were forecast as input features upstream tp and tn loads tributary tp and tn loads a hydrological factor flow rate for site n and water residence time for site y daily precipitation irradiance and ambient temperature were included since ambient temperature showed high correlation with water temperature pearson s correlation coefficient 0 96 for site n and 0 97 for site y and was measured daily compared to weekly measured water temperature ambient temperature was selected as an input additional to these cladoceran abundance was included as an input for site y the dataset for site n was divided into training 70 jan 2016 jul 2019 validation 15 jul 2019 mar 2020 and test 15 apr 2020 dec 2020 periods table s1 the data for site y were similarly divided into training 75 jan 2013 dec 2018 validation 12 5 jan 2019 dec 2019 and test 12 5 jan 2020 dec 2020 periods but with slighly altered proportions due to its longer modeling period log transformation natural base was applied to the input features except for ambient temperature and irradiance based on the training data each input feature was scaled to range from 0 to 1 using min max normalization to avoid the effects of the differing scales among the features on parameter learning for retain d time step was set at 7 days reflecting the travel time from upstream and tributary sites to the study sites 1 95 and 0 43 days from the upstream and tributary sites to site n and 3 69 and 0 48 days from the upstream and tributary sites to site y based on median flow velocity and the hab monitoring frequency weekly in general the time step for the baseline rnn models was set at 1 week consistent with the time step for retain d hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model performance during the model training mean squared error mse was used as the loss function for backpropagation while the number of epochs was set at 2000 the tree structured parzen estimator tpe bergstra et al 2011 one of the popular bayesian optimization methods was used in this study for hyperparameter tuning the tpe sequentially reflects the results of previous trials in hyperparameter optimization and identifies candidate sets of hyperparameters that have the greatest expected improvement ei 10 e i y x y y y p x y p y p x d y where x is the set of hyperparameters y is the loss function value and y is the threshold for pre defined quantile γ 0 15 herein when p y y γ tpe defines p x y using two estimated densities from a set of hyperparameters that make loss function lower or greater than the threshold as follows 11 p x y l x i f y y g x i f y y based on this ei can be re expressed simply as follows 12 e i y x γ g x l x 1 γ 1 therefore the optimization process focuses on the trials with lower loss higher performance and converges to the optimal set of hyperparameters table 2 the search space for seven hyperparameters activation function hidden dimension batch size dropout rate in the embedding layer dropout rate in the fully connected layer learning rate and weight decay of retain d was explored using the tpe table 2 of the seven hyperparameters of retain d batch size and dropout embedding layer were excluded from lstm and gru while batch size was excluded from retain mse was used as the loss function for hyperparameter tuning on the validation set during both model training and hyperparameter tuning the mse was calculated using measured data only that is imputed data from the decay mechanism were excluded from the calculation of mse a set of hyperparameters that resulted in the minimum mse was applied to the retain d and baseline rnn models the tpe based hyperparameter tuning was implemented with 100 iterations using hyperopt bergstra et al 2015 library in python 3 6 8 van rossum and drake 1995 2 2 4 performance evaluation using the measured test set that is excluding the data that were imputed using the decay mechanism the performances of retain and other rnn models were evaluated based on four different metrics root mean squared error rmse coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae and symmetric mean absolute percentage error smape the formulae for these evaluation metrics are as follows 14 r m s e i 1 n y o b s y p r e d 2 n 15 r 2 1

cyanobacteria and hydrometeorological factors sites n and y located in the lower part of the nakdong and yeongsan rivers showed apparent seasonality in meteorological and hydrological factors during the study period as can be seen in the wide ranges of these factors in table 1 summer june to september was characterized by high ambient temperature median 23 8 c at site n and 23 8 c at site y high irradiance median 5 35 mj m2 at site n and 17 03 mj m2 at site y and large amounts of precipitation median 0 mean 7 01 mm at site n and median 0 mean 5 24 mm at site y for details of other seasons please see table 1 accordingly flow rates at site n were substantially larger in summer median 228 9 m3 s than in other seasons median 125 76 m3 s whereas water residence time during summer median 5 63 days was significantly shorter than that during other seasons median 9 91 days at site y sites n and y experienced severe habs during the study period with the maximum cyanobacteria cell counts exceeding a hundred thousand at both sites 134 670 cells ml at site n and 357 600 cells ml at site y the measured cyanobacteria abundance also showed distinct seasonality with cyanobacteria cell counts being substantially higher in summer months june to september median 8404 5 cells ml at site n and 481 5 cells ml at site y than in other seasons median 69 cells ml at site n and 0 cells ml at site y table 1 fig 4 although summer proliferation of habs was common to sites n and y the two sites showed differing temporal patterns in other seasons at site n cyanobacteria abundance exceeding the attention level cyanobacteria cell counts 1000 cells ml of the harmful cyanobacteria bloom alert system persisted from late spring may through early winter december with its duration substantially varying by year fig 4a whereas at site y this level of abundance occurred mainly in summer except for 2020 when cyanobacteria abundance was higher in fall october november than summer fig 4b moreover hab events exceeding the warning level 10 000 cells ml occurred 51 times in summer and 11 times in spring march may and fall at site n whereas such events occurred 26 times in summer only at site y for both sites n and y microcystis dominated the cyanobacteria community during summer reaching the maximums of 133 750 cells ml at site n and 357 600 cells ml at site y table 1 in contrast cyanobacteria community composition differed between the two sites in seasons other than summer at site n aphanizomenon tended to dominate among the cyanobacteria taxa with cell counts of aphanizomenon dominating in 73 4 of total samples monitored during non summer seasons with the maximum cell count of 26 610 cells ml whereas at site y the dominance of microcystis persisted 57 1 maximum 91 540 cells ml and that of anabaena 21 4 maximum 1275 cells ml increased during non summer seasons 3 2 modeling unmeasured values the incorporation of a decay mechanism in retain d generated a complete multivariate data set with an enhanced temporal resolution in contrast to existing modeling practices that involve manual feature engineering such as temporal aggregation by calculating monthly means matching values among temporal mismatches and interpolating missing values in this study unmeasured values of all input features and outputs were modeled using retain d to consistently exhibit a daily scale consequently the percentages of modeled values in the entire time series were largely determined by the monitoring frequency of the feature fig 5 therefore for both sites n and y major proportions 84 46 89 93 of values were modeled for environmental upstream and tributary nutrient loads and biological cell counts of cyanobacteria taxa factors that were monitored weekly with time variant frequency in contrast the percentages of modeled values accounted for insignificant proportions 0 0 49 of the time series for the daily monitored meteorological and hydrological factors for which only missing values were modeled 3 3 performance evaluation the model outputs were cyanobacteria cell counts and cell counts of dominant cyanobacteria taxa microcystis and aphanizomenon for

fig 6a and anabaena cell counts for site y fig 7e furthermore validation and testing results were generally in close agreement with measured values without signs of overfitting or underfitting figs 6a

successfully captured large temporal variations in weekly measured cell counts of cyanobacteria and dominant taxa figs 6d f and 7d f prolonged low and high abundance fig 7d f timing and magnitude of abundance peaks figs 6f and 7d f and rapid short drops in abundance figs 6f and 7d f were generally well reflected in the forecasts from retain d although there were occasional deviations from measurements in the timing and magnitude of the forecast peaks fig 6d e compared with the baseline rnn models retain d yielded the lowest mse the minimum validation loss across all model outputs and sites after 100 iterations of bayesian hyperparameter optimization using tpe fig s1 and table 2 among the baseline models retain yielded consistently lower mse than lstm and gru across all outputs and sites forecasting performances relative to the measured test set were compared among the retain d and baseline rnn models among the baseline models retain rmse 0 58 1 48 r2 0 73 0 95 mae 0 52 1 19

feature levels based on the entire data set including all measured training validation and test sets relative feature importance based on overall mean absolute feature level attention weights of each feature over all instances and times steps t 1 to 7 days indicated that ambient temperature was the most important feature in forecasting most outputs with one exception namely for cyanobacteria cell counts at site n where the cyanobacteria abundance during the past week appeared to be considerably more important than other input features fig 8 at site y a hydrological factor residence time was consistently the second most important feature for all outputs whereas the relative importance of the hydrological factor flow rates for site n varied depending on the output in general irradiance showed relatively high second to fifth highest importance across model outputs and sites we evaluated seasonal differences in the contributions of hydrometeorological factors that were monitored daily and showed generally high importance to forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts fig 9 for site n the mean contributions of increasing temperature to the forecast cyanobacteria cell counts tended to increase over all time steps regardless of seasons with pronounced increases in summer whereas for site y these contributions either increased or remained low across seasons fig 9a d the mean contributions of irradiance and flow rates for site n or residence time for site y to the forecast cyanobacteria cell counts over all time steps revealed apparent seasonality for both sites n and y increases in irradiance were associated with significant increases in the mean contributions in summer slope 0 005 p 0 05 for site n slope 0 013 p 0 05 for site y in other seasons increases in irradiance were associated with decreases in the mean contributions for site n slope 0 0004 p 0 05 and smaller increases in the mean contributions for site y slope 0 004 p 0 05 fig 9b e also for site n the mean contributions of flow rates decreased as flow rates increased and this was more apparent in summer slope 0 001 p 0 05 than in other seasons slope 0 000 p 0 899 for site y the mean contributions of residence time increased with increasing residence time and this was more apparent in summer slope 0 030 p 0 05 than in other seasons slope 0 001 p 0 05 furthermore time variant contributions of hydrometeorological features to forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts are illustrated in fig 10 across all time steps the mean contributions of all these hydrometeorological features to forecast cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml exceeding the warning level were positive and higher than those to forecast cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml for site n temporal changes in the contribution of each feature were generally marginal except for a slight increase in the contribution of irradiance with a shift from time step 4 to 3 at cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml fig 10b for site y variations of feature contributions at different time steps were larger compared to site n for forecasts of cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml with the time steps 2 4 making greater contributions than other time steps fig 10d f 4 discussion 4 1 effects of automated feature engineering habs can form and develop rapidly in response to interactions among numerous drivers with cyanobacteria abundance increasing by several orders of magnitude within days havens 2008 therefore reliable short term forecasts of habs at locations of concern e g stagnant water or high importance e g upstream of water supply intakes can be useful to assist decision making and formulating advice about how to prevent or mitigate habs associated risks and costs rousso et al 2020 however the temporal resolution of multivariate data sets used for forecasting habs often weekly to monthly scales is usually unsuitable to ensure the efficacy of developed models and can differ among input features despite the success that rnn based dls showed across various domains low temporal frequency of data and temporal discrepancies among features may hamper the improvements that can potentially be achieved by these approaches our forecasting results showed that retain d addressed these hurdles successfully generating complete time series with increasing data volume and temporal resolution generally the greater accuracy of forecasts using retain d compared to those using retain with a sole exception of forecast microcystis cell counts for site n table 3 suggested that the decay mechanism generated multivariate synthetic time series data that well reflected reality and the resultant increase in data volume led to improved parameter learning in fact retain d tended to capture the magnitude of peak and low cyanobacteria abundance accurately figs 6 and 7 whereas retain underestimated the overall degree of variability in cyanobacteria abundance figs s2 and s3 however due to the different temporal resolutions and time steps of the retain d and baseline rnn models comparisons of performance among them should not be considered in parallel also because model outputs cyanobacteria and microcystis cell counts for site n included occasional semiweekly data during the testing period see section 2 2 2 for weekly baseline models including retain those semiweekly output data were averaged over a week and used as output values this manual feature engineering likely decreased the degree of variation in measured and forecast outputs from the baseline models slightly affecting the magnitude of deviations and evaluation metrics in several studies synthetic data were generated using the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc for the purpose of data augmentation before forecasting habs using anns or rnn based models park et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 despite advantages such as performance improvements and provision of spatial representation from using a hybrid of process based and data driven models developing a separate process based model requires additional effort moreover implementation of the resultant hybrid models requires additional work such as manual feature engineering and rescaling of temporal resolution and is based on multiple processes in contrast retain d was implemented in a single step process 4 2 effects of using a reverse attention mechanism retain d and retain outperformed lstm and gru across all model outputs and sites table 3 suggesting that the use of a reverse attention mechanism was effective in improving forecasting performance compared to retain d and retain lstm and gru frequently failed to capture the timing and magnitude of sudden changes in cyanobacteria abundance at both sites figs 6 7 and s2 s3 most apparently lstm and gru substantially overestimated cyanobacteria abundance during the lasting non bloom seasons for site y fig s3 the relatively low performances of lstm and gru shown in this study appear inconsistent with many studies that presented superior performance of rnn based models in predicting chlorophyll a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms cho and park 2019 lee and lee 2018 and other water quality parameters jiang et al 2021 kim et al 2021 these published results confirm that the recurrent architectures which allow rnn based models to retain and use past information to forecast future outcomes are advantageous for modeling sequence data however our results suggest that these rnn based models have limited capability in forecasting temporal dynamics of cyanobacteria cell counts that typically include many zeros and have several orders of magnitude larger variance than other water quality parameters our results suggest that despite the difficulty in modeling cyanobacteria abundance feature level and time level attentions enabled the models retain and particularly retain d to accurately forecast consecutive zeros and closely reflect extremely large variances of measured cell counts of cyanobacteria and dominant taxa figs 6 7 and s2 s3 the use of time level attentions allowed retain d to concentrate on important time steps for parameter learning in contrast to the rnn based models that considered all steps of the input sequence equivalently bahdanau et al 2014 choi et al 2017 also feature level attentions in retain d allowed for a weighted focus on important features among inputs choi et al 2017 some recently developed models dual stage attention lstm da lstm e g qin et al 2017 include feature level and time level attention mechanisms similar to those in retain d these models also reported positive effects of using dual attentions in performance improvements however whereas feature and time level attentions in da lstm have serial architecture those in retain d have parallel architecture where feature and time level attention weights are retained separately thus yielding more explicit interpretations at the feature and time levels furthermore training the model in reverse time order facilitates stabilized attention generation and efficient parameter learning choi et al 2017 the temporal distributions of the contributions of input features especially daily monitored important features such as ambient temperature irradiance residence time and flow rates to individual forecasts illustrated that high contributions were clearly distinguished from low contributions in general agreement with model outputs indicating the efficacy of using reverse attentions for capturing the temporal dynamics of habs figs s4 s5 noticeably based on generated attentions retain d successfully modeled cell counts of different cyanobacteria taxa despite markedly differing temporal characteristics among them e g longer proliferation durations for aphanizomenon fig s4c than microcystis fig s4b and substantially higher peak magnitudes for microcystis fig s5b than anabaena fig s5c 4 3 validity and limitations of interpretations in the forecasts of habs using retain d the overall mean contributions of each input feature over all measured instances and time steps provided a basis for evaluating the relative importance among input features our forecasts generally indicated the foremost importance of ambient temperature in determining the magnitude of habs fig 8 consistent with numerous published reports of strong positive associations between temperature and habs cha et al 2017 elliott 2012 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 the only exception was that in forecasting cyanobacteria cell counts for site n the magnitude of cyanobacteria cell counts in the past seven days was substantially more informative than other input features including temperature fig 8a this result may have arisen in part from the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria abundance in site n where dominance of microcystis in summer and that of aphanizomenon in late spring and fall through early winter account for increases in cell counts of cyanobacteria over different seasons fig 4a these temporal patterns contrast with those for site y for which the duration of high abundance is usually shorter and more pronounced fig 4 therefore for site n a high cyanobacteria abundance persisting over a wide range of ambient temperatures may decrease the relative importance of temperature while increasing that of past cyanobacteria abundance in forecasting cyanobacteria cell counts furthermore the high importance of past cyanobacteria abundance may also reflect the movement of hab biomass from the upstream area of high concern in the nakdong river ahn et al 2021 the relative importance of a hydrological factor flow rates for site n and residence time for site y differed between the sites for site n flow rate was less important than was residence time for site y and its relative importance varied among different model outputs fig 8a c whereas for site y residence time was consistently the second most important feature across model outputs fig 8d f these differences can be explained by different hydrological conditions between the sites site n is located 12 km distant from the downstream changnyeong haman weir with an overall mean flow velocity of 0 11 m s one standard deviation 0 20 m s in contrast site y is located proximate to 500 m upstream of the juksan weir with overall slower flow velocity mean 0 05 m s one standard deviation 0 11 m s in addition highly dynamic changes in outflow due to weir gate operations may have increased the importance of the hydrological factor in determining the magnitude of habs at site y changes in magnitude and direction of contributions mean values over all instances and time steps of 1 to 7 days of meteorological and hydrological factors i e ambient temperature irradiance and flow rates or residence time generally agreed well with seasonal patterns of cyanobacteria cell counts fig 9 in addition these contributions indicated the interactions among these features demonstrating that during summer concurrent increases in temperature and irradiance and decreases in flow rates and increases in residence time in the past week likely increased cyanobacteria cell counts at both sites figs 9 s4 and s5 furthermore temporal variations in contributions mean values over all instances at each time step of these hydrometeorological features among different time steps showed differing patterns between the two sites fig 10 at site n the differences in contributions of hydrometeorological features among different time steps were marginal fig 10a c while these differences were more pronounced at site y especially for forecast high cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cell ml fig 10d f generally long durations longer than several months of habs at site n may lead to similar contributions among different time steps within a span of seven days whereas greater temporally varying contributions for site y were attributable to relatively shorter durations of habs at this site moreover across the hydrometeorological features contributions to forecasts for site y at time steps 2 4 were larger than those at the proximate time step time step of 1 day fig 10d f these lagged responses likely indicated the accumulated effects of input features on habs at site y where flow velocities were was generally slow in addition to their overall temporal trends the contributions of input features to individual forecasts showed large variations for example contributions of hydrometeorological features to forecasts that captured the initial timing of cyanobacteria cell counts 10 000 cells ml were consistently positive with large variations over time steps fig s6 the effects of nutrient loads davis et al 2009 mcdonald and lehman 2013 paerl et al 2016 and biological factors gliwicz 1990 smayda 2008 on habs have been widely studied in this study upstream and tributary nutrient loads tp and tn and cladoceran abundance showed varying degrees of importance in forecasting habs fig 8 however interpretations of their feature importance especially temporal variations in their contributions were limited by the large proportions of modeled values 84 46 for all these features relative to the entire time series to address the limited interpretability increases in monitoring frequency for nutrient concentrations and biological factors are required particularly in tributaries prone to data scarcity but changing the monitoring schemes at a large spatial scale is accompanied by substantial increases in costs alternatively developing variations of decay mechanisms and multiple interpretable methods to complement the lack of measured data and comparing them in future studies can enhance the reliability of modeled values and interpretations 5 conclusions retain d was developed to forecast habs daily at the downstream sites in the nakdong and yeongsan rivers south korea in this study retain d generated complete time series data without manual feature engineering processes such as temporal aggregation matching and interpolation while increasing the temporal resolution of forecasts from weekly to daily retain d yielded high forecasting accuracy across all model outputs and sites and substantially outperformed other rnn based models i e lstm gru and retain retain d represented the temporal patterns of habs well with timely forecasts of abundance peaks and sustained low and high cyanobacteria abundance therefore forecasting results using retain d provide a useful quantitative basis for decision making for managing water quality and resources furthermore considering that temporal changes in cyanobacteria abundance can occur rapidly further increases in the temporal resolution of forecasts hourly basis could potentially increase the usefulness of such hab forecasting models in contrast absence of input features monitored at high frequency can restrict the forecasting models from achieving improved temporal resolution despite the use of retain d temperature was of prime importance in determining the magnitude of cyanobacteria abundance according to the interpretations of the retain d forecasts at time and feature levels furthermore the contributions of input features to individual forecasts displayed seasonality during summer increases in ambient temperature and irradiance concurrent with decreases in flow rates or increases in residence time led to pronounced increases in abundance of cyanobacteria in future efforts extending the time steps for example to account for a monthly scale may improve the delineation of such temporal variations in feature importance although the interpretability of attention based dls is generally not fully understood among researchers in this study the interpretations derived from retain d generally had high environmental relevance leading us to advocate the use of attention generation to improve interpretability declaration of

2019 with respect to activated sludge or membrane technologies clarification systems are still required upstream of such units yet benefit from simpler construction lower energy operation and

disparity in the literature with respect to conceptual clarification models illustrates the critical need to interrogate the predictive capability of such models over a range of clarification system scales subject to complex conditions and loadings in particular the impacts and consequences resulted from the presumptions required of analytical models in practical engineering design and regulatory guidance require interrogation and elucidated without a clear illustration of the applicability and elucidation of generality clarification system design and regulation can be potentially mis represented by methods that are not as robust and economic li and sansalone 2022 li et al 2021c this study interrogates common analytical models representing clarification by common uo systems for their predictive capability and generalizability with attention to applications of pm and pm partitioned constituents clarification in the urban water cycle the hypothesis of this study are that 1 the conceptualized system geometry and idealized hydrodynamics embedded in the common analytical models limit their predictive capability and generalizability and can significantly impact the economics of

parameters and generalize system dynamics by casting the governing equation in a nondimensional form the nondimensional incompressible navier stokes equations with the coupling of a pm transport

finite reynolds number drag correction model balachandar and eaton 2010 schiller and naumann 1935 the nondimensional pm concentration c is scaled by the pm concentration scale c the selection of the characteristic scales such as velocity length pm concentration in dynamic similarity is also not unique and is a matter of choice herein following conventions in clarification modeling fischerström 1958 hazen 1904 li and sansalone 2020c the surface loading rate slr q a is selected as the velocity scale u where q is the hydraulic loading rate and a is the system surface area slr is different from sor and their correlation are shown in the section of databases examined for prismatic cylindrical system the bottom diameter is selected as the length scales for quasi rectangular system the bottom length is selected as the length scale by choosing the influent pm concentration c i as the pm concentration scale i e c c i the nondimensional effluent pm concentration is therefore defined as c e c e c c e c i the pm fluid system is further considered with a heterodisperse particle size distribution psd the discrete pm diameter ranges that constitute a psd are denoted by the particle index of j using this notation the pm separation δ j for the j particle of a psd can be defined by the nondimensional effluent pm concentration c j e of the j particle as shown in eq 5 5 δ j c j i c j e c j i 1 c j e the dimensional analysis indicates the pm separation of a dilute i e without significant pm induced stratification and coagulation flocculation heterodisperse fluid pm clarification system is a

systems are perfectly proportional fulfilling the geometric similarity and also that each dimensionless group i e r e s c w of the two systems are equal then the pm separation of these two clarification systems are also equivalent barenblatt 2014 6 δ j f r e s c w eqs 1 3 provide an accurate representation of dilute heterodisperse pm fluid systems and are commonly used in fluid mechanics applications li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2021 liu et al 2020 salinas et al 2020 hereafter an objective is to examine and propose further simplification of eq 6 based on observed physical behavior of clarification systems most clarification systems function and operate in the turbulent regime with the flow reynolds number in the range of approximately 1 000 to 100 000 li et al 2021c lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 in a multiphase turbulent flow system the transport and separation of pm in the bulk regions away from walls are primarily dominated by the reynolds turbulent fluxes and gravity for pm in the settleable granulometric range and larger silt and sand size pope 2000 therefore the contribution of brownian diffusion impacting only the smaller pm granulometric range of suspended pm such as the clay size fraction provides only a nominal impact to the bulk pm transport and hence the schmidt number is of lesser importance cantero et al 2009 li et al 2021a salinas et al 2019 furthermore the reynolds number impacts the solution of the pm transport equation eq 3 explicitly through the brownian diffusion term 2 c resc although of lesser importance compared to turbulent fluxes and implicitly through the advection term u c this dependence of u on reynolds number is governed by eqs 1 2 studies of turbulent jet flows and channel flows moser et al 1999 schultz and flack 2013 stamou et al 1989 xu et al 2013 reveal the mean flow and reynolds shear stress can show weak to almost no dependence on the reynolds number which is known as reynolds number invariance heller 2017 therefore we hypothesize that the pm separation of a clarification system has a lesser dependence on the flow reynolds and schmidt numbers as compared to the nondimensional pm settling velocity hence pm separation of a clarification uo can be potentially approximated as a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity as shown in eq 7 producing a more representative result than common analytical models this hypothesis is examined in the results section 7 δ j f w 2 2 physics informed data driven modeling of pm separation while the dimensional analysis provides physical insight for the pm separation dynamics eq 7 the dimensional analysis does not infer the exact form of the pm separation function f w studies of dickenson and sansalone 2009 howard et al 2012 li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2020d stamou et al 1989 have shown that the pm separation function f w generally follows a s shape curve that monotonically increases as w increase therefore this pm separation function f w is represented by a modified gamma cumulative distribution function as shown in eq 8 and this model is referred to as the similarity modified gamma model smg the choice of this modified gamma cumulative distribution function is because i the function monotonically increases to unity which is consistent with the observed physical behavior of the pm separation function and ii the function

databases examined table 1 summarizes the analytical models of sor pfr and cstr commonly applied for pm separation the detailed derivations of these models are available in the cited literature and also in the online supplemental materials these analytical models are interrogated in the following five 5 cases of common but distinct clarification systems with differing geometries across a range of scales as summarized in table 2 details drawings and further method based physical test information are provided in the online supplemental materials 2 3 1 case 1 st anthony falls laboratory safl plain cylinder tanks ct the physical modeling of pm separation in cylindrical tanks ct a geometry commonly implemented for hydrodynamic separators hs and also tested by st anthony falls laboratory safl at the university of minnesota usa is examined with the hypothesis posited from the dimensional analysis eq 7 as well as to train the smg model eq 8 representing eq 7 fig s1 in online

3 2 case 2 cetv njcat hydrodynamics separators hs the predictive capabilities of the analytical models are also interrogated for 22 commercially available hydrodynamic separator hs systems new jersey department of environmental protection 2013 toronto and region conservation authority 2013 similar to the safl ct hs systems are also designed to clarify pm from the flow stream compared to the safl ct these proprietary hs systems are designed with more complex and varied geometries as illustrated in fig s2 and table s2 online supplemental materials a relatively coarse heterodisperse pm d 10 5 μ m d 50 75 μ m d 90 250 μ m with a specific gravity of 2 65 is used to create the influent feed the psd of this heterodisperse pm is shown in fig 1 and is referred to as the njcat psd hereafter a constant pm loading of 200 20 mg l is applied in the physical modeling of a hs system the total pm separation δ t o t a l is either determined based on the captured pm or indirectly determined based on the eluted pm the system total pm separation defined with eluted pm is shown in eq 10 for a heterodisperse pm the total pm separation δ t o t a l is an integral of the product between the psd mass fraction m j and the pm separation for all pm diameter ranges that constitute the entire psd δ j as shown in eq 11 for a given psd m j the total pm separation δ t o t a l is a function of the velocity scale u the particle index j and pm settling velocity w s are interchangeable because of their direct and unique correspondence in addition for a monodisperse psd the pm separation δ j and the total pm separation δ t o t a l across the psd are equivalent as is the case of safl ct 10 δ t o t a l c i c e c i 1 c e 11 δ t o t a l u m j w s δ j w w s u d w s in this equation m j is the mass fraction

is based on the rectangular clarifiers rc at the karlsruhe institute of technology kit lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 as shown in fig s3 online supplemental material the three 3 kit rc units share the same bulk system dimensions and only differ in the inlet deflector baffle configurations that are within the clarifier specifically there are deflectors configured downstream of the inlet in the two sided deflector clarifier and one sided clarifier in the no deflector clarifier the deflector is not configured and the free surface elevation h 17 cm is nominally lower than the clarifier with deflectors h 17 3 cm in comparison with the two previous cases of safl ct and the cetv njcat hs unit database in which the system length depth ratios are approximately 1 0 the kit rc system has a larger length depth ratio of 14 the physical modeling of the kit rc lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 focused on the system hydrodynamics and the pm separation results were not available therefore the high fidelity les simulations of the pm separation were carried out to extend the original studies li et al 2021a 2021b li and sansalone 2021 similar to the previous two cases of safl ct and the cetv njcat hs unit database constant hydraulic loading and pm loading are implemented in the simulation of pm separation in the kit rc case the average inlet velocity is 1 61 cm s three monodisperse pm diameters of 112 158 and 224 μ m with a specific gravity of 1 1 for typical organic particles in a wastewater clarifier are simulated 2 3 4 case 4 apf urban drainage clarification basin the fourth case represents a larger scale system this case is a stormwater clarification basin at the naples municipal airport airport code apf florida usa li et al 2021c located near the southwest gulf coast of florida the system bathymetry and geometric configuration are illustrated in fig s4 online supplemental materials the basin has a length of 260 m from north to south and a lateral dimension varying from 40 to 86 m the mean water depth is 3 m the basin depth averaged surface area is 12 600 m 2 crushed recycled concrete crc that was carbonated served as media 75 to 100 mm size range in twelve 12 linear and permeable baffles configured as an internal retrofit within the basin to improve the system hydraulic training and clarification in comparison with the previous cases this system has a significantly larger length depth ratio of 86 7 in addition this system is also subject to the highly unsteady hydraulic pm and constituent loadings from off site generated by uncontrolled rainfall runoff processed from a combination of airside and landside urban commercial area catchment interfaces in this interrogation of the analytical models event mean flowrate and observed influent psd apf psd in fig 1 are used to calculate the total pm separation two pm densities of 1000 organic pm and 2650 inorganic siliceous pm kg m3 are considered a water density of 995 7kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 0 8 10 6 m2 s at a water temperature of 30 c is used in addition as shown in eq 12 an empirical model harper and baker 2003 based on residence time rt is also interrogated for this case this empirical correlation was developed from a regression based on a florida basin database 13 data points in total residence time notwithstanding this empirical correlation in part constituent the basis of current stormwater basin design guidance and presumptive basin performance by state of florida regulators and is therefore pertinent for this case along with the models identified in table 1

hs in the fifth case the analytical models are interrogated for a physical model of a hs system for pm separation based on pm elution at a constant pm influent concentration subject to unsteady flow loading in the stormwater unit operations laboratory suol at university of florida given the unsteady loading a dynamic variant of the cstr model is considered this dynamic cstr model is commonly used in process based simulations such as swmm and integrated urban water system analysis huber et al 2006 krajewski et al 2017 wilson and barfield 1984 in the dynamic cstr model the momentum transport is not considered and the pm transport equation is shown in eq 13 13 d v c j d t q i c j i q e c j e a w s c j e in this equation v is the system volume q i and q e are the inlet and outlet flowrate because the hs provide minimal volumetric storage the routing process is not considered i e q i q e d v d t 0 the term a w s represents the clarification removal rate m3 s note that subject to a simplified case steady state hydraulic conditions d d t 0 eq 13 simplifies to the cstr formulation for the steady state pm separation table 1 in the physical modeling of the steady state pm separation under constant loadings the njcat psd fig 1 is used to create the constant influent pm of 100 mg l effluent psd data were generated with a malvern 2000 laser diffraction malvern instruments ltd 2012 further testing details are identical to the previous case of cetv njcat hs units database as previously referenced the schematic representation of the hs system and the physical modeling of the pm elution subject to unsteady loadings are illustrated in fig s5 online supplemental materials controlled laboratory tests of the hs are also conducted for the total six 6 combinations of three 3 hydrographs fig s5a and two 2 different heterodisperse psds finer psd and njcat psd in fig 1 in the interrogation of the dynamic cstr model the heterodispersivity of the psd is considered by solving multiple transport equations for different pm diameter ranges simultaneously eighty 80 pm diameter ranges are examined from laser diffraction data and are simulated for each psd as shown in figs s6 and s7 eq 13 is implicitly solved by the crank nicolson scheme in matlab a time step of 10 s is determined based on the numerical convergence study as shown in figs s7b and s7d 3 results 3 1 case 1 st anthony falls laboratory safl plain cylinder tanks ct figures 2 and 3 are introduced to interrogate the analytical model results with respect to the physical modeling pm separation of the two safl ct systems 4x4 and 6x6 as defined in table 3 the comparison of results in dimensional space are plotted as the inset diagram fig 2a and also shown in nondimensional space as the larger plot fig 2b the predictions of the analytical models sor cstr and pfr as compared to eq 7 as represented by the smg model eq 8 α 1 162 β 2 506 λ 11 61 are also plotted the water density of 1000kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 3 10 6 m2 s at a temperature of 10 c are used to calculate the pm settling velocity as shown in fig 2 a the pm separation results are widely distributed over the dimensional domain for the same particle diameter the different pm separation values are a result of the system dimensions surface area and also the test flowrate on pm separation which are not accounted for in dimensional space pm separation results in a dimensional space also do not clearly indicate based on inspection or infer a definitive correlation for pm separation in contrast plotting pm separation results in the nondimensional space illustrates the dominant influence of the nondimensional pm settling velocity w as hypothesized from eq 7 pm separation results from various combinations of pm diameters flowrates and system geometries collapse into a single asymptotic function this is indicated by inspection of fig 2 b and also fig 3 d the coefficient of determination r t 2 is 0 98 for the smg model representing eq 7 on the training dataset of the 4x4 system the trained smg model also predicts the pm separation of the 6x6 system with the coefficient of determination r v 2 of 0 95 these results support the hypothesis eq 7 in the dimensional analysis of section 2 1 that pm separation is hypothesized to be predominately a function of the nondimensional pm settling velocity eq 7 in comparison to the validated smg model the analytical models sor pfr cstr do not produce representative predictions of pm separation the significant differences for pm separation between the analytical models and the physical model data as well as the validated smg model are illustrated in fig 2 b these analytical models yield lower pm separation as function of nondimensional pm settling velocity w by 38 for sor 48 for pfr and 55 for cstr models at w 0 5 these results support the hypothesis that the common models sor pfr cstr are not robust for predicting pm separation the dynamic similitude and the compression or synthesis ability of the smg model representing eq 7 is further illustrated in fig 3 figs 3 a and 3 b show the physical modeling results of safl ct markers and the smg model plotted as a 3d surface in the 3d space defined by the pm settling velocity w s characteristic velocity scale u and pm separation δ j from figs 3 a and 3 b the contour lines of the smg model 3d surface are projected onto the 2d plane of characteristic velocity scale and pm terminal velocity which is further highlighted in fig 3 c as shown in fig 3 a and 3 b the smg model captures the dependence of pm separation on the pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale pm separation increases as the pm settling velocity increases larger diameter pm and or higher pm specific gravity and or as the characteristic velocity scale decreases increasing clarifier surface area and or decreasing hydraulic loading rate this combined influence of the pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale on pm separation yields a non linear 3d surface this non linearity of the pm separation has critical implications for clarification system design and modeling which are elaborated in the discussion section fig 3 c shows the projection of this 3d surface contour line in the 2d w s u plane is a line this is a result of the contour line gradient in the w s u plane which is w s u which is the nondimensional pm velocity w of eq 7 therefore each contour line represents a family of pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale combinations that yields the same w and thereby the same pm separation as illustrated by eq 7 and fig 2 b the comparison between fig 3 and 2 demonstrates the ability of a nondimensional approach to unify compress and provide synthesis of results under dynamic similitude a complex non linear 3d surface in dimensional space fig 3a can be compressed into a single 2d non linear curve in a nondimensional space fig 2 3 2 case 2 cetv njcat hydrodynamic separators hs the publicly reported and agency certified total pm separation of cetv njcat hs systems are summarized in fig 4 in addition to plotting the analytical models sor pfr cstr interrogated in this study the smg model representation of eq 7 previously interrogated with the safl ct database is also plotted and labeled as the safl ct this case is different from the previous safl ct case where the pm separation is based on discrete pm diameters in the medium sand size range in this case the interrogation of the analytical models and safl ct smg model is for total pm separation δ t o t a l based on physical modeling data this requires an additional integration of pm separation with each particle diameter range mass fraction across the entire psd as shown in eq 11 the results plotted in fig 4 are for the coarser heterodisperse psd njcat psd in fig 1 figure 4 illustrates difference between the analytical models and physical modeling results across this entire database the analytical models generally do not yield accurate prediction of the total pm separation for the hs systems however given the wide variability of the hs system results the analytical model can coincidentally agree with some hs system results any agreement between analytical models and physical results depend on the hs system and the characteristic velocity scale pfr and cstr models predict lower total pm separation for all systems across the characteristic velocity scales examined differences between sor and physical results range from 10 to 20 at higher characteristic velocity scales u 100 l min m2 at lower characteristic velocity scales u 100 l min m2 the sor model provides improved representation of the physical results with differences less than 10 the improved sor representation in the lower characteristic velocity scale range directly results from two critical constraints 1 adoption of total pm as the assessment metric for pm separation and 2 imposition of a heterodisperse relatively coarse and inorganic specific gravity of 2 65 psd as the required loading metric at a lower characteristic velocity scale the combination of these factors yield total pm separation results that are less sensitive to the embedded model assumptions and the resulting discrepancies generated by each analytical models li and sansalone 2020c at a lower characteristic velocity scale the mass proportion of completely separated pm 100 pm separation primarily sediment size pm 75 μ m in a psd increases with total pm as the assessment metric model discrepancies can only translate through the mass fractions of pm diameter ranges that are not completely separated smaller particles primarily suspended pm 25 μ m as a result the apparent difference in the total pm separation between the physical model results and the analytical models decreases in the limiting case when the characteristic velocity scale is sufficiently low there is an insignificant difference more precisely the apparent model error between the physical model and the analytical models since all the particles that constitute the psd approach 100 separation indeed due to this reduction in sensitivity based on the requirement of the total pm separation as a comparison metric the differences between pfr cstr and sor models are masked these differences are less than 10 at a lower characteristic velocity u 100 l min m2 furthermore results indicate that with this specified psd metric total pm separation in contrast to pm separation on a discrete particle diameter basis of different hs systems physical modeling results are not distinguishable at the lower characteristic velocity u 100 l min m2 the safl ct smg model also does not reproduce the total pm separation of the cetv njcat hs systems the basis for the discrepancy of the safl ct smg model is the dimensional analysis as identified previously the safl ct smg model can only be applied to systems that are geometrically similar to the original training system i e the 4x4 system of safl ct the hs systems are not geometrically similar to the safl ct systems as illustrated by figs s1 and s2 a comparison of the safl ct smg model and physical model results of hs systems suggests that in aggregate most hs systems do not provide improved pm separation as compared to the plain tank such as the safl cl systems fig s1 plain cylinder tanks while a number of hs systems can yield better or equivalent performance compared to the safl cl plain tank systems many hs systems show 10 20 lower total pm separation than the safl cl systems even though sophisticated geometries of hs systems have been promoted by the different manufacturers 3 3 case 3 karlsruhe institute of technology kit rectangular clarifiers rc figure 5 compares analytical models and safl ct smg model with high fidelity les simulation results pm separation from the rans based cfd models of komega06 wilcox 2006 komegasst menter et al 2003 and wa18 han et al 2018 as performed in li and sansalone 2020d are also plotted as shown in fig 5 different rans based cfd models while showing variability in their prediction capability generally agree well with les results and produce differences less than 10 in contrast analytical model results differ from les results by as large as 25 with respect to different clarifier configurations analytical models predict the same results irrespective of configuration given that analytical models lack dependence on the system geometrics pm separation is only a function of w for the analytical models by comparison the les and rans based cfd model indicate that the two sided deflector configuration improves the pm separation by as much as 10 compared to the one sided deflector and no deflector configuration in contrast to the safl ct case in this case the pfr model yields better agreement with les compared to sor and cstr the better agreement by the pfr model is consistent with stamou et al 1989 for a primary clarifier in sarnia ontario canada subject to quasi steady flows comparison of fig 2 and 5 indicate that there is no consistent trend produced by the analytical models predicting lower or higher pm separation depending on the specific geometry of the clarifier system these analytical models lack consistency and can produce lower or higher predictions figure 5 implies that conventional clarification systems depending on geometry can be less effective than safl ct or njcat cetv hs systems based on nondimensional pm settling velocity as hypothesized in eq 7 or slr for a psd this implication is similar to heinking and wilcoxon 1985 where for a given unit surface area hs systems can accommodate higher flowrates than conventional clarifiers based on the same pm separation level 3 4 case 4 apf stormwater clarification basin figure 6 compares event based total pm separation from physical monitoring of uncontrolled basin loadings and the model predictions the agreement between physical monitoring and model predictions varies by storm events the differences are nominally within 30 except for the 24 july 2015 event where the difference ranges from 40 to 60 in addition the pm density yields a minimal influence on model results an increase in pm density from 1000 kg m3 denser than fluid density of 995 7kg m 3 to 2650 kg m3 increased the pm settling velocity by 384 times based on the stokes drag law for a given pm diameter however total pm separation increased by 5 to 9 in the analytical models this substantially reduced influence of the pm settling velocity w s to the total pm separation suggests the clarification system operates at the limit of the low characteristic velocity scale median of 0 46 and range from 0 25 to 87 l min m2 hence this clarification system is significantly oversized on a hydraulic basis additionally the influent psd is relatively coarse and heterodisperse with respect to the characteristic velocity scale of the uncontrolled events recognizing that the high flow hydraulic stress in such events is a small proportion of the hydrograph these results also illustrate a lack of sensitivity when applying total pm separation as the common comparison metric on a mass basis at lower hydraulic loading as illustrated with fig 4 of case 2 at the lower hydraulic loadings and relatively coarse heterodisperse psds the analytical models interrogated herein yield comparable results that show less than 10 difference meanwhile the tested empirical model em yields comparable results for the total pm separation as the common models although the empirical model of harper and baker 2003 further lacks the dependence on the pm density and psd the comparable results of these models can be explained through eq 7 accounting for the interaction of the inflow heterodisperse psd and slr for the system and not the representativeness of these common models 3 5 case 5 suol hydrodynamics separator hs figure 7 summarizes the pm separation δ j results of physical modeling komegasst cfd model and analytical models for a commercial hs unit 4 6m 3 based on controlled physical model testing with the njcat coarser heterodisperse psd of fig 1 the results of the komegasst cfd model reproduces the physical modeling results for the entire psd range indicated by w with the difference nominally less than 10 by comparison analytical models produce large deviation with respect to physical model results irrespective of flow rate 4 53 l s and 13 6 l s represent 25 and 75 of designed peak hydraulic capacity for this hs unit the cstr model of pm separation is consistently 50 to 60 lower than the physical model results these prediction results are consistent with the observed behavior of the cstr model in the previous cetv njcat case summarized in fig 4 of case 2 figure 8 illustrates a series of plots of eluted pm concentration as suspended sediment concentration ssc from the physical model response to three hydrographs of differing unsteadiness and peak flow that ranged from 4 53 to 18 0 l s and the corresponding predictions of the dynamic cstr model eq 13 also plotted is a trained dynamic cstr model in the trained cstr model the clarification removal rate term a w s in eq 13 is modified by an additional parameter as κ a w s and this parameter κ 2 0 is calibrated with the results of the finer psd as shown in figs 8 a 8 c the motivation and limitations of calibration in the cstr model are elaborated in the later discussion section in comparison to the dynamic cstr the calibrated cstr produces improved model predictions for the results of the coarser psd validation cases with the coefficient of determination ranging from 0 83 to 0 99 as shown in figs 8 d 8 f the dynamic cstr model predicts the general trends of the pm elution profile however the dynamic cstr tends to overpredict the ssc on the elution recession limb the differences between the cstr and physical model range from 20 to 30 an exceptional high deviation of 70 is observed at 120 minutes maximum duration of the physical modeling for storm 3 with the finer psd loading psd is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 8 c the overprediction of the dynamic cstr model for eluted ssc is consistent with the pm separation results under steady state loadings as shown in fig 7 however the overprediction by the dynamic cstr model is significantly less pronounced in this unsteady loading case as compared to the steady state loading case fig 7 note that the cstr model fig 7 is the exact solution of the dynamic cstr model under steady state condition therefore this reduction in the apparent modeling error in the dynamic cstr case results from the combined influence of the unsteady loading and adopting of the total pm as the comparison metric the unsteady loading alters the characteristic velocity scale and hence the accuracy of the analytical model as illustrated in figs 2 4 and 7 additionally adopting total pm the entire psd as a comparison metric if a psd is coarser and heterodisperse will mask uo clarification assessments since coarse pm is a relatively high mass fraction and dominates separation on a gravimetric basis a more robust comparison is based on a per particle diameter or particle number density elution or separation li and sansalone 2020b spelman and sansalone 2017 4 discussion 4 1 benefits of proposed dynamic similitude models the dimensional analysis demonstrates the dominant role of nondimensional pm settling velocity hypothesized in eq 7 for pm clarification or by extension for pm associated chemicals pathogens the study also provides a theoretical basis for developing dynamic similitude models e g smg model for pm separation as a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity or variant thereof ho 2011 wilson et al 2009 implementation of such analyses is illustrated by the safl ct case with the smg model as a representation of eq 7 such dynamic similitude models are of significant value for engineering practice for example in the current regulation and verification of urban water clarifiers the pm separation performance of a clarification system is quantified by multiple physical tests under different loading conditions i e psd flowrate this process requires higher time and economic resource investment e g 250 000 700 000 usd for field based testing 150 000 usd for controlled laboratory testing as of 2018 chesapeake bay scientific and technical advisory committee 2015 li and sansalone 2020c national stormwater testing and evaluation of products and practices workgroup 2014 based on the findings and dynamic similitude model of this research instead of performing multiple tests for different loading conditions a single physical test with a heterodisperse psd can be performed to develop and train an smg model representation of eq 7 then the trained smg model can be used to predict the system pm separation and total pm separation for any given hydraulic loading and pm granulometry i e density psd compared to the existing regulations and verification requirements of only physical model testing through a large testing matrix the application of smg model can significantly simplify and reduce the effort of physical testing similarly the smg model can also benefit and accelerate cfd simulation of pm separation i e flow solution is more computational expensive than solving the pm transport equations although cfd simulations have a lower cost than physical based system testing e g 24 000 usd li and sansalone 2020c 4 2 distinction between dynamic similitude model and common analytical models although dynamic similitude models share some features with common models in the mathematical expression e g inclusion of w as for the case of sor dynamic similitude models are distinctive from common models in the fundamental formulation and underlying principles common models are derived based on assumptions of conceptualized system geometry e g rectangular channel and idealized hydrodynamic conditions plug flow or well mixed condition such a derivation is the major obstacle that hinders interpretability and blurs the applicability of common models since the system hydrodynamics do not adhere to these assumptions indeed the results of this study show these models are not robust for predicting pm separation across the diverse range of clarification systems examined moreover the formulation of common models also does not provide a physical basis and motivation for model calibration for example a cstr model can be modified and calibrated to physical testing data however the existing theory of common models does not illustrate 1 what the model has learned through the calibration and 2 to what system such a calibrated cstr model can be applied the causes of these weaknesses and ambiguity of common models in applicability and generality can be traced back to the assumptions i e conceptualized system geometry idealized hydrodynamics employed in the model deviation in contrast to the common models the dynamic similitude theory and model presented by this study are physics based and are more generalizable specifically 1 a dynamic similitude model does not assume any specific system geometry and hydrodynamics condition and therefore is not constrained by complex system geometry or non ideal hydrodynamic conditions in fact the simplification of the dynamic similitude model from eq 6 to eq 7 require the system hydrodynamic is sufficiently complex i e higher reynolds number such that the system flow is turbulent this is because the reynolds number invariance heller 2017 is a feature of turbulent flow and does not hold when the flow is laminar for a system that operates in a laminar condition not the case for clarification system li et al 2021b pm separation may also show dependence on the reynolds number in contrast to the dynamic similitude model none of these important physics is considered in the formulation of common models 2 a dynamic similitude model does not impose any specific pm separation scaling relation and spectrum in contrast common model such as sor forces a linear relation between pm separation and w which however does not hold in reality as illustrated across disparate databases of the safl ct in fig 2 kit rc in fig 5 and suol hs in fig 7 additionally the common model assumes a pm separation under non ideal flow conditions as a pfr cstr spectrum through the tanks in series approach hazen 1904 as demonstrated in fig 2 sor and cstr are not the limits of pm separation and this common assumption is not valid and requires revision 3 model calibration training with physical data or cfd simulation is an essential part of the dynamic similitude model once trained the dynamic similitude model can be applied to geometric similar systems irrespective of hydraulic loading and pm granulometry the predictive capability and generalizability are well explained and delineated by the theoretical basis in the dynamic similitude model which contrasts with the common models 4 3 new perspective on the application of analytical models the common models sor pfr cstr interrogated herein based on benchmarking results of each pm clarification case study were in general not accurate however these models did exhibit a degree of predictive capability the resulting deviations of these analytical models from benchmarking are generally within 50 in terms of specific pm diameter or range δ j figs 2 and 5 and 20 in terms of total pm separation δ t o t a l figs 4 and 6 while a range of predictive capability has been shown in the literature carbone et al 2014 ying and sansalone 2011 the basis has not been fully explained the dimensional analysis and dynamic similitude presented by this study can explain interrogation outcomes of the analytical models as follows 1 the analytical model formulation includes nondimensional pm settling velocity w dependence 2 w has a dominant influence on the pm transport and separation in turbulent flows 3 this level of apparent predictive capability can be significantly amplified erroneously by the coarseness and size heterodispersivity of a psd in which the total pm separation δ t o t a l as a comparison metric is much less sensitive to model errors especially at lower flowrate li and sansalone 2020c 2020d and for a coarser heterodisperse psd examples are illustrated in cases 2 and 4 and the coarser psd of case 5 for clarification whether a psd is considered as coarse or fine must be based on both the mass fraction distribution of pm diameters and also the flow characteristic velocity scale as indicated by eq 7 because of the similarity in the mathematical expression the analytical models can be considered and interpreted as types of the dynamic similitude model given their dependence on w from this unique point of view and principle of dynamic similitude the analytical models require that the simulated system is dynamically similar to the original training system which counters the common criticism regarding the assumption of idealized hydrodynamics of these analytical models plug or complete mixing in the literature furthermore in this unique perspective calibrating parameters e g modified pm settling velocity of the analytical models is not an ad hoc solution to compensate for the model s deficiency but an essential inverse modeling process for example in the safl ct case modifying and calibrating the analytical models may also yield reasonable predictions although smg is preferred for the theoretical basis and the expressibility in pm separation scaling as discussed previously and shown in fig s8 this unique perspective provides a theoretical basis for calibration of analytical models and their dynamic variants krajewski and sikorska senoner 2021 takács et al 1991 additionally calibrated analytical models are also subject to geometric similitude constraints and calibration is required on a case by case basis note that such interpretation on the applicability and generalizability of common model are not facilitated by the original hypothetical deviation of common models but a novel outcome of presented dynamic similitude theory by this study 4 4 conditions that can facilitate application of analytical models depending on the application and goals analytical model errors for clarification have variable levels of significance in the integrated analysis of conveyance treatment such as combined sewer overflows and receiving water systems with models such as the swmm and the integrated urban drainage models iudms the system dynamics are governed by many sub models including clarification modeling in such cases other model components e g hydrology and calibration data can potentially contribute larger error and uncertainties than the clarification modeling bach et al 2014 fulford and kimball 2015 li et al 2021c hence there is a reduced need to apply more accurate clarification models such as rans based cfd which can come at a higher computation expense moreover as illustrated in the case of the suol hs system fig 8 the total pm as ssc δ t o t a l as the evaluation metric results in reduced sensitivity to the underlying clarification modeling errors due to the unsteady loading and the mass based analysis of a psd in particular for a coarser heterodisperse psd 4 5 conditions that do not facilitate application of analytical models analytical models are agnostic to internal system hydrodynamics and pm separation as a function of detailed system geometrics internal or external hazen s semi empirical model notwithstanding for systems with internal baffle retrofits analytical models sor pfr cstr do not provide guidance for improving system pm separation krebs 1995 furthermore an accurate clarification model is critical for design of internal and external geometrics fig 9 illustrates an example of sizing the safl ct system to achieve a targeted pm separation of 80 st johns river water management district 2018 in this case a flowrate and pm diameter combination w s q 1 m 2 e g siliceous pm diameter of 373 μ m and q 50 l s at the water density of 1000kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 3 10 6 m2 s is considered the nondimensional pm settling velocity hypothesized in eq 7 that is functionally represented by the dynamic similitude smg model and validated with physical model testing is shown in fig 2 eq 7 illustrates that the appropriate safl ct size is a surface area of 0 4 m2 by comparison if sor pfr and cstr model are applied the system will be oversized by 100 304 and 904 applying inaccurate models to design sizing can result in unnecessary increases in manufacturing construction and maintenance costs as well as lost opportunity land costs the oversizing effects of analytical models compared to eq 7 are a function of the pm separation requirement in this example 80 as the pm separation requirement increases the oversizing effects are magnified except for the sor model examining oversizing effects is similarly applied to the suol hs system in figs 7 and 8 analytical models which can yield reasonable capability for total pm in an integrated water systems analysis e g swmm iudms may not be accurate and suitable for guiding clarification system design optimization and regulation the psd and system operation condition i e flowrate characteristic velocity scale also influences the required accuracy in clarification modeling as illustrated in the cetv njcat case fig 4 different models overlap for a heterodisperse psd at the lower characteristic velocity scale however considering a typical total pm separation range of 40 45 for the hs at their design capacity range of 500 2000 l min m2 new jersey department of environmental protection 2013 toronto and region conservation authority 2013 different models show drastic different predictions despite the reduced sensitivity for a total pm metric therefore the clarification modeling accuracy and sensitivity are critical to the system design optimization and regulation the oversizing effect of the analytical models discussed above in the context of a pm separation requirement level fig 9 persists even for total pm separation fig s5 the oversizing effect also increases non linearly as the total pm separation requirement level increases 4 6 implication of non linearity in pm separation pm separation is predominately a non linear function as illustrated from the analyses of all the cases tested figs 2 5 and 7 this non linearity of pm separation has the following significant implications 1 as illustrated in fig 9 except for sor which is linear i e pm separation changes linearly with system geometrics pfr and cstr models are non linear exponential functions in which the gradient d a δ j increases as the pm separation δ j increases given the predominance of non linear pm separation a small change in the targeted pm separation leads to an amplified change in the corresponding system geometrics this non linearity is the cause of the amplified oversizing behavior in the analytical models as identified above 2 non linearity of pm separation has important implications for system design and optimization optimization in the design phase yields amplified beneficial returns when the optimization objective is system geometrics at a pm separation level in contrast to the common objective of increasing pm separation solving the dilemma of increasing basin spatial requirements based on impaired performance is particularly important and beneficial with respect to a frequent need to retrofit clarification applications basins in conventional retrofits increasing surface area and volume the land use lost opportunity cost of a basin is a major economic consideration common examples include stormwater clarification systems above or below grade in highly urbanized areas where infrastructure adjacency and growth results in significant economic constraints for basin expansion the alternative is internal basin retrofits such as with permeable baffles that can improve clarification without basin expansion li et al 2021c for which analytical models are agnostic 3 the non linearity in pm separation fig 9 demonstrates that as pm separation or pm separation requirement increases enlarging system dimensions becomes increasingly less effective and less economical for increasing pm separation howard et al 2012 the required system geometrics lost land use opportunity costs and construction cost increase exponentially as the pm separation requirement increases for example from 80 to 90 therefore achieving and maintaining strong scalability e g pm separation continues to linearly increase as the system enlarges in the system design is important for the cost effective pm separation by clarification as shown in fig 9 a clarification system design can show weak scalability as illustrated by the cstr model in such cases optimizing design and improving system pm separation modeling through eq 7 as an example can offer improved economics as compared to increasing the dimensions of the system based on a model of weaker scalability 4 consideration of non linearity can extend to larger clarification systems system design optimization can be particularly critical and effective for the large depth length ratio clarification systems such as stormwater basins in which the system design can also be prone to weak scaling this is suggested by comparing saflt ct kit rc and apf cases as the system length depth ratio increases pm separation characteristics tend to shift from the eq 7 basis stronger scaling to the cstr weaker scaling the apf case further illustrates that the cstr overpredicts the total pm separation therefore the pm separation characteristics in the apf system is conjectured to have even weaker scaling than simulated with the cstr model as a result of this weakened scalability pm separation in a large length depth ratio clarification system can be insensitive to the system dimension adjustments negating the cost effectiveness more research is needed to verify this hypothesis 4 7 challenges in system design another insight from this investigation is that the many existing commercial hs systems do not outperform plain cylinder tanks the saft ct as illustrated in fig 4 this finding is also in line with the physical modeling results of boogaard et al 2017 in which the commercial hs systems show pm separation characteristics similar to the sor model this result is unexpected and contradicts the previous studies that advocate and suggest that the commercial hs systems process unique flow hydrodynamics e g swirling vortex etc that promote pm separation the design and optimization of an hs systems can be a challenging task as shown in fig 10 les reveals the safl ct system undergoes complex flow configurations and turbulence structures despite the simple system geometry the multiphase turbulent flow studies reveal that these turbulent flow structures play critical roles in the pm transport and fate in the system however there are few studies that elucidate the significance of these turbulent flow structures on pm separation in clarification systems the complexity of these turbulence flow structures e g strong streamline curvature curved boundary layer impinging jet secondary flow of prandtl s first kind in the system substantially exceeds the analysis capability of analytical models and can even challenge the robustness for rans based cfd design models li and sansalone 2021 further research is needed to investigate the turbulent flow structure in these clarification systems and benchmark the rans based model with physical modeling or high fidelity simulation les or dns further research should also elucidate the pm resuspension and souring process in clarification system such fundamental investigations can potentially illuminate the pm separation dynamics in the safl ct systems stormwater basins unit operations and processes and better guide the design of non proprietary and commercial clarification systems 5 conclusions the predictive capabilities of common analytical models of sor pfr and cstr are investigated under steady and unsteady loading conditions over a range of common clarification systems represented by tanks hydrodynamic separators hs rectangular clarifiers and stormwater clarification basins the predictions of analytical models are compared with the results of controlled laboratory full scale physical modeling field monitoring and high fidelity les simulations dimensional analysis for a dilute pm fluid multiphase system is conducted to develop a generalized and physically interpretable theory for modeling of pm separation by unit operations through the hypothesis of eq 7 and dynamic similitude a modified gamma model smg is proposed and tested the non linearity of the pm separation modeling profiles is shown to have critical implications for clarification system design and optimization the results of this study yield the following conclusions analytical models are generally not accurate for predicting pm separation hypothesis 1 objective 2 depending on the system the analytical models deviate from the physical modeling and les simulation results by 30 to 50 for pm separation δ j objective 3 pfr and cstr are also not robust to represent the limits of pm separation in a non idealized clarification as shown in fig 2 however these modeling errors in pm separation are masked when applying a total pm separation δ t o t a l metric on a mass basis e g suspended sediment concentration ssc of a heterodisperse psd with an apparent error of less than 20 furthermore an inaccurate pm separation model can exhibit some level of apparent predictive capability for ssc under the influence of unsteady loadings and a coarse heterodisperse psd the accuracy of clarification modeling is critical for the design optimization regulation maintenance and management of the clarification systems hypothesis 1 this in part is because of the non linearity of the pm separation small changes in pm separation can translate to amplified changes in the designed system geometrics applying inaccurate analytical models can significantly oversize the system by as much as 904 as illustrated in fig 9 objective 4 this non linearity of pm separation further suggests that the clarification system s optimization receives magnified beneficial returns when the optimization goal is to reduce system dimension for a fixed level of performance as opposed to the goal of enhancing system performance the non linearity of pm separation also emphasizes the importance of system design scalability for cost effective pm separation by clarification despite assumptions of the analytical models the models did produce a level of predictive capability given the complex flow hydrodynamics irrespective of a coarse heterodisperse psd metric that masks model discrepancies the existing literature does not explicate this level of predictive capability the dynamic similitude in this study potentially explains this observed predictive capabilities of analytical models the dynamic similitude also provides a unique theoretical basis for interpreting these analytical models the analytical models can be perceived as a form of the dynamic similarity model because of the similar features in the mathematical expression this unique perspective gives a physical explanation for the analytical models calibration in the literature on a case by case basis the dynamic similitude however indicates a calibrated analytical model remains constrained by geometry similitude dynamic similitude is a robust alternative for modeling system pm separation hypothesis 2 the dynamic similarity model presented does not require any hypothetical assumptions as compared to the common models in addition the working principle of the dynamic similarity model has a physical basis and the generalizability is well delineated by the geometric similitude leveraging unique characteristics of turbulence flow i e dominate role of reynolds flux in mixing and reynolds number invariance pm separation of a dilute multiphase system can be distilled to a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity function eq 7 as a reasonable simplification of the more general dimensionless groups eq 6 for clarification systems with geometric similitude as illustrated in fig 2 a dynamic similitude model once trained with the physical model or cfd simulations can be applied to predict the pm and total pm separation for any given hydraulic loading and pm granulometry psd density hypothesis 3 this critical benefit of dynamic similitude model can significantly simplify and reduce the effort and cost associated with physical modeling or cfd simulations of clarification systems for clarification whether a psd is considered as coarse or fine must be based on both the mass fraction distribution of pm diameters and also the flow characteristic velocity scale as indicated by eq 7 commercial hs systems do not demonstrate a more cost effective design than the safl ct systems plain cylinder tanks for pm separation the high fidelity les simulation reveals complex turbulent flow structures in such systems these results indicate the challenge to optimize the system design for pm separation in such small footprint systems that find application in constrained area land use conditions such as in densely populated urban areas of significant existing infrastructure future research should investigate the role of turbulent

common models are not robust and generalizable for predicting pm separation with error ranging from 30 to 50 and can significantly oversize a clarifier up to 904 the non linear characteristics of pm

parameters and generalize system dynamics by casting the governing equation in a nondimensional form the nondimensional incompressible navier stokes equations with the coupling of a pm transport equation for a dilute pm volume fraction 1 10 3 fluid pm multiphase system are defined in eqs 1 3 gravitational sedimentation i e type i sedimentation of pm is developed through a first order

finite reynolds number drag correction model balachandar and eaton 2010 schiller and naumann 1935 the nondimensional pm concentration c is scaled by the pm concentration scale c the selection of the characteristic scales such as velocity length pm concentration in dynamic similarity is also not unique and is a matter of choice herein following conventions in clarification modeling fischerström 1958 hazen 1904 li and sansalone 2020c the surface loading rate slr q a is selected as the velocity scale u where q is the hydraulic loading rate and a is the system surface area slr is different from sor and their correlation are shown in the section of databases examined for prismatic cylindrical system the bottom diameter is selected as the length scales for quasi rectangular system the bottom length is selected as the length scale by choosing the influent pm concentration c i as the pm concentration scale i e c c i the nondimensional effluent pm concentration is therefore defined as c e c e c c e c i the pm fluid system is further considered with a heterodisperse particle size distribution psd the discrete pm diameter ranges that constitute a psd are denoted by the particle index of j using this notation the pm separation δ j for the j particle of a psd can be defined by the nondimensional effluent pm concentration c j e of the j particle as shown in eq 5 5 δ j c j i c j e c j i 1 c j e the dimensional analysis indicates the pm separation of a dilute i e without significant pm induced stratification and coagulation flocculation heterodisperse fluid pm clarification system is a function of system geometry reynolds number schmidt number and nondimensional pm settling velocity as conceptualized in eq 6 for any two clarification systems if the geometries of two clarification systems are perfectly proportional fulfilling the geometric similarity and also that each dimensionless group i e r e s c w of the two systems are equal then the pm separation of these two clarification systems are also equivalent barenblatt 2014 6 δ j f r e s c w eqs 1 3 provide an accurate representation of dilute heterodisperse pm fluid systems and are commonly used in fluid mechanics applications li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2021 liu et al 2020 salinas et al 2020 hereafter an objective is to examine and propose further simplification of eq 6 based on observed physical behavior of clarification systems most clarification systems function and operate in the turbulent regime with the flow reynolds number in the range of approximately 1 000 to 100 000 li et al 2021c lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 in a multiphase turbulent flow system the transport and separation of pm in the bulk regions away from walls are primarily dominated by the reynolds turbulent fluxes and gravity for pm in the settleable granulometric range and larger silt and sand size pope 2000 therefore the contribution of brownian diffusion impacting only the smaller pm granulometric range of suspended pm such as the clay size fraction provides only a nominal impact to the bulk pm transport and hence the schmidt number is of lesser importance cantero et al 2009 li et al 2021a salinas et al 2019 furthermore the reynolds number impacts the solution of the pm transport equation eq 3 explicitly through the brownian diffusion term 2 c resc although of lesser importance compared to turbulent fluxes and implicitly through the advection term u c this dependence of u on reynolds number is governed by eqs 1 2 studies of turbulent jet flows and channel flows moser et al 1999 schultz and flack 2013 stamou et al 1989 xu et al 2013 reveal the mean flow and reynolds shear stress can show weak to almost no dependence on the reynolds number which is known as reynolds number invariance heller 2017 therefore we hypothesize that the pm separation of a clarification system has a lesser dependence on the flow reynolds and schmidt numbers as compared to the nondimensional pm settling velocity hence pm separation of a clarification uo can be potentially approximated as a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity as shown in eq 7 producing a more representative result than common analytical models this hypothesis is examined in the results section 7 δ j f w 2 2 physics informed data driven modeling of pm separation while the dimensional analysis provides physical insight for the pm separation dynamics eq 7 the dimensional analysis does not infer the exact form of the pm separation function f w studies of dickenson and sansalone 2009 howard et al 2012 li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2020d stamou et al 1989 have shown that the pm separation function f w generally follows a s shape curve that monotonically increases as w increase therefore this pm separation function f w is represented by a modified gamma cumulative distribution function as shown in eq 8 and this model is referred to as the similarity modified gamma model smg the choice of this modified gamma cumulative distribution function is because i the function monotonically increases to unity which is consistent with the observed physical behavior of the pm separation function and ii the function

databases examined table 1 summarizes the analytical models of sor pfr and cstr commonly applied for pm separation the detailed derivations of these models are available in the cited literature and also in the online supplemental materials these analytical models are interrogated in the following five 5 cases of common but distinct clarification systems with differing geometries across a range of scales as summarized in table 2 details drawings and further method based physical test information are provided in the online supplemental materials 2 3 1 case 1 st anthony falls laboratory safl plain cylinder tanks ct the physical modeling of pm separation in cylindrical tanks ct a geometry commonly implemented for hydrodynamic separators hs and also tested by st anthony falls laboratory safl at the university of minnesota usa is examined with the hypothesis posited from the dimensional analysis eq 7 as well as to train the smg model eq 8 representing eq 7 fig s1 in online supplemental materials illustrates the geometric configurations of the safl ct table 3 shows the detailed system dimensions and the physical modeling configurations of the 4x4 system and 6x6 system 2 3 2 case 2 cetv njcat hydrodynamics separators hs the predictive capabilities of the analytical models are also interrogated for 22 commercially available hydrodynamic separator hs systems new jersey department of environmental protection 2013 toronto and region conservation authority 2013 similar to the safl ct hs systems are also designed to clarify pm from the flow stream compared to the safl ct these proprietary hs systems are designed with more complex and varied geometries as illustrated in fig s2 and table s2 online supplemental materials a relatively coarse heterodisperse pm d 10 5 μ m d 50 75 μ m d 90 250 μ m with a specific gravity of 2 65 is used to create the influent feed the psd of this heterodisperse pm is shown in fig 1 and is referred to as the njcat psd hereafter a constant pm loading of 200 20 mg l is applied in the physical modeling of a hs system the total pm separation δ t o t a l is either determined based on the captured pm or indirectly determined based on the eluted pm the system total pm separation defined with eluted pm is shown in eq 10 for a heterodisperse pm the total pm separation δ t o t a l is an integral of the product between the psd mass fraction m j and the pm separation for all pm diameter ranges that constitute the entire psd δ j as shown in eq 11 for a given psd m j the total pm separation δ t o t a l is a function of the velocity scale u the particle index j and pm settling velocity w s are interchangeable because of their direct and unique correspondence in addition for a monodisperse psd the pm separation δ j and the total pm separation δ t o t a l across the psd are equivalent as is the case of safl ct 10 δ t o t a l c i c e c i 1 c e 11 δ t o t a l u m j w s δ j w w s u d w s in this equation m j is the mass fraction

is based on the rectangular clarifiers rc at the karlsruhe institute of technology kit lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 as shown in fig s3 online supplemental material the three 3 kit rc units share the same bulk system dimensions and only differ in the inlet deflector baffle configurations that are within the clarifier specifically there are deflectors configured downstream of the inlet in the two sided deflector clarifier and one sided clarifier in the no deflector clarifier the deflector is not configured and the free surface elevation h 17 cm is nominally lower than the clarifier with deflectors h 17 3 cm in comparison with the two previous cases of safl ct and the cetv njcat hs unit database in which the system length depth ratios are approximately 1 0 the kit rc system has a larger length depth ratio of 14 the physical modeling of the kit rc lyn and rodi 1990 stamou 1991 focused on the system hydrodynamics and the pm separation results were not available therefore the high fidelity les simulations of the pm separation were carried out to extend the original studies li et al 2021a 2021b li and sansalone 2021 similar to the previous two cases of safl ct and the cetv njcat hs unit database constant hydraulic loading and pm loading are implemented in the simulation of pm separation in the kit rc case the average inlet velocity is 1 61 cm s three monodisperse pm diameters of 112 158 and 224 μ m with a specific gravity of 1 1 for typical organic particles in a wastewater clarifier are simulated 2 3 4 case 4 apf urban drainage clarification basin the fourth case represents a larger scale system this case is a stormwater clarification basin at the naples municipal airport airport code apf florida usa li et al 2021c located near the southwest gulf coast of florida the system bathymetry and geometric configuration are illustrated in fig s4 online supplemental materials the basin has a length of 260 m from north to south and a lateral dimension varying from 40 to 86 m the mean water depth is 3 m the basin depth averaged surface area is 12 600 m 2 crushed recycled concrete crc that was carbonated served as media 75 to 100 mm size range in twelve 12 linear and permeable baffles configured as an internal retrofit within the basin to improve the system hydraulic training and clarification in comparison with the previous cases this system has a significantly larger length depth ratio of 86 7 in addition this system is also subject to the highly unsteady hydraulic pm and constituent loadings from off site generated by uncontrolled rainfall runoff processed from a combination of airside and landside urban commercial area catchment interfaces in this interrogation of the analytical models event mean flowrate and observed influent psd apf psd in fig 1 are used to calculate the total pm separation two pm densities of 1000 organic pm and 2650 inorganic siliceous pm kg m3 are considered a water density of 995 7kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 0 8 10 6 m2 s at a water temperature of 30 c is used in addition as shown in eq 12 an empirical model harper and baker 2003 based on residence time rt is also interrogated for this case this empirical correlation was developed from a regression based on a florida basin database 13 data points in total residence time notwithstanding this empirical correlation in part constituent the basis of current stormwater basin design guidance and presumptive basin performance by state of florida regulators and is therefore pertinent for this case along with the models identified in table 1

hs in the fifth case the analytical models are interrogated for a physical model of a hs system for pm separation based on pm elution at a constant pm influent concentration subject to unsteady flow loading in the stormwater unit operations laboratory suol at university of florida given the unsteady loading a dynamic variant of the cstr model is considered this dynamic cstr model is commonly used in process based simulations such as swmm and integrated urban water system analysis huber et al 2006 krajewski et al 2017 wilson and barfield 1984 in the dynamic cstr model the momentum transport is not considered and the pm transport equation is shown in eq 13 13 d v c j d t q i c j i q e c j e a w s c j e in this equation v is the system volume q i and q e are the inlet and outlet flowrate because the hs provide minimal volumetric storage the routing process is not considered i e q i q e d v d t 0 the term a w s represents the clarification removal rate m3 s note that subject to a simplified case steady state hydraulic conditions d d t 0 eq 13 simplifies to the cstr formulation for the steady state pm separation table 1 in the physical modeling of the steady state pm separation under constant loadings the njcat psd fig 1 is used to create the constant influent pm of 100 mg l effluent psd data were generated with a malvern 2000 laser diffraction malvern instruments ltd 2012 further testing details are identical to the previous case of cetv njcat hs units database as previously referenced the schematic representation of the hs system and the physical modeling of the pm elution subject to unsteady loadings are illustrated in fig s5 online supplemental materials controlled laboratory tests of the hs are also conducted for the total six 6 combinations of three 3 hydrographs fig s5a and two 2 different heterodisperse psds finer psd and njcat psd in fig 1 in the interrogation of the dynamic cstr model the heterodispersivity of the psd is considered by solving multiple transport equations for different pm diameter ranges simultaneously eighty 80 pm diameter ranges are examined from laser diffraction data and are simulated for each psd as shown in figs s6 and s7 eq 13 is implicitly solved by the crank nicolson scheme in matlab a time step of 10 s is determined based on the numerical convergence study as shown in figs s7b and s7d 3 results 3 1 case 1 st anthony falls laboratory safl plain cylinder tanks ct figures 2 and 3 are introduced to interrogate the analytical model results with respect to the physical modeling pm separation of the two safl ct systems 4x4 and 6x6 as defined in table 3 the comparison of results in dimensional space are plotted as the inset diagram fig 2a and also shown in nondimensional space as the larger plot fig 2b the predictions of the analytical models sor cstr and pfr as compared to eq 7 as represented by the smg model eq 8 α 1 162 β 2 506 λ 11 61 are also plotted the water density of 1000kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 3 10 6 m2 s at a temperature of 10 c are used to calculate the pm settling velocity as shown in fig 2 a the pm separation results are widely distributed over the dimensional domain for the same particle diameter the different pm separation values are a result of the system dimensions surface area and also the test flowrate on pm separation which are not accounted for in dimensional space pm separation results in a dimensional space also do not clearly indicate based on inspection or infer a definitive correlation for pm separation in contrast plotting pm separation results in the nondimensional space illustrates the dominant influence of the nondimensional pm settling velocity w as hypothesized from eq 7 pm separation results from various combinations of pm diameters flowrates and system geometries collapse into a single asymptotic function this is indicated by inspection of fig 2 b and also fig 3 d the coefficient of determination r t 2 is 0 98 for the smg model representing eq 7 on the training dataset of the 4x4 system the trained smg model also predicts the pm separation of the 6x6 system with the coefficient of determination r v 2 of 0 95 these results support the hypothesis eq 7 in the dimensional analysis of section 2 1 that pm separation is hypothesized to be predominately a function of the nondimensional pm settling velocity eq 7 in comparison to the validated smg model the analytical models sor pfr cstr do not produce representative predictions of pm separation the significant differences for pm separation between the analytical models and the physical model data as well as the validated smg model are illustrated in fig 2 b these analytical models yield lower pm separation as function of nondimensional pm settling velocity w by 38 for sor 48 for pfr and 55 for cstr models at w 0 5 these results support the hypothesis that the common models sor pfr cstr are not robust for predicting pm separation the dynamic similitude and the compression or synthesis ability of the smg model representing eq 7 is further illustrated in fig 3 figs 3 a and 3 b show the physical modeling results of safl ct markers and the smg model plotted as a 3d surface in the 3d space defined by the pm settling velocity w s characteristic velocity scale u and pm separation δ j from figs 3 a and 3 b the contour lines of the smg model 3d surface are projected onto the 2d plane of characteristic velocity scale and pm terminal velocity which is further highlighted in fig 3 c as shown in fig 3 a and 3 b the smg model captures the dependence of pm separation on the pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale pm separation increases as the pm settling velocity increases larger diameter pm and or higher pm specific gravity and or as the characteristic velocity scale decreases increasing clarifier surface area and or decreasing hydraulic loading rate this combined influence of the pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale on pm separation yields a non linear 3d surface this non linearity of the pm separation has critical implications for clarification system design and modeling which are elaborated in the discussion section fig 3 c shows the projection of this 3d surface contour line in the 2d w s u plane is a line this is a result of the contour line gradient in the w s u plane which is w s u which is the nondimensional pm velocity w of eq 7 therefore each contour line represents a family of pm settling velocity and characteristic velocity scale combinations that yields the same w and thereby the same pm separation as illustrated by eq 7 and fig 2 b the comparison between fig 3 and 2 demonstrates the ability of a nondimensional approach to unify compress and provide synthesis of results under dynamic similitude a complex non linear 3d surface in dimensional space fig 3a can be compressed into a single 2d non linear curve in a nondimensional space fig 2 3 2 case 2 cetv njcat hydrodynamic separators hs the publicly reported and agency certified total pm separation of cetv njcat hs systems are summarized in fig 4 in addition to plotting the analytical models sor pfr cstr interrogated in this study the smg model representation of eq 7 previously interrogated with the safl ct database is also plotted and labeled as the safl ct this case is different from the previous safl ct case where the pm separation is based on discrete pm diameters in the medium sand size range in this case the interrogation of the analytical models and safl ct smg model is for total pm separation δ t o t a l based on physical modeling data this requires an additional integration of pm separation with each particle diameter range mass fraction across the entire psd as shown in eq 11 the results plotted in fig 4 are for the coarser heterodisperse psd njcat psd in fig 1 figure 4 illustrates difference between the analytical models and physical modeling results across this entire database the analytical models generally do not yield accurate prediction of the total pm separation for the hs systems however given the wide variability of the hs system results the analytical model can coincidentally agree with some hs system results any agreement between analytical models and physical results depend on the hs system and the characteristic velocity scale pfr and cstr models predict lower total pm separation for all systems across the characteristic velocity scales examined differences between sor and physical results range from 10 to 20 at higher characteristic velocity scales u 100 l min m2 at lower characteristic velocity scales u 100 l min m2 the sor model provides improved representation of the physical results with differences less than 10 the improved sor representation in the lower characteristic velocity scale range directly results from two critical constraints 1 adoption of total pm as the assessment metric for pm separation and 2 imposition of a heterodisperse relatively coarse and inorganic specific gravity of 2 65 psd as the required loading metric at a lower characteristic velocity scale the combination of these factors yield total pm separation results that are less sensitive to the embedded model assumptions and the resulting discrepancies generated by each analytical models li and sansalone 2020c at a lower characteristic velocity scale the mass proportion of completely separated pm 100 pm separation primarily sediment size pm 75 μ m in a psd increases with total pm as the assessment metric model discrepancies can only translate through the mass fractions of pm diameter ranges that are not completely separated smaller particles primarily suspended pm 25 μ m as a result the apparent difference in the total pm separation between the physical model results and the analytical models decreases in the limiting case when the characteristic velocity scale is sufficiently low there is an insignificant difference more precisely the apparent model error between the physical model and the analytical models since all the particles that constitute the psd approach 100 separation indeed due to this reduction in sensitivity based on the requirement of the total pm separation as a comparison metric the differences between pfr cstr and sor models are masked these differences are less than 10 at a lower characteristic velocity u 100 l min m2 furthermore results indicate that with this specified psd metric total pm separation in contrast to pm separation on a discrete particle diameter basis of different hs systems physical modeling results are not distinguishable at the lower characteristic velocity u 100 l min m2 the safl ct smg model also does not reproduce the total pm separation of the cetv njcat hs systems the basis for the discrepancy of the safl ct smg model is the dimensional analysis as identified previously the safl ct smg model can only be applied to systems that are geometrically similar to the original training system i e the 4x4 system of safl ct the hs systems are not geometrically similar to the safl ct systems as illustrated by figs s1 and s2 a comparison of the safl ct smg model and physical model results of hs systems suggests that in aggregate most hs systems do not provide improved pm separation as compared to the plain tank such as the safl cl systems fig s1 plain cylinder tanks while a number of hs systems can yield better or equivalent performance compared to the safl cl plain tank systems many hs systems show 10 20 lower total pm separation than the safl cl systems even though sophisticated geometries of hs systems have been promoted by the different manufacturers 3 3 case 3 karlsruhe institute of technology kit rectangular clarifiers rc figure 5 compares analytical models and safl ct smg model with high fidelity les simulation results pm separation from the rans based cfd models of komega06 wilcox 2006 komegasst menter et al 2003 and wa18 han et al 2018 as performed in li and sansalone 2020d are also plotted as shown in fig 5 different rans based cfd models while showing variability in their prediction capability generally agree well with les results and produce differences less than 10 in contrast analytical model results differ from les results by as large as 25 with respect to different clarifier configurations analytical models predict the same results irrespective of configuration given that analytical models lack dependence on the system geometrics pm separation is only a function of w for the analytical models by comparison the les and rans based cfd model indicate that the two sided deflector configuration improves the pm separation by as much as 10 compared to the one sided deflector and no deflector configuration in contrast to the safl ct case in this case the pfr model yields better agreement with les compared to sor and cstr the better agreement by the pfr model is consistent with stamou et al 1989 for a primary clarifier in sarnia ontario canada subject to quasi steady flows comparison of fig 2 and 5 indicate that there is no consistent trend produced by the analytical models predicting lower or higher pm separation depending on the specific geometry of the clarifier system these analytical models lack consistency and can produce lower or higher predictions figure 5 implies that conventional clarification systems depending on geometry can be less effective than safl ct or njcat cetv hs systems based on nondimensional pm settling velocity as hypothesized in eq 7 or slr for a psd this implication is similar to heinking and wilcoxon 1985 where for a given unit surface area hs systems can accommodate higher flowrates than conventional clarifiers based on the same pm separation level 3 4 case 4 apf stormwater clarification basin figure 6 compares event based total pm separation from physical monitoring of uncontrolled basin loadings and the model predictions the agreement between physical monitoring and model predictions varies by storm events the differences are nominally within 30 except for the 24 july 2015 event where the difference ranges from 40 to 60 in addition the pm density yields a minimal influence on model results an increase in pm density from 1000 kg m3 denser than fluid density of 995 7kg m 3 to 2650 kg m3 increased the pm settling velocity by 384 times based on the stokes drag law for a given pm diameter however total pm separation increased by 5 to 9 in the analytical models this substantially reduced influence of the pm settling velocity w s to the total pm separation suggests the clarification system operates at the limit of the low characteristic velocity scale median of 0 46 and range from 0 25 to 87 l min m2 hence this clarification system is significantly oversized on a hydraulic basis additionally the influent psd is relatively coarse and heterodisperse with respect to the characteristic velocity scale of the uncontrolled events recognizing that the high flow hydraulic stress in such events is a small proportion of the hydrograph these results also illustrate a lack of sensitivity when applying total pm separation as the common comparison metric on a mass basis at lower hydraulic loading as illustrated with fig 4 of case 2 at the lower hydraulic loadings and relatively coarse heterodisperse psds the analytical models interrogated herein yield comparable results that show less than 10 difference meanwhile the tested empirical model em yields comparable results for the total pm separation as the common models although the empirical model of harper and baker 2003 further lacks the dependence on the pm density and psd the comparable results of these models can be explained through eq 7 accounting for the interaction of the inflow heterodisperse psd and slr for the system and not the representativeness of these common models 3 5 case 5 suol hydrodynamics separator hs figure 7 summarizes the pm separation δ j results of physical modeling komegasst cfd model and analytical models for a commercial hs unit 4 6m 3 based on controlled physical model testing with the njcat coarser heterodisperse psd of fig 1 the results of the komegasst cfd model reproduces the physical modeling results for the entire psd range indicated by w with the difference nominally less than 10 by comparison analytical models produce large deviation with respect to physical model results irrespective of flow rate 4 53 l s and 13 6 l s represent 25 and 75 of designed peak hydraulic capacity for this hs unit the cstr model of pm separation is consistently 50 to 60 lower than the physical model results these prediction results are consistent with the observed behavior of the cstr model in the previous cetv njcat case summarized in fig 4 of case 2 figure 8 illustrates a series of plots of eluted pm concentration as suspended sediment concentration ssc from the physical model response to three hydrographs of differing unsteadiness and peak flow that ranged from 4 53 to 18 0 l s and the corresponding predictions of the dynamic cstr model eq 13 also plotted is a trained dynamic cstr model in the trained cstr model the clarification removal rate term a w s in eq 13 is modified by an additional parameter as κ a w s and this parameter κ 2 0 is calibrated with the results of the finer psd as shown in figs 8 a 8 c the motivation and limitations of calibration in the cstr model are elaborated in the later discussion section in comparison to the dynamic cstr the calibrated cstr produces improved model predictions for the results of the coarser psd validation cases with the coefficient of determination ranging from 0 83 to 0 99 as shown in figs 8 d 8 f the dynamic cstr model predicts the general trends of the pm elution profile however the dynamic cstr tends to overpredict the ssc on the elution recession limb the differences between the cstr and physical model range from 20 to 30 an exceptional high deviation of 70 is observed at 120 minutes maximum duration of the physical modeling for storm 3 with the finer psd loading psd is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 8 c the overprediction of the dynamic cstr model for eluted ssc is consistent with the pm separation results under steady state loadings as shown in fig 7 however the overprediction by the dynamic cstr model is significantly less pronounced in this unsteady loading case as compared to the steady state loading case fig 7 note that the cstr model fig 7 is the exact solution of the dynamic cstr model under steady state condition therefore this reduction in the apparent modeling error in the dynamic cstr case results from the combined influence of the unsteady loading and adopting of the total pm as the comparison metric the unsteady loading alters the characteristic velocity scale and hence the accuracy of the analytical model as illustrated in figs 2 4 and 7 additionally adopting total pm the entire psd as a comparison metric if a psd is coarser and heterodisperse will mask uo clarification assessments since coarse pm is a relatively high mass fraction and dominates separation on a gravimetric basis a more robust comparison is based on a per particle diameter or particle number density elution or separation li and sansalone 2020b spelman and sansalone 2017 4 discussion 4 1 benefits of proposed dynamic similitude models the dimensional analysis demonstrates the dominant role of nondimensional pm settling velocity hypothesized in eq 7 for pm clarification or by extension for pm associated chemicals pathogens the study also provides a theoretical basis for developing dynamic similitude models e g smg model for pm separation as a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity or variant thereof ho 2011 wilson et al 2009 implementation of such analyses is illustrated by the safl ct case with the smg model as a representation of eq 7 such dynamic similitude models are of significant value for engineering practice for example in the current regulation and verification of urban water clarifiers the pm separation performance of a clarification system is quantified by multiple physical tests under different loading conditions i e psd flowrate this process requires higher time and economic resource investment e g 250 000 700 000 usd for field based testing 150 000 usd for controlled laboratory testing as of 2018 chesapeake bay scientific and technical advisory committee 2015 li and sansalone 2020c national stormwater testing and evaluation of products and practices workgroup 2014 based on the findings and dynamic similitude model of this research instead of performing multiple tests for different loading conditions a single physical test with a heterodisperse psd can be performed to develop and train an smg model representation of eq 7 then the trained smg model can be used to predict the system pm separation and total pm separation for any given hydraulic loading and pm granulometry i e density psd compared to the existing regulations and verification requirements of only physical model testing through a large testing matrix the application of smg model can significantly simplify and reduce the effort of physical testing similarly the smg model can also benefit and accelerate cfd simulation of pm separation i e flow solution is more computational expensive than solving the pm transport equations although cfd simulations have a lower cost than physical based system testing e g 24 000 usd li and sansalone 2020c 4 2 distinction between dynamic similitude model and common analytical models although dynamic similitude models share some features with common models in the mathematical expression e g inclusion of w as for the case of sor dynamic similitude models are distinctive from common models in the fundamental formulation and underlying principles common models are derived based on assumptions of conceptualized system geometry e g rectangular channel and idealized hydrodynamic conditions plug flow or well mixed condition such a derivation is the major obstacle that hinders interpretability and blurs the applicability of common models since the system hydrodynamics do not adhere to these assumptions indeed the results of this study show these models are not robust for predicting pm separation across the diverse range of clarification systems examined moreover the formulation of common models also does not provide a physical basis and motivation for model calibration for example a cstr model can be modified and calibrated to physical testing data however the existing theory of common models does not illustrate 1 what the model has learned through the calibration and 2 to what system such a calibrated cstr model can be applied the causes of these weaknesses and ambiguity of common models in applicability and generality can be traced back to the assumptions i e conceptualized system geometry idealized hydrodynamics employed in the model deviation in contrast to the common models the dynamic similitude theory and model presented by this study are physics based and are more generalizable specifically 1 a dynamic similitude model does not assume any specific system geometry and hydrodynamics condition and therefore is not constrained by complex system geometry or non ideal hydrodynamic conditions in fact the simplification of the dynamic similitude model from eq 6 to eq 7 require the system hydrodynamic is sufficiently complex i e higher reynolds number such that the system flow is turbulent this is because the reynolds number invariance heller 2017 is a feature of turbulent flow and does not hold when the flow is laminar for a system that operates in a laminar condition not the case for clarification system li et al 2021b pm separation may also show dependence on the reynolds number in contrast to the dynamic similitude model none of these important physics is considered in the formulation of common models 2 a dynamic similitude model does not impose any specific pm separation scaling relation and spectrum in contrast common model such as sor forces a linear relation between pm separation and w which however does not hold in reality as illustrated across disparate databases of the safl ct in fig 2 kit rc in fig 5 and suol hs in fig 7 additionally the common model assumes a pm separation under non ideal flow conditions as a pfr cstr spectrum through the tanks in series approach hazen 1904 as demonstrated in fig 2 sor and cstr are not the limits of pm separation and this common assumption is not valid and requires revision 3 model calibration training with physical data or cfd simulation is an essential part of the dynamic similitude model once trained the dynamic similitude model can be applied to geometric similar systems irrespective of hydraulic loading and pm granulometry the predictive capability and generalizability are well explained and delineated by the theoretical basis in the dynamic similitude model which contrasts with the common models 4 3 new perspective on the application of analytical models the common models sor pfr cstr interrogated herein based on benchmarking results of each pm clarification case study were in general not accurate however these models did exhibit a degree of predictive capability the resulting deviations of these analytical models from benchmarking are generally within 50 in terms of specific pm diameter or range δ j figs 2 and 5 and 20 in terms of total pm separation δ t o t a l figs 4 and 6 while a range of predictive capability has been shown in the literature carbone et al 2014 ying and sansalone 2011 the basis has not been fully explained the dimensional analysis and dynamic similitude presented by this study can explain interrogation outcomes of the analytical models as follows 1 the analytical model formulation includes nondimensional pm settling velocity w dependence 2 w has a dominant influence on the pm transport and separation in turbulent flows 3 this level of apparent predictive capability can be significantly amplified erroneously by the coarseness and size heterodispersivity of a psd in which the total pm separation δ t o t a l as a comparison metric is much less sensitive to model errors especially at lower flowrate li and sansalone 2020c 2020d and for a coarser heterodisperse psd examples are illustrated in cases 2 and 4 and the coarser psd of case 5 for clarification whether a psd is considered as coarse or fine must be based on both the mass fraction distribution of pm diameters and also the flow characteristic velocity scale as indicated by eq 7 because of the similarity in the mathematical expression the analytical models can be considered and interpreted as types of the dynamic similitude model given their dependence on w from this unique point of view and principle of dynamic similitude the analytical models require that the simulated system is dynamically similar to the original training system which counters the common criticism regarding the assumption of idealized hydrodynamics of these analytical models plug or complete mixing in the literature furthermore in this unique perspective calibrating parameters e g modified pm settling velocity of the analytical models is not an ad hoc solution to compensate for the model s deficiency but an essential inverse modeling process for example in the safl ct case modifying and calibrating the analytical models may also yield reasonable predictions although smg is preferred for the theoretical basis and the expressibility in pm separation scaling as discussed previously and shown in fig s8 this unique perspective provides a theoretical basis for calibration of analytical models and their dynamic variants krajewski and sikorska senoner 2021 takács et al 1991 additionally calibrated analytical models are also subject to geometric similitude constraints and calibration is required on a case by case basis note that such interpretation on the applicability and generalizability of common model are not facilitated by the original hypothetical deviation of common models but a novel outcome of presented dynamic similitude theory by this study 4 4 conditions that can facilitate application of analytical models depending on the application and goals analytical model errors for clarification have variable levels of significance in the integrated analysis of conveyance treatment such as combined sewer overflows and receiving water systems with models such as the swmm and the integrated urban drainage models iudms the system dynamics are governed by many sub models including clarification modeling in such cases other model components e g hydrology and calibration data can potentially contribute larger error and uncertainties than the clarification modeling bach et al 2014 fulford and kimball 2015 li et al 2021c hence there is a reduced need to apply more accurate clarification models such as rans based cfd which can come at a higher computation expense moreover as illustrated in the case of the suol hs system fig 8 the total pm as ssc δ t o t a l as the evaluation metric results in reduced sensitivity to the underlying clarification modeling errors due to the unsteady loading and the mass based analysis of a psd in particular for a coarser heterodisperse psd 4 5 conditions that do not facilitate application of analytical models analytical models are agnostic to internal system hydrodynamics and pm separation as a function of detailed system geometrics internal or external hazen s semi empirical model notwithstanding for systems with internal baffle retrofits analytical models sor pfr cstr do not provide guidance for improving system pm separation krebs 1995 furthermore an accurate clarification model is critical for design of internal and external geometrics fig 9 illustrates an example of sizing the safl ct system to achieve a targeted pm separation of 80 st johns river water management district 2018 in this case a flowrate and pm diameter combination w s q 1 m 2 e g siliceous pm diameter of 373 μ m and q 50 l s at the water density of 1000kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 3 10 6 m2 s is considered the nondimensional pm settling velocity hypothesized in eq 7 that is functionally represented by the dynamic similitude smg model and validated with physical model testing is shown in fig 2 eq 7 illustrates that the appropriate safl ct size is a surface area of 0 4 m2 by comparison if sor pfr and cstr model are applied the system will be oversized by 100 304 and 904 applying inaccurate models to design sizing can result in unnecessary increases in manufacturing construction and maintenance costs as well as lost opportunity land costs the oversizing effects of analytical models compared to eq 7 are a function of the pm separation requirement in this example 80 as the pm separation requirement increases the oversizing effects are magnified except for the sor model examining oversizing effects is similarly applied to the suol hs system in figs 7 and 8 analytical models which can yield reasonable capability for total pm in an integrated water systems analysis e g swmm iudms may not be accurate and suitable for guiding clarification system design optimization and regulation the psd and system operation condition i e flowrate characteristic velocity scale also influences the required accuracy in clarification modeling as illustrated in the cetv njcat case fig 4 different models overlap for a heterodisperse psd at the lower characteristic velocity scale however considering a typical total pm separation range of 40 45 for the hs at their design capacity range of 500 2000 l min m2 new jersey department of environmental protection 2013 toronto and region conservation authority 2013 different models show drastic different predictions despite the reduced sensitivity for a total pm metric therefore the clarification modeling accuracy and sensitivity are critical to the system design optimization and regulation the oversizing effect of the analytical models discussed above in the context of a pm separation requirement level fig 9 persists even for total pm separation fig s5 the oversizing effect also increases non linearly as the total pm separation requirement level increases 4 6 implication of non linearity in pm separation pm separation is predominately a non linear function as illustrated from the analyses of all the cases tested figs 2 5 and 7 this non linearity of pm separation has the following significant implications 1 as illustrated in fig 9 except for sor which is linear i e pm separation changes linearly with system geometrics pfr and cstr models are non linear exponential functions in which the gradient d a δ j increases as the pm separation δ j increases given the predominance of non linear pm separation a small change in the targeted pm separation leads to an amplified change in the corresponding system geometrics this non linearity is the cause of the amplified oversizing behavior in the analytical models as identified above 2 non linearity of pm separation has important implications for system design and optimization optimization in the design phase yields amplified beneficial returns when the optimization objective is system geometrics at a pm separation level in contrast to the common objective of increasing pm separation solving the dilemma of increasing basin spatial requirements based on impaired performance is particularly important and beneficial with respect to a frequent need to retrofit clarification applications basins in conventional retrofits increasing surface area and volume the land use lost opportunity cost of a basin is a major economic consideration common examples include stormwater clarification systems above or below grade in highly urbanized areas where infrastructure adjacency and growth results in significant economic constraints for basin expansion the alternative is internal basin retrofits such as with permeable baffles that can improve clarification without basin expansion li et al 2021c for which analytical models are agnostic 3 the non linearity in pm separation fig 9 demonstrates that as pm separation or pm separation requirement increases enlarging system dimensions becomes increasingly less effective and less economical for increasing pm separation howard et al 2012 the required system geometrics lost land use opportunity costs and construction cost increase exponentially as the pm separation requirement increases for example from 80 to 90 therefore achieving and maintaining strong scalability e g pm separation continues to linearly increase as the system enlarges in the system design is important for the cost effective pm separation by clarification as shown in fig 9 a clarification system design can show weak scalability as illustrated by the cstr model in such cases optimizing design and improving system pm separation modeling through eq 7 as an example can offer improved economics as compared to increasing the dimensions of the system based on a model of weaker scalability 4 consideration of non linearity can extend to larger clarification systems system design optimization can be particularly critical and effective for the large depth length ratio clarification systems such as stormwater basins in which the system design can also be prone to weak scaling this is suggested by comparing saflt ct kit rc and apf cases as the system length depth ratio increases pm separation characteristics tend to shift from the eq 7 basis stronger scaling to the cstr weaker scaling the apf case further illustrates that the cstr overpredicts the total pm separation therefore the pm separation characteristics in the apf system is conjectured to have even weaker scaling than simulated with the cstr model as a result of this weakened scalability pm separation in a large length depth ratio clarification system can be insensitive to the system dimension adjustments negating the cost effectiveness more research is needed to verify this hypothesis 4 7 challenges in system design another insight from this investigation is that the many existing commercial hs systems do not outperform plain cylinder tanks the saft ct as illustrated in fig 4 this finding is also in line with the physical modeling results of boogaard et al 2017 in which the commercial hs systems show pm separation characteristics similar to the sor model this result is unexpected and contradicts the previous studies that advocate and suggest that the commercial hs systems process unique flow hydrodynamics e g swirling vortex etc that promote pm separation the design and optimization of an hs systems can be a challenging task as shown in fig 10 les reveals the safl ct system undergoes complex flow configurations and turbulence structures despite the simple system geometry the multiphase turbulent flow studies reveal that these turbulent flow structures play critical roles in the pm transport and fate in the system however there are few studies that elucidate the significance of these turbulent flow structures on pm separation in clarification systems the complexity of these turbulence flow structures e g strong streamline curvature curved boundary layer impinging jet secondary flow of prandtl s first kind in the system substantially exceeds the analysis capability of analytical models and can even challenge the robustness for rans based cfd design models li and sansalone 2021 further research is needed to investigate the turbulent flow structure in these clarification systems and benchmark the rans based model with physical modeling or high fidelity simulation les or dns further research should also elucidate the pm resuspension and souring process in clarification system such fundamental investigations can potentially illuminate the pm separation dynamics in the safl ct systems stormwater basins unit operations and processes and better guide the design of non proprietary and commercial clarification systems 5 conclusions the predictive capabilities of common analytical models of sor pfr and cstr are investigated under steady and unsteady loading conditions over a range of common clarification systems represented by tanks hydrodynamic separators hs rectangular clarifiers and stormwater clarification basins the predictions of analytical models are compared with the results of controlled laboratory full scale physical modeling field monitoring and high fidelity les simulations dimensional analysis for a dilute pm fluid multiphase system is conducted to develop a generalized and physically interpretable theory for modeling of pm separation by unit operations through the hypothesis of eq 7 and dynamic similitude a modified gamma model smg is proposed and tested the non linearity of the pm separation modeling profiles is shown to have critical implications for clarification system design and optimization the results of this study yield the following conclusions analytical models are generally not accurate for predicting pm separation hypothesis 1 objective 2 depending on the system the analytical models deviate from the physical modeling and les simulation results by 30 to 50 for pm separation δ j objective 3 pfr and cstr are also not robust to represent the limits of pm separation in a non idealized clarification as shown in fig 2 however these modeling errors in pm separation are masked when applying a total pm separation δ t o t a l metric on a mass basis e g suspended sediment concentration ssc of a heterodisperse psd with an apparent error of less than 20 furthermore an inaccurate pm separation model can exhibit some level of apparent predictive capability for ssc under the influence of unsteady loadings and a coarse heterodisperse psd the accuracy of clarification modeling is critical for the design optimization regulation maintenance and management of the clarification systems hypothesis 1 this in part is because of the non linearity of the pm separation small changes in pm separation can translate to amplified changes in the designed system geometrics applying inaccurate analytical models can significantly oversize the system by as much as 904 as illustrated in fig 9 objective 4 this non linearity of pm separation further suggests that the clarification system s optimization receives magnified beneficial returns when the optimization goal is to reduce system dimension for a fixed level of performance as opposed to the goal of enhancing system performance the non linearity of pm separation also emphasizes the importance of system design scalability for cost effective pm separation by clarification despite assumptions of the analytical models the models did produce a level of predictive capability given the complex flow hydrodynamics irrespective of a coarse heterodisperse psd metric that masks model discrepancies the existing literature does not explicate this level of predictive capability the dynamic similitude in this study potentially explains this observed predictive capabilities of analytical models the dynamic similitude also provides a unique theoretical basis for interpreting these analytical models the analytical models can be perceived as a form of the dynamic similarity model because of the similar features in the mathematical expression this unique perspective gives a physical explanation for the analytical models calibration in the literature on a case by case basis the dynamic similitude however indicates a calibrated analytical model remains constrained by geometry similitude dynamic similitude is a robust alternative for modeling system pm separation hypothesis 2 the dynamic similarity model presented does not require any hypothetical assumptions as compared to the common models in addition the working principle of the dynamic similarity model has a physical basis and the generalizability is well delineated by the geometric similitude leveraging unique characteristics of turbulence flow i e dominate role of reynolds flux in mixing and reynolds number invariance pm separation of a dilute multiphase system can be distilled to a function of nondimensional pm settling velocity function eq 7 as a reasonable simplification of the more general dimensionless groups eq 6 for clarification systems with geometric similitude as illustrated in fig 2 a dynamic similitude model once trained with the physical model or cfd simulations can be applied to predict the pm and total pm separation for any given hydraulic loading and pm granulometry psd density hypothesis 3 this critical benefit of dynamic similitude model can significantly simplify and reduce the effort and cost associated with physical modeling or cfd simulations of clarification systems for clarification whether a psd is considered as coarse or fine must be based on both the mass fraction distribution of pm diameters and also the flow characteristic velocity scale as indicated by eq 7 commercial hs systems do not demonstrate a more cost effective design than the safl ct systems plain cylinder tanks for pm separation the high fidelity les simulation reveals complex turbulent flow structures in such systems these results indicate the challenge to optimize the system design for pm separation in such small footprint systems that find application in constrained area land use conditions such as in densely populated urban areas of significant existing infrastructure future research should investigate the role of turbulent flow in the pm separation process and develop analysis tools that allow for more accurate design evaluation and optimization of clarification systems supplemental materials figs s1 s9 and tables s1 s3

16177,antibiotic resistance in the environment mostly mediated by antibiotic resistance genes args has posed a threat to ecological and human health contamination of surface water and groundwater with args has become a serious environmental concern however the distinctions and similarities across arg profiles the various ecological processes associated with args the driving mechanisms for arg profiles in surface water and groundwater and how they respond to land use and seasonal variation remain unknown to tackle these issues the contamination of args in surface water and groundwater in central china was investigated using metagenomic technology the results indicated that seasonal changes in arg abundance and diversity were inconsistent across surface water and groundwater and that the relationship between args in surface water and groundwater was stronger during the rainy season land use had a greater effect on args in surface water than in groundwater and was stronger during the dry season than during the rainy season more interestingly the ideal buffer zones with the greatest impact of land use on the args of surface water and groundwater had distinct radii 1500 m for both dry and rainy seasons in surface water and 1000 m for dry season and 500 m for rainy season in groundwater furthermore stochastic mechanisms mediated by mobile gene elements mges contribute significantly more to arg assemblages than deterministic processes particularly in groundwater furthermore our results also showed that arg enrichment in microbial communities was host dependent and the risk of args in groundwater was greater both during the rainy season and dry season in conclusion the findings have improved our understanding of the relationship and driving mechanisms of args in surface and ground water as well as their responses to land use and seasonal variation which may be beneficial for limiting arg pollution in a watershed with high levels of anthropogenic activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistome ecological process groundwater land use metagenomic 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used in treating bacterial diseases and have made great contributions to human and animal health zou et al 2021 however due to the widespread use and abuse of antibiotics in human medical treatment aquaculture and animal husbandry they are presently widely existed in the environment and induced antibiotic resistance genes args which have become a globally recognized health problem in the 21st century world health 2015 yin et al 2021 seeking a solution for the problem of antibiotic resistance is an urgent task at present and even in the future globally surface water and groundwater represent one of the most valuable resources on our unique blue planet these two water environments have been considered hot spots for arg contamination mainly because of the effects of anthropogenic activities compared with groundwater surface water is easier to be observed and sampled therefore a large number of literatures have reported the occurrence and pollution of args in surface water dang et al 2020 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in fact equally important as surface water groundwater as a significant part of the hydrological cycle is frequently exchanged with surface water and plays a critical role in maintaining the biogeochemical processes and biodiversity on earth liu et al 2021c more importantly approximately one third of people rely on groundwater as their crucial drinking water source worldwide sophocleous 2002 however at present although previous studies have reported the pollution of args in groundwater these studies have mainly reported the arg profiles in groundwater under or near specific pollution sources e g municipal solid waste landfill leaking sewers and livestock facilities chen et al 2017 gallert et al 2005 koike et al 2007 the propagation and diffusion mechanism of args in groundwater is still largely unknown especially compared within surface waters due to the hydrological connectivity of surface water and groundwater the linkage of arg profiles in these two water environments should exist however the current knowledge still lacks systematic insight into args in these two water environments and their connection is still unknown especially in a relatively large geographical area this research gap is not conducive to reveal and solve the pollution of args in water environment systematically current knowledge has proved that args in water environment is closely related to human activities to a great extent liu et al 2018 pruden et al 2012 land use as a systemic reflection of human activities in space is a key factor that affects watershed water environment and has been proved to be responsible for shaping the profile of args peng et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b previous studies have reported that the increment in urbanization level may increase arg diversity and abundance and agricultural runoff could accelerate the arg dissemination from cultivated land to aquatic environments peng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c however previous studies only focused on the impact of specific land use types on args in surface water and studies on the impacts of different land use types on args in surface groundwater and the scale effects are still lacking args usually exist in the microbial community and the arg profile is largely affected by microbial community structure wang et al 2020 although previous studies have confirmed that stochastic and deterministic processes which are two important opposing approaches that are closely related to each other affected microbial community assembly hassell et al 2019 mo et al 2018 sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 the assembly of arg profile remains a challenge fang et al 2019 guo et al 2018 understanding the ecological processes and mechanisms of arg profile can help design specific strategies to control args in the water environment peng et al 2020 recently several studies have identified the assembly process of args in surface water and revealed the deterministic or stochastic processes of arg assembly chen et al 2021 hou et al 2021 peng et al 2020 despite the hydrological connectivity between groundwater and surface water the environment in groundwater including water retention residence time human disturbance dissolved oxygen and light conditions significantly differ with surface water stegen et al 2016 however whether the ecological processes and formation mechanisms of arg profiles between surface water and groundwater have similarities and differences and how they respond to different external disturbances such as land use and seasonal changes remain unclear therefore in the present study we intend to take the honghu lake watershed in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in china as the research model to attempt to answer questions about the characterization and driving mechanisms of args in surface groundwater and their responses to land use and seasonal variation honghu lake watershed was selected as the research model because this watershed is a typical alluvial plain with abundant surface water and groundwater resources and the shallow groundwater and surface water in this watershed has strong hydrogeological interaction in addition the alluvial plain has been an area of intensive human activities that shaped a variety of land use patterns worldwide since ancient times the specific objectives are presented as follows 1 to provide a relatively integral characterization and linkage of args in surface water and groundwater during different seasons 2 to determine the ecological processes of arg profiles and how they respond to land use and seasonal variation in surface and ground water and 3 to identify the difference of arg host between surface water and groundwater and assess the risk of args these results could provide the global arg profiles of surface water and groundwater in plains with dense anthropogenic activity and reveal the mechanism of arg formation to protect the watershed ecosystems and human health better 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the honghu lake watershed area 1 2 104 km2 111 95 114 08 e 29 43 31 03 n is

microbial community structure between surface water and groundwater fig 2c for example the relative abundance of uc actinobacteria uc alphaproteobacteria and cyanobium is relatively high in surface water whereas caulobacter deinococcus and massilia were the genera with high relative abundance in groundwater fig 2a and b in addition nmds analysis showed obvious differences in microbial community between dry season and rainy season in surface water or groundwater fig 2d although there was obvious difference of microbial community in surface water and groundwater 150 genera 56 2 shared in surface water and groundwater fig s2 in addition procrustes test also showed that there was a significant correlation of bacterial community between surface water and groundwater in the rainy season p 0 05 table s2 3 2 arg spatiotemporal variation and linkage between surface water and groundwater spatiotemporal variation of args in surface water and groundwater a total of 23 arg types and 309 arg subtypes were detected in surface water and groundwater with the average abundance of 256 3 tpm ranging from 10 9 to 1262 4 tpm fig 3 a and b among them 172 arg subtypes shared in surface water and groundwater accounting for 55 7 of the total arg subtypes fig 3c multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin resistance genes were presented with the highest abundance in all samples accounting for 62 and 17 of the total arg abundance respectively fig 3a and b in terms of arg subtypes baca 16 had the highest relative abundance followed by mexk 8 mexf 8 rpob2 7 and mext 5 fig s3 arg profiles varied between dry season and rainy season for surface water and groundwater fig 3d g for surface water although no significant difference of the abundance of args were observed between rainy season and dry season the simpson index of args was significantly higher in the rainy season than that in the dry season p 0 05 fig 3d and e in addition the abundance of the top three args e g multidrug resistance genes bacitracin resistance genes and rifamycin resistance genes still varied substantially with the seasons fig s4a for groundwater the abundance of args in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the rainy season p 0 05 whereas no significant difference in the simpson index of args was noted between rainy season and dry seasons fig 3d and e s3b in addition the abundance and compositions of args in surface water and groundwater showed differences fig 3d and e in the dry season the abundance and simpson index of groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water fig 3d and e p 0 05 whereas no significant difference was observed during the rainy season the linkage of args in surface water and groundwater although surface water and groundwater have significant differences in args non neglected linkages with regard to arg profiles exist between surface water and groundwater venn diagrams showed the number of arg subtypes shared between surface water and groundwater in different seasons fig 4 a and b in the dry season 94 args accounted for 39 8 of the total args shared between surface water and groundwater while the number of shared genes during the rainy season increased to 138 55 4 fig 4a and b furthermore a significant positive correlation was found in the abundance of several args including rpob2 sul1 arna opmh between surface water and groundwater p 0 05 fig 4c f 3 3 formation mechanism and ecological process of arg profiles scale effects and seasonal differences of land use on args the rda results showed that the extent and scale of the influence of land use on the profiles of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent fig 5 in surface water land use had the highest explanation rate for the arg profiles in the 1500 m buffer zone during the dry 54 and rainy seasons 33 while seasonal differences are observed on groundwater fig 5a and b in the dry season the interpretation rate of land use on arg profiles was the highest within the buffer zone of 1000 m whereas the buffer zone was 500 m in the rainy season fig 5b the effect of land use on args was stronger in the dry season for the surface water and groundwater in addition the impact of land use on the args of surface water were higher than that of groundwater to obtain the optimal analysis results we selected land use parameters in the buffer zone with the highest influence on args for subsequent analysis coupling effects of land use physiochemical factors mges and microbial community on args pls pma were applied to further explore how environmental factors e g land use and physiochemical factors mges and microbial community affect the profiles of args fig 6 our results indicated that mges had the highest direct effect on arg profiles in surface water and groundwater and the total effects were also at a high level fig 6 however the total effect of microbial community on args was the highest in surface water but lower in groundwater fig 6 in surface water the physiochemical factors showed a relatively low and positive direct effect on args but had high positive indirect impacts on the args fig 6b and d compared with surface water physiochemical factors had lower negative total effects on args in groundwater fig 6b and d in addition the latent variable physicochemical factors had more load factors in surface water than that in groundwater fig 6a and c in surface water the latent variable physiochemical factors had a negative load factor with ph and do and had a positive load factor with tn tp nh4 n spcond and antibiotics fig 6a in groundwater the latent variable physiochemical factors had a negative load factor with nh4 n and had a positive load factor with ph wt and turbidity fig 6c land use mainly affects args through indirect effects fig 6b and d the latent variable land use had positive load factors with cultivated land surface water and residence surface water and groundwater and had a negative load factor with pond groundwater fig 6a and c ecological processes of the arg assembly null model approach was used to evaluate the ecological process of arg assemblage in surface water the contribution of stochastic processes to the assembly of args in the rainy season 67 was significantly higher than that in the dry season 57 fig 7 compared with surface water the contributions of stochastic processes were significantly increased to 78 during the dry season and 79 during the rainy season in groundwater fig 7 however no significant difference was observed in the contribution of stochastic processes between dry season and rainy season on the arg assemblage in groundwater fig 7 these results indicated that the stochastic process dominated the assembly of arg profiles in surface water and groundwater 3 4 bacterial host and the antibiotic resistome risk of args the contigs carrying args were assigned to genus to investigate the relationship between microbes and args results showed that the highest proportion of microbe carrying args in total microbial community in groundwater during the dry season was 64 followed by surface water during the dry season 58 surface water during the rainy season 55 and groundwater during the rainy season 54 fig 8 a in terms of the genera carrying args pseudomonas 46 and acinetobacter 16 were the two genera carrying the most args in surface water and groundwater fig 8a in terms of the types of args carried by the host microbe the args carried by microbe were selective and multi drug resistance genes are the most carried genes by microbe followed by bacitracin triclosan rifamycin and peptide fig 8b and c however the types of args carried by the same microbe in surface water and groundwater are similar especially pseudomonas and acinetobacter the two host bacteria with the highest proportion fig 8b and c in addition many of the host bacteria that carry args were human pathogens and args on mges carried by human bacterial pathogens indicate the highest risk levels martínez et al 2015 han et al 2022 therefore we analyzed the co occurrence of args mges and human pathogenic bacteria based on the contigs to evaluate the potential resistome risk in surface water and groundwater oh et al 2018 according to the database of pathogenic bacteria provided by previous research li et al 2015 69 pathogens that carried args were identified in this study and among them acinetobacter johnsonii pseudomonas alcaligenes and pseudomonas putida were the top most prevalent bacterial pathogens in surface water and groundwater in addition the results showed that the antibiotic resistome risk in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the rainy season in surface water p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in groundwater between the dry season and the rainy season fig 8d moreover the resistome risk scores were also significantly higher in groundwater p 0 05 fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 season affects the distribution and linkage of args in surface water and groundwater in this study we first provided a relatively integral characterization of antibiotic resistome in surface water and groundwater during the dry season and rainy season via metagenomic technology and args were diverse and prevalent in the surface water and groundwater multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin genes are common in freshwater ecosystems because of the two args with the highest abundance which may imply that the prevalence of multiple efflux pumps in prokaryotes is more facilitated for bacteria to exist in diverse environments although the presence of efflux pump genes does not imply the necessary expression of multidrug resistance chen et al 2019 peng et al 2020 piddock 2006 in addition due to the widespread use of antibiotics many kinds of antibiotics can be found in the aquatic environment liu et al 2021c multidrug resistance genes can develop resistance to many different types of antibiotics and can be driven by other biochemical compounds such as heavy metals biocides detergents and organic solvents peng et al 2020 among bacitracin resistance genes baca was the main subtype detected in the surface water and groundwater and has been detected in various aquatic environments with high relative abundance gao et al 2018 liu et al 2021a the prevalence of bacitracin resistance genes was probably due to the fact that the baca gene is bacterial intrinsic and its homologues can be found in 153 genera hu et al 2013 the change in the args in surface water and groundwater was not consistent in season suggesting that the compositions of widespread args could be regulated by season in surface water args are more diverse during the rainy season possibly because high temperature can promote the change in microbial community during the rainy season thereby increasing the diversity of intracellular args zhang et al 2021d zheng et al 2018 in addition rain events also cause nutrients microbes and args from intense agricultural or anthropogenic activities to enter the surface water with runoff in watershed cesare et al 2017 however the abundance of some resistance genes e g bacitracin resistance genes in dry season was significantly higher than that in rainy season probably due to the higher dosage of antibiotics in winter as included in our previous study table s1 liu et al 2021c by contrast the abundance of args in groundwater is higher during the dry season because of the following reasons first the temperature change in groundwater 16 5 c in dry season vs 22 9 c in rainy season is smaller than that in surface water 9 1 c in dry season vs 29 0 c in rainy season thus the influence of temperature change on args by microbe is relatively low second the longer water retention time in dry season will exacerbate the enrichment of antibiotic resistance bacterial and args czekalski et al 2015 dang et al 2020 in addition a large amount of surface water input into groundwater may dilute and affect the abundance of args in groundwater during the rainy season interestingly we found that the abundance and diversity of args in surface water and groundwater were not exactly consistent with antibiotic concentration suggesting that the formation of args were probably influenced by other factors moreover the connection between surface water and groundwater with regard to args should not be ignored our results showed that approximately 40 55 of args appeared simultaneously in surface water and groundwater meanwhile regression analysis found that some arg subtypes were significantly positively correlated in surface water and groundwater indicating the non negligible relationship of args between surface water and groundwater on the one hand the significant difference in args between surface water and groundwater only occurred in the dry season but not in the rainy season this means that the rainy season promoted the spread and dispersal of args between surface water and groundwater this phenomenon probably results from the fact that stable and different environment in dry season were more likely to shape various arg profiles our results also show that environmental factors e g ph antibiotics and spcond are important factors that affect the existence of args and these environmental factors were significantly different between surface water and groundwater fig s5 on the other hand the higher proportion of args shared in rainy season may indicate that different hydrological conditions caused by season may also affect the distribution of args in surface water and groundwater in the rainy season the runoff and hydrological connectivity between surface water and groundwater was stronger and these higher proportion of shared args provided evidence of an accompanying increased potential for args to transfer to each other in surface water and ground water although the linkage between surface water and groundwater has been proved through previous studies of hydrochemistry and microbes liu et al 2021c wu et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the study of args between surface water and groundwater in watershed is relatively lacking considering the high potential of interaction between shallow groundwater and surface water in honghu lake watershed our study provided evidence that args of groundwater are probably closely related to surface water filtration 4 2 effects of land use and buffer zone scales on the arg profiles land use is the spatial reflection of anthropogenic activities and an important human made driving force that affects the change in the physicochemical parameters in watersheds peng et al 2020 the effect of land use on the pattern of antibiotic resistance is an urgent issue of public concern and is also one of the keys to solve the problem of arg contaminations in the aquatic environment of watershed our results show that although the direct effects of land use on args were not strong it indirectly affected the distribution of args by affecting physicochemical parameters thereby supporting that land use structure plays a critical role in selecting different pollution compositions impacting the watershed aquatic environment amos et al 2015 our previous studies have also proved that land use has a strong impact on the physicochemical parameters of surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021c zhang et al 2021 further physicochemical parameters including temperature nutrients do and salinity may influence bacterial growth and proliferation thereby directly or indirectly affecting the distribution and abundance of resistance genes wang et al 2020 in terms of land use types residence and cultivated land represent intensive anthropogenic activities which means more contamination were produced in this area generally the use of antibiotics for medical treatment and animal production was relatively high in residence wastewater that contains antibiotics and their metabolites as well as various pollutants enters surface water or seeps into groundwater thereby altering the arg profiles in the aquatic environment especially in high density residential areas amos et al 2015 martínez et al 2015 suzuki et al 2017 agriculture as a field with frequent human activities produces serious non point source pollution farming and fertilization consume numerous fertilizers thereby bringing large amounts of nutrients into surface waters through runoff zhang et al 2021 notably rice is the main crop in the honghu lake watershed and the applied fertilizer can easily reach surface water via runoff in this watershed thereby negatively affecting water quality zhang et al 2021 therefore for cultivated land agricultural activities may affect the growth and proliferation of microbe by increasing the concentration of nutrients in water and then influence the resistance genes in water in addition the possible application of organic fertilizer in farmland is an important reason for the enrichment of args in farmland soil zhang et al 2021 the args absorbed by these soil particles will enter the aquatic environment with runoff chen and xia 2017 moreover the effect of land use on the args of surface water were higher than that in groundwater this phenomenon may be due to the fact that surface water directly receives pollutants from different land use types whereas the pollution load was affected after these pollutants were transported into the groundwater thereby weakening the influence of land use on args of groundwater similar to the effects of land use on nutrients in surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021c zhang et al 2021 the effects of land use on args also have spatiotemporal differences land use act as a better explained arg profile during the dry season rather than the rainy season probably because physicochemical parameter such as nutrients are important factors that land use indirectly affects args while physicochemical parameters are easily affected by the seasons in the dry season precipitation and runoff are relatively low and the concentration of most pollutants and nutrients were generally higher however during the rainy season on the one hand precipitation may dilute the nutrients in the aquatic environment on the other hand the stronger self purification capacity of the water and the growth of algae and plants will reduce the nutrients in surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021b in addition the dilution and mixing effects of stronger precipitation and run off may also weaken the impact of land use on args in the aquatic environment during the rainy season overall the strong hydrological activities in the rainy season are not conducive to water retention which may weaken the impact of land use on arg profiles more importantly we explored the scale effects where land use has the strongest impact on surface and ground water in different seasons understanding the influences of land use pattern on watershed water ecology at different spatial scales is of great significance for rational land use planning and effective watershed protection and management strategies dai et al 2017 the results showed that the scale of the influence of land use on the profiles of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent for surface water the optimal buffer zone occurred in the radii of 1500 m in the dry season and rainy season however for groundwater the optimal buffer zone in dry season and rainy season occurred in the radii of 1000 and 500 m respectively therefore land use management planning and strategies for land use must consider the optimal buffer zone in other words the concept of minimum acceptable width should be considered in the watershed protection to obtain ideal ecological benefits at the lowest cost via the appropriate width our results can provide a reference for land management for ecological protection in similar geographical and climatic watershed however the scale of the impact of land use on arg profiles is likely to be affected by topographic attributes and hydrological processes of watersheds hence the problem of land use scale for different watershed needs further discussion 4 3 driving factors and ecological mechanism of arg profiles results of pls pma args profiles in surface water and groundwater are determined by complex factors e g mges microbial community physicochemical parameters and land use and mges were the main driving factors of arg profiles mges mainly affect the distribution of arg through horizontal gene transfer hgt which is the main mechanism of arg transmission and as one of the carriers of args genetic linkage and co selection between mges may promote the transmission of args he et al 2016 hu et al 2016 peng et al 2020 li et al 2020 notably the direct effect of microbial community on args was higher in surface water while microbe had a very weak direct effect on args in groundwater fig 6b and d in surface water microbe acquire resistance genes under the selective pressure of antibiotics and the proliferation and succession of microbe will affect the abundance of args wang et al 2020 although previous studies have shown that bacteria were one of the main forces in args profiles in antibiotic rich environments the selective forces of driving args profiles varied greatly in different aquatic environments in groundwater bacterial community was not the key driver of arg profiles while mges and environmental factors play more important roles as similar results were also found in studies of args in urban ponds hou et al 2021 in our study the results revealed that stochastic processes mainly driven the assembly of arg both in surface water and groundwater fig 7 however compared with groundwater the deterministic process has a stronger effect on arg assembly in surface water which is consistent with the results of pls pma that arg profiles of surface water and were more strongly influenced by environmental filters fig 6 this phenomenon was probably due to the fact that compared with surface water groundwater is less directly affected by anthropogenic activities and better hydrological connectivity leads to a weaker environmental gradient of groundwater in this watershed in addition hgt with stochastic nature caused by mges may be the main contributing factor to the stochastic processes in aquatic ecosystem hou et al 2021 this result was consistent with previous studies suggesting that more homogeneous environmental conditions seem to favor stochastic processes logares et al 2013 sloan et al 2006 peng et al 2020 also reported that stochastic processes dominated the assembly of arg profiles under weak environmental gradients in the upstream and midstream at the watershed scale while environmental pressures caused by strong urbanization in the downstream turned the assembly mechanism of arg profiles into a deterministic process in addition for surface water the higher stochastic processes in rainy season may be due to more frequent hydraulic exchange in rainy season which increases the possibility of free diffusion of args in the whole watershed 4 4 resistance risk and control countermeasures our findings indicate that not only resistance genes but also the microbial community structure altered between surface and ground water the variation in the structure of microbial communities between surface and ground water may be influenced by environmental parameters such as temperature do nutrient concentration ph and turbidity likewise previous research has demonstrated that a neutral ph and constant water temperature are more beneficial to the microbe s proliferation pinto and nano 2015 additionally we evaluated the relationship between the microbial ecology and args args are transferred and enriched in microbial communities on a host specific basis most likely due to the fact that various bacteria have distinct dispersal barriers and the ability to develop inactive latent stages chen et al 2019 bengtsson palme 2018 truth be told args are found in a variety of habitats including extreme settings such as permafrost martínez et al 2015 previous research has established that antibiotic resistant genes are widespread in bacteria and play critical biological roles zhang et al 2021 however only a small proportion of these genes represent a harm to human health fitzpatrick and walsh 2016 making quantitative assessment of the risk of args to human health the most fundamental and crucial stage in global resistance gene management we focus on the harm to human health posed by viruses containing args in our study the hosts identified as pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the most abundant and some of their species were serious human diseases pathogenic bacteria that carry args can also pose significant concerns to human health and clinical therapy tang et al 2021 in addition the results of resistome risk score based on args mges and hbps showed that the risks of args in groundwater were higher both during the dry season and rainy season because groundwater is widely used in this region for municipal water supply irrigated agriculture aquaculture and other activities as well as serving as a significant source of drinking water local populations are frequently exposed to args found in the aquatic environment in this situation greater attention should be paid to the health hazards posed by resistance genes it s worth emphasizing that the likelihood of drug resistance genes affecting human health is influenced by a variety of factors including host pathogenicity genetic background dissemination potential and environmental factors thus in the future risk assessment of resistance genes and resistance genes to form disseminate pathogenic and related aspects would require additional attention 5 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive profile of the characteristics and ecological processes underlying arg profiles in surface and ground water as well as their responses to land use and seasonal changes and assessed the risk of args in a watershed with a high concentration of anthropogenic activities our findings indicated that while multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin genes were the most prevalent seasonal variations in the abundance and diversity of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent and that the link between args in surface water and groundwater was stronger during the rainy season due to hydrological activities land use had a greater impact on args in surface water than on groundwater via indirect pathways such as physicochemical characteristics microbial community composition and mges and was greater in the dry season than in the rainy season more crucially the ideal buffer zones were identified in areas where land use has the greatest impact the ideal buffer zone for surface water occurred within radii of 1500 m during the dry and rainy seasons whereas the optimal buffer zone for groundwater happened between radii of 1000 and 500 m during the dry and rainy seasons respectively stochastic processes mediated by mges such as hgt contribute significantly more to arg assemblages than deterministic processes particularly in groundwater pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the two genera with the highest concentrations of args in both surface and ground water additionally arg enrichment in microbial communities is host dependent and the potential risk of pathogens harboring args on mges in groundwater was greater both during the dry season and rainy season in general our study provided a thorough understanding of the effects of seasons and land use on the contamination and ecological processes of args in surface water and groundwater which could assist in developing effective management strategies for reducing args in a watershed with high anthropogenic activity our results represent the response characteristics of args to land use in shallow groundwater with strong anthropogenic disturbance however further works need to be explored in watersheds with different

16177,antibiotic resistance in the environment mostly mediated by antibiotic resistance genes args has posed a threat to ecological and human health contamination of surface water and groundwater with args has become a serious environmental concern however the distinctions and similarities across arg profiles the various ecological processes associated with args the driving mechanisms for arg profiles in surface water and groundwater and how they respond to land use and seasonal variation remain unknown to tackle these issues the contamination of args in surface water and groundwater in central china was investigated using metagenomic technology the results indicated that seasonal changes in arg abundance and diversity were inconsistent across surface water and groundwater and that the relationship between args in surface water and groundwater was stronger during the rainy season land use had a greater effect on args in surface water than in groundwater and was stronger during the dry season than during the rainy season more interestingly the ideal buffer zones with the greatest impact of land use on the args of surface water and groundwater had distinct radii 1500 m for both dry and rainy seasons in surface water and 1000 m for dry season and 500 m for rainy season in groundwater furthermore stochastic mechanisms mediated by mobile gene elements mges contribute significantly more to arg assemblages than deterministic processes particularly in groundwater furthermore our results also showed that arg enrichment in microbial communities was host dependent and the risk of args in groundwater was greater both during the rainy season and dry season in conclusion the findings have improved our understanding of the relationship and driving mechanisms of args in surface and ground water as well as their responses to land use and seasonal variation which may be beneficial for limiting arg pollution in a watershed with high levels of anthropogenic activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistome ecological process groundwater land use metagenomic 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used in treating bacterial diseases and have made great contributions to human and animal health zou et al 2021 however due to the widespread use and abuse of antibiotics in human medical treatment aquaculture and animal husbandry they are presently widely existed in the environment and induced antibiotic resistance genes args which have become a globally recognized health problem in the 21st century world health 2015 yin et al 2021 seeking a solution for the problem of antibiotic resistance is an urgent task at present and even in the future globally surface water and groundwater represent one of the most valuable resources on our unique blue planet these two water environments have been considered hot spots for arg contamination mainly because of the effects of anthropogenic activities compared with groundwater surface water is easier to be observed and sampled therefore a large number of literatures have reported the occurrence and pollution of args in surface water dang et al 2020 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in fact equally important as surface water groundwater as a significant part of the hydrological cycle is frequently exchanged with surface water and plays a critical role in maintaining the biogeochemical processes and biodiversity on earth liu et al 2021c more importantly approximately one third of people rely on groundwater as their crucial drinking water source worldwide sophocleous 2002 however at present although previous studies have reported the pollution of args in groundwater these studies have mainly reported the arg profiles in groundwater under or near specific pollution sources e g municipal solid waste landfill leaking sewers and livestock facilities chen et al 2017 gallert et al 2005 koike et al 2007 the propagation and diffusion mechanism of args in groundwater is still largely unknown especially compared within surface waters due to the hydrological connectivity of surface water and groundwater the linkage of arg profiles in these two water environments should exist however the current knowledge still lacks systematic insight into args in these two water environments and their connection is still unknown especially in a relatively large geographical area this research gap is not conducive to reveal and solve the pollution of args in water environment systematically current knowledge has proved that args in water environment is closely related to human activities to a great extent liu et al 2018 pruden et al 2012 land use as a systemic reflection of human activities in space is a key factor that affects watershed water environment and has been proved to be responsible for shaping the profile of args peng et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b previous studies have reported that the increment in urbanization level may increase arg diversity and abundance and agricultural runoff could accelerate the arg dissemination from cultivated land to aquatic environments peng et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c however previous studies only focused on the impact of specific land use types on args in surface water and studies on the impacts of different land use types on args in surface groundwater and the scale effects are still lacking args usually exist in the microbial community and the arg profile is largely affected by microbial community structure wang et al 2020 although previous studies have confirmed that stochastic and deterministic processes which are two important opposing approaches that are closely related to each other affected microbial community assembly hassell et al 2019 mo et al 2018 sloan et al 2006 zhou and ning 2017 the assembly of arg profile remains a challenge fang et al 2019 guo et al 2018 understanding the ecological processes and mechanisms of arg profile can help design specific strategies to control args in the water environment peng et al 2020 recently several studies have identified the assembly process of args in surface water and revealed the deterministic or stochastic processes of arg assembly chen et al 2021 hou et al 2021 peng et al 2020 despite the hydrological connectivity between groundwater and surface water the environment in groundwater including water retention residence time human disturbance dissolved oxygen and light conditions significantly differ with surface water stegen et al 2016 however whether the ecological processes and formation mechanisms of arg profiles between surface water and groundwater have similarities and differences and how they respond to different external disturbances such as land use and seasonal changes remain unclear therefore in the present study we intend to take the honghu lake watershed in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in china as the research model to attempt to answer questions about the characterization and driving mechanisms of args in surface groundwater and their responses to land use and seasonal variation honghu lake watershed was selected as the research model because this watershed is a typical alluvial plain with abundant surface water and groundwater resources and the shallow groundwater and surface water in this watershed has strong hydrogeological interaction in addition the alluvial plain has been an area of intensive human activities that shaped a variety of land use patterns worldwide since ancient times the specific objectives are presented as follows 1 to provide a relatively integral characterization and linkage of args in surface water and groundwater during different seasons 2 to determine the ecological processes of arg profiles and how they respond to land use and seasonal variation in surface and ground water and 3 to identify the difference of arg host between surface water and groundwater and assess the risk of args these results could provide the global arg profiles of surface water and groundwater in plains with dense anthropogenic activity and reveal the mechanism of arg formation to protect the watershed ecosystems and human health better 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the honghu lake watershed area 1 2 104 km2 111 95 114 08 e 29 43 31 03 n is

the original community data generated the expected similarity eexp of null expected communities during this process community richness and the proportion of species occupancy were consistent with the observed ones chase et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 then the relative importance of stochastic processes was calculated using the following formula s t o c h a s t i c i t y 1 s o b s e e x p s o b s where sobs represents the observed similarity of the actual communities and eexp represents the average expected similarity of null expected communities zhang et al 2019 the ecological risk of args

microbial community honghu lake watershed as a typical alluvial plain is dominated by cultivated land in upstream and natural water body and pond in downstream fig 1 the proportion of cultivated land residence natural water body pond and forest were 71 32 5 32 11 41 11 23 and 0 72 respectively seasonal differences in the water quality parameters of surface water and groundwater were observed in this plain table s1 in surface water the physicochemical parameters of no3 n do spcond orp and antibiotics were significantly higher in the dry season than in the rainy season whereas water temperature ph and chl a during the dry season were significantly lower than that in the rainy season p 0 05 in groundwater only nh4 n and tp concentrations during the dry season were significantly higher than that in the rainy season whereas antibiotics during the dry season were significantly lower than that in the rainy season p 0 05 moreover no3 n nh4 n chl a ph do turbidity and antibiotics were higher in surface water than those in groundwater p 0 05 the microbial community structures of surface water and groundwater vary fig 2 at the genera level pseudomonas uc actinobacteria and limnohabitans were dominant genera in surface water accounting for 22 10 18 02 and 12 33 of the total relative abundance respectively fig 2a whereas pseudomonas 25 72 acinetobacter 11 22 and limnohabitans 6 32 were dominant in groundwater fig 2b although the dominant genera of surface water and groundwater were similar e g pseudomonas and limnohabitans differences were observed in the microbial community structure between surface water and groundwater fig 2c for example the relative abundance of uc actinobacteria uc alphaproteobacteria and cyanobium is relatively high in surface water whereas caulobacter deinococcus and massilia were the genera with high relative abundance in groundwater fig 2a and b in addition nmds analysis showed obvious differences in microbial community between dry season and rainy season in surface water or groundwater fig 2d although there was obvious difference of microbial community in surface water and groundwater 150 genera 56 2 shared in surface water and groundwater fig s2 in addition procrustes test also showed that there was a significant correlation of bacterial community between surface water and groundwater in the rainy season p 0 05 table s2 3 2 arg spatiotemporal variation and linkage between surface water and groundwater spatiotemporal variation of args in surface water and groundwater a total of 23 arg types and 309 arg subtypes were detected in surface water and groundwater with the average abundance of 256 3 tpm ranging from 10 9 to 1262 4 tpm fig 3 a and b among them 172 arg subtypes shared in surface water and groundwater accounting for 55 7 of the total arg subtypes fig 3c multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin resistance genes were presented with the highest abundance in all samples accounting for 62 and 17 of the total arg abundance respectively fig 3a and b in terms of arg subtypes baca 16 had the highest relative abundance followed by mexk 8 mexf 8 rpob2 7 and mext 5 fig s3 arg profiles varied between dry season and rainy season for surface water and groundwater fig 3d g for surface water although no significant difference of the abundance of args were observed between rainy season and dry season the simpson index of args was significantly higher in the rainy season than that in the dry season p 0 05 fig 3d and e in addition the abundance of the top three args e g multidrug resistance genes bacitracin resistance genes and rifamycin resistance genes still varied substantially with the seasons fig s4a for groundwater the abundance of args in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the rainy season p 0 05 whereas no significant difference in the simpson index of args was noted between rainy season and dry seasons fig 3d and e s3b in addition the abundance and compositions of args in surface water and groundwater showed differences fig 3d and e in the dry season the abundance and simpson index of groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water fig 3d and e p 0 05 whereas no significant difference was observed during the rainy season the linkage of args in surface water and groundwater although surface water and groundwater have significant differences in args non neglected linkages with regard to arg profiles exist between surface water and groundwater venn diagrams showed the number of arg subtypes shared between surface water and groundwater in different seasons fig 4 a and b in the dry season 94 args accounted for 39 8 of the total args shared between surface water and groundwater while the number of shared genes during the rainy season increased to 138 55 4 fig 4a and b furthermore a significant positive correlation was found in the abundance of several args including rpob2 sul1 arna opmh between surface water and groundwater p 0 05 fig 4c f 3 3 formation mechanism and ecological process of arg profiles scale effects and seasonal differences of land use on args the rda results showed that the extent and scale of the influence of land use on the profiles of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent fig 5 in surface water land use had the highest explanation rate for the arg profiles in the 1500 m buffer zone during the dry 54 and rainy seasons 33 while seasonal differences are observed on groundwater fig 5a and b in the dry season the interpretation rate of land use on arg profiles was the highest within the buffer zone of 1000 m whereas the buffer zone was 500 m in the rainy season fig 5b the effect of land use on args was stronger in the dry season for the surface water and groundwater in addition the impact of land use on the args of surface water were higher than that of groundwater to obtain the optimal analysis results we selected land use parameters in the buffer zone with the highest influence on args for subsequent analysis coupling effects of land use physiochemical factors mges and microbial community on args pls pma were applied to further explore how environmental factors e g land use and physiochemical factors mges and microbial community affect the profiles of args fig 6 our results indicated that mges had the highest direct effect on arg profiles in surface water and groundwater and the total effects were also at a high level fig 6 however the total effect of microbial community on args was the highest in surface water but lower in groundwater fig 6 in surface water the physiochemical factors showed a relatively low and positive direct effect on args but had high positive indirect impacts on the args fig 6b and d compared with surface water physiochemical factors had lower negative total effects on args in groundwater fig 6b and d in addition the latent variable physicochemical factors had more load factors in surface water than that in groundwater fig 6a and c in surface water the latent variable physiochemical factors had a negative load factor with ph and do and had a positive load factor with tn tp nh4 n spcond and antibiotics fig 6a in groundwater the latent variable physiochemical factors had a negative load factor with nh4 n and had a positive load factor with ph wt and turbidity fig 6c land use mainly affects args through indirect effects fig 6b and d the latent variable land use had positive load factors with cultivated land surface water and residence surface water and groundwater and had a negative load factor with pond groundwater fig 6a and c ecological processes of the arg assembly null model approach was used to evaluate the ecological process of arg assemblage in surface water the contribution of stochastic processes to the assembly of args in the rainy season 67 was significantly higher than that in the dry season 57 fig 7 compared with surface water the contributions of stochastic processes were significantly increased to 78 during the dry season and 79 during the rainy season in groundwater fig 7 however no significant difference was observed in the contribution of stochastic processes between dry season and rainy season on the arg assemblage in groundwater fig 7 these results indicated that the stochastic process dominated the assembly of arg profiles in surface water and groundwater 3 4 bacterial host and the antibiotic resistome risk of args the contigs carrying args were assigned to genus to investigate the relationship between microbes and args results showed that the highest proportion of microbe carrying args in total microbial community in groundwater during the dry season was 64 followed by surface water during the dry season 58 surface water during the rainy season 55 and groundwater during the rainy season 54 fig 8 a in terms of the genera carrying args pseudomonas 46 and acinetobacter 16 were the two genera carrying the most args in surface water and groundwater fig 8a in terms of the types of args carried by the host microbe the args carried by microbe were selective and multi drug resistance genes are the most carried genes by microbe followed by bacitracin triclosan rifamycin and peptide fig 8b and c however the types of args carried by the same microbe in surface water and groundwater are similar especially pseudomonas and acinetobacter the two host bacteria with the highest proportion fig 8b and c in addition many of the host bacteria that carry args were human pathogens and args on mges carried by human bacterial pathogens indicate the highest risk levels martínez et al 2015 han et al 2022 therefore we analyzed the co occurrence of args mges and human pathogenic bacteria based on the contigs to evaluate the potential resistome risk in surface water and groundwater oh et al 2018 according to the database of pathogenic bacteria provided by previous research li et al 2015 69 pathogens that carried args were identified in this study and among them acinetobacter johnsonii pseudomonas alcaligenes and pseudomonas putida were the top most prevalent bacterial pathogens in surface water and groundwater in addition the results showed that the antibiotic resistome risk in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the rainy season in surface water p 0 05 while there was no significant difference in groundwater between the dry season and the rainy season fig 8d moreover the resistome risk scores were also significantly higher in groundwater p 0 05 fig 8d 4 discussion 4 1 season affects the distribution and linkage of args in surface water and groundwater in this study we first provided a relatively integral characterization of antibiotic resistome in surface water and groundwater during the dry season and rainy season via metagenomic technology and args were diverse and prevalent in the surface water and groundwater multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin genes are common in freshwater ecosystems because of the two args with the highest abundance which may imply that the prevalence of multiple efflux pumps in prokaryotes is more facilitated for bacteria to exist in diverse environments although the presence of efflux pump genes does not imply the necessary expression of multidrug resistance chen et al 2019 peng et al 2020 piddock 2006 in addition due to the widespread use of antibiotics many kinds of antibiotics can be found in the aquatic environment liu et al 2021c multidrug resistance genes can develop resistance to many different types of antibiotics and can be driven by other biochemical compounds such as heavy metals biocides detergents and organic solvents peng et al 2020 among bacitracin resistance genes baca was the main subtype detected in the surface water and groundwater and has been detected in various aquatic environments with high relative abundance gao et al 2018 liu et al 2021a the prevalence of bacitracin resistance genes was probably due to the fact that the baca gene is bacterial intrinsic and its homologues can be found in 153 genera hu et al 2013 the change in the args in surface water and groundwater was not consistent in season suggesting that the compositions of widespread args could be regulated by season in surface water args are more diverse during the rainy season possibly because high temperature can promote the change in microbial community during the rainy season thereby increasing the diversity of intracellular args zhang et al 2021d zheng et al 2018 in addition rain events also cause nutrients microbes and args from intense agricultural or anthropogenic activities to enter the surface water with runoff in watershed cesare et al 2017 however the abundance of some resistance genes e g bacitracin resistance genes in dry season was significantly higher than that in rainy season probably due to the higher dosage of antibiotics in winter as included in our previous study table s1 liu et al 2021c by contrast the abundance of args in groundwater is higher during the dry season because of the following reasons first the temperature change in groundwater 16 5 c in dry season vs 22 9 c in rainy season is smaller than that in surface water 9 1 c in dry season vs 29 0 c in rainy season thus the influence of temperature change on args by microbe is relatively low second the longer water retention time in dry season will exacerbate the enrichment of antibiotic resistance bacterial and args czekalski et al 2015 dang et al 2020 in addition a large amount of surface water input into groundwater may dilute and affect the abundance of args in groundwater during the rainy season interestingly we found that the abundance and diversity of args in surface water and groundwater were not exactly consistent with antibiotic concentration suggesting that the formation of args were probably influenced by other factors moreover the connection between surface water and groundwater with regard to args should not be ignored our results showed that approximately 40 55 of args appeared simultaneously in surface water and groundwater meanwhile regression analysis found that some arg subtypes were significantly positively correlated in surface water and groundwater indicating the non negligible relationship of args between surface water and groundwater on the one hand the significant difference in args between surface water and groundwater only occurred in the dry season but not in the rainy season this means that the rainy season promoted the spread and dispersal of args between surface water and groundwater this phenomenon probably results from the fact that stable and different environment in dry season were more likely to shape various arg profiles our results also show that environmental factors e g ph antibiotics and spcond are important factors that affect the existence of args and these environmental factors were significantly different between surface water and groundwater fig s5 on the other hand the higher proportion of args shared in rainy season may indicate that different hydrological conditions caused by season may also affect the distribution of args in surface water and groundwater in the rainy season the runoff and hydrological connectivity between surface water and groundwater was stronger and these higher proportion of shared args provided evidence of an accompanying increased potential for args to transfer to each other in surface water and ground water although the linkage between surface water and groundwater has been proved through previous studies of hydrochemistry and microbes liu et al 2021c wu et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the study of args between surface water and groundwater in watershed is relatively lacking considering the high potential of interaction between shallow groundwater and surface water in honghu lake watershed our study provided evidence that args of groundwater are probably closely related to surface water filtration 4 2 effects of land use and buffer zone scales on the arg profiles land use is the spatial reflection of anthropogenic activities and an important human made driving force that affects the change in the physicochemical parameters in watersheds peng et al 2020 the effect of land use on the pattern of antibiotic resistance is an urgent issue of public concern and is also one of the keys to solve the problem of arg contaminations in the aquatic environment of watershed our results show that although the direct effects of land use on args were not strong it indirectly affected the distribution of args by affecting physicochemical parameters thereby supporting that land use structure plays a critical role in selecting different pollution compositions impacting the watershed aquatic environment amos et al 2015 our previous studies have also proved that land use has a strong impact on the physicochemical parameters of surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021c zhang et al 2021 further physicochemical parameters including temperature nutrients do and salinity may influence bacterial growth and proliferation thereby directly or indirectly affecting the distribution and abundance of resistance genes wang et al 2020 in terms of land use types residence and cultivated land represent intensive anthropogenic activities which means more contamination were produced in this area generally the use of antibiotics for medical treatment and animal production was relatively high in residence wastewater that contains antibiotics and their metabolites as well as various pollutants enters surface water or seeps into groundwater thereby altering the arg profiles in the aquatic environment especially in high density residential areas amos et al 2015 martínez et al 2015 suzuki et al 2017 agriculture as a field with frequent human activities produces serious non point source pollution farming and fertilization consume numerous fertilizers thereby bringing large amounts of nutrients into surface waters through runoff zhang et al 2021 notably rice is the main crop in the honghu lake watershed and the applied fertilizer can easily reach surface water via runoff in this watershed thereby negatively affecting water quality zhang et al 2021 therefore for cultivated land agricultural activities may affect the growth and proliferation of microbe by increasing the concentration of nutrients in water and then influence the resistance genes in water in addition the possible application of organic fertilizer in farmland is an important reason for the enrichment of args in farmland soil zhang et al 2021 the args absorbed by these soil particles will enter the aquatic environment with runoff chen and xia 2017 moreover the effect of land use on the args of surface water were higher than that in groundwater this phenomenon may be due to the fact that surface water directly receives pollutants from different land use types whereas the pollution load was affected after these pollutants were transported into the groundwater thereby weakening the influence of land use on args of groundwater similar to the effects of land use on nutrients in surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021c zhang et al 2021 the effects of land use on args also have spatiotemporal differences land use act as a better explained arg profile during the dry season rather than the rainy season probably because physicochemical parameter such as nutrients are important factors that land use indirectly affects args while physicochemical parameters are easily affected by the seasons in the dry season precipitation and runoff are relatively low and the concentration of most pollutants and nutrients were generally higher however during the rainy season on the one hand precipitation may dilute the nutrients in the aquatic environment on the other hand the stronger self purification capacity of the water and the growth of algae and plants will reduce the nutrients in surface water and groundwater liu et al 2021b in addition the dilution and mixing effects of stronger precipitation and run off may also weaken the impact of land use on args in the aquatic environment during the rainy season overall the strong hydrological activities in the rainy season are not conducive to water retention which may weaken the impact of land use on arg profiles more importantly we explored the scale effects where land use has the strongest impact on surface and ground water in different seasons understanding the influences of land use pattern on watershed water ecology at different spatial scales is of great significance for rational land use planning and effective watershed protection and management strategies dai et al 2017 the results showed that the scale of the influence of land use on the profiles of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent for surface water the optimal buffer zone occurred in the radii of 1500 m in the dry season and rainy season however for groundwater the optimal buffer zone in dry season and rainy season occurred in the radii of 1000 and 500 m respectively therefore land use management planning and strategies for land use must consider the optimal buffer zone in other words the concept of minimum acceptable width should be considered in the watershed protection to obtain ideal ecological benefits at the lowest cost via the appropriate width our results can provide a reference for land management for ecological protection in similar geographical and climatic watershed however the scale of the impact of land use on arg profiles is likely to be affected by topographic attributes and hydrological processes of watersheds hence the problem of land use scale for different watershed needs further discussion 4 3 driving factors and ecological mechanism of arg profiles results of pls pma args profiles in surface water and groundwater are determined by complex factors e g mges microbial community physicochemical parameters and land use and mges were the main driving factors of arg profiles mges mainly affect the distribution of arg through horizontal gene transfer hgt which is the main mechanism of arg transmission and as one of the carriers of args genetic linkage and co selection between mges may promote the transmission of args he et al 2016 hu et al 2016 peng et al 2020 li et al 2020 notably the direct effect of microbial community on args was higher in surface water while microbe had a very weak direct effect on args in groundwater fig 6b and d in surface water microbe acquire resistance genes under the selective pressure of antibiotics and the proliferation and succession of microbe will affect the abundance of args wang et al 2020 although previous studies have shown that bacteria were one of the main forces in args profiles in antibiotic rich environments the selective forces of driving args profiles varied greatly in different aquatic environments in groundwater bacterial community was not the key driver of arg profiles while mges and environmental factors play more important roles as similar results were also found in studies of args in urban ponds hou et al 2021 in our study the results revealed that stochastic processes mainly driven the assembly of arg both in surface water and groundwater fig 7 however compared with groundwater the deterministic process has a stronger effect on arg assembly in surface water which is consistent with the results of pls pma that arg profiles of surface water and were more strongly influenced by environmental filters fig 6 this phenomenon was probably due to the fact that compared with surface water groundwater is less directly affected by anthropogenic activities and better hydrological connectivity leads to a weaker environmental gradient of groundwater in this watershed in addition hgt with stochastic nature caused by mges may be the main contributing factor to the stochastic processes in aquatic ecosystem hou et al 2021 this result was consistent with previous studies suggesting that more homogeneous environmental conditions seem to favor stochastic processes logares et al 2013 sloan et al 2006 peng et al 2020 also reported that stochastic processes dominated the assembly of arg profiles under weak environmental gradients in the upstream and midstream at the watershed scale while environmental pressures caused by strong urbanization in the downstream turned the assembly mechanism of arg profiles into a deterministic process in addition for surface water the higher stochastic processes in rainy season may be due to more frequent hydraulic exchange in rainy season which increases the possibility of free diffusion of args in the whole watershed 4 4 resistance risk and control countermeasures our findings indicate that not only resistance genes but also the microbial community structure altered between surface and ground water the variation in the structure of microbial communities between surface and ground water may be influenced by environmental parameters such as temperature do nutrient concentration ph and turbidity likewise previous research has demonstrated that a neutral ph and constant water temperature are more beneficial to the microbe s proliferation pinto and nano 2015 additionally we evaluated the relationship between the microbial ecology and args args are transferred and enriched in microbial communities on a host specific basis most likely due to the fact that various bacteria have distinct dispersal barriers and the ability to develop inactive latent stages chen et al 2019 bengtsson palme 2018 truth be told args are found in a variety of habitats including extreme settings such as permafrost martínez et al 2015 previous research has established that antibiotic resistant genes are widespread in bacteria and play critical biological roles zhang et al 2021 however only a small proportion of these genes represent a harm to human health fitzpatrick and walsh 2016 making quantitative assessment of the risk of args to human health the most fundamental and crucial stage in global resistance gene management we focus on the harm to human health posed by viruses containing args in our study the hosts identified as pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the most abundant and some of their species were serious human diseases pathogenic bacteria that carry args can also pose significant concerns to human health and clinical therapy tang et al 2021 in addition the results of resistome risk score based on args mges and hbps showed that the risks of args in groundwater were higher both during the dry season and rainy season because groundwater is widely used in this region for municipal water supply irrigated agriculture aquaculture and other activities as well as serving as a significant source of drinking water local populations are frequently exposed to args found in the aquatic environment in this situation greater attention should be paid to the health hazards posed by resistance genes it s worth emphasizing that the likelihood of drug resistance genes affecting human health is influenced by a variety of factors including host pathogenicity genetic background dissemination potential and environmental factors thus in the future risk assessment of resistance genes and resistance genes to form disseminate pathogenic and related aspects would require additional attention 5 conclusion this study provided a comprehensive profile of the characteristics and ecological processes underlying arg profiles in surface and ground water as well as their responses to land use and seasonal changes and assessed the risk of args in a watershed with a high concentration of anthropogenic activities our findings indicated that while multidrug resistance genes and bacitracin genes were the most prevalent seasonal variations in the abundance and diversity of args in surface water and groundwater were inconsistent and that the link between args in surface water and groundwater was stronger during the rainy season due to hydrological activities land use had a greater impact on args in surface water than on groundwater via indirect pathways such as physicochemical characteristics microbial community composition and mges and was greater in the dry season than in the rainy season more crucially the ideal buffer zones were identified in areas where land use has the greatest impact the ideal buffer zone for surface water occurred within radii of 1500 m during the dry and rainy seasons whereas the optimal buffer zone for groundwater happened between radii of 1000 and 500 m during the dry and rainy seasons respectively stochastic processes mediated by mges such as hgt contribute significantly more to arg assemblages than deterministic processes particularly in groundwater pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the two genera with the highest concentrations of args in both surface and ground water additionally arg enrichment in microbial communities is host dependent and the potential risk of pathogens harboring args on mges in groundwater was greater both during the dry season and rainy season in general our study provided a thorough understanding of the effects of seasons and land use on the contamination and ecological processes of args in surface water and groundwater which could assist in developing effective management strategies for reducing args in a watershed with high anthropogenic activity our results represent the response characteristics of args to land use in shallow groundwater with strong anthropogenic disturbance however further works need to be explored in watersheds with different

16178,bromide br a ubiquitous species in natural water is capable of reacting with sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh to form secondary reactive bromine species rbs the reaction routes can influence the degradation mechanisms and performance of these radicals for removal of target pollutants and may also form harmful bromine containing disinfection by products br dbps during subsequent chlorination in the present research the uv activated persulfate ps degradation of bisphenol a bpa was systematically examined in the presence of br results indicated that the presence of br enhanced the bpa degradation and both uv ps and uv ps br processes followed the pseudo first order kinetics at 0 0 8 mm br 0 2 mm br exerted the best enhanced effect on bpa degradation while rbs functioned as the major contributor in the presence of 0 05 0 5 mm br solution ph 6 0 8 0 barely affected the bpa degradation in the uv ps system but the introduction of br augmented the ph dependence in the uv ps br system the reaction rate constant of bpa increased decreased with increasing ps ha dosage and was affected slightly in the presence of bicarbonate and chloride according to the quantum chemical

various products such as epoxy resin polycarbonate plastics fire retardants and medical equipment sharma et al 2015 deng et al 2018 the global consumption of bpa was reported to exceed 7 million tons year and its production and consumption may continue to increase jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 owing to the widespread use and resistance to conventional water treatment processes bpa has been extensively detected in various aquatic environments with the concentrations typically raining from several ng l to several hundred µg l jiang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 li et al 2021 zorzo et al 2021 due to its high estrogenic effect the exposure to bpa can cause adverse effects on animals and humans such as prostate cancer metabolism disorder endocrine disorder reproductive dysfunction and cancer gao et al 2020 wan et al 2020 zorzo et al 2021 consequently there is an urgent need to develop effective water treatment technologies for bpa removal from contaminated water in recent years sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention on the removal of recalcitrant organic compounds in water and wastewater for its high oxidation ability sánchez montes et al 2020 wang et al 2021a compared with hydroxyl radicals oh 1 8 2 7 v so4 exhibits higher standard redox potential 2 5 3 1 v at neutral ph and higher reactivity toward certain organic pollutants cai et al 2021b generally so4 can react with various refractory organic pollutants with a rate constant of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 it more selectively oxidizes target organic contaminants through electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction addition ling et al 2017 so4 can be produced through persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms activation by various methods such as heat transition metals alkaline and ultraviolet uv irradaition sánchez montes et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 among them the activation by uv irradiation is deemed as an effective and promising method moreover the generated so4 can react with h2o and oh resulting in the production of oh wang et al 2021a bromide br naturally exists in the aquatic environment within a typical occurrence range from a few µm 6 µm to several tens of µm 52 µm in fresh water and surface water but its level can be increased up to hundreds of µm 838 µm in seawater guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a previous studies found that the presence of br significantly influenced the performance of chemical oxidation treatment as reported the presence of 0 05 10 mm br retarded the degradation of humic acid ha benzophenone benzoic acid cyclohexane carboxylic acid diethyl phthalate salbutamol and terbutaline whereas the removal of sulfamethoxazole ofloxacin and sulfonamides was accelerated in the presence of 0 1 0 8 mm br in a uv ps process guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a these phenomena are mainly due to the scavenging of so4 and oh and the formation of secondary reactive bromine species rbs e g bromine atoms br dibromide radical anions br2 and free bromine hobr et al in the presence of br lei et al 2021 wang et al 2021a br can be generated in so4 based aops through the reaction of so4 with br which further reacts with oh h2o to form broh and with br to form br2 eqs 1 4 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2021a besides br can react with broh and oh to form br2 and broh respectively eqs 5 and 6 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2021a

most of which only focused on the transformation from so4 and oh to rbs or understanding of the role of rbs on the degradation of organic compounds yang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 2021a however the degradation and transformation of certain organic compound by uv ps br process have not been comprehensively studied in particular the degradation mechanism of organic pollutant as well as the toxicity of its degradation products deserve further evaluation in a uv ps process in the presence of br quantum chemical calculation is a feasible method for exploring theoretical investigations on bimolecular reactions which can supplement or even substitute experimental research to better understand chemical degradation mechanisms tentscher et al 2019 qin et al 2020 the quantitative structure activity relationships qsar model has proven as an effective tool for calculating the toxicity of transformation products tps enabling better assessment of environmental risks gao et al 2021 in addition the formation potential of disinfection by products dbps especially bromine containing dbps br dbps should also be carefully examined over a uv ps br pre oxidation during post chlorination prior studies revealed that br could react with hypochlorous acid hocl to form hypobromous acid hobr during chlorination which reacted with nom moieties more easily than hocl zhu et al 2021 it is worth noting that hobr can react with nom and organic pollutants to generate br dbps which are generally more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs erdem et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 overall the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of br on the bpa degradation in a uv ps process 2 to evaluate effects of ps dosage br concentration solution ph humic acid ha and inorganic anions on the bpa degradation 3 to identify the role of different reactive radicals and discern the contributions of so4 oh and rbs in the uv ps process at varied br concentrations and ph conditions 4 to explore the theoretical reaction mechanisms and calculate the second order rate constants of radicals with bpa thereby proposing a plausible degradation pathway based on density functional theory dft calculation and 5 to assess the formation potential and toxic risk of br dbps by a uv ps br pre treatment during chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents

constants k were calculated using the conventional transition state theory tst text s6 li et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of bpa abatement in various systems fig 1 a showed bpa removals by uv irradiation ps only uv ps and uv ps br processes at ph 7 0 as seen the removals of bpa by uv irradiation alone and ps oxidation only were negligible within 5 min 5 similar observations have been reported previously gao et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in contrast bpa could be abated in the uv ps and uv ps br processes by 63 5 and 76 3 respectively these findings could be due to the efficient generation of active radicals such as so4 oh and rbs in addition the presence of br accelerated the bpa degradation in the uv ps process which may be explained by the high reactivities of bpa containing phenol structure with the produced rbs guo et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the bpa degradation in the uv ps and uv ps br systems followed the pseudo first order kinetics well eq 7 the fitted pseudo first order rate constant kobs of bpa by uv ps br system was found to be 0 281 min 1 which was increased by 1 35 time compared to that in the uv ps process 0 208 min 1 7 ln b p a b p a 0 k o b s t in order to identify the species of active radicals generated from the uv ps br process tert butyl alcohol tba and meoh as different radical scavengers were added to the reaction solution tba acts as an effective quencher for oh with a second order rate constant of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while meoh is regarded as the scavenger for both oh and so4 with the second order rate constants of 1 1 107 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively xie et al 2015 in addition the second order rate constants of br with tba and meoh are determined as 1 4 104 and 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reactivities of tba and meoh with other bromine radicals can be negligible lee et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 b as tba and meoh concentrations increased from 0 to 10 mm the removal efficiency of bpa in 5 min decreased from 76 3 to 67 5 and 47 7 respectively furthermore with further increasing meoh concentration to 50 mm the bpa degradation was still not completely suppressed these results indicated that so4 oh and rbs such as br hobr obr and br2 et al were all involved in the bpa degradation in the mixed uv ps br system 3 2 effects of bromide on the conversion of radical species fig 2 a demonstrated the effect of br concentration 0 0 8 mm on kobs in the system of bpa and uv ps at ph 7 0 as br concentrations increased from 0 to 0 8 mm the kobs value presneted an initially increasing and then decreasing trend with a peak of 0 281 min 1 at 0 2 mm the promotive effect remained even though br concentration further increased to 0 8 mm with kobs of 0 234 min 1 higher than that in the absence of br 0 208 min 1 similar phenomenon has been observed previously the degradation of nitrobenzene nb followed the similar pattern with br 0 50 µm in the uv ps process wang et al 2021a the result may be because the excessive br dosage can act as radical quencher in order to better understand the transformation of different radicals in the presence of br the contributions of so4 oh and rbs were estimated with br concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 5 mm nb can rapidly react with oh knb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while can be slowly decomposed by so4 and rbs meanwhile metronidazole met possesses higher reactivity with both so4 k met so4 8 4 109 m 1 s 1 and oh k met oh 3 8 109 m 1 s 1 than with rbs wang et al 2021a consequently the steady state concentrations and contributions of different radicals could be quantified using nb and met as probe compounds in the uv ps br system the detailed calculation information was summarized in text s7 the calculated steady state concentrations of oh oh s s and so4 s o 4 s s were shown in table s1 as br concentrations increased from 0 to 0 5 mm s o 4 s s obviously decreased from 3 76 10 13 to 5 71 10 15 m and oh s s only decreased from 1 76 10 13 to 4 79 10 14 m the result demonstrated that oh s s and s o 4 s s were increasingly converted into rbs with the increase of br concentrations fig 2 b exhibited the calculated k values for bpa removal by so4 k bpa s o 4 s o 4 s s oh k bpa oh oh s s and rbs k r b s b p a oxidations in the uv ps process in the range of 0 0 5 mm br concentrations either of oh and so4 contributed nearly 50 of bpa removal in the uv ps process the both contributions presented a decreasing trend with increasing br concentrations from 0 to 0 5 mm among them so4 only accounted for 0 8 on the bpa degradation in the presence of 0 5 mm br suggesting that radicals were nearly completely converted from so4 to rbs and oh meanwhile the yield of rbs decreased slightly as the br concentration increased from 0 2 to 0 5 mm which may be due to the self quenching of the excess rbs produced wang et al 2021a by subtracting the k value of oh and so4 from total k bpa value the contribution of rbs grew from 64 1 to 87 7 when the br concentrations increased from 0 05 to 0 5 mm therefore rbs played a vital role in bpa degradation by the uv ps system in the presence of 0 05 0 5 mm br 3 3 effects of ps dosage and solution ph the bpa degradation was evaluated at different ps dosages and solution ph in the uv ps br system as shown in fig 3 a the kobs value increased dramatically from 0 049 to 0 281 min 1 with the increase of ps dosage from 0 2 to 1 0 mm the kobs value in the uv ps br system exhibited a linear relationship as a function of ps dosages kobs 0 2875 ps 0 0151 r2 0 992 the enhanced effect can be attributed to the significant increase in the production of reactive radicals via the photolysis of more ps it was reported that the excessive oxidants could slow down the degradation of pollutants liu et al 2020 however it was not observed in this study as illustrated in fig 3 c the bpa degradation was almost negligible in the uv ps system in the absence of br and kobs value of bpa slightly decreased from 0 238 to 0 210 min 1 with increasing solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 in such a ph range bpa pka1 9 6 and pka2 10 2 principally existed in the same form lin et al 2020 therefore the bpa degradation in the uv ps system was barely affected by the initial solution ph 6 0 8 0 however as seen from fig 3 b the presence of 0 2 mm br widened the gap in kobs value at different ph values as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the removal efficiencies of bpa decreased from 84 0 to 71 9 accompanied by the decrease of kobs from 0 346 to 0 247 min 1 fig 3 c displayed the k values of bpa by oh so4 and rbs oxidations in the uv ps system in the presence absence of 0 2 mm br in ph range of 6 0 8 0 in the absence of br the contributions of oh and so4 were hardly changed at different ph conditions and the k values slightly increased at ph 6 0 the introduction of 0 2 mm br obviously increased corresponding k values of bpa and changed the contributions of radicals to bpa degradation the contributions of so4 oh and rbs to bpa degradation in the presence of 0 2 mm br at ph 6 0 were calculated as 2 3 12 4 and 85 3 respectively as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the contributions of so4 and oh increased to 4 9 and 17 respectively but the role of rbs decreased to 78 1 the phenomenon may be due to the fact that the generated so4 more readily reacted with oh to form oh under alkaline conditions thus alleviating the formation of rbs generally the contributions of so4 oh and rbs did not obviously fluctuate among which rbs played the most important role in the bpa degradation in a uv ps br process in ph range of 6 0 8 0 3 4 effects of water matrix constituents 3 4 1 ha the introduction of ha the representative fraction of nom significantly retarded the degradation of bpa in the uv ps br system fig 4 a as ha concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 the kobs value decreased from 0 281 to 0 147 min 1 the observed inhibiting effect can be attributed to the following two aspects first ha can serve as the quencher of oh br and so4 with the corresponding reaction rates of 6 8 103 2 5 104 and 9 4 103 mg l 1 s 1 respectively wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021 second ha can also act as an inner filter of uv light to mitigate the direct photolysis efficiency of ps which further reduces the formation of so4 cai et al 2021a 3 4 2 inorganic anions inorganic anions such as hco3 and cl are widely present in natural water sources the influences of hco3 and cl on bpa degradation in the uv ps br system were thus studied as depicted in fig 4 b the kobs value slightly increased from 0 281 to 0 3 min 1 with the increase of hco3 concentration from 0 to 5 0 mm hco3 can react with oh and so4 to form co3 with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively qin et al 2020 hco3 might influence the complex system in different aspects it was reported that the second order rate constant of co3 with bpa was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 gao et al 2020 although the rate constants of co3 with bpa were still lower than that of oh and so4 with bpa k bpa oh 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 and k bpa so4 4 49 109 m 1 s 1 the high steady state concentration of co3 about two orders of magnitude higher than oh likely ensured a high reaction rate in the bpa decomposition gao et al 2020 lin et al 2020 furthermore hco3 can scavenge br and br2 with lower rate constants of 1 0 106 and 8 0 104 m 1 s 1 respectively therefore in the uv ps br system hco3 mainly scavenges oh and so4 to form co3 leading to a slight improvement in kobs value the presence of 1 0 mm cl exhibited inhibitory effect on bpa degradation while bpa degradation appeared a slight enhancing effect with increasing cl concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mm the kobs value of bpa reduced from 0 281 to 0 243 min 1 as cl concentration increased from 0 to 1 0 mm however the kobs value increased to 0 297 min 1 when cl concentration further increased to 5 0 mm the phenomenon may mainly be caused by the following reasons cl can react with oh and so4 to form several reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 clo and cloh qin et al 2020 meanwhile the produced cl2 and cloh can be reversibly decomposed into cl and oh according to the literature the second order rate constants of cl cl2 and clo with bpa were reported to be 1 83 1010 5 82 108 and 1 76 109 m 1 s 1 respectively yin and shang 2020 thus the generated rcs similar to oh and so4 also have a strong ability to remove bpa meanwhile cl competes with br for oh and so4 at relatively lower cl concentration resulting in less rbs formation and then a slight decrease in kobs clbr that possesses the same redox potentials as br 2 0 v can form through the reactions of cl with rbs and the reactions of br with rcs guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a therefore the higher doses of cl may promote rbs formation causing the improvement in kobs 3 5 reaction mechanisms for the oxidation of bpa the reactions of bpa with oh and so4 proceed via three pathways including hydrogen atom transfer hat radical adduct formation raf and single electron transfer set the detailed thermodynamic results were summarized in table s2 six raf and five hat reactions of bpa with oh were considered and the corresponding profile of potential energy surface is provided in fig 5 a the addition and h abstraction paths of oh can be seen in fig s1 all the raf and hat reactions of bpa with oh are thermodynamically favorable gibbs free energy change δg 0 with δg in the range of 19 43 to 3 02 kcal mol 1 for raf pathways the free energy barrier δg of oh addition paths at c3 c4 and c8 sites were lower than that at c5 c6 and c7 sites indicating that c atoms near the oh on the left side of the benzene ring is preferentially subject to the oh addition reaction the highest free energy barrier was 6 29 kcal mol 1 at c7 site while the lowest one was 2 71 kcal mol 1 at c4 site the lowest free energy barrier of h abstraction paths was located at h24 site 4 68 kcal mol 1 suggesting that the h atoms on the benzene ring were more difficult for abstraction than the h atoms on the alkyl group as shown in fig 5 c the δg of the set pathway was calculated as 21 74 kcal mol 1 the reaction was the only thermodynamically unfavorable path in all the reactions of bpa with oh δg 13 72 kcal mol 1 overall raf pathways especially at c3 c4 and c8 sites were more likely occur than the hat routes due to their lower energy barriers in addition the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with oh was calculated as 7 65 1010 m 1 s 1 based on conventional transition state theory text s6 which was slightly higher than the value reported in a previous study k bpa oh 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 gao et al 2020 fig 5 b presented δg for the so4 addition and h abstraction routes of bpa and the corresponding paths are described in fig s2 the δg for so4 addition routes varied from 5 03 kcal mol 1 at c8 site to 15 96 kcal mol 1 at c7 site and the δg for so4 h abstraction routes varied from the lowest 14 57 kcal mol 1 at h23 site to the highest 20 21 kcal mol 1 at h21 site as demonstrated in fig 5 c the δg and δg in so4 set pathway were 7 92 and 7 45 kcal mol 1 respectively all the δg value in so4 addition and h abstraction routes were all positive except h24 abstraction thus the so4 addition routes were relatively difficult to occur while the h abstraction routes likely occurred at h24 site the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with so4 was calculated as 1 67 109 m 1 s 1 the generated rbs mainly included br and br2 and the set routes of br and br2 with bpa are shown in fig 5 c the set reactions of bpa with br were thermodynamically favorable δg 12 05 kcal mol 1 and the δg for br set pathway was 6 34 kcal mol 1 the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with br was calculated as 1 77 108 m 1 s 1 however the δg and δg for br2 set route were 14 43 and 11 49 kcal mol 1 respectively the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with br2 was calculated as 2 83 102 m 1 s 1 study indicated that when br concentrations increased from 0 01 to 0 05 mm in the uv ps process the concentrations of br and br2 always kept an order of magnitude difference based on the model simulation results wang et al 2021a consequently it can be speculated that br in rbs may function as an important role in the bpa degradation during the uv ps treatment in the presence of br 3 6 degradation pathways and modeling predicted toxicity to further clarify the underlying bpa degradation mechanisms dft calculation and multiwfn software were used to calculate fukui function ƒ0 and dual descriptor δƒ based on hirshfeld charge table s3 lu and chen 2012 qin et al 2020 as depicted in fig 6 b the symmetrical phenyl rings were more vulnerable to lose electrons and can be attacked by radicals in addition it was consistent with the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo fig s3 which can be used to describe the sites in bpa molecule prone to lose electrons or attacked by radicals the c4 and c16 with the highest ƒ0 values indicated that they were the most vulnerable reaction sites to be attacked by radicals furthermore the degradation intermediates of bpa in the uv ps br process were determined by hplc ms analysis in full scan mode the primary tps of bpa were identified according to the obtained mass to charge ratio m z and spectra fig s4 the proposed chemical structures of these tps were presented in table s4 according to the identified tps and dft calculation three plausible bpa degradation pathways including so4 induced hydroxylation reaction oh addition and direct bromination of bpa were proposed and the details were described in fig 6 c the br2 and hobr obr can be produced via the interaction with the generated rbs in the uv ps process in the presence of br wang et al 2020 the ortho substitution reactions of bpa likely occur due to the higher charges at these sites based on the obtained higher ƒ value table s3 which might be vulnerable to electrophilic attack therefore the direct bromination of bpa results in the formation of tp1 with m z 305 followed by the formation of tp2 m z 383 and tp3 m z 461 after subsequent bromination a previous study also observed the generation of tp1 tp2 and tp3 in the reactions of bpa with chlorine and br li et al 2021 in the second pathway as the hydroxylation products of bpa tp4 and tp5 with m z 243 were identified as isomers based on their different retention times the formation of tp5 may originate from c4 addition of oh followed by oxygen mediated h elimination which was the mono hydroxylated product to be most readily formed based on the obtained addition paths of oh and ƒ0 values the formation mechanism of tp4 was similar to that of tp5 it was believed that the possible oh addition occurred at meta substitution as the di hydroxylation product of bpa the tp6 with m z 259 can be formed by further oxidation of tp5 at c16 site the β scission of the cc bond may occur in tp6 molecule resulting in the formation of intermediate p1 4 isopropylcatechol radical liu et al 2022 p1 can further react with oh and then lose a water molecule to form tp7 which can be further oxidized to yield tp8 guo et al have previously reported that the hydroxylated products can react with rbs or free bromine to generate brominated products in the uv bromine system guo et al 2020 in this study the brominated products containing hydroxyl functional groups including tp9 m z 321 tp10 m z 337 tp11 m z 415 and tp12 m z 431 were detected these bromine containing products were all yielded through the bromination or further hydroxylation based on the generated tp5 and tp6 for so4 induced hydroxylation reaction the addition reaction of so4 occurred most easily at c8 site located on the benzene ring based on the above calculation consequently the c8 site of the phenyl ring was attacked by so4 and then electrons transferred from the phenyl ring to so4 to form intermediate p2 which can also be oxidized to tp5 choi et al 2018 meanwhile the formed p2 can be further transformed into the phenoxyl bpa radical p3 through the elimination of water molecule the β scission of the cc bond also happened in p3 leading to the formation of tp13 with m z 361 through two bpa adducts which was similar to previous study liu et al 2022 these generated tps may possess higher or similar toxicity than the parent compound bpa causing potential biological toxicity and ecological risks to the aquatic environment and adversely affecting human health since the toxicity of most tps is not easily quantified toxicity estimation software tool test is commonly employed to predict the toxicity of formed tps after bpa treated by the uv ps br process test can be used to estimate the value for several toxicity endpoints including bioaccumulation effect developmental toxicity ames mutagenicity and acute toxicity for fathead minnow daphnia magna tetrahymena pyriformis and oral rat since the model prediction is based on the determined chemical structure of the query compound toxicity calculations are performed for all possible isomers tp9 t10 tp11 and tp12 and detailed information is shown in table s5 table s6 exhibited the predicted acute toxicity of bpa and its tps by test and the lower value meant higher toxicity the formation of hydroxylated tps enhanced the acute toxicity of treated solutions and the more substituted hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring resulted in the higher acute toxicity query no 5 7 the phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring improves the binding activity and solubility of these tps and thus strengthens their bioavailability which can lead to higher toxicity gao et al 2021 except for oral rat the predicted toxicity of single ring tps query no 8 9 was much lower than that of bpa while triple ring tp query no 33 presented the opposite trend obviously the decrease increase in toxicity may be attributed to the loss addition of one phenolic toxophore for oral rat the predicted toxicity of single ring tps increased which was consistent with the previous findings gao et al 2021 notably the predicted values of bromine containing hydroxylated products were much lower than that of bpa indicating that its toxicity was growing moreover the increase in hydroxyl bromo groups on the benzene ring significantly decreased the predicted values of tps besides the difference in the predicted values for isomers with the same molecular weight query nos 10 16 17 18 19 24 and 25 32 could be nearly negligible revealing that the toxicity change was not related to the number of hydroxyl bromo groups on the benzene ring instead of the position of the substituent as shown in table s7 the predicted result of comprehensive toxicity indices demonstrated that both bpa and its tps were biologically development toxic however only query compound no 8 was ames mutagenicity which was caused by the biological activation of the olefin part into electrophilic reactive metabolites with high affinity for proteins or dna zhang and elfarra 2017 in addition bioaccumulation factors of the most tps were obviously lower than that of bpa the three direct bromination products of bpa query no 2 4 and triple ring tp query no 33 presented higher bioaccumulation factors than that of bpa which increased the occurrence of toxic incidents in general single ring tp tp9 query no 9 owns the lowest toxicity among the detected products while tp12 with multiple hydroxyl groups and bromo groups on the benzene ring possesses the highest toxicity therefore during the degradation of bpa polycyclic and bicyclic tps containing hydroxyl and bromo groups are preferentially converted into monocyclic or acyclic products without olefins through ring splitting 3 7 formation and toxicity assessment of dbps during chlorination degradation products containing bromine substituents and phenolic groups can be produced during the bpa removal by uv ps br treatment they may serve as the precursors of br dbps during subsequent chlorination besides since the pka value of hocl is 7 5 the solution ph affects the main existing form of chlorine species hclo and clo which present different reactivity with the degradation products of bpa after uv ps br pre oxidation therefore the dbps formation potential was evaluated under different conditions including direct chlorination uv ps and uv ps br pre treatment including ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 during subsequent chlorination as elucidated in fig 7 a only trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa cl dbps were detected by direct chlorination and uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa were determined to be 19 3 60 3 and 216 1 µg l 1 during chlorination respectively in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa were found to be 38 2 59 and 155 3 µg l 1 respectively clearly uv ps pre oxidation increased the formation of tcm but reduced the yield of tcaa the generated reactive radicals in the uv ps system can attack bpa through hydrogen abstraction addition and hydroxylation resulting in the formation of hydroxylated products these products can react with free chlorine to form more tcm during the subsequent post chlorination cai et al 2021a the decrease of tcaa yield can be explained by the reduction in the precursors of tcaa after uv ps pre oxidation through hydroxylation and epoxidation xu et al 2021 uvc based aops were reported to mitigate haas and the cleavage of cc σ bond and the elimination of co2 hco3 co3 2 molecules in tcaa can lead to the transformation into tcm qian et al 2013 gao et al 2019 moreover the substitution of halogen atoms on ɑ c with nucleophiles can also lessen the formation of haa similar experimental results have also been observed in the degradation of carbamazepine in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination xu et al 2021 however a large amount of additional br dbps dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm tribromoacetic acid tbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa and dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa formed accompanied by the decreasing production of cl dbps tcm dcaa and tcaa 7 µg l 1 in uv ps br pre treatment during subsequent chlorination the phenomenon can be ascribed to the formation of brominated precursors and the reaction of residual br with hocl to form hobr among the detected br dbps the concentrations of dbcm dbaa and dbcaa only were detected at 5 4 19 8 and 5 8 µg l 1 respectively while tbm and tbaa were the two dominant species tbm even reached 542 5 µg l 1 obviously the introduction of br resulted in the formation of br dbps but greatly restrained the generation of cl dbps in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination fig 7 b displayed the formation potential of dbps by uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 as shown the difference between tcm dbcm dcaa tcaa and dbcaa was almost negligible at different ph as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the concentration of tbm raised from 400 to 584 7 µg l 1 but tbaa presented the opposite trend that was its concentration decreased from 140 to 88 7 µg l 1 in addition the concentration of dbaa fluctuated slightly at different ph with the concentration of 26 1 19 7 and 31 3 µg l 1 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively in general the total yield of dbps decreased from 723 6 to 589 9 µg l 1 as solution ph declined from 8 0 to 6 0 as mentioned above ph 6 0 was more conducive to bpa degradation in the uv ps br process which may result in the reduction of br containing intermediates furthermore the phenomenon may also be caused by the different reactivity of hocl and clo toward the transformation products at different ph levels zhu et al 2021 due to the difference in the toxicity risk caused by each dbp it is difficult to effectively evaluate the overall effect of uv ps pre oxidation on bpa degradation during chlorination in terms of the toxicity of dbps only by measuring the produced dbps therefore it is necessary to conduct a preliminary toxicity risk analysis by calculating the toxicity risk value of dbps identified in this study previous studies have reported the values of chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity of various dbps to chinese hamster ovary cells which provided an effective method for evaluating the toxicity risk of dbps richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 the toxic risk value trv of each dbp could be calculated by eq 8 where the combined toxicity value ctv is the reciprocal of the average value of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values for corresponding dbp the higher ctv value represents the greater the overall toxicity of one dbp table s8 and c dbp is the concentration of each dbp zhu et al 2021 8 t r v c d b p c t v fig 7 c exhibited the calculated trv of each dbp by direct chlorination uv ps pre oxidation and uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the trv of tcaa in direct chlorination and uv ps pre oxidation accounted for 75 and 64 of the total dbps respectively and uv ps pre oxidation reduced the total trv compared to direct chlorination at ph 7 0 indicating that uv ps pre oxidation can reduce the toxicity risk and tcaa possesses the highest toxicity by both treatment methods however the introduction of 0 2 mm br greatly increased total trv from 239 3 106 to 713 9 106 due to the formation of large amounts of br dbps among them tbm and tbaa were identified as the two main br dbps that caused higher total trv and trv of tbm and tbaa were calculated as 309 2 106 and 307 7 106 respectively as displayed in fig 7 d the total trv slightly decreased from 718 4 106 to 706 106 with increasing solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 at ph 6 0 the detected concentration of total dbps was the lowest but the calculated total trv was the highest this phenomenon is attributed to the generation of more tbaa at ph 6 0 which possesses higher toxicity ctv 2 65 l 1 g consequently uv ps pre oxidation could markedly increase the total trv of dbps in the presence of br regardless of the solution ph 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that the bpa degradation by uv ps process was promoted in the presence of br which can be ascribed to the formation of rbs the rbs played the most important role on bpa degradation in uv ps br process at different ph conditions 6 0 8 0 and br concentrations 0 05 0 5 mm as ps dosage increased from 0 2 to 1 0 mm the kobs value of bpa presented a linear increase trend the introduction of ha inhibited bpa degradation while the presence of hco3 and cl slightly influenced its removal according to quantum chemical calculation the reaction mechanisms for bpa oxidation were explored in detail and the second order rate constants of bpa with different radicals were also determined the proposed transformation pathways of bpa included so4 induced hydroxylation reaction oh addition and direct bromination of bpa were put forward the toxicity analysis results of bpa and its tps demonstrated that the generated polycyclic and bicyclic tps containing hydroxyl and bromo groups can reduce toxicity if they can be converted into monocyclic or acyclic products without olefins through ring opening however the analysis only predicted the possible toxicity theoretically and the real toxicity of treated solutions needs to be further verified in addition the formation of tbm and tbaa by uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination greatly increased the toxicity of dbps declaration

16178,bromide br a ubiquitous species in natural water is capable of reacting with sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh to form secondary reactive bromine species rbs the reaction routes can influence the degradation mechanisms and performance of these radicals for removal of target pollutants and may also form harmful bromine containing disinfection by products br dbps during subsequent chlorination in the present research the uv activated persulfate ps degradation of bisphenol a bpa was systematically examined in the presence of br results indicated that the presence of br enhanced the bpa degradation and both uv ps and uv ps br processes followed the pseudo first order kinetics at 0 0 8 mm br 0 2 mm br exerted the best enhanced effect on bpa degradation while rbs functioned as the major contributor in the presence of 0 05 0 5 mm br solution ph 6 0 8 0 barely affected the bpa degradation in the uv ps system but the introduction of br augmented the ph dependence in the uv ps br system the reaction rate constant of bpa increased decreased with increasing ps ha dosage and was affected slightly in the presence of bicarbonate and chloride according to the quantum chemical calculation the second order rate constants of bpa with oh so4 br and br2 were calculated as 7 65 1010 1 67 109 1 77 108 and 2 83 102 m 1 s 1 respectively additionally three degradation pathways of bpa were proposed based on dft calculation and hplc ms analysis and the formed bromine containing products exhibited higher toxicity than bpa br dbps particularly tribromomethane and tribromoacetic acid generated from uv ps br pre oxidation during bpa chlorination significantly increased the toxicity of total dbps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bromide advanced oxidation processes quantum chemical calculation reaction mechanism disinfection by products 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa a typical endocrine disrupting chemical has been widely used in the manufacture of various products such as epoxy resin polycarbonate plastics fire retardants and medical equipment sharma et al 2015 deng et al 2018 the global consumption of bpa was reported to exceed 7 million tons year and its production and consumption may continue to increase jiang et al 2018 li et al 2021 owing to the widespread use and resistance to conventional water treatment processes bpa has been extensively detected in various aquatic environments with the concentrations typically raining from several ng l to several hundred µg l jiang et al 2018 lin et al 2020 li et al 2021 zorzo et al 2021 due to its high estrogenic effect the exposure to bpa can cause adverse effects on animals and humans such as prostate cancer metabolism disorder endocrine disorder reproductive dysfunction and cancer gao et al 2020 wan et al 2020 zorzo et al 2021 consequently there is an urgent need to develop effective water treatment technologies for bpa removal from contaminated water in recent years sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention on the removal of recalcitrant organic compounds in water and wastewater for its high oxidation ability sánchez montes et al 2020 wang et al 2021a compared with hydroxyl radicals oh 1 8 2 7 v so4 exhibits higher standard redox potential 2 5 3 1 v at neutral ph and higher reactivity toward certain organic pollutants cai et al 2021b generally so4 can react with various refractory organic pollutants with a rate constant of 108 1010 m 1 s 1 it more selectively oxidizes target organic contaminants through electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction addition ling et al 2017 so4 can be produced through persulfate ps or peroxymonosulfate pms activation by various methods such as heat transition metals alkaline and ultraviolet uv irradaition sánchez montes et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 among them the activation by uv irradiation is deemed as an effective and promising method moreover the generated so4 can react with h2o and oh resulting in the production of oh wang et al 2021a bromide br naturally exists in the aquatic environment within a typical occurrence range from a few µm 6 µm to several tens of µm 52 µm in fresh water and surface water but its level can be increased up to hundreds of µm 838 µm in seawater guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a previous studies found that the presence of br significantly influenced the performance of chemical oxidation treatment as reported the presence of 0 05 10 mm br retarded the degradation of humic acid ha benzophenone benzoic acid cyclohexane carboxylic acid diethyl phthalate salbutamol and terbutaline whereas the removal of sulfamethoxazole ofloxacin and sulfonamides was accelerated in the presence of 0 1 0 8 mm br in a uv ps process guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a these phenomena are mainly due to the scavenging of so4 and oh and the formation of secondary reactive bromine species rbs e g bromine atoms br dibromide radical anions br2 and free bromine hobr et al in the presence of br lei et al 2021 wang et al 2021a br can be generated in so4 based aops through the reaction of so4 with br which further reacts with oh h2o to form broh and with br to form br2 eqs 1 4 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2021a besides br can react with broh and oh to form br2 and broh respectively eqs 5 and 6 lee et al 2020 wang et al 2021a these rbs are electrophilic which can selectively react with electron rich substances to cause the generation of brominated products wang et al 2020 1 b r s o 4 s o 4 2 b r k 7 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 2 b r b

most of which only focused on the transformation from so4 and oh to rbs or understanding of the role of rbs on the degradation of organic compounds yang et al 2014 wang et al 2020 2021a however the degradation and transformation of certain organic compound by uv ps br process have not been comprehensively studied in particular the degradation mechanism of organic pollutant as well as the toxicity of its degradation products deserve further evaluation in a uv ps process in the presence of br quantum chemical calculation is a feasible method for exploring theoretical investigations on bimolecular reactions which can supplement or even substitute experimental research to better understand chemical degradation mechanisms tentscher et al 2019 qin et al 2020 the quantitative structure activity relationships qsar model has proven as an effective tool for calculating the toxicity of transformation products tps enabling better assessment of environmental risks gao et al 2021 in addition the formation potential of disinfection by products dbps especially bromine containing dbps br dbps should also be carefully examined over a uv ps br pre oxidation during post chlorination prior studies revealed that br could react with hypochlorous acid hocl to form hypobromous acid hobr during chlorination which reacted with nom moieties more easily than hocl zhu et al 2021 it is worth noting that hobr can react with nom and organic pollutants to generate br dbps which are generally more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogs erdem et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 overall the main objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of br on the bpa degradation in a uv ps process 2 to evaluate effects of ps dosage br concentration solution ph humic acid ha and inorganic anions on the bpa degradation 3 to identify the role of different reactive radicals and discern the contributions of so4 oh and rbs in the uv ps process at varied br concentrations and ph conditions 4 to explore the theoretical reaction mechanisms and calculate the second order rate constants of radicals with bpa thereby proposing a plausible degradation pathway based on density functional theory dft calculation and 5 to assess the formation potential and toxic risk of br dbps by a uv ps br pre treatment during chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents

constants k were calculated using the conventional transition state theory tst text s6 li et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of bpa abatement in various systems fig 1 a showed bpa removals by uv irradiation ps only uv ps and uv ps br processes at ph 7 0 as seen the removals of bpa by uv irradiation alone and ps oxidation only were negligible within 5 min 5 similar observations have been reported previously gao et al 2020 lin et al 2020 in contrast bpa could be abated in the uv ps and uv ps br processes by 63 5 and 76 3 respectively these findings could be due to the efficient generation of active radicals such as so4 oh and rbs in addition the presence of br accelerated the bpa degradation in the uv ps process which may be explained by the high reactivities of bpa containing phenol structure with the produced rbs guo et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the bpa degradation in the uv ps and uv ps br systems followed the pseudo first order kinetics well eq 7 the fitted pseudo first order rate constant kobs of bpa by uv ps br system was found to be 0 281 min 1 which was increased by 1 35 time compared to that in the uv ps process 0 208 min 1 7 ln b p a b p a 0 k o b s t in order to identify the species of active radicals generated from the uv ps br process tert butyl alcohol tba and meoh as different radical scavengers were added to the reaction solution tba acts as an effective quencher for oh with a second order rate constant of 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 while meoh is regarded as the scavenger for both oh and so4 with the second order rate constants of 1 1 107 and 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 respectively xie et al 2015 in addition the second order rate constants of br with tba and meoh are determined as 1 4 104 and 3 5 105 m 1 s 1 respectively while the reactivities of tba and meoh with other bromine radicals can be negligible lee et al 2020 as shown in fig 2 b as tba and meoh concentrations increased from 0 to 10 mm the removal efficiency of bpa in 5 min decreased from 76 3 to 67 5 and 47 7 respectively furthermore with further increasing meoh concentration to 50 mm the bpa degradation was still not completely suppressed these results indicated that so4 oh and rbs such as br hobr obr and br2 et al were all involved in the bpa degradation in the mixed uv ps br system 3 2 effects of bromide on the conversion of radical species fig 2 a demonstrated the effect of br concentration 0 0 8 mm on kobs in the system of bpa and uv ps at ph 7 0 as br concentrations increased from 0 to 0 8 mm the kobs value presneted an initially increasing and then decreasing trend with a peak of 0 281 min 1 at 0 2 mm the promotive effect remained even though br concentration further increased to 0 8 mm with kobs of 0 234 min 1 higher than that in the absence of br 0 208 min 1 similar phenomenon has been observed previously the degradation of nitrobenzene nb followed the similar pattern with br 0 50 µm in the uv ps process wang et al 2021a the result may be because the excessive br dosage can act as radical quencher in order to better understand the transformation of different radicals in the presence of br the contributions of so4 oh and rbs were estimated with br concentrations ranging from 0 to 0 5 mm nb can rapidly react with oh knb oh 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 while can be slowly decomposed by so4 and rbs meanwhile metronidazole met possesses higher reactivity with both so4 k met so4 8 4 109 m 1 s 1 and oh k met oh 3 8 109 m 1 s 1 than with rbs wang et al 2021a consequently the steady state concentrations and contributions of different radicals could be quantified using nb and met as probe compounds in the uv ps br system the detailed calculation information was summarized in text s7 the calculated steady state concentrations of oh oh s s and so4 s o 4 s s were shown in table s1 as br concentrations increased from 0 to 0 5 mm s o 4 s s obviously decreased from 3 76 10 13 to 5 71 10 15 m and oh s s only decreased from 1 76 10 13 to 4 79 10 14 m the result demonstrated that oh s s and s o 4 s s were increasingly converted into rbs with the increase of br concentrations fig 2 b exhibited the calculated k values for bpa removal by so4 k bpa s o 4 s o 4 s s oh k bpa oh oh s s and rbs k r b s b p a oxidations in the uv ps process in the range of 0 0 5 mm br concentrations either of oh and so4 contributed nearly 50 of bpa removal in the uv ps process the both contributions presented a decreasing trend with increasing br concentrations from 0 to 0 5 mm among them so4 only accounted for 0 8 on the bpa degradation in the presence of 0 5 mm br suggesting that radicals were nearly completely converted from so4 to rbs and oh meanwhile the yield of rbs decreased slightly as the br concentration increased from 0 2 to 0 5 mm which may be due to the self quenching of the excess rbs produced wang et al 2021a by subtracting the k value of oh and so4 from total k bpa value the contribution of rbs grew from 64 1 to 87 7 when the br concentrations increased from 0 05 to 0 5 mm therefore rbs played a vital role in bpa degradation by the uv ps system in the presence of 0 05 0 5 mm br 3 3 effects of ps dosage and solution ph the bpa degradation was evaluated at different ps dosages and solution ph in the uv ps br system as shown in fig 3 a the kobs value increased dramatically from 0 049 to 0 281 min 1 with the increase of ps dosage from 0 2 to 1 0 mm the kobs value in the uv ps br system exhibited a linear relationship as a function of ps dosages kobs 0 2875 ps 0 0151 r2 0 992 the enhanced effect can be attributed to the significant increase in the production of reactive radicals via the photolysis of more ps it was reported that the excessive oxidants could slow down the degradation of pollutants liu et al 2020 however it was not observed in this study as illustrated in fig 3 c the bpa degradation was almost negligible in the uv ps system in the absence of br and kobs value of bpa slightly decreased from 0 238 to 0 210 min 1 with increasing solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 in such a ph range bpa pka1 9 6 and pka2 10 2 principally existed in the same form lin et al 2020 therefore the bpa degradation in the uv ps system was barely affected by the initial solution ph 6 0 8 0 however as seen from fig 3 b the presence of 0 2 mm br widened the gap in kobs value at different ph values as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the removal efficiencies of bpa decreased from 84 0 to 71 9 accompanied by the decrease of kobs from 0 346 to 0 247 min 1 fig 3 c displayed the k values of bpa by oh so4 and rbs oxidations in the uv ps system in the presence absence of 0 2 mm br in ph range of 6 0 8 0 in the absence of br the contributions of oh and so4 were hardly changed at different ph conditions and the k values slightly increased at ph 6 0 the introduction of 0 2 mm br obviously increased corresponding k values of bpa and changed the contributions of radicals to bpa degradation the contributions of so4 oh and rbs to bpa degradation in the presence of 0 2 mm br at ph 6 0 were calculated as 2 3 12 4 and 85 3 respectively as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the contributions of so4 and oh increased to 4 9 and 17 respectively but the role of rbs decreased to 78 1 the phenomenon may be due to the fact that the generated so4 more readily reacted with oh to form oh under alkaline conditions thus alleviating the formation of rbs generally the contributions of so4 oh and rbs did not obviously fluctuate among which rbs played the most important role in the bpa degradation in a uv ps br process in ph range of 6 0 8 0 3 4 effects of water matrix constituents 3 4 1 ha the introduction of ha the representative fraction of nom significantly retarded the degradation of bpa in the uv ps br system fig 4 a as ha concentration increased from 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 the kobs value decreased from 0 281 to 0 147 min 1 the observed inhibiting effect can be attributed to the following two aspects first ha can serve as the quencher of oh br and so4 with the corresponding reaction rates of 6 8 103 2 5 104 and 9 4 103 mg l 1 s 1 respectively wang et al 2021a xu et al 2021 second ha can also act as an inner filter of uv light to mitigate the direct photolysis efficiency of ps which further reduces the formation of so4 cai et al 2021a 3 4 2 inorganic anions inorganic anions such as hco3 and cl are widely present in natural water sources the influences of hco3 and cl on bpa degradation in the uv ps br system were thus studied as depicted in fig 4 b the kobs value slightly increased from 0 281 to 0 3 min 1 with the increase of hco3 concentration from 0 to 5 0 mm hco3 can react with oh and so4 to form co3 with rate constants of 8 5 106 and 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 respectively qin et al 2020 hco3 might influence the complex system in different aspects it was reported that the second order rate constant of co3 with bpa was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 gao et al 2020 although the rate constants of co3 with bpa were still lower than that of oh and so4 with bpa k bpa oh 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 and k bpa so4 4 49 109 m 1 s 1 the high steady state concentration of co3 about two orders of magnitude higher than oh likely ensured a high reaction rate in the bpa decomposition gao et al 2020 lin et al 2020 furthermore hco3 can scavenge br and br2 with lower rate constants of 1 0 106 and 8 0 104 m 1 s 1 respectively therefore in the uv ps br system hco3 mainly scavenges oh and so4 to form co3 leading to a slight improvement in kobs value the presence of 1 0 mm cl exhibited inhibitory effect on bpa degradation while bpa degradation appeared a slight enhancing effect with increasing cl concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mm the kobs value of bpa reduced from 0 281 to 0 243 min 1 as cl concentration increased from 0 to 1 0 mm however the kobs value increased to 0 297 min 1 when cl concentration further increased to 5 0 mm the phenomenon may mainly be caused by the following reasons cl can react with oh and so4 to form several reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 clo and cloh qin et al 2020 meanwhile the produced cl2 and cloh can be reversibly decomposed into cl and oh according to the literature the second order rate constants of cl cl2 and clo with bpa were reported to be 1 83 1010 5 82 108 and 1 76 109 m 1 s 1 respectively yin and shang 2020 thus the generated rcs similar to oh and so4 also have a strong ability to remove bpa meanwhile cl competes with br for oh and so4 at relatively lower cl concentration resulting in less rbs formation and then a slight decrease in kobs clbr that possesses the same redox potentials as br 2 0 v can form through the reactions of cl with rbs and the reactions of br with rcs guo et al 2020 wang et al 2021a therefore the higher doses of cl may promote rbs formation causing the improvement in kobs 3 5 reaction mechanisms for the oxidation of bpa the reactions of bpa with oh and so4 proceed via three pathways including hydrogen atom transfer hat radical adduct formation raf and single electron transfer set the detailed thermodynamic results were summarized in table s2 six raf and five hat reactions of bpa with oh were considered and the corresponding profile of potential energy surface is provided in fig 5 a the addition and h abstraction paths of oh can be seen in fig s1 all the raf and hat reactions of bpa with oh are thermodynamically favorable gibbs free energy change δg 0 with δg in the range of 19 43 to 3 02 kcal mol 1 for raf pathways the free energy barrier δg of oh addition paths at c3 c4 and c8 sites were lower than that at c5 c6 and c7 sites indicating that c atoms near the oh on the left side of the benzene ring is preferentially subject to the oh addition reaction the highest free energy barrier was 6 29 kcal mol 1 at c7 site while the lowest one was 2 71 kcal mol 1 at c4 site the lowest free energy barrier of h abstraction paths was located at h24 site 4 68 kcal mol 1 suggesting that the h atoms on the benzene ring were more difficult for abstraction than the h atoms on the alkyl group as shown in fig 5 c the δg of the set pathway was calculated as 21 74 kcal mol 1 the reaction was the only thermodynamically unfavorable path in all the reactions of bpa with oh δg 13 72 kcal mol 1 overall raf pathways especially at c3 c4 and c8 sites were more likely occur than the hat routes due to their lower energy barriers in addition the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with oh was calculated as 7 65 1010 m 1 s 1 based on conventional transition state theory text s6 which was slightly higher than the value reported in a previous study k bpa oh 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 gao et al 2020 fig 5 b presented δg for the so4 addition and h abstraction routes of bpa and the corresponding paths are described in fig s2 the δg for so4 addition routes varied from 5 03 kcal mol 1 at c8 site to 15 96 kcal mol 1 at c7 site and the δg for so4 h abstraction routes varied from the lowest 14 57 kcal mol 1 at h23 site to the highest 20 21 kcal mol 1 at h21 site as demonstrated in fig 5 c the δg and δg in so4 set pathway were 7 92 and 7 45 kcal mol 1 respectively all the δg value in so4 addition and h abstraction routes were all positive except h24 abstraction thus the so4 addition routes were relatively difficult to occur while the h abstraction routes likely occurred at h24 site the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with so4 was calculated as 1 67 109 m 1 s 1 the generated rbs mainly included br and br2 and the set routes of br and br2 with bpa are shown in fig 5 c the set reactions of bpa with br were thermodynamically favorable δg 12 05 kcal mol 1 and the δg for br set pathway was 6 34 kcal mol 1 the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with br was calculated as 1 77 108 m 1 s 1 however the δg and δg for br2 set route were 14 43 and 11 49 kcal mol 1 respectively the second order reaction rate constant of bpa with br2 was calculated as 2 83 102 m 1 s 1 study indicated that when br concentrations increased from 0 01 to 0 05 mm in the uv ps process the concentrations of br and br2 always kept an order of magnitude difference based on the model simulation results wang et al 2021a consequently it can be speculated that br in rbs may function as an important role in the bpa degradation during the uv ps treatment in the presence of br 3 6 degradation pathways and modeling predicted toxicity to further clarify the underlying bpa degradation mechanisms dft calculation and multiwfn software were used to calculate fukui function ƒ0 and dual descriptor δƒ based on hirshfeld charge table s3 lu and chen 2012 qin et al 2020 as depicted in fig 6 b the symmetrical phenyl rings were more vulnerable to lose electrons and can be attacked by radicals in addition it was consistent with the position of the highest occupied molecular orbital homo fig s3 which can be used to describe the sites in bpa molecule prone to lose electrons or attacked by radicals the c4 and c16 with the highest ƒ0 values indicated that they were the most vulnerable reaction sites to be attacked by radicals furthermore the degradation intermediates of bpa in the uv ps br process were determined by hplc ms analysis in full scan mode the primary tps of bpa were identified according to the obtained mass to charge ratio m z and spectra fig s4 the proposed chemical structures of these tps were presented in table s4 according to the identified tps and dft calculation three plausible bpa degradation pathways including so4 induced hydroxylation reaction oh addition and direct bromination of bpa were proposed and the details were described in fig 6 c the br2 and hobr obr can be produced via the interaction with the generated rbs in the uv ps process in the presence of br wang et al 2020 the ortho substitution reactions of bpa likely occur due to the higher charges at these sites based on the obtained higher ƒ value table s3 which might be vulnerable to electrophilic attack therefore the direct bromination of bpa results in the formation of tp1 with m z 305 followed by the formation of tp2 m z 383 and tp3 m z 461 after subsequent bromination a previous study also observed the generation of tp1 tp2 and tp3 in the reactions of bpa with chlorine and br li et al 2021 in the second pathway as the hydroxylation products of bpa tp4 and tp5 with m z 243 were identified as isomers based on their different retention times the formation of tp5 may originate from c4 addition of oh followed by oxygen mediated h elimination which was the mono hydroxylated product to be most readily formed based on the obtained addition paths of oh and ƒ0 values the formation mechanism of tp4 was similar to that of tp5 it was believed that the possible oh addition occurred at meta substitution as the di hydroxylation product of bpa the tp6 with m z 259 can be formed by further oxidation of tp5 at c16 site the β scission of the cc bond may occur in tp6 molecule resulting in the formation of intermediate p1 4 isopropylcatechol radical liu et al 2022 p1 can further react with oh and then lose a water molecule to form tp7 which can be further oxidized to yield tp8 guo et al have previously reported that the hydroxylated products can react with rbs or free bromine to generate brominated products in the uv bromine system guo et al 2020 in this study the brominated products containing hydroxyl functional groups including tp9 m z 321 tp10 m z 337 tp11 m z 415 and tp12 m z 431 were detected these bromine containing products were all yielded through the bromination or further hydroxylation based on the generated tp5 and tp6 for so4 induced hydroxylation reaction the addition reaction of so4 occurred most easily at c8 site located on the benzene ring based on the above calculation consequently the c8 site of the phenyl ring was attacked by so4 and then electrons transferred from the phenyl ring to so4 to form intermediate p2 which can also be oxidized to tp5 choi et al 2018 meanwhile the formed p2 can be further transformed into the phenoxyl bpa radical p3 through the elimination of water molecule the β scission of the cc bond also happened in p3 leading to the formation of tp13 with m z 361 through two bpa adducts which was similar to previous study liu et al 2022 these generated tps may possess higher or similar toxicity than the parent compound bpa causing potential biological toxicity and ecological risks to the aquatic environment and adversely affecting human health since the toxicity of most tps is not easily quantified toxicity estimation software tool test is commonly employed to predict the toxicity of formed tps after bpa treated by the uv ps br process test can be used to estimate the value for several toxicity endpoints including bioaccumulation effect developmental toxicity ames mutagenicity and acute toxicity for fathead minnow daphnia magna tetrahymena pyriformis and oral rat since the model prediction is based on the determined chemical structure of the query compound toxicity calculations are performed for all possible isomers tp9 t10 tp11 and tp12 and detailed information is shown in table s5 table s6 exhibited the predicted acute toxicity of bpa and its tps by test and the lower value meant higher toxicity the formation of hydroxylated tps enhanced the acute toxicity of treated solutions and the more substituted hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring resulted in the higher acute toxicity query no 5 7 the phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that the increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring improves the binding activity and solubility of these tps and thus strengthens their bioavailability which can lead to higher toxicity gao et al 2021 except for oral rat the predicted toxicity of single ring tps query no 8 9 was much lower than that of bpa while triple ring tp query no 33 presented the opposite trend obviously the decrease increase in toxicity may be attributed to the loss addition of one phenolic toxophore for oral rat the predicted toxicity of single ring tps increased which was consistent with the previous findings gao et al 2021 notably the predicted values of bromine containing hydroxylated products were much lower than that of bpa indicating that its toxicity was growing moreover the increase in hydroxyl bromo groups on the benzene ring significantly decreased the predicted values of tps besides the difference in the predicted values for isomers with the same molecular weight query nos 10 16 17 18 19 24 and 25 32 could be nearly negligible revealing that the toxicity change was not related to the number of hydroxyl bromo groups on the benzene ring instead of the position of the substituent as shown in table s7 the predicted result of comprehensive toxicity indices demonstrated that both bpa and its tps were biologically development toxic however only query compound no 8 was ames mutagenicity which was caused by the biological activation of the olefin part into electrophilic reactive metabolites with high affinity for proteins or dna zhang and elfarra 2017 in addition bioaccumulation factors of the most tps were obviously lower than that of bpa the three direct bromination products of bpa query no 2 4 and triple ring tp query no 33 presented higher bioaccumulation factors than that of bpa which increased the occurrence of toxic incidents in general single ring tp tp9 query no 9 owns the lowest toxicity among the detected products while tp12 with multiple hydroxyl groups and bromo groups on the benzene ring possesses the highest toxicity therefore during the degradation of bpa polycyclic and bicyclic tps containing hydroxyl and bromo groups are preferentially converted into monocyclic or acyclic products without olefins through ring splitting 3 7 formation and toxicity assessment of dbps during chlorination degradation products containing bromine substituents and phenolic groups can be produced during the bpa removal by uv ps br treatment they may serve as the precursors of br dbps during subsequent chlorination besides since the pka value of hocl is 7 5 the solution ph affects the main existing form of chlorine species hclo and clo which present different reactivity with the degradation products of bpa after uv ps br pre oxidation therefore the dbps formation potential was evaluated under different conditions including direct chlorination uv ps and uv ps br pre treatment including ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 during subsequent chlorination as elucidated in fig 7 a only trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa cl dbps were detected by direct chlorination and uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa were determined to be 19 3 60 3 and 216 1 µg l 1 during chlorination respectively in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa were found to be 38 2 59 and 155 3 µg l 1 respectively clearly uv ps pre oxidation increased the formation of tcm but reduced the yield of tcaa the generated reactive radicals in the uv ps system can attack bpa through hydrogen abstraction addition and hydroxylation resulting in the formation of hydroxylated products these products can react with free chlorine to form more tcm during the subsequent post chlorination cai et al 2021a the decrease of tcaa yield can be explained by the reduction in the precursors of tcaa after uv ps pre oxidation through hydroxylation and epoxidation xu et al 2021 uvc based aops were reported to mitigate haas and the cleavage of cc σ bond and the elimination of co2 hco3 co3 2 molecules in tcaa can lead to the transformation into tcm qian et al 2013 gao et al 2019 moreover the substitution of halogen atoms on ɑ c with nucleophiles can also lessen the formation of haa similar experimental results have also been observed in the degradation of carbamazepine in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination xu et al 2021 however a large amount of additional br dbps dibromochloromethane dbcm tribromomethane tbm tribromoacetic acid tbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa and dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa formed accompanied by the decreasing production of cl dbps tcm dcaa and tcaa 7 µg l 1 in uv ps br pre treatment during subsequent chlorination the phenomenon can be ascribed to the formation of brominated precursors and the reaction of residual br with hocl to form hobr among the detected br dbps the concentrations of dbcm dbaa and dbcaa only were detected at 5 4 19 8 and 5 8 µg l 1 respectively while tbm and tbaa were the two dominant species tbm even reached 542 5 µg l 1 obviously the introduction of br resulted in the formation of br dbps but greatly restrained the generation of cl dbps in uv ps pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination fig 7 b displayed the formation potential of dbps by uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 as shown the difference between tcm dbcm dcaa tcaa and dbcaa was almost negligible at different ph as solution ph increased from 6 0 to 8 0 the concentration of tbm raised from 400 to 584 7 µg l 1 but tbaa presented the opposite trend that was its concentration decreased from 140 to 88 7 µg l 1 in addition the concentration of dbaa fluctuated slightly at different ph with the concentration of 26 1 19 7 and 31 3 µg l 1 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively in general the total yield of dbps decreased from 723 6 to 589 9 µg l 1 as solution ph declined from 8 0 to 6 0 as mentioned above ph 6 0 was more conducive to bpa degradation in the uv ps br process which may result in the reduction of br containing intermediates furthermore the phenomenon may also be caused by the different reactivity of hocl and clo toward the transformation products at different ph levels zhu et al 2021 due to the difference in the toxicity risk caused by each dbp it is difficult to effectively evaluate the overall effect of uv ps pre oxidation on bpa degradation during chlorination in terms of the toxicity of dbps only by measuring the produced dbps therefore it is necessary to conduct a preliminary toxicity risk analysis by calculating the toxicity risk value of dbps identified in this study previous studies have reported the values of chronic cytotoxicity and acute genotoxicity of various dbps to chinese hamster ovary cells which provided an effective method for evaluating the toxicity risk of dbps richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 the toxic risk value trv of each dbp could be calculated by eq 8 where the combined toxicity value ctv is the reciprocal of the average value of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values for corresponding dbp the higher ctv value represents the greater the overall toxicity of one dbp table s8 and c dbp is the concentration of each dbp zhu et al 2021 8 t r v c d b p c t v fig 7 c exhibited the calculated trv of each dbp by direct chlorination uv ps pre oxidation and uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination the trv of tcaa in direct chlorination and uv ps pre oxidation accounted for 75 and 64 of the total dbps respectively and uv ps pre oxidation reduced the total trv compared to direct chlorination at ph 7 0 indicating that uv ps pre oxidation can reduce the toxicity risk and tcaa possesses the highest toxicity by both treatment methods however the introduction of 0 2 mm br greatly increased total trv from 239 3 106 to 713 9 106 due to the formation of large amounts of br dbps among them tbm and tbaa were identified as the two main br dbps that caused higher total trv and trv of tbm and tbaa were calculated as 309 2 106 and 307 7 106 respectively as displayed in fig 7 d the total trv slightly decreased from 718 4 106 to 706 106 with increasing solution ph from 6 0 to 8 0 at ph 6 0 the detected concentration of total dbps was the lowest but the calculated total trv was the highest this phenomenon is attributed to the generation of more tbaa at ph 6 0 which possesses higher toxicity ctv 2 65 l 1 g consequently uv ps pre oxidation could markedly increase the total trv of dbps in the presence of br regardless of the solution ph 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that the bpa degradation by uv ps process was promoted in the presence of br which can be ascribed to the formation of rbs the rbs played the most important role on bpa degradation in uv ps br process at different ph conditions 6 0 8 0 and br concentrations 0 05 0 5 mm as ps dosage increased from 0 2 to 1 0 mm the kobs value of bpa presented a linear increase trend the introduction of ha inhibited bpa degradation while the presence of hco3 and cl slightly influenced its removal according to quantum chemical calculation the reaction mechanisms for bpa oxidation were explored in detail and the second order rate constants of bpa with different radicals were also determined the proposed transformation pathways of bpa included so4 induced hydroxylation reaction oh addition and direct bromination of bpa were put forward the toxicity analysis results of bpa and its tps demonstrated that the generated polycyclic and bicyclic tps containing hydroxyl and bromo groups can reduce toxicity if they can be converted into monocyclic or acyclic products without olefins through ring opening however the analysis only predicted the possible toxicity theoretically and the real toxicity of treated solutions needs to be further verified in addition the formation of tbm and tbaa by uv ps br pre oxidation during subsequent chlorination greatly increased the toxicity of dbps declaration

achieve a concentration of desired products from a mixture in an energy efficient manner bouzerara et al 2015 mistry and maubois 2017 padaki et al 2015 while polymeric membranes have been widely used with low cost and easy fabrication their frequent replacement due to membrane damages is still a limitation of polymeric membranes in biochemical fine petrochemical and pharmaceutical industry applications requiring excellent selectivity and physicochemical durability over the last few decades ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention in membrane technology because they offer significant advantages including superior mechanical chemical and thermal stability compared with conventional polymeric membranes lee et al 2016 lee et al 2013 these advantages indicate that ceramic membranes will tolerate chemical and thermal regeneration and sterilization by high temperatures 800 c and strong chemical processes acid alkaline oxidation conditions alventosa delara et al 2012 sunarso et al 2015 ceramic membranes are usually prepared with several layers which include the substrate intermediate and separation active layers the most common method to prepare the substrate ceramic membranes is slip casting known as pouring a prepared slurry using al2o3 tio2 zro2 sio2 or a combination of these materials into a porous mold where the solvent of the suspension is extracted to form pores athayde et al 2016 bouzerara et al 2015 lee et al 2015 this slip casting method is appropriate to fabricate microfiltration mf membranes for separating suspended solids such as colloids particulates and fat from a solvent bouazizi et al 2016 to improve the separation efficiency of a dissolved solute and low molecular weight organic matter using ceramic ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes more accurate and precise control of the final pore size distribution is necessary generally multiple steps are required to prepare a desirable molecular weight cut off mwco for ceramic uf and nf membranes various methods such as dip coating sol gel and chemical vapor deposition cvd processes have been widely used for ceramic membranes with macropores pore size over 50 nm athayde et al 2016 lee et al 2015 li 2007a despite the progress in preparation techniques current methods for preparing separation active layers still have several limitations for ceramic membranes with a tunable pore size to control their mwco precisely chen et al 2017 tsuru 2001 in more detail the previous methods cannot directly achieve a controlled and narrow pore size distribution of the separation active layer for ceramic uf and nf membranes due to the requirements for the intermediate layers smart et al 2013 van gestel et al 2014 to achieve a smaller pore size additional intermediate layers are required however cracks can occur due to surface tension when the intermediate and separation active layer on the surface of the substrate membrane is created during the drying and calcination process to avoid this difficulty a repeated coating process is inevitable smart et al 2013 as for the disadvantages of the mentioned conventional methods creating each intermediate layer and repeating the coating process which involves calcination at a high temperature cause the membrane to be extremely expensive smart et al 2013 in addition current methods require additional equipment to precisely control the mwco of the ceramic membranes by controlling complicated parameters such as the viscosity of the suspension solid concentration air condition initial membrane properties etc chen et al 2017 which are difficult to scale up for commercial use maría arsuaga et al 2013 this study demonstrates a simple and novel preparation method to fabricate ceramic membranes with a tunable mwco directly without defects or complicated processes the variously sized nanoparticles contained in the feed solution penetrated and packed into the pores previously formed on the substrate ceramic membranes then the nanoparticle sizes of the prepared ceramic membranes were correlated with packing theory and the hagen poiseuille equation and finally we proposed the equation to tune the mwco of ceramic membranes via the size of nanoparticles 2 theoretical 2 1 pore structure of the ceramic membranes 2 1 1 sphere packing theory when mono dispersed spherical particles are deposited the size of the interstitial void space or the pore size of the membrane is determined by the size of the deposited spherical particles and the mode of packing the sphere packing theory can explain the relationship between the pore size and the arrangements of the nanoparticles and the representative packing geometries corresponding to a tetrahedral octahedral hexagonal and trigonal site with mono sized spheres wang et al 2017 the radius ratio sp as interstitial voids over the radius of the sphere nanoparticle rn is 0 155 0 225 and 0 414 for the tetrahedral octahedral and hexagonal site respectively based on the sphere packing theory pesterfield 2003 in addition the packing density or porosity of nanoparticles inside a ceramic membrane also can be changed by the arrangements of homogeneous spheres theoretically it has been revealed that the ideal porosity increases in the order of the trigonal 26 0 tetrahedral 30 2 octahedral 39 5 hexagonal 39 5 and cubic site 47 6 depending on the structures of the identical packed spheres rice 1998 wilkens 1997 furthermore mono sized sphere packing can be extended to multi sized sphere packing in multi sized sphere packing the size ratio of the larger and smaller spheres θlarge θsmall and volume proportions of the two spheres should be considered to the sphere packing theory he et al 2012 shi and zhang 2008 when two different sizes of spheres are packed in a container a smaller porosity can be achieved than with a mono sized packing due to the reduction of the void space with the smaller spheres inside of the larger spheres theoretically the minimum porosity when using two sizes of spheres in a container can be 6 7 when minimizing the size of the smaller spheres yamada et al 2011 2 1 2 neck growth phenomenon a calcination process is always required to produce the final object of the ceramic membranes during the calcination process the materials are transported to promote the growth of the bonds between the particles thus the strength of the ceramic bond increases and the phenomenon is considered as neck growth kang 2004 calcination is known as one of the irreversible processes that occur by lowering the free energy of particles li 2007b and governed by diffusion surface diffusion lattice diffusion and grain boundary diffusion and vapor transport evaporation and condensation at the atomic level among them surface diffusion and grain boundary diffusion are the most important driving forces that govern the pore shapes al qudsi et al 2015 cramer 2017 in more detail the equilibrium shapes of the pores in ceramic membranes are determined by the balance between the surface and interfacial forces at the point where the nanoparticles intersect the pore rahaman 2003 the balance of forces following eq 1 1 γ g b 2 γ s v cos ψ 2 where γgb is the grain boundary tension n m γsv is the surface tension n m and ψ is the dihedral angle the pores have a circular cross section in most assume which is equivalent that ψ is 180 rahaman 2003 mass transport can occur through surface and grain boundary diffusion because of the established driving force σdf eq 2 minimizing the free surface area asv and building a strong ceramic bond during the calcination 2 σ d f γ sv r γ gb g where r is the radius of curvature of the pore and g is the grain size the change in energy of the system is given by following eq 3 3 δ e γ g b δ a g b γ s v δ a s v where the system will evolve towards a provisional equilibrium governed by the condition γ g b δ a g b γ s v δ a s v abadi et al 2011 in that situation the free surface area asv indicating membrane pores is eliminated to create a new grain boundary area agb cramer 2017 during the final stage of calcination the free surface area asv is generally decreased to 90 95 of the initial area by the neck growth phenomenon rahaman 2003 2 2 characterization of the ceramic membranes 2 2 1 calculation of the pore size based on the hagen poiseuille equation the flow of fluid through microporous membranes in laminar flow is related to the trans membrane pressure tmp pore size porosity solution viscosity and membrane thickness by the hagen

hydraulic tortuosity of porous media with spherical nanoparticles is reported with a factor ranging from 1 4 to 2 0 by numerical simulations in this study the tortuosity is fixed to 1 5 from du plessis s model which is derived from an idealized granular pore microstructure 2 2 2 stokes radius of polyethylene glycols pegs to estimate the mean effective pore size and pore size distribution of ceramic uf and nf membranes from a practical viewpoint the mwco of the membrane was analyzed using solutes such as polyethylene glycols pegs dextrans and polystyrene sulfonates psss with various molecular weights ferreira et al 2014 the stokes hydrodynamic radius of the polymers can be converted to the pore size and is described by following the stokes einstein equation eq 5 hsieh et al 1979

representative macromolecules along with dextran because of their neutral polymers that can exclude the charge effect on the membrane surface revchuk and suffet 2009 the intrinsic viscosity of peg with various molecular weights can be obtained from the following empirical eq 6 meireles et al 1995 6 η 4 9 10 4 m w 0 672 from the above mentioned eqs 5 and 6 the stokes hydrodynamic radius a of peg is given by empirical eq 7 as follows singh et al 1998 7 m w a 16 73 10 10 1 795 by ignoring the hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions between membranes pores and solute the stokes hydrodynamic radius a of peg can be considered as a membrane pore radius dp jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 lin et al 2016 zhong et al 2013 the exponential probability density can mathematically express the relationship between the stokes hydrodynamic radius a and pore size distribution as the following eq 8 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 lin et al 2016 zhong et al 2013 8 d r d p d d p 1 2 π d p ln σ p

standard deviation defined as the solute radius ratio at r 84 13 over that at r 50 following the sphere packing theory neck formation and the stokes einstein equation theoretical pore radius of ceramic membranes created from filtration coating methods can be described by following eq 9 9 dp κ s p r n where rn denotes the radius of homogeneous nanoparticles nm sp is the radius ratio radius of

prepared to pack the pores of ceramic membranes 0 5 m aluminum nitrate nonahydrate al no3 3 9h2o sigma aldrich usa and 0 01 m zirconium iv oxychloride octahydrate zrocl2 8h2o sigma aldrich usa was prepared with stirring at 200 rpm and 70 c for 6 h respectively al no3 3 9h2o zrocl2 8h2o and deionized di water were mixed at a volume ratio of 15 15 70 after gentle stirring at 200 rpm for 12 h the amount of polyvinyl alcohol pva and solution ph was controlled from 0 0 wt to 0 8 wt and from 2 0 to 3 5 respectively to control the size of the al zr nanoparticles the average radius of the nanoparticles was analyzed by digital image processing of scanning electron microscope sem images magellan 400 fei co usa and calculated by the gaussian distribution of feret s diameter measured following the longest dimension of 100 nanoparticle samples to model the packing of the pores by the al zr nanoparticles walton 1948 3 2 preparation of the ceramic membranes by the filtration coating method the preparation method of ceramic uf and nf membranes from ceramic mf membranes is explained in our previous report chung et al 2018 briefly tubular type ceramic mf membranes were prepared with α aluminum oxide al2o3 using the slip casting process to prepare the separation active layer on the ceramic mf membranes the solution containing variously sized nanoparticles was kept in a pressurized vessel as the feed for the membrane module and deposited into each ceramic mf membrane to create the packed layer inside of the membrane at a trans membrane pressure tmp of 10 bar and a cross flow velocity cfv of 15 cm s to avoid an irregular surface deposition of the nanoparticles finally the drying and calcination steps were accomplished by microwave for 3 h and an oven at 700 c for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 c min respectively 3 3 characterization of the ceramic membranes the surface and cross sectional morphology of the prepared ceramic membranes were analyzed by sem su8230 hitachi high technologies japan to obtain the average thickness of the al zr packing layer 50 images of the cross section were taken by sem from 10 pieces of prepared ceramic membranes each image was then used for calculating geometrical average using eq 11 as follows 11 δ x l 0 l δ x i d l where δ x is the average thickness of separation active layer μm l is the measured length of separation active layer in the cross section of sem images μm the pure water flux was monitored with the single tubular type ceramic membranes outer diameter of 1 6 mm and length of 80 mm at tmps of 5 8 and 10 bar with a cfv of 10 cm s the feed water was supplied using the pressurized vessel in a closed loop so that the pressure on the feed side was extremely stable during the experiment a digital pressure gage was connected to measure the tmp between the feed and permeate sides during the operation and the data were loaded into a computer in real time 3 4 mwco of the ceramic membranes to measure the mwco of the prepared ceramic membranes the initial water flux was set to 30 1 lmh with a cfv of 10 cm s during all experiments and 3 g l of poly ethylene glycols pegs with molecular weights of 200 400 1000 2000 6000 and 20 000 g mol were used as standard matters the rejection of pegs was calculated by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc of the feed and the permeate stream using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the pore size distribution of the ceramic membranes was calculated through the exponential probability density which can express the relationship between the pegs rejection r and their stokes hydrodynamic radius a of pegs as the following eq 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of prepared ceramic membranes the properties of the ceramic membranes were characterized after preparation with four different sizes of nanoparticles by the filtration coating process in fig 1 representative sem images of the nanoparticles and the prepared ceramic membrane surface and cross section are shown fig 1 a and e compare the different radius of the al zr nanoparticles rn which were prepared at the different pva dispersant concentration and ph the average radius rn of nanoparticles was determined by the average of 100 observations and the results were 21 2 3 1 nm 30 4 6 3 nm 50 7 7 9 nm and 76 2 9 7 nm respectively after the filtration coating process the nanoparticles shown in fig 1a and e were successfully deposited onto the surfaces of the ceramic membranes without any cracks and representative sem images of membrane surfaces were shown in fig 1b and c and f and g as expected the smaller size of nanoparticles with the narrow size distribution can generate relatively smaller pores fig 1c on the membrane surface compared with those of bigger nanoparticles fig 1g it is also corresponded with the measured specific flux j0 δp of the ceramic membranes in table 1 that the specific flux was increased from 2 1 0 2 lmh bar to 9 6 0 2 lmh bar as the increase of nanoparticle size from r21 2 to r76 2 in comparison to the commercially available u30 inopor germany and previously studied tsuru et al 2001 lu et al 2016 ceramic membranes which prepared by the thin layer deposition of small nanoparticles on top of ceramic membranes the prepared ceramic membranes in this study have shown slightly lower permeation flux due to the thicker filtration coating layer fig 1 d and h show the cross section of the prepared ceramic membranes r21 2 and r50 7 showing that packed layers were successfully generated inside the membrane surface by applying the tmp of 10 bar during the filtration coating process moreover fig 1d and h also show the relatively smooth membrane surface due to the applied cfv of 15 cm s during the preparation the effective thickness δx of the ceramic membranes measured by the average of 50 observations was 5 7 2 1 μm 8 1 2 5 μm 12 4 3 1 μm and 16 5 2 8 μm for nanoparticles of r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 respectively 4 2 mwco of the ceramic membranes the rejections of different molecular weights of pegs by the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 are shown in fig 2 the rejection of the ceramic membranes increased with the increase in the molecular weight of pegs the differences in the mwcos corresponding to a molecular weight with a 90 rejection of peg is responsible for variously sized nanoparticles from 21 4 to 76 2 nm used for the filtration coating process the nonlinear curve fitting with origin8 software originlab usa provides that the mwcos of the ceramic membranes prepared by nanoparticles with r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 were 980 da 1980 da 4920 da and 9970 da respectively as shown in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 the mwco value of the ceramic membranes increases when using a larger nanoparticle size due to an increase of radius of interstitial voids based on the sphere packing theory the effective pore diameter dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 can be calculated from the results of the mwco in fig 2 by the stokes einstein equation eq 5 the effective pore diameter dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was 1 6 nm 2 3 nm 3 9 nm and 5 8 nm respectively in fig 3 a the pore size distribution of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 were plotted using the exponential probability density with the pegs rejection r and their stokes hydrodynamic radius a calculated by eq 8 the geometric standard deviation σp of the pore size on the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was obtained in fig 3a as 1 31 1 39 1 53 and 1 61 respectively based on a nonlinear curve fitting of the mwco results in fig 2 from the results of the pore size distribution in fig 3a it was revealed that the filtration coating with the smaller nanoparticles can achieve not only a smaller effective pore size but also a narrow pore size distribution the similar propensity of the pore size distribution was obtained from the average of 100 observations of the membrane pore size by the digital image processing of the sem in fig 3b the average pore diameter of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 measured by the digital image processing of the sem in fig 3b was 5 8 2 5 11 4 4 2 11 6 2 2 and 20 6 10 9 nm respectively which are approximately 4 5 times bigger diameters than those calculated from the pegs rejection using the stokes einstein equation in fig 3a and table 1 according to bessières et al 1996 and singh et al 1998 the measurement of the mean pore size by digital image processing of microscopy is systematically 2 5 times larger when comparing pore dimensions with a diameter calculated from a solute rejection this difference generally can be explained as follows the membrane pore size measured by sem images corresponds to a maximum size of the pore in the case of funnel shaped pores with two dimensions while the minimal size of the pore is obtained in a filtration experiment using a solute therefore the effective pore size dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was used from the results of the solute rejection to understand the relationship between the mwco and nanoparticle size in this study a more detailed explanation will be discussed by analyzing the curve fitting model later in this paper 4 3 theoretical calculation and verification of the effective porosity the properties of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 prepared with the variously sized nanoparticles are summarized in table 1 following the results of the membrane properties the effective porosity ε of the ceramic membranes can be calculated using the hagen poiseuille equation eq 4 the results of the calculated effective porosity on the active layer were 58 2 53 3 52 7 and 58 6 for the prepared ceramic membranes using a nanoparticle radius of 21 2 3 1 nm 30 4 6 3 nm 50 7 7 9 nm and 76 2 9 7 nm respectively all the results of the porosity were higher than athe theoretical maximum porosity of 45 0 when a multi sized sphere is packed in a container he et al 2011 yamada et al 2011 which represented the randompacking with various separation thickness as shown in fig 1 in more detail the size of the packed nanoparticles are around 1 10 the size of the alumina particles in the substrate ceramic membrane when the size ratio between the larger and smaller spheres is around 10 θlarge θsmall the porosity can be from 17 3 to 41 8 depending on the volume ratio of the smaller particles being from 0 to 100 respectively farr and groot 2009 torquato et al 2000 when the proportion of smaller spheres is 25 the lowest porosity can be obtained as 17 3 on the other hand the maximum porosity of 41 8 can be achieved when the relative proportion of larger or smaller spheres is close to 100 which indicates mono sized packing in this experiment although smaller al zr nanoparticles deposited inside the pores of larger particles the complete packing with smaller particles cannot be achieved as shown in fig 1 that the active layer of the ceramic membrane exhibited the changes in coating layer thickness thus in addition to the maximum porosity of complete packing additional void volumes were taken into account thus the calculated porosities were always higher than the theoretical maximum porosity of 41 8 4 4 model prediction for the tunable mwco of the ceramic membranes fig 4 shows the relationship between the average radius of the prepared al zr nanoparticles rn for the filtration coating and the mwco of the ceramic membranes the theoretical minimum and maximum mwcos of the ceramic membranes according to the radius of the nanoparticles rn were also plotted in fig 4 the theoretical minimum and maximum mwcos were calculated based on the stokes einstein equation eq 5 with the radius ratio radius of interstitial voids radius of nanoparticles of sp which can be 0 155 tetrahedral and 0 414 hexagonal respectively by the sphere packing theory furthermore the theoretical range of minimum and maximum mwcos were also displayed with a reduction coefficient κ of pore size by neck growth phenomenon from 0 22 to 0 31 which is 90 95 decline of the initial area of the free surface at the final stage of calcination cramer 2017 rahaman 2003 regression model analysis was conducted with the data of the measured mwco value on the prepared ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 and the radius of the nanoparticles using a nonlinear curve fitting with a power function in the originlab software the results of the nonlinear curve fitting between the measured mwco and the nanoparticle size are represented in eq 12 and plotted in fig 4 eq 12 reveals a high accuracy with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9994 it indicates that the mwco of the ceramic membranes can be predicted using the curve fitting model with the variously sized nanoparticles by the filtration coating process mwc o predicted 4 0463 r n 1

insights about the relationship between the nanoparticle size and the mwco of ceramic membranes first fig 4 shows that the curve fitting model in eq 12 are successfully fitted between the theoretical minimum and maximum of mwco values based on the sphere packing theory and the stokes einstein equation more specifically curve fitting model in eq 12 is particularly located in the theoretical range of minimum mwco value which indicates the tetrahedral arrangement of nanoparticles by the sphere packing theory this can be also explained with 0 036 of κ s p value in eq 12 which is closer to 0 034 of the tetrahedral site than to 0 128 of the hexagonal site it implies that the relatively dense random packing of the al zr nanoparticles in the ceramic uf membrane pores occurred by the tmp of 10 bar during the filtration coating process second the exponent value from the curve fitting model in eq 12 was obtained as 1 806 which is in good agreement with the theoretical exponent value of 1 795 from the stokes einstein equation eq 5 the results provide strong evidence that the prediction model for mwco of ceramic membranes follows the relationship between the stokes hydrodynamic radius of the polymers and pore radius in the stokes einstein equation eq 5 hsieh et al 1979 lastly the minimum expected mwco of the ceramic membranes prepared by the filtration coating process can also be estimated as approximately 200 da when the results of the curve fitting model eq 12 are extended to a nanoparticle radius of around 10 nm this mwco value is considered as the practical range for distinctions between nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes gur reznik et al 2011 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a simple and novel filtration coating method to prepare the separation active layer of the ceramic membrane using al zr nanoparticles and a cross flow filtration system variously sized nanoparticles were successfully packed inside the substrate pores and the mwco of the prepared ceramic membranes varied from around 1000 to 10 000 g mol as the radius of the nanoparticles was changed from 20 to 80 nm respectively in addition the relationship between the size of the nanoparticles and the mwco of the ceramic membranes was successfully explained by the sphere packing theory and the stokes einstein equation moreover it was verified that the packing geometry of nanoparticles in the separation active layer of the ceramic membranes was close to the tetrahedral arrangement of nanoparticles with a maximum density due to the given tmp during the filtration coating process consequently the mwco of ceramic membranes can be precisely controlled by the preparation of variously sized nanoparticles used in this novel filtration coating method moreover the guideline from the prediction model for the mwco of ceramic membranes will help in producing reproducible ceramic membranes with precisely controlled pore sizes which can be used in industrial

achieve a concentration of desired products from a mixture in an energy efficient manner bouzerara et al 2015 mistry and maubois 2017 padaki et al 2015 while polymeric membranes have been widely used with low cost and easy fabrication their frequent replacement due to membrane damages is still a limitation of polymeric membranes in biochemical fine petrochemical and pharmaceutical industry applications requiring excellent selectivity and physicochemical durability over the last few decades ceramic membranes have gained increasing attention in membrane technology because they offer significant advantages including superior mechanical chemical and thermal stability compared with conventional polymeric membranes lee et al 2016 lee et al 2013 these advantages indicate that ceramic membranes will tolerate chemical and thermal regeneration and sterilization by high temperatures 800 c and strong chemical processes acid alkaline oxidation conditions alventosa delara et al 2012 sunarso et al 2015 ceramic membranes are usually prepared with several layers which include the substrate intermediate and separation active layers the most common method to prepare the substrate ceramic membranes is slip casting known as pouring a prepared slurry using al2o3 tio2 zro2 sio2 or a combination of these materials into a porous mold where the solvent of the suspension is extracted to form pores athayde et al 2016 bouzerara et al 2015 lee et al 2015 this slip casting method is appropriate to fabricate microfiltration mf membranes for separating suspended solids such as colloids particulates and fat from a solvent bouazizi et al 2016 to improve the separation efficiency of a dissolved solute and low molecular weight organic matter using ceramic ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membranes more accurate and precise control of the final pore size distribution is necessary generally multiple steps are required to prepare a desirable molecular weight cut off mwco for ceramic uf and nf membranes various methods such as dip coating sol gel and chemical vapor deposition cvd processes have been widely used for ceramic membranes with macropores pore size over 50 nm athayde et al 2016 lee et al 2015 li 2007a despite the progress in preparation techniques current methods for preparing separation active layers still have several limitations for ceramic membranes with a tunable pore size to control their mwco precisely chen et al 2017 tsuru 2001 in more detail the previous methods cannot directly achieve a controlled and narrow pore size distribution of the separation active layer for ceramic uf and nf membranes due to the requirements for the intermediate layers smart et al 2013 van gestel et al 2014 to achieve a smaller pore size additional intermediate layers are required however cracks can occur due to surface tension when the intermediate and separation active layer on the surface of the substrate membrane is created during the drying and calcination process to avoid this difficulty a repeated coating process is inevitable smart et al 2013 as for the disadvantages of the mentioned conventional methods creating each intermediate layer and repeating the coating process which involves calcination at a high temperature cause the membrane to be extremely expensive smart et al 2013 in addition current methods require additional equipment to precisely control the mwco of the ceramic membranes by controlling complicated parameters such as the viscosity of the suspension solid concentration air condition initial membrane properties etc chen et al 2017 which are difficult to scale up for commercial use maría arsuaga et al 2013 this study demonstrates a simple and novel preparation method to fabricate ceramic membranes with a tunable mwco directly without defects or complicated processes the variously sized nanoparticles contained in the feed solution penetrated and packed into the pores previously formed on the substrate ceramic membranes then the nanoparticle sizes of the prepared ceramic membranes were correlated with packing theory and the hagen poiseuille equation and finally we proposed the equation to tune the mwco of ceramic membranes via the size of nanoparticles 2 theoretical 2 1 pore structure of the ceramic membranes 2 1 1 sphere packing theory when mono dispersed spherical particles are deposited the size of the interstitial void space or the pore size of the membrane is determined by the size of the deposited spherical particles and the mode of packing the sphere packing theory can explain the relationship between the pore size and the arrangements of the nanoparticles and the representative packing geometries corresponding to a tetrahedral octahedral hexagonal and trigonal site with mono sized spheres wang et al 2017 the radius ratio sp as interstitial voids over the radius of the sphere nanoparticle rn is 0 155 0 225 and 0 414 for the tetrahedral octahedral and hexagonal site respectively based on the sphere packing theory pesterfield 2003 in addition the packing density or porosity of nanoparticles inside a ceramic membrane also can be changed by the arrangements of homogeneous spheres theoretically it has been revealed that the ideal porosity increases in the order of the trigonal 26 0 tetrahedral 30 2 octahedral 39 5 hexagonal 39 5 and cubic site 47 6 depending on the structures of the identical packed spheres rice 1998 wilkens 1997 furthermore mono sized sphere packing can be extended to multi sized sphere packing in multi sized sphere packing the size ratio of the larger and smaller spheres θlarge θsmall and volume proportions of the two spheres should be considered to the sphere packing theory he et al 2012 shi and zhang 2008 when two different sizes of spheres are packed in a container a smaller porosity can be achieved than with a mono sized packing due to the reduction of the void space with the smaller spheres inside of the larger spheres theoretically the minimum porosity when using two sizes of spheres in a container can be 6 7 when minimizing the size of the smaller spheres yamada et al 2011 2 1 2 neck growth phenomenon a calcination process is always required to produce the final object of the ceramic membranes during the calcination process the materials are transported to promote the growth of the bonds between the particles thus the strength of the ceramic bond increases and the phenomenon is considered as neck growth kang 2004 calcination is known as one of the irreversible processes that occur by lowering the free energy of particles li 2007b and governed by diffusion surface diffusion lattice diffusion and grain boundary diffusion and vapor transport evaporation and condensation at the atomic level among them surface diffusion and grain boundary diffusion are the most important driving forces that govern the pore shapes al qudsi et al 2015 cramer 2017 in more detail the equilibrium shapes of the pores in ceramic membranes are determined by the balance between the surface and interfacial forces at the point where the nanoparticles intersect the pore rahaman 2003 the balance of forces following eq 1 1 γ g b 2 γ s v cos ψ 2 where γgb is the grain boundary tension n m γsv is the surface tension n m and ψ is the dihedral angle the pores have a circular cross section in most assume which is equivalent that ψ is 180 rahaman 2003 mass transport can occur through surface and grain boundary diffusion because of the established driving force σdf eq 2 minimizing the free surface area asv and building a strong ceramic bond during the calcination 2 σ d f γ sv r γ gb g where r is the radius of curvature of the pore and g is the grain size the change in energy of the system is given by following eq 3 3 δ e γ g b δ a g b γ s v δ a s v where the system will evolve towards a provisional equilibrium governed by the condition γ g b δ a g b γ s v δ a s v abadi et al 2011 in that situation the free surface area asv indicating membrane pores is eliminated to create a new grain boundary area agb cramer 2017 during the final stage of calcination the free surface area asv is generally decreased to 90 95 of the initial area by the neck growth phenomenon rahaman 2003 2 2 characterization of the ceramic membranes 2 2 1 calculation of the pore size based on the hagen poiseuille

hydraulic tortuosity of porous media with spherical nanoparticles is reported with a factor ranging from 1 4 to 2 0 by numerical simulations in this study the tortuosity is fixed to 1 5 from du plessis s model which is derived from an idealized granular pore microstructure 2 2 2 stokes radius of polyethylene glycols pegs to estimate the mean effective pore size and pore size distribution of ceramic uf and nf membranes from a practical viewpoint the mwco of the membrane was analyzed using solutes such as polyethylene glycols pegs dextrans and polystyrene sulfonates psss with various molecular weights ferreira et al 2014 the stokes hydrodynamic radius of the polymers can be converted to the pore size and is described by following the stokes einstein equation eq 5 hsieh et al 1979

representative macromolecules along with dextran because of their neutral polymers that can exclude the charge effect on the membrane surface revchuk and suffet 2009 the intrinsic viscosity of peg with various molecular weights can be obtained from the following empirical eq 6 meireles et al 1995 6 η 4 9 10 4 m w 0 672 from the above mentioned eqs 5 and 6 the stokes hydrodynamic radius a of peg is given by empirical eq 7 as follows singh et al 1998 7 m w a 16 73 10 10 1 795 by ignoring the hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions between membranes pores and solute the stokes hydrodynamic radius a of peg can be considered as a membrane pore radius dp jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 lin et al 2016 zhong et al 2013 the exponential probability density can mathematically express the relationship between the stokes hydrodynamic radius a and pore size distribution as the following eq 8 jiang et al 2018 li et al 2019 lin et al 2016 zhong et al 2013 8 d r d p d d p 1 2 π d p ln σ p

standard deviation defined as the solute radius ratio at r 84 13 over that at r 50 following the sphere packing theory neck formation and the stokes einstein equation theoretical pore radius of ceramic membranes created from filtration coating methods can be described by following eq 9 9 dp κ s p r n where rn denotes the radius of homogeneous nanoparticles nm sp is the radius ratio radius of

prepared to pack the pores of ceramic membranes 0 5 m aluminum nitrate nonahydrate al no3 3 9h2o sigma aldrich usa and 0 01 m zirconium iv oxychloride octahydrate zrocl2 8h2o sigma aldrich usa was prepared with stirring at 200 rpm and 70 c for 6 h respectively al no3 3 9h2o zrocl2 8h2o and deionized di water were mixed at a volume ratio of 15 15 70 after gentle stirring at 200 rpm for 12 h the amount of polyvinyl alcohol pva and solution ph was controlled from 0 0 wt to 0 8 wt and from 2 0 to 3 5 respectively to control the size of the al zr nanoparticles the average radius of the nanoparticles was analyzed by digital image processing of scanning electron microscope sem images magellan 400 fei co usa and calculated by the gaussian distribution of feret s diameter measured following the longest dimension of 100 nanoparticle samples to model the packing of the pores by the al zr nanoparticles walton 1948 3 2 preparation of the ceramic membranes by the filtration coating method the preparation method of ceramic uf and nf membranes from ceramic mf membranes is explained in our previous report chung et al 2018 briefly tubular type ceramic mf membranes were prepared with α aluminum oxide al2o3 using the slip casting process to prepare the separation active layer on the ceramic mf membranes the solution containing variously sized nanoparticles was kept in a pressurized vessel as the feed for the membrane module and deposited into each ceramic mf membrane to create the packed layer inside of the membrane at a trans membrane pressure tmp of 10 bar and a cross flow velocity cfv of 15 cm s to avoid an irregular surface deposition of the nanoparticles finally the drying and calcination steps were accomplished by microwave for 3 h and an oven at 700 c for 3 h at a heating rate of 5 c min respectively 3 3 characterization of the ceramic membranes the surface and cross sectional morphology of the prepared ceramic membranes were analyzed by sem su8230 hitachi high technologies japan to obtain the average thickness of the al zr packing layer 50 images of the cross section were taken by sem from 10 pieces of prepared ceramic membranes each image was then used for calculating geometrical average using eq 11 as follows 11 δ x l 0 l δ x i d l where δ x is the average thickness of separation active layer μm l is the measured length of separation active layer in the cross section of sem images μm the pure water flux was monitored with the single tubular type ceramic membranes outer diameter of 1 6 mm and length of 80 mm at tmps of 5 8 and 10 bar with a cfv of 10 cm s the feed water was supplied using the pressurized vessel in a closed loop so that the pressure on the feed side was extremely stable during the experiment a digital pressure gage was connected to measure the tmp between the feed and permeate sides during the operation and the data were loaded into a computer in real time 3 4 mwco of the ceramic membranes to measure the mwco of the prepared ceramic membranes the initial water flux was set to 30 1 lmh with a cfv of 10 cm s during all experiments and 3 g l of poly ethylene glycols pegs with molecular weights of 200 400 1000 2000 6000 and 20 000 g mol were used as standard matters the rejection of pegs was calculated by measuring the dissolved organic carbon doc of the feed and the permeate stream using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the pore size distribution of the ceramic membranes was calculated through the exponential probability density which can express the relationship between the pegs rejection r and their stokes hydrodynamic radius a of pegs as the following eq 7 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of prepared ceramic membranes the properties of the ceramic membranes were characterized after preparation with four different sizes of nanoparticles by the filtration coating process in fig 1 representative sem images of the nanoparticles and the prepared ceramic membrane surface and cross section are shown fig 1 a and e compare the different radius of the al zr nanoparticles rn which were prepared at the different pva dispersant concentration and ph the average radius rn of nanoparticles was determined by the average of 100 observations and the results were 21 2 3 1 nm 30 4 6 3 nm 50 7 7 9 nm and 76 2 9 7 nm respectively after the filtration coating process the nanoparticles shown in fig 1a and e were successfully deposited onto the surfaces of the ceramic membranes without any cracks and representative sem images of membrane surfaces were shown in fig 1b and c and f and g as expected the smaller size of nanoparticles with the narrow size distribution can generate relatively smaller pores fig 1c on the membrane surface compared with those of bigger nanoparticles fig 1g it is also corresponded with the measured specific flux j0 δp of the ceramic membranes in table 1 that the specific flux was increased from 2 1 0 2 lmh bar to 9 6 0 2 lmh bar as the increase of nanoparticle size from r21 2 to r76 2 in comparison to the commercially available u30 inopor germany and previously studied tsuru et al 2001 lu et al 2016 ceramic membranes which prepared by the thin layer deposition of small nanoparticles on top of ceramic membranes the prepared ceramic membranes in this study have shown slightly lower permeation flux due to the thicker filtration coating layer fig 1 d and h show the cross section of the prepared ceramic membranes r21 2 and r50 7 showing that packed layers were successfully generated inside the membrane surface by applying the tmp of 10 bar during the filtration coating process moreover fig 1d and h also show the relatively smooth membrane surface due to the applied cfv of 15 cm s during the preparation the effective thickness δx of the ceramic membranes measured by the average of 50 observations was 5 7 2 1 μm 8 1 2 5 μm 12 4 3 1 μm and 16 5 2 8 μm for nanoparticles of r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 respectively 4 2 mwco of the ceramic membranes the rejections of different molecular weights of pegs by the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 are shown in fig 2 the rejection of the ceramic membranes increased with the increase in the molecular weight of pegs the differences in the mwcos corresponding to a molecular weight with a 90 rejection of peg is responsible for variously sized nanoparticles from 21 4 to 76 2 nm used for the filtration coating process the nonlinear curve fitting with origin8 software originlab usa provides that the mwcos of the ceramic membranes prepared by nanoparticles with r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 were 980 da 1980 da 4920 da and 9970 da respectively as shown in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 the mwco value of the ceramic membranes increases when using a larger nanoparticle size due to an increase of radius of interstitial voids based on the sphere packing theory the effective pore diameter dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 can be calculated from the results of the mwco in fig 2 by the stokes einstein equation eq 5 the effective pore diameter dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was 1 6 nm 2 3 nm 3 9 nm and 5 8 nm respectively in fig 3 a the pore size distribution of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 were plotted using the exponential probability density with the pegs rejection r and their stokes hydrodynamic radius a calculated by eq 8 the geometric standard deviation σp of the pore size on the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was obtained in fig 3a as 1 31 1 39 1 53 and 1 61 respectively based on a nonlinear curve fitting of the mwco results in fig 2 from the results of the pore size distribution in fig 3a it was revealed that the filtration coating with the smaller nanoparticles can achieve not only a smaller effective pore size but also a narrow pore size distribution the similar propensity of the pore size distribution was obtained from the average of 100 observations of the membrane pore size by the digital image processing of the sem in fig 3b the average pore diameter of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 measured by the digital image processing of the sem in fig 3b was 5 8 2 5 11 4 4 2 11 6 2 2 and 20 6 10 9 nm respectively which are approximately 4 5 times bigger diameters than those calculated from the pegs rejection using the stokes einstein equation in fig 3a and table 1 according to bessières et al 1996 and singh et al 1998 the measurement of the mean pore size by digital image processing of microscopy is systematically 2 5 times larger when comparing pore dimensions with a diameter calculated from a solute rejection this difference generally can be explained as follows the membrane pore size measured by sem images corresponds to a maximum size of the pore in the case of funnel shaped pores with two dimensions while the minimal size of the pore is obtained in a filtration experiment using a solute therefore the effective pore size dp of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 was used from the results of the solute rejection to understand the relationship between the mwco and nanoparticle size in this study a more detailed explanation will be discussed by analyzing the curve fitting model later in this paper 4 3 theoretical calculation and verification of the effective porosity the properties of the ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 prepared with the variously sized nanoparticles are summarized in table 1 following the results of the membrane properties the effective porosity ε of the ceramic membranes can be calculated using the hagen poiseuille equation eq 4 the results of the calculated effective porosity on the active layer were 58 2 53 3 52 7 and 58 6 for the prepared ceramic membranes using a nanoparticle radius of 21 2 3 1 nm 30 4 6 3 nm 50 7 7 9 nm and 76 2 9 7 nm respectively all the results of the porosity were higher than athe theoretical maximum porosity of 45 0 when a multi sized sphere is packed in a container he et al 2011 yamada et al 2011 which represented the randompacking with various separation thickness as shown in fig 1 in more detail the size of the packed nanoparticles are around 1 10 the size of the alumina particles in the substrate ceramic membrane when the size ratio between the larger and smaller spheres is around 10 θlarge θsmall the porosity can be from 17 3 to 41 8 depending on the volume ratio of the smaller particles being from 0 to 100 respectively farr and groot 2009 torquato et al 2000 when the proportion of smaller spheres is 25 the lowest porosity can be obtained as 17 3 on the other hand the maximum porosity of 41 8 can be achieved when the relative proportion of larger or smaller spheres is close to 100 which indicates mono sized packing in this experiment although smaller al zr nanoparticles deposited inside the pores of larger particles the complete packing with smaller particles cannot be achieved as shown in fig 1 that the active layer of the ceramic membrane exhibited the changes in coating layer thickness thus in addition to the maximum porosity of complete packing additional void volumes were taken into account thus the calculated porosities were always higher than the theoretical maximum porosity of 41 8 4 4 model prediction for the tunable mwco of the ceramic membranes fig 4 shows the relationship between the average radius of the prepared al zr nanoparticles rn for the filtration coating and the mwco of the ceramic membranes the theoretical minimum and maximum mwcos of the ceramic membranes according to the radius of the nanoparticles rn were also plotted in fig 4 the theoretical minimum and maximum mwcos were calculated based on the stokes einstein equation eq 5 with the radius ratio radius of interstitial voids radius of nanoparticles of sp which can be 0 155 tetrahedral and 0 414 hexagonal respectively by the sphere packing theory furthermore the theoretical range of minimum and maximum mwcos were also displayed with a reduction coefficient κ of pore size by neck growth phenomenon from 0 22 to 0 31 which is 90 95 decline of the initial area of the free surface at the final stage of calcination cramer 2017 rahaman 2003 regression model analysis was conducted with the data of the measured mwco value on the prepared ceramic membranes r21 2 r30 4 r50 7 and r76 2 and the radius of the nanoparticles using a nonlinear curve fitting with a power function in the originlab software the results of the nonlinear curve fitting between the measured mwco and the nanoparticle size are represented in eq 12 and plotted in fig 4 eq 12 reveals a high accuracy with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9994 it indicates that the mwco of the ceramic membranes can be predicted using the curve fitting model with the variously sized nanoparticles by the filtration coating process mwc o predicted 4 0463 r n 1

insights about the relationship between the nanoparticle size and the mwco of ceramic membranes first fig 4 shows that the curve fitting model in eq 12 are successfully fitted between the theoretical minimum and maximum of mwco values based on the sphere packing theory and the stokes einstein equation more specifically curve fitting model in eq 12 is particularly located in the theoretical range of minimum mwco value which indicates the tetrahedral arrangement of nanoparticles by the sphere packing theory this can be also explained with 0 036 of κ s p value in eq 12 which is closer to 0 034 of the tetrahedral site than to 0 128 of the hexagonal site it implies that the relatively dense random packing of the al zr nanoparticles in the ceramic uf membrane pores occurred by the tmp of 10 bar during the filtration coating process second the exponent value from the curve fitting model in eq 12 was obtained as 1 806 which is in good agreement with the theoretical exponent value of 1 795 from the stokes einstein equation eq 5 the results provide strong evidence that the prediction model for mwco of ceramic membranes follows the relationship between the stokes hydrodynamic radius of the polymers and pore radius in the stokes einstein equation eq 5 hsieh et al 1979 lastly the minimum expected mwco of the ceramic membranes prepared by the filtration coating process can also be estimated as approximately 200 da when the results of the curve fitting model eq 12 are extended to a nanoparticle radius of around 10 nm this mwco value is considered as the practical range for distinctions between nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes gur reznik et al 2011 5 conclusions in this study we proposed a simple and novel filtration coating method to prepare the separation active layer of the ceramic membrane using al zr nanoparticles and a cross flow filtration system variously sized nanoparticles were successfully packed inside the substrate pores and the mwco of the prepared ceramic membranes varied from around 1000 to 10 000 g mol as the radius of the nanoparticles was changed from 20 to 80 nm respectively in addition the relationship between the size of the nanoparticles and the mwco of the ceramic membranes was successfully explained by the sphere packing theory and the stokes einstein equation moreover it was verified that the packing geometry of nanoparticles in the separation active layer of the ceramic membranes was close to the tetrahedral arrangement of nanoparticles with a maximum density due to the given tmp during the filtration coating process consequently the mwco of ceramic membranes can be precisely controlled by the preparation of variously sized nanoparticles used in this novel filtration coating method moreover the guideline from the prediction model for the mwco of ceramic membranes will help in producing reproducible ceramic membranes with precisely controlled pore sizes which can be used in industrial
