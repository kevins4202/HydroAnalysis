15965,anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification is an effective method for the advanced nitrogen removal from the wastewater with limited carbon source the influence of s2o3 2 s addition on anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification was investigated by adding different concentrations of s2o3 2 s 0 39 78 156 and 312 mg l to the anammox system the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal at s2o3 2 s concentrations of 156 mg l was 75 83 and 17 25 respectively and the mixed system achieved completely nitrogen removal however anammox bioactivity was completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s concentrations up to 312 mg l and only sulfur autotrophic denitrification occurred the isotopic effects of no2 n δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 and no3 n δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 during anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification showed a gradual decrease trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the ratios of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 and δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was maintained at 1 30 2 41 and 1 36 2 52 respectively which revealed that anammox was dominant nitrogen removal pathway at s2o3 2 s concentrations less than 156 mg l microbial diversity gradually decreased with the increase of s2o3 2 s the s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification and weakened the anammox leading to a gradually decreasing trend of the proportion of candidatus brocadia as anammox bacteria from the initial 27 to 4 s2o3 2 s of 156 mg l yet norank f hydrogenophilaceae more than 50 and thiobacillus 54 as functional bacteria of autotrophic denitrification obviously increased the appropriate amount of s2o3 2 s addition promoted the performance of anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification achieved completely nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox complete nitrogen removal isotope effect microbial diversity s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification 1 introduction anammox as the most potential autotrophic nitrogen removal technology due to no need of organic carbon source and aeration energy consumption ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 is being tried to apply to the mainstream treatment of wastewater with limited carbon source du et al 2019 ma et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the no3 n generated by anammox accounted for 11 of the total nitrogen in the influent which was hard to achieve nitrogen removal arriagada et al 2017 ma et al 2020 anammox coupled with heterotrophic denitrification was an effective way to achieve simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater zhang et al 2020 du et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 the addition of organic matter enhanced the heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 but negatively influenced the autotrophic anammox zhou et al 2021 compared with heterotrophic denitrification sulfur autotrophic denitrification was an effective pathway for no3 n removal due to its high efficiency safety and economy mora et al 2015 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the coupling between anammox and sulfide dependent denitrification had been discovered in environments where sulfur and nitrogen cycles were active wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2014 which demonstrated that the combination of these two processes was sustainable in the long run moreover the inorganic electron donors of sulfur had multiple valence states and the conversion of valence states promoted electron buffering and strengthened the cycle of s and n chung et al 2014 yang et al 2020 thiosulfate s2o3 2 s became a main electron donor for autotrophic denitrification due to its high bioavailability and few by products chung et al 2014 mora et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 no3 n was reduced to no2 n in the first step of denitrification in addition no3 n was more readily available to denitrifying bacteria than no2 n zhou et al 2021 which provided the new ideas for the implementation of sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox the autotrophic complete nitrogen removal was realized through the optimization of microbial communities and operation conditions kosugi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 the implementation of the coupling process required the coexistence of autotrophic denitrification and anammox bacteria to achieve the integrated completely nitrogen removal rios del toro and cervantes 2016 kosugi et al 2020 there are very few studies on the coupling of s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification and anammox to achieve completely nitrogen removal autotrophic denitrification reduces no3 n to no2 n or directly to n2 which not only provides no2 n to anammox but also reduces no3 n generated by anammox the changes of denitrifying activity was an effective tool to analyze the nitrogen transformation pathways which revealed the contribution of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal li et al 2020 ganesan and vadivelu 2020 previous studies showed that the denitrification activity was stronger at low temperature 14 18 c while the anammox activity was stronger at high temperature 28 33 c during nitrogen removal weiqiang et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the autotrophic denitrification rate was 3 4 times higher than that of anammox when no2 n was insufficient yang et al 2020 and s2o3 2 s was still oxidized in the absence of electron acceptor which facilitated the disproportionation phenomenon qian et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however whether this phenomenon occurred in the integrated system needed further analysis the changes of activity could indicate the difference between the denitrification and anammox but could not quantify the ratio of their contribution isotope tracing technology was an effective method to reveal the contribution of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal the autotrophic denitrification anammox process was successfully operated when the molar ratios of nh4 n no3 n and s2o3 2 no3 n were 0 75 and 0 85 respectively in this process no3 n was converted to no2 n or no by sulfur bacteria using s2o3 2 as electron donor and then no2 n was utilized by anammox yang et al 2020 therefore the amount of s2o3 2 in raw wastewater was an important factor influencing the synergy of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox both nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopes in fixed nitrogen compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were fractionated during the nitrogen cycle kobayashi et al 2019 casciotti 2016 thus the fractionation effect of natural abundance could reveal the isotope ratios of 15n 14n and 18o 16o which characterized the nitrogen transformation and the reaction processes nishizawa et al 2016 however the degree of fractionation and operating characteristics were still unknown to the integrated anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification which has not been reported the exploration and discovery of the sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox provided a guarantee for the stable operation of long term autotrophic nitrogen removal the feasibility analysis of the coupled process was carried out using direct addition of s2o3 2 s into anammox on this basis the dual isotope fractionation technique was used to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal and the synergistic mechanisms the exploration and analysis of microbial diversity was used to provide a theoretical basis for the long term stable operation of the coupled system 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of anammox sludge and batch tests of s2o3 2 s addition the anammox activated sludge was cultivated using synthetic wastewater and the wastewater compositions were

respectively total 58 cycles was operated the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was maintained at 7000 8000 mg l and the temperature was maintained at 25 30 c the successfully cultured anammox sludge was used as the seed sludge for the batch test 500 ml serum bottle the batch tests were performed in 500 ml serum bottles nh4 n was maintained at 59 0 5 mg l and no2 n was 79 0

thermo scientific usa 2 3 isotope tracer test to explore the contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification to nitrogen removal the 15n stable isotope labeling compounds k15no3 or 15nh4cl were used in the batch tests of isotope tracer table 1 2 ml of sludge was put into 20 ml headspace bottle flush ar to reduce the effect of air 28n2 water was blown off with ar for 60 min and then was added into the headspace bottle and the cap was tightened without substrate the headspace bottle was incubated at 150 r min continuous rotation the sludge was starved for 24 h to remove residual substrate before performing the tracer test and different concentrations of s2o3 2 s were added to match the amount of s2o3 2 s during the incubation phase a was the experimental group to distinguish the contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification b was the control group which supplemented and coordinated the contribution distribution the purpose of group b was to facilitate the calculation of the total amount of n2 and the correction of the total amount for the group a c was the validation group which verified whether autotrophic denitrification actually occurred d was the validation group which verified whether anammox indeed occur meanwhile the air was used as a reference standard for calibration the calculation method of 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 produced by anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification are provided in the supplementary material 2 4 isotope effects analysis 2 4 1 the nitrogen conversion methods the stable isotope technology was used to analyze nitrogen conversion pathways both no2 n and no3 n in anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification needed to be converted to n2o and n2 isotope ratio analysis was performed by isotope mass spectrometry 253plus thermo usa optimization was performed on the basis of the original chemical transformation method ryabenko et al 2009 and the transformation operation steps were briefly described as follows no3 n ammonium zinc cadmium method firstly 5 ml of water sample was put into a 20 ml headspace bottle and sulphamic acid was added to remove no2 n to ensure the accuracy of no3 n determination the ph was adjusted to 6 8 while ammonium chloride cadmium and clean zinc rolls were added separately to convert no3 n to no2 n after the headspace bottle was sealed the mixture of sodium azide acetic acid was added and incubated in a constant temperature oscillator the reaction was terminated by adding naoh at the end of the reaction which was ready for mass spectrometric determination 2 4 2 isotope analysis isotopic analyses were often resolved using the conventional delta δ notion with air and vienna standard mean ocean water as reference standards for δ15n and δ18o respectively santoro and casciotti 2011 mariotti et al 1981 in order to reduce the influence of the conversion pathway on the isotopic ratios the usgs32 usgs34 and usgs35 were used as standards for the isotopic correction of n and o during the chemical conversion of no3 n to n2o jin et al 2021 and the reproducibility was determined which met the accuracy range kno2 and nano2 were used as reference substances for calibration in the no2 n conversion process the calibration was first performed by an elemental analyzer using standards usgs32 and usgs35 which were then used as calibration standards for no2 n conversion 2 5 microbial diversity analysis anammox sludge with different s2o3 2 s additions was taken after the system reached stability the sludge was centrifuged frozen and

scientific usa the v3 v4 high variable region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa the purified pcr product was used to construct a sequence library and the bacterial community structure information was obtained through database analysis the sequenced raw sequences were submitted to the sequence read archive sra database on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different s2o3 2 s addition on anammox anammox was gradually applied to the mainstream nitrogen removal in actual wastewater treatment the anammox culture process was shown in fig s1 anammox was successfully cultured after a long period of incubation to achieve efficient removal of nh4 n and no2 n yet the production of no3 n limited the complete nitrogen removal sulfur compounds provided a reliable electron donor for autotrophic denitrification to achieve the complete nitrogen removal in this study the effect of different thiosulfate additions on the stability of the anammox system and anammox coupling s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification was investigated to achieve completely nitrogen removal fig 1 presents the effect of s2o3 2 s additions on anammox performance the seed sludge of 5 reactors was taken from the successfully cultured anammox system at without s2o3 2 s addition the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were low and the removal rate of nh4 n and no2 n was as high as 99 fig s2a and the effluent no3 n concentration accumulated to more than 30 mg l fig 1a although anammox presented good performance completely nitrogen removal could not be achieved due to the accumulation of no3 n when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 39 0 4 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration showed a gradual increasing trend from 1 to 5 cycles fig 1b and then the effluent concentration of nh4 n gradually decreased the removal of no2 n was less affected by the amount of s2o3 2 s addition fig 1b the effluent concentration of no3 n first increased and then decreased and then gradually stabilized at 25 28 mg l fig 1b which was lower than without the addition of s2o3 2 s fig 1a the addition of small amounts of s2o3 2 s promoted the reduction of no3 n indicating that the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria was more easily promoted in the anammox system but the amount of no3 n removal was limited by the addition of s2o3 2 s the tn nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 80 1 3 fig s2b s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l the no3 n was more readily available to autotrophic denitrification and s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification utilized no3 n to a much greater extent than no2 n chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 which promoted no2 n accumulation and avoid the competition with anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 78 0 6 mg l the effluent nh4 n and no2 n both showed fluctuations before 40 cycles and the maximum effluent concentrations were 13 25 0 32 mg l and 23 19 0 42 mg l respectively fig 1c the effluent nh4 n and no2 n stabilized below 1 mg l after 40 cycles the effluent concentration of no3 n first increased and then decreased and finally stabilized at 16 18 mg l which was less than that of s2o3 2 s of 39 0 4 mg l fig 1b when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 156 1 2 mg l the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n gradually increased fig 1d and the effluent concentration of nh4 n was as high as 19 82 0 21 mg l cycle14 the effluent concentration of no2 n was 18 57 0 32 mg l cycle 8 it indicated that the nitrogen removal performance of anammox was affected at the initial stage however as the reaction proceeded the effluent nh4 n and no2 n gradually decreased and anammox activity gradually recovered the effluent no3 n showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing and the effluent concentration was below 1 mg l after the system reached stable operation fig 1d the tn nitrogen removal rate was as high as 98 fig s2d s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l it showed that anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification successfully achieved completely nitrogen removal at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l sulfur autotrophic denitrification could completely transform the no3 n produced by anammox and the produced no2 n could be further utilized by anammox the sulfur autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria synergistically achieved the efficient nitrogen removal and there was no residual nh4 n in the effluent indicating that the contribution of anammox was greater than that of autotrophic denitrification only when the generated no3 n was completely consumed autotrophic denitrification competed with anammox for electron donors of no2 n the competitive relationship did not cause the surplus of nh4 n because no3 n was continuously generated in anammox and the generated no3 n was continuously used by denitrifying bacteria when the substrate was insufficient no2 n was used by denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal the differential degree of no3 n and no2 n utilization by autotrophic denitrification promoted the implementation of the integrated process s0 driven autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox for nitrogen removal was found to preferentially utilize no3 n as an electron acceptor to complete denitrification in which the no2 n and n2 were products chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 s0 coupled nh4 n and no2 n were found to accomplish completely denitrification in the presence of the mixed bacteria through the relationship of stoichiometry chen et al 2018 2019 during the shortcut nitrification anammox coupled autotrophic denitrification no3 n was preferentially utilized by the autotrophic denitrification which continuously provided no2 n to the anammox reaction system and greatly increased the tn loss the synergy between the microorganisms promoted the implementation of the coupled process zhang et al 2020 when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was increased to 312 1 5 mg l the nh4 n was basically not removed the nh4 n nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 0 2 fig s2e s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l however the effluent no2 n concentration increased and then decreased and finally reached a stable level below 1 mg l fig 1e the no2 n nitrogen removal rate was as high as 99 fig s2e s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l it indicated that the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the reduction of no2 n the effluent concentration of no3 n was maintained at a high level at the beginning of the reaction the addition of high concentration s2o3 2 s inhibited the anammox yet promoted the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification in summary sulfur autotrophic denitrification was promoted by adding s2o3 2 s to the anammox system when the concentration of s2o3 2 s increased from 39 0 4 mg l to 156 1 2 mg l anammox performance was not influenced and maintained stable operation the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification increased with the increase of the s2o3 2 s addition when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 156 1 2 mg l the completely nitrogen removal was successfully achieved through anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification the addition of high s2o3 2 s concentration promoted the efficient nitrogen removal by autotrophic denitrification while inhibited the anammox process the complete nitrogen removal was difficult to achieve due to the residual effluent nh4 n therefore the appropriate addition of s2o3 2 s favored the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification and provided a guarantee for the coupling process to achieve completely nitrogen removal 3 2 characterization of s valence transformation at different s2o3 2 s addition s2o3 2 s became a main electron donor for autotrophic denitrification due to few by products the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification in the anammox system which was accompanied by the cycle of sulfur valence s2o3 2 s reacted with no3 n in a certain ratio to generate n2 in the autotrophic denitrification system according to literature data the reaction equation was as following mora et al 2014 yang et al 2020 1 s2o3 2 1 16no3 0 124h2o 0 035co2 0 519hco3 0 11nh4 2so4 2 0 578n2 0 435h 0 110c5h7o2n the s2o3 2 s was mainly oxidized to of so4 2 s which maybe also produced other valence sulfur in the mixed culture system in this experiment xps revealed the changes of s valence state in the different s2o3 2 s addition system fig 2 the signal intensity of s2 showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the addition of a small amount of s2o3 2 promoted the formation of s2 indicating that the addition of s2o3 2 to anammox generated s2 meanwhile the addition of s2o3 2 s s2 also promoted the generation of s4 and the larger the amount of s2 added the more s4 was produced so4 2 s s6 as the end product of the reaction showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition it has been found that a part of s2o3 2 s formed an electron buffer during s2o3 2 s conversion and the complex of periplasmic multienzyme oxidized s2o3 2 s to so4 2 s but no other valence sulfur was formed appia ayme et al 2001 another pathway was to form the conspicuous globules of polymeric water insoluble sulfur accumulation as a transient or final product during s2o3 2 s oxidation the intermediates either derived from a reductive cleavage of the molecule or incomplete sox enzyme system meyer et al 2007 yang et al 2020 the involvement of s2o3 2 s in the reaction process served as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification and other conversion pathways promoted the formation of intermediates for electron buffering which could be used for the removal of anammox by products yang et al 2020 in summary the addition of s2o3 2 s drove the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox in addition the other valence states of sulfur s2 s4 and s6 continued to participate in the reaction to form an electron buffering effect for completely nitrogen removal 3 3 nitrogen transformation and contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification to nitrogen removal s2o3 2 s addition as the main electron donor improved the removal efficiencies of no3 n yet the long term addition of s2o3 2 s competed with anammox for no2 n the no3 n generated by the anammox without s2o3 2 s addition was close to the theoretical value the removal of no3 n increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration however when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 312 1 5 mg l anammox was inhibited and no2 n was removed by the autotrophic denitrification fig 3 shows the nitrogen distribution at the end of reaction in different s2o3 2 s addition systems at without addition of s2o3 2 s no n2o was produced and the effluent of no3 n was as high as 13 17 fig 3a as the addition of s2o3 2 s increased from 39 0 4 mg l to 156 1 2 mg l the effluent percentage of no3 n decreased from 9 02 to 0 and no3 n was completely removed the generated n2o increased from 1 48 to 6 15 it indicated that the addition of s2o3 2 s enhanced the autotrophic denitrification nevertheless it increased the generation of n2o the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l limited the process of no3 n generation by anammox and no2 n became the electron acceptor for denitrification there was no accumulation of n2o due to the high s2o3 2 s concentration however the percentage of nh4 n was as high as 43 17 and the complete nitrogen removal was not achieved due to anammox inhibition the isotope tracing technology revealed the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal fig 4 the pre culture without substrate was carried out to reduce the influence of substrates and metabolites on the system the r2 r5 produced n2 in the validation c group indicating the presence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification process r2 r4 produced n2 in the validation d group indicating the presence of anammox process at without the addition of s2o3 2 s 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 was not detected in the experimental group and the denitrification process of no3 n was not achieved which led to the failure of anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 39 0 4 mg l autotrophic denitrification gradually took effect the percentage of sulfur autotrophic denitrification decreased from 45 4 h to 35 24 h while anammox increased from 55 4 h to 65 24 h fig 4a the percentage of anammox decreased from 76 4 h to 38 24 h with s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l while the percentage of autotrophic denitrification increased from 24 4 h to 62 24 h fig 4b the percentage of autotrophic denitrification was gradually enhanced up to 75 83 with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition 156 1 2 mg l while anammox was only 17 25 at this time fig 4c the complete nitrogen removal was achieved when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 156 1 2 mg l no3 n produced by anammox was utilized by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria to successfully achieve completely nitrogen removal by autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l n2 came from autotrophic denitrification in summary the appropriate addition of s2o3 2 s was beneficial to achieve autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox but excessive addition led to the deterioration of anammox performance 3 4 denitrification performance and isotope fractionation effects in typical cycle operation the coupling of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification provided a guarantee for complete nitrogen removal which promoted the migration and transformation of n and o elements nh4 n was utilized only by anammox while sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox worked together for the removal or production of no2 n and no3 n s2o3 2 s as an electron donor was directly involved in the removal of no2 n and no3 n by autotrophic denitrification thus affecting the translocation of n and o isotopes during the reaction the isotopic variation characteristics of no2 n and no3 n were analyzed during the typical cycle operation the long term addition of s2o3 2 s enhanced the nitrogen removal by anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification however the denitrification effect showed obvious variability due to the different amounts of s2o3 2 s addition the analysis of typical cycle operation could reveal the characteristics of migration and transformation of n and o 3 4 1 denitrification performance analysis of typical cycle fig s3 presents the denitrification performance and so4 2 s generation characteristics analysis in typical cycles at without the addition of s2o3 2 s nh4 n and no2 n were gradually removed and the effluent concentration of no3 n was as high as 14 89 0 32 mg l fig s3 a the nitrogen variation characteristics at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l were basically the same as those without the s2o3 2 s addition the effluent concentration of no3 n was reduced to 12 29 0 23 mg l due to the effect of s2o3 2 s and the concentration of so4 2 s 22 27 0 43 mg l was lower than the addition amount of s2o3 2 s when the s2o3 2 s concentration were maintained at 78 156 mg l there was a significant lag in denitrification effect the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification made the effluent concentration of so4 2 s at 50 27 95 09 mg l which was lower than the amount of s2o3 2 s addition anammox was completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s addition of 312 1 5 mg l and the effluent concentration of nh4 n was close to the influent concentration autotrophic denitrification with no2 n as the electron acceptor played a dominant role the effluent concentration of so4 2 s was 251 21 1 6 mg l regardless of the dosage of s2o3 2 s the produced so4 2 s was significantly lower than the s2o3 2 s xps results indicated the existence of other valence states of s s2 s4 and s6 fig 2 3 4 2 dynamic response of isotope during typical cycle operation the electron donor addition not only affected the removal and conversion of no2 n and no3 n but also affected the migration and conversion of isotopes the intermittent operation mode was adopted in the typical cycle the nitrification performance and isotopic conversion characteristics were determined by the initial conditions that is the closed system operation was used the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification accompanied with the conversion of n and o elements fig 5 presents the conversion characteristics of n and o isotopes during the removal of no2 n and no3 n δ15nno2 showed a gradual decrease during the reaction the decrease rate of δ15nno2 slowed with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition fig 5a the changes of δ15nno2 in r1 r4 showed obvious inverse isotope effects previous studies explored the n and o isotopic effects of three different anammox bacteria including ca s japonica ca j caeni and ca b sinica δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed significant inverse isotopic effects during no2 n removal and the inverse isotopic effects produced significant differences due to the differences in bacterial species brunner et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2019 the δ15nno2 was basically maintained at 23 r1 r4 when the microorganisms gradually adapted to the environment and no2 n was completely removed the sulfur autotrophic denitrification included to the conversion of no3 n to no2 n and no2 n further reduced to n2o and n2 which caused the change of δ15nno2 when the no2 n was completely removed at the end of the reaction δ15nno2 was basically the same r2 r4 at without the addition of s2o3 2 s r1 δ15nno2 was 23 53 the δ15nno2 indicated that anammox dominated the efficient removal of no2 n in r1 r4 when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l the δ15nno2 decreased from 14 21 to 16 85 which was significantly different from other systems anammox was inhibited and no2 n was removed mainly by sulfur autotrophic denitrification when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l resulting in a small decline of δ15nno2 δ15nno2 was maintained at 15 8 6 9 in the pure culture of bacterial denitrification bacteria sutka et al 2006 casciotti 2009 and at 29 3 6 0 in fungal denitrification rohe et al 2014 in contrast no2 n reduction of nitrifying bacteria resulted in strong isotope effects with a mean δ15nno2 of 34 45 0 66 sutka et al 2003 2004 as shown in fig 5 b δ18ono2 gradually decreased when the reaction showed an obvious inverse isotope effect r1 r4 the denitrification process and the o atoms exchange caused the change of δ18ono2 the change of δ18ono2 included 1 transport and delivery of no2 n by the anammoxosome 2 oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by binding o in water and 3 contributing to the accumulation of heavy isotopes in no2 n knöller et al 2011 the reversible transporter realized the input of no3 n into the cytoplasm and no3 n was reduced to produce no2 n in the process of denitrification by the loss of o atoms it has also been found that the oxygen equilibrium isotope effect was maintained at 14 0 14 4 casciotti et al 2007 meanwhile s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s were present in the denitrification process as reactant and product and the replacement and equilibrium effect of oxygen also affected the migration and conversion of oxygen in the denitrification system margalef marti et al 2019 contrastively no2 n was removed only by sulfur autotrophic denitrification when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l fig 1e and δ18ono2 showed a gradually increasing trend fig 5b when no2 n as electron acceptors was reduced the o in the water promoted the oxygen balance and affected the isotope migration and transformation which enhanced the oxygen fractionation effect in addition the concentration changes of s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s also affected the oxygen fractionation effect in no2 n removal in summary the reactors dominated by anammox r1 and sulfur autotrophic denitrification r5 showed significant differences in δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 the dynamic changes of isotopes in the process of no2 n removal could be used to distinguish anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification processes when sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox acted together in the no2 n removal the δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 changed accordingly with the adjustment of the addition amount no3 n as a product of anammox was gradually accumulated in the system without the addition of s2o3 2 s r1 while s2o3 2 s addition made no3 n gradually decrease fig s1b e the accumulation and removal of no3 n in the four systems r1 r4 resulted in a gradual decrease of both δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 fig 5c d the utilization rate of heavy isotopes was slower than that of light isotopes in the process of no3 n accumulation which made light isotopes preferentially accumulate no3 n was gradually removed with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration δ15nno3 changed from 3 54 50 63 r1 to 5 12 26 93 r4 and δ18ono3 changed from 14 11 25 39 r1 to 5 23 11 95 r4 the change range of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 was significantly low the successful coupling of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox achieved the simultaneous production and removal of no3 n which drove the utilization of light and heavy isotopes and thus affected the fractionation of n and o isotopes of no3 n in the r1 r4 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 driven by anammox were combined with the contribution of autotrophic denitrification for no3 n removal in the mixed systems the no3 n removal increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration but the changes of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were small in the r1 without s2o3 2 s addition the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 showed a significant isotopic effect during anammox fig 5c d in a separate autotrophic denitrification along with no3 n reduction light isotopes were utilized in preference to heavy isotopes resulting in a gradual increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 liu et al 2021 the accumulation of heavy isotopes was also frequently observed in the removal of no3 n from natural waters and heterotrophic denitrification wunderlich et al 2012 margalef marti et al 2019 the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration enhanced the autotrophic denitrification and thus complemented the decrease of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 caused by anammox isotope effects were weaker for bacterial pure culture studies bpc with δ15nno3 values ranging between 36 7 and 10 mean 25 2 8 4 lewicka szczebak et al 2014 barford et al 1999 2015 the relatively weak isotopic effect in the removal of no3 n by autotrophic denitrification interacted with the stronger isotopic effect in the generation of no3 n by anammox which resulted in a slow decreasing trend of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 with increasing s2o3 2 s concentration in summary the dynamic response of isotopes in the denitrification process achieved by sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox could reveal the transformation characteristics of nitrogen and the isotope effect was biased toward the autotrophic denitrification process with increasing s2o3 2 s concentration 3 4 3 the dynamic relationship between δ15n and δ18o during typical cycle operation the rayleigh model was more appropriate to elaborate the fractionation effects of n and o isotope in a single reaction 15 ε or 18 ε mariotti et al 1981 and the variation characteristics of no2 n could be analyzed comprehensively by δ15nno2 δ18ono2 in denitrification involving multiple reactions fig 6 shows the characteristics of n and o migration and transformation in the process of no2 n removal in order to better understand the dynamic relationship between δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 in the no2 n removal process the proportional relationship analysis with δ18ono2 as the horizontal coordinate and δ15nno2 as the vertical coordinate revealed that δ15nno2 had an increase trend with the increase of δ18ono2 r1 r4 which showed a certain correlation fig 6b the slope of δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration the maximum slope was 2 41 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l while the slope was 1 30 at the concentration of 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the maximum value of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 was between the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 and 156 1 2 mg l the characteristics of no2 n removal at s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l was basically the same as that without the addition of s2o3 2 s in the typical cycle denitrification process it indicated that no2 n removal process was not affected when s2o3 2 s was 78 0 6 mg l fig s1c however the no2 n removal was lagged significantly when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 156 1 2 mg l fig s1d indicating that the optimum s2o3 2 s concentration was in the range of 78 156 mg l the characteristics of no2 n removal were consistent with the change characteristics of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 indicating that the dynamic relationship of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 could indirectly guide the optimal addition of s2o3 2 s when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 312 1 5 mg l δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed a negative correlation which was obviously different from the others fig 6b δ15nno2 showed a slow decreasing trend fig 5a while δ18ono2 showed a gradual increasing trend fig 5b and the o heavy isotopes were accumulated in summary the reduction of no3 n the oxidation of no2 n the reduction of no2 n and the o atom balance between no2 n and h2o worked together to promote the dynamic distribution of δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 meanwhile these processes occurred simultaneously in the coupled system instead of in a stepwise manner but this did not affect the characteristics analysis of no2 n isotopic changes martin and casciotti 2017 buchwald and casciotti 2013 the dynamic effects of the isotopes in this experiment were the result of multiple reactions δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 gradually exhibited the characteristics of autotrophic denitrification with increasing s2o3 2 s addition r1 r5 which was consistent with the denitrification performance with different s2o3 2 s addition amount meanwhile there was the exchange of o between no2 n and h2o during the reaction which affected the fractionation characteristics martin and casciotti 2016 buchwald and casciotti 2013 fig 7 presents the characteristics of n and o migration and transformation in the process of no3 n removal the changes of no3 n were derived from anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification thus the changes in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were attributed to the combined effect of both the increase of s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the sulfur autotrophic denitrification and reduced the fractionation of light and heavy isotopes resulting in the reduction of δ15nno3 from 50 63 3 54 to 26 93 5 13 fig 7a while δ18ono3 reduced from 25 39 14 11 to 11 95 5 23 fig 7c the stronger the autotrophic denitrification was the faster the reaction rate was which was not conducive to the fractionation of n and o isotopes in no3 n δ15nno3 showed a gradually increasing trend with the increase of δ18ono3 which showed a good correlation fig 7b the slope increased from 1 36 to 2 52 at the s2o3 2 s concentration from 0 to 78 0 6 mg l while the slope decreased from 2 52 to 2 27 when the s2o3 2 s concentration increased to 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the maximum value of δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was between 78 0 6 and 156 1 2 mg l of s2o3 2 s no3 n was not produced at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l and no data analysis was performed the isotope ratio also had the same slope change characteristics for the process of no2 n removal and the change characteristics as the process of no2 n removal and the change characteristics of δ15nno3 δ18ono3 could also indicate the optimal addition amount of s2o3 2 s δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was close to 1 in autotrophic denitrification or heterotrophic denitrification casciotti et al 2013 martin and casciotti 2016 anammox still dominated in the nitrogen removal no3 n produced in anammox was utilized by autotrophic denitrification and the no3 n removal were positively correlated to s2o3 2 s addition fig 1a d the removal of no3 n by sulfur autotrophic denitrification increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the oxidation of no2 n to no3 n and the reduction of no3 n by autotrophic denitrification also involved the uptake and exchange of o in h2o with no2 n and no3 n while the addition of s2o3 2 s and the production of so4 2 s also affected the fractionation of o isotopes the fractionation of n atoms came from the formation and removal of no3 n while the exchange or substitution between no2 n and no3 n was relatively small in kinetic isotopes of n which was often not considered marine denitrification and assimilation reduction of no3 n decomposed n and o isotopes in a ratio of 1 1 casciotti et al 2002 the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was 1 13 in the process of anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification of freshwater bodies and the expression of both the n and o isotope fractionation in the water column can be significantly reduced at multiple spatial scales wenk et al 2014 the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 higher than 1 may be related to the differential expression of n o isotopes at the enzyme level there are four types of nitrate reductases bacterial membrane bound denitrification nar periplasmic denitrification nap cytoplasmic denitrification nas and eukaryotic denitrification euknr kritee et al 2012 wenk et al 2014 sulfurovum sp nbc37 1 and sulfurimonas denitrificans also contained nap in sulfide dependent denitrification of freshwater ecosystems which affected the migration and transformation of isotopes sievert et al 2008 no2 n and no3 n maybe also come from the nitrification process although the rate of nitrification was not directly monitored nitrifying bacteria could also complete the oxidation of nh4 n in a low do environment brunner et al 2013 the oxidation process of nh4 n decreased δ15nno2 and δ15nno3 wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2014 which were involved in nitrogen transformation this study did not distinguish individual reactions and only considered the isotope fractionation caused by the main denitrification process 3 5 microbial diversity analysis the dynamic changes of microbial community structure were analyzed at different s2o3 2 s addition r1 r5 otus showed a gradual decrease trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition amount fig s4 the microbial diversity shannon index and simpson index and community richness also showed a decrease trend table s1 indicating that excessive s2o3 2 s addition decreased the diversity of microbial community structure the depth coverage of microbial sequencing was above 99 table s1 indicating that the obtained sequence data could characterize the community structure of microbes genus based venn map showed the commonalities and differences of microbial community among the five reactors the number of unique otus in r1 r4 gradually decreased 32 16 2 3 with the s2o3 2 s concentration increasing from 0 to 156 1 2 mg l the anammox activities were significantly inhibited at the s2o3 2 s concentrations up to 312 1 5 mg l fig 1e and thus no2 n was utilized by s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification which promoted the differences of microbial community structure in r5 the number of unique otus in r5 was much more than that in r3 and r4 fig s4 proteobacteria planctomycetota chloroflexi and bacteroidota were dominant phyla fig s5 proteobacteria showed a significant increasing trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition while the other three phyla showed a gradual decrease trend 13 to 85 indicating that the s2o3 2 s addition changed the structure of microbial communities proteobacteria became the most dominant phylum in s2o3 2 s addition systems and most autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria belonged to proteobacteria yang et al 2020 planctomycetota contained all the genera of anammox gonzalez martinez et al 2015 the increase of s2o3 2 s addition limited the anammox process when the concentration of s2o3 2 s reached 312 1 5 mg l anammox was completely inhibited and the percentage of planctomycetota phylum was only 1 chloroflexi was reported as a coexistent in anammox reactors because its members degraded anammox bacterial cell materials tomonori et al 2012 chloroflexi was also the main phylum in autotrophic denitrification systems and the improvement of denitrification performance contributed to the increase in the percentage of functional phyla sun et al 2020 chen et al 2017 the percentage of chloroflexi increased to 8 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l fig 8 presented the microbial community at the genus level in different s2o3 2 s addition systems nitrospira as a functional microorganism of nitrification reaction tatari et al 2017 wahman and speitel 2015 accounted for 6 in r1 without s2o3 2 s addition which showed a significant decreasing trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition which accounted for up to 6 without s2o3 2 s addition fig 8 that suggested that s2o3 2 s addition had a negative impact on nitrification the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification and made the coupled system easily maintain an anaerobic environment resulting in a decrease in the proportion of nitrospira meanwhile the presence of nitrospira reduced the do in the wastewater which maintained a good anaerobic environment for the anammox candidatus brocadia completed the denitrification process as a functional microorganism of anammox process candidatus brocadia as a functional microorganism of anammox accounted for 27 in r1 without s2o3 2 s addition and the system achieved efficient removal of nh4 n and no2 n fig 1a the s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification and weakened the anammox leading to a gradually decreasing trend of the proportion of candidatus brocadia 22 3 4 and 1 fig 8 thiobacillus as a functional microorganism of autotrophic denitrification showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s the percentage of thiobacillus increased from 6 s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l to 54 s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l indicating the role of s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification was gradually enhanced the relative abundance of norank f hydrogenophilaceae increased and then decreased and the highest percentage was 65 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l but the percentage of abundance was only 3 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l the excessive s2o3 2 s not only inhibited the normal metabolism of candidatus brocadia but also significantly reduced the percentage of norank f hydrogenophilaceae contrastively thiobacillus and norank f hydrogenophilaceae acted as functional microorganisms for autotrophic denitrification which were not detected in r1 system of anammox without s2o3 2 s addition zhou et al 2021 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 meanwhile norank f hydrogenophilaceae proliferated rapidly in the reactors with s2o3 2 s addition resulting in the decrease of anammox abundance gong et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the increase of s2o3 2 s addition limited the denitrification process of anammox nevertheless it promoted sulfur autotrophic denitrification the advanced nitrogen removal was achieved in r4 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the above mentioned candidatus brocadia 4 thiobacillus 40 and norank f hydrogenophilaceae 40 related to anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification mainly contributed to the nitrogen removal comamonas only appeared in the r5 system with a s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l in this case the anammox basically did not play a role and only the autotrophic denitrification occurred fig 1e however comamonas frequently appeared in the processes of sulfate reduction anammox and partial nitrification kosugi et al 2020 and the abundance obviously varied with the changes of seasonal temperature zhou et al 2021 the s2o3 2 s addition promoted the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification synergy of multiple microorganisms related to nitrification anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification achieved completely nitrogen removal in this study the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal was successfully distinguished by natural abundance isotope effect and labeled nitrogen tracing technique the isotopic characteristics provided a technical means to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen losses and nitrogen transformation pathways in actual sewage denitrification the coexistence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox bacteria in the coupling system was also revealed by microbial diversity which provided a reliable basis for the effective application of nitrogen removal process the successful performance of sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox provided a new way of low energy consumption for the treatment of actual sewage with limited carbon sources 4 conclusion 1 the addition of s2o3 2 s realized the completely nitrogen removal of anammox coupled with autotrophic denitrification and the optimal addition range was 78 156 mg l the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal was 75 83 and 17 25 respectively 2 the isotope effects of n and o in no2 n and no3 n revealed the influence mechanism of s2o3 2 s addition on the coupling process which was able to successfully distinguish the contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification to the nitrogen removal 3 the microbial diversity was negatively correlated with the increase of s2o3 2 s the coexistence of autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria could be promoted at s2o3 2 s concentrations of 39 156 mg l candidatus brocadia as the important anammox bacteria were completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s concentrations

15965,anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification is an effective method for the advanced nitrogen removal from the wastewater with limited carbon source the influence of s2o3 2 s addition on anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification was investigated by adding different concentrations of s2o3 2 s 0 39 78 156 and 312 mg l to the anammox system the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal at s2o3 2 s concentrations of 156 mg l was 75 83 and 17 25 respectively and the mixed system achieved completely nitrogen removal however anammox bioactivity was completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s concentrations up to 312 mg l and only sulfur autotrophic denitrification occurred the isotopic effects of no2 n δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 and no3 n δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 during anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification showed a gradual decrease trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the ratios of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 and δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was maintained at 1 30 2 41 and 1 36 2 52 respectively which revealed that anammox was dominant nitrogen removal pathway at s2o3 2 s concentrations less than 156 mg l microbial diversity gradually decreased with the increase of s2o3 2 s the s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification and weakened the anammox leading to a gradually decreasing trend of the proportion of candidatus brocadia as anammox bacteria from the initial 27 to 4 s2o3 2 s of 156 mg l yet norank f hydrogenophilaceae more than 50 and thiobacillus 54 as functional bacteria of autotrophic denitrification obviously increased the appropriate amount of s2o3 2 s addition promoted the performance of anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification achieved completely nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox complete nitrogen removal isotope effect microbial diversity s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification 1 introduction anammox as the most potential autotrophic nitrogen removal technology due to no need of organic carbon source and aeration energy consumption ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 is being tried to apply to the mainstream treatment of wastewater with limited carbon source du et al 2019 ma et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the no3 n generated by anammox accounted for 11 of the total nitrogen in the influent which was hard to achieve nitrogen removal arriagada et al 2017 ma et al 2020 anammox coupled with heterotrophic denitrification was an effective way to achieve simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen from wastewater zhang et al 2020 du et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 the addition of organic matter enhanced the heterotrophic denitrification ashok and hait 2015 but negatively influenced the autotrophic anammox zhou et al 2021 compared with heterotrophic denitrification sulfur autotrophic denitrification was an effective pathway for no3 n removal due to its high efficiency safety and economy mora et al 2015 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 the coupling between anammox and sulfide dependent denitrification had been discovered in environments where sulfur and nitrogen cycles were active wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2014 which demonstrated that the combination of these two processes was sustainable in the long run moreover the inorganic electron donors of sulfur had multiple valence states and the conversion of valence states promoted electron buffering and strengthened the cycle of s and n chung et al 2014 yang et al 2020 thiosulfate s2o3 2 s became a main electron donor for autotrophic denitrification due to its high bioavailability and few by products chung et al 2014 mora et al 2015 zhou et al 2021 no3 n was reduced to no2 n in the first step of denitrification in addition no3 n was more readily available to denitrifying bacteria than no2 n zhou et al 2021 which provided the new ideas for the implementation of sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox the autotrophic complete nitrogen removal was realized through the optimization of microbial communities and operation conditions kosugi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 the implementation of the coupling process required the coexistence of autotrophic denitrification and anammox bacteria to achieve the integrated completely nitrogen removal rios del toro and cervantes 2016 kosugi et al 2020 there are very few studies on the coupling of s2o3 2 driven autotrophic denitrification and anammox to achieve completely nitrogen removal autotrophic denitrification reduces no3 n to no2 n or directly to n2 which not only provides no2 n to anammox but also reduces no3 n generated by anammox the changes of denitrifying activity was an effective tool to analyze the nitrogen transformation pathways which revealed the contribution of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal li et al 2020 ganesan and vadivelu 2020 previous studies showed that the denitrification activity was stronger at low temperature 14 18 c while the anammox activity was stronger at high temperature 28 33 c during nitrogen removal weiqiang et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the autotrophic denitrification rate was 3 4 times higher than that of anammox when no2 n was insufficient yang et al 2020 and s2o3 2 s was still oxidized in the absence of electron acceptor which facilitated the disproportionation phenomenon qian et al 2015 yang et al 2020 however whether this phenomenon occurred in the integrated system needed further analysis the changes of activity could indicate the difference between the denitrification and anammox but could not quantify the ratio of their contribution isotope tracing technology was an effective method to reveal the contribution of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal the autotrophic denitrification anammox process was successfully operated when the molar ratios of nh4 n no3 n and s2o3 2 no3 n were 0 75 and 0 85 respectively in this process no3 n was converted to no2 n or no by sulfur bacteria using s2o3 2 as electron donor and then no2 n was utilized by anammox yang et al 2020 therefore the amount of s2o3 2 in raw wastewater was an important factor influencing the synergy of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox both nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopes in fixed nitrogen compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were fractionated during the nitrogen cycle kobayashi et al 2019 casciotti 2016 thus the fractionation effect of natural abundance could reveal the isotope ratios of 15n 14n and 18o 16o which characterized the nitrogen transformation and the reaction processes nishizawa et al 2016 however the degree of fractionation and operating characteristics were still unknown to the integrated anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification which has not been reported the exploration and discovery of the sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox provided a guarantee for the stable operation of long term autotrophic nitrogen removal the feasibility analysis of the coupled process was carried out using direct addition of s2o3 2 s into anammox on this basis the dual isotope fractionation technique was used to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal and the synergistic mechanisms the exploration and analysis of microbial diversity was used to provide a theoretical basis for the long term stable operation of the coupled system 2

15nh4cl were used in the batch tests of isotope tracer table 1 2 ml of sludge was put into 20 ml headspace bottle flush ar to reduce the effect of air 28n2 water was blown off with ar for 60 min and then was added into the headspace bottle and the cap was tightened without substrate the headspace bottle was incubated at 150 r min continuous rotation the sludge was starved for 24 h to remove residual substrate before performing the tracer test and different concentrations of s2o3 2 s were added to match the amount of s2o3 2 s during the incubation phase a was the experimental group to distinguish the contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification b was the control group which supplemented and coordinated the contribution distribution the purpose of group b was to facilitate the calculation of the total amount of n2 and the correction of the total amount for the group a c was the validation group which verified whether autotrophic denitrification actually occurred d was the validation group which verified whether anammox indeed occur meanwhile the air was used as a reference standard for calibration the calculation method of 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 produced by anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification are provided in the supplementary material 2 4 isotope effects analysis 2 4 1 the nitrogen conversion methods the stable isotope technology was used to analyze nitrogen conversion pathways both no2 n and no3 n in anammox coupling sulfur autotrophic denitrification needed to be converted to n2o and n2 isotope ratio analysis was performed by isotope mass spectrometry 253plus thermo usa optimization was performed on the basis of the original chemical transformation method ryabenko et al 2009 and the transformation operation steps were briefly described as follows no3 n ammonium zinc cadmium method firstly 5 ml of water sample was put into a 20 ml headspace bottle and sulphamic acid was added to remove no2 n to ensure the accuracy of no3 n determination the ph was adjusted to 6 8 while ammonium chloride cadmium and clean zinc rolls were added separately to convert no3 n to no2 n after the headspace bottle was sealed the mixture of sodium azide acetic acid was added and incubated in a constant temperature oscillator the reaction was terminated by adding naoh at the end of the reaction which was ready for mass spectrometric determination 2 4 2 isotope analysis isotopic analyses were often resolved using the conventional delta δ notion with air and vienna standard mean ocean water as reference standards for δ15n and δ18o respectively santoro and casciotti 2011 mariotti et al 1981 in order to reduce the influence of the conversion pathway on the isotopic ratios the usgs32 usgs34 and usgs35 were used as standards for the isotopic correction of n and o during the chemical conversion of no3 n to n2o jin et al 2021 and the reproducibility was determined which met the accuracy range kno2 and nano2 were used as reference substances for calibration in the no2 n conversion process the calibration was first performed by an elemental analyzer using standards usgs32 and usgs35 which were then used as calibration standards for no2 n conversion 2 5 microbial diversity analysis anammox sludge with different s2o3 2 s additions was taken after the system reached stability the sludge was centrifuged frozen and dried and genomic dna was extracted using fast dna spin kits for soil bio 101 vistsa ca usa the concentration and purity of dna were determined using a nanodrop 1000 uv spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the v3 v4 high variable region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa the purified pcr product was used to construct a sequence library and the bacterial community structure information was obtained through database analysis the sequenced raw sequences were submitted to the sequence read archive sra database on the national center for biotechnology information ncbi platform 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different s2o3 2 s addition on anammox anammox was gradually applied to the mainstream nitrogen removal in actual wastewater treatment the anammox culture process was shown in fig s1 anammox was successfully cultured after a long period of incubation to achieve efficient removal of nh4 n and no2 n yet the production of no3 n limited the complete nitrogen removal sulfur compounds provided a reliable electron donor for autotrophic denitrification to achieve the complete nitrogen removal in this study the effect of different thiosulfate additions on the stability of the anammox system and anammox coupling s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification was investigated to achieve completely nitrogen removal fig 1 presents the effect of s2o3 2 s additions on anammox performance the seed sludge of 5 reactors was taken from the successfully cultured anammox system at without s2o3 2 s addition the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n were low and the removal rate of nh4 n and no2 n was as high as 99 fig s2a and the effluent no3 n concentration accumulated to more than 30 mg l fig 1a although anammox presented good performance completely nitrogen removal could not be achieved due to the accumulation of no3 n when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 39 0 4 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration showed a gradual increasing trend from 1 to 5 cycles fig 1b and then the effluent concentration of nh4 n gradually decreased the removal of no2 n was less affected by the amount of s2o3 2 s addition fig 1b the effluent concentration of no3 n first increased and then decreased and then gradually stabilized at 25 28 mg l fig 1b which was lower than without the addition of s2o3 2 s fig 1a the addition of small amounts of s2o3 2 s promoted the reduction of no3 n indicating that the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria was more easily promoted in the anammox system but the amount of no3 n removal was limited by the addition of s2o3 2 s the tn nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 80 1 3 fig s2b s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l the no3 n was more readily available to autotrophic denitrification and s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification utilized no3 n to a much greater extent than no2 n chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 which promoted no2 n accumulation and avoid the competition with anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 78 0 6 mg l the effluent nh4 n and no2 n both showed fluctuations before 40 cycles and the maximum effluent concentrations were 13 25 0 32 mg l and 23 19 0 42 mg l respectively fig 1c the effluent nh4 n and no2 n stabilized below 1 mg l after 40 cycles the effluent concentration of no3 n first increased and then decreased and finally stabilized at 16 18 mg l which was less than that of s2o3 2 s of 39 0 4 mg l fig 1b when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 156 1 2 mg l the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n gradually increased fig 1d and the effluent concentration of nh4 n was as high as 19 82 0 21 mg l cycle14 the effluent concentration of no2 n was 18 57 0 32 mg l cycle 8 it indicated that the nitrogen removal performance of anammox was affected at the initial stage however as the reaction proceeded the effluent nh4 n and no2 n gradually decreased and anammox activity gradually recovered the effluent no3 n showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing and the effluent concentration was below 1 mg l after the system reached stable operation fig 1d the tn nitrogen removal rate was as high as 98 fig s2d s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l it showed that anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification successfully achieved completely nitrogen removal at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l sulfur autotrophic denitrification could completely transform the no3 n produced by anammox and the produced no2 n could be further utilized by anammox the sulfur autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria synergistically achieved the efficient nitrogen removal and there was no residual nh4 n in the effluent indicating that the contribution of anammox was greater than that of autotrophic denitrification only when the generated no3 n was completely consumed autotrophic denitrification competed with anammox for electron donors of no2 n the competitive relationship did not cause the surplus of nh4 n because no3 n was continuously generated in anammox and the generated no3 n was continuously used by denitrifying bacteria when the substrate was insufficient no2 n was used by denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal the differential degree of no3 n and no2 n utilization by autotrophic denitrification promoted the implementation of the integrated process s0 driven autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox for nitrogen removal was found to preferentially utilize no3 n as an electron acceptor to complete denitrification in which the no2 n and n2 were products chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 s0 coupled nh4 n and no2 n were found to accomplish completely denitrification in the presence of the mixed bacteria through the relationship of stoichiometry chen et al 2018 2019 during the shortcut nitrification anammox coupled autotrophic denitrification no3 n was preferentially utilized by the autotrophic denitrification which continuously provided no2 n to the anammox reaction system and greatly increased the tn loss the synergy between the microorganisms promoted the implementation of the coupled process zhang et al 2020 when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was increased to 312 1 5 mg l the nh4 n was basically not removed the nh4 n nitrogen removal rate was maintained at 0 2 fig s2e s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l however the effluent no2 n concentration increased and then decreased and finally reached a stable level below 1 mg l fig 1e the no2 n nitrogen removal rate was as high as 99 fig s2e s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l it indicated that the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the reduction of no2 n the effluent concentration of no3 n was maintained at a high level at the beginning of the reaction the addition of high concentration s2o3 2 s inhibited the anammox yet promoted the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification in summary sulfur autotrophic denitrification was promoted by adding s2o3 2 s to the anammox system when the concentration of s2o3 2 s increased from 39 0 4 mg l to 156 1 2 mg l anammox performance was not influenced and maintained stable operation the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification increased with the increase of the s2o3 2 s addition when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 156 1 2 mg l the completely nitrogen removal was successfully achieved through anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification the addition of high s2o3 2 s concentration promoted the efficient nitrogen removal by autotrophic denitrification while inhibited the anammox process the complete nitrogen removal was difficult to achieve due to the residual effluent nh4 n therefore the appropriate addition of s2o3 2 s favored the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification and provided a guarantee for the coupling process to achieve completely nitrogen removal 3 2 characterization of s valence transformation at different s2o3 2 s addition s2o3 2 s became a main electron donor for autotrophic denitrification due to few by products the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification in the anammox system which was accompanied by the cycle of sulfur valence s2o3 2 s reacted with no3 n in a certain ratio to generate n2 in the autotrophic denitrification system according to literature data the reaction equation was as following mora et al 2014 yang et al 2020 1 s2o3 2 1 16no3 0 124h2o 0 035co2 0 519hco3 0 11nh4 2so4 2 0 578n2 0 435h 0 110c5h7o2n the s2o3 2 s was mainly oxidized to of so4 2 s which maybe also produced other valence sulfur in the mixed culture system in this experiment xps revealed the changes of s valence state in the different s2o3 2 s addition system fig 2 the signal intensity of s2 showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the addition of a small amount of s2o3 2 promoted the formation of s2 indicating that the addition of s2o3 2 to anammox generated s2 meanwhile the addition of s2o3 2 s s2 also promoted the generation of s4 and the larger the amount of s2 added the more s4 was produced so4 2 s s6 as the end product of the reaction showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition it has been found that a part of s2o3 2 s formed an electron buffer during s2o3 2 s conversion and the complex of periplasmic multienzyme oxidized s2o3 2 s to so4 2 s but no other valence sulfur was formed appia ayme et al 2001 another pathway was to form the conspicuous globules of polymeric water insoluble sulfur accumulation as a transient or final product during s2o3 2 s oxidation the intermediates either derived from a reductive cleavage of the molecule or incomplete sox enzyme system meyer et al 2007 yang et al 2020 the involvement of s2o3 2 s in the reaction process served as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification and other conversion pathways promoted the formation of intermediates for electron buffering which could be used for the removal of anammox by products yang et al 2020 in summary the addition of s2o3 2 s drove the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox in addition the other valence states of sulfur s2 s4 and s6 continued to participate in the reaction to form an electron buffering effect for completely nitrogen removal 3 3 nitrogen transformation and contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification to nitrogen removal s2o3 2 s addition as the main electron donor improved the removal efficiencies of no3 n yet the long term addition of s2o3 2 s competed with anammox for no2 n the no3 n generated by the anammox without s2o3 2 s addition was close to the theoretical value the removal of no3 n increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration however when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 312 1 5 mg l anammox was inhibited and no2 n was removed by the autotrophic denitrification fig 3 shows the nitrogen distribution at the end of reaction in different s2o3 2 s addition systems at without addition of s2o3 2 s no n2o was produced and the effluent of no3 n was as high as 13 17 fig 3a as the addition of s2o3 2 s increased from 39 0 4 mg l to 156 1 2 mg l the effluent percentage of no3 n decreased from 9 02 to 0 and no3 n was completely removed the generated n2o increased from 1 48 to 6 15 it indicated that the addition of s2o3 2 s enhanced the autotrophic denitrification nevertheless it increased the generation of n2o the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l limited the process of no3 n generation by anammox and no2 n became the electron acceptor for denitrification there was no accumulation of n2o due to the high s2o3 2 s concentration however the percentage of nh4 n was as high as 43 17 and the complete nitrogen removal was not achieved due to anammox inhibition the isotope tracing technology revealed the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal fig 4 the pre culture without substrate was carried out to reduce the influence of substrates and metabolites on the system the r2 r5 produced n2 in the validation c group indicating the presence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification process r2 r4 produced n2 in the validation d group indicating the presence of anammox process at without the addition of s2o3 2 s 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 was not detected in the experimental group and the denitrification process of no3 n was not achieved which led to the failure of anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 39 0 4 mg l autotrophic denitrification gradually took effect the percentage of sulfur autotrophic denitrification decreased from 45 4 h to 35 24 h while anammox increased from 55 4 h to 65 24 h fig 4a the percentage of anammox decreased from 76 4 h to 38 24 h with s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l while the percentage of autotrophic denitrification increased from 24 4 h to 62 24 h fig 4b the percentage of autotrophic denitrification was gradually enhanced up to 75 83 with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition 156 1 2 mg l while anammox was only 17 25 at this time fig 4c the complete nitrogen removal was achieved when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 156 1 2 mg l no3 n produced by anammox was utilized by autotrophic denitrifying bacteria to successfully achieve completely nitrogen removal by autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l n2 came from autotrophic denitrification in summary the appropriate addition of s2o3 2 s was beneficial to achieve autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox but excessive addition led to the deterioration of anammox performance 3 4 denitrification performance and isotope fractionation effects in typical cycle operation the coupling of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification provided a guarantee for complete nitrogen removal which promoted the migration and transformation of n and o elements nh4 n was utilized only by anammox while sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox worked together for the removal or production of no2 n and no3 n s2o3 2 s as an electron donor was directly involved in the removal of no2 n and no3 n by autotrophic denitrification thus affecting the translocation of n and o isotopes during the reaction the isotopic variation characteristics of no2 n and no3 n were analyzed during the typical cycle operation the long term addition of s2o3 2 s enhanced the nitrogen removal by anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification however the denitrification effect showed obvious variability due to the different amounts of s2o3 2 s addition the analysis of typical cycle operation could reveal the characteristics of migration and transformation of n and o 3 4 1 denitrification performance analysis of typical cycle fig s3 presents the denitrification performance and so4 2 s generation characteristics analysis in typical cycles at without the addition of s2o3 2 s nh4 n and no2 n were gradually removed and the effluent concentration of no3 n was as high as 14 89 0 32 mg l fig s3 a the nitrogen variation characteristics at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l were basically the same as those without the s2o3 2 s addition the effluent concentration of no3 n was reduced to 12 29 0 23 mg l due to the effect of s2o3 2 s and the concentration of so4 2 s 22 27 0 43 mg l was lower than the addition amount of s2o3 2 s when the s2o3 2 s concentration were maintained at 78 156 mg l there was a significant lag in denitrification effect the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification made the effluent concentration of so4 2 s at 50 27 95 09 mg l which was lower than the amount of s2o3 2 s addition anammox was completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s addition of 312 1 5 mg l and the effluent concentration of nh4 n was close to the influent concentration autotrophic denitrification with no2 n as the electron acceptor played a dominant role the effluent concentration of so4 2 s was 251 21 1 6 mg l regardless of the dosage of s2o3 2 s the produced so4 2 s was significantly lower than the s2o3 2 s xps results indicated the existence of other valence states of s s2 s4 and s6 fig 2 3 4 2 dynamic response of isotope during typical cycle operation the electron donor addition not only affected the removal and conversion of no2 n and no3 n but also affected the migration and conversion of isotopes the intermittent operation mode was adopted in the typical cycle the nitrification performance and isotopic conversion characteristics were determined by the initial conditions that is the closed system operation was used the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification accompanied with the conversion of n and o elements fig 5 presents the conversion characteristics of n and o isotopes during the removal of no2 n and no3 n δ15nno2 showed a gradual decrease during the reaction the decrease rate of δ15nno2 slowed with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition fig 5a the changes of δ15nno2 in r1 r4 showed obvious inverse isotope effects previous studies explored the n and o isotopic effects of three different anammox bacteria including ca s japonica ca j caeni and ca b sinica δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed significant inverse isotopic effects during no2 n removal and the inverse isotopic effects produced significant differences due to the differences in bacterial species brunner et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2019 the δ15nno2 was basically maintained at 23 r1 r4 when the microorganisms gradually adapted to the environment and no2 n was completely removed the sulfur autotrophic denitrification included to the conversion of no3 n to no2 n and no2 n further reduced to n2o and n2 which caused the change of δ15nno2 when the no2 n was completely removed at the end of the reaction δ15nno2 was basically the same r2 r4 at without the addition of s2o3 2 s r1 δ15nno2 was 23 53 the δ15nno2 indicated that anammox dominated the efficient removal of no2 n in r1 r4 when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l the δ15nno2 decreased from 14 21 to 16 85 which was significantly different from other systems anammox was inhibited and no2 n was removed mainly by sulfur autotrophic denitrification when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l resulting in a small decline of δ15nno2 δ15nno2 was maintained at 15 8 6 9 in the pure culture of bacterial denitrification bacteria sutka et al 2006 casciotti 2009 and at 29 3 6 0 in fungal denitrification rohe et al 2014 in contrast no2 n reduction of nitrifying bacteria resulted in strong isotope effects with a mean δ15nno2 of 34 45 0 66 sutka et al 2003 2004 as shown in fig 5 b δ18ono2 gradually decreased when the reaction showed an obvious inverse isotope effect r1 r4 the denitrification process and the o atoms exchange caused the change of δ18ono2 the change of δ18ono2 included 1 transport and delivery of no2 n by the anammoxosome 2 oxidation of no2 n to no3 n by binding o in water and 3 contributing to the accumulation of heavy isotopes in no2 n knöller et al 2011 the reversible transporter realized the input of no3 n into the cytoplasm and no3 n was reduced to produce no2 n in the process of denitrification by the loss of o atoms it has also been found that the oxygen equilibrium isotope effect was maintained at 14 0 14 4 casciotti et al 2007 meanwhile s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s were present in the denitrification process as reactant and product and the replacement and equilibrium effect of oxygen also affected the migration and conversion of oxygen in the denitrification system margalef marti et al 2019 contrastively no2 n was removed only by sulfur autotrophic denitrification when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was as high as 312 1 5 mg l fig 1e and δ18ono2 showed a gradually increasing trend fig 5b when no2 n as electron acceptors was reduced the o in the water promoted the oxygen balance and affected the isotope migration and transformation which enhanced the oxygen fractionation effect in addition the concentration changes of s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s also affected the oxygen fractionation effect in no2 n removal in summary the reactors dominated by anammox r1 and sulfur autotrophic denitrification r5 showed significant differences in δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 the dynamic changes of isotopes in the process of no2 n removal could be used to distinguish anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification processes when sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox acted together in the no2 n removal the δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 changed accordingly with the adjustment of the addition amount no3 n as a product of anammox was gradually accumulated in the system without the addition of s2o3 2 s r1 while s2o3 2 s addition made no3 n gradually decrease fig s1b e the accumulation and removal of no3 n in the four systems r1 r4 resulted in a gradual decrease of both δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 fig 5c d the utilization rate of heavy isotopes was slower than that of light isotopes in the process of no3 n accumulation which made light isotopes preferentially accumulate no3 n was gradually removed with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration δ15nno3 changed from 3 54 50 63 r1 to 5 12 26 93 r4 and δ18ono3 changed from 14 11 25 39 r1 to 5 23 11 95 r4 the change range of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 was significantly low the successful coupling of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox achieved the simultaneous production and removal of no3 n which drove the utilization of light and heavy isotopes and thus affected the fractionation of n and o isotopes of no3 n in the r1 r4 the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 driven by anammox were combined with the contribution of autotrophic denitrification for no3 n removal in the mixed systems the no3 n removal increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration but the changes of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were small in the r1 without s2o3 2 s addition the δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 showed a significant isotopic effect during anammox fig 5c d in a separate autotrophic denitrification along with no3 n reduction light isotopes were utilized in preference to heavy isotopes resulting in a gradual increase in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 liu et al 2021 the accumulation of heavy isotopes was also frequently observed in the removal of no3 n from natural waters and heterotrophic denitrification wunderlich et al 2012 margalef marti et al 2019 the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration enhanced the autotrophic denitrification and thus complemented the decrease of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 caused by anammox isotope effects were weaker for bacterial pure culture studies bpc with δ15nno3 values ranging between 36 7 and 10 mean 25 2 8 4 lewicka szczebak et al 2014 barford et al 1999 2015 the relatively weak isotopic effect in the removal of no3 n by autotrophic denitrification interacted with the stronger isotopic effect in the generation of no3 n by anammox which resulted in a slow decreasing trend of δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 with increasing s2o3 2 s concentration in summary the dynamic response of isotopes in the denitrification process achieved by sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox could reveal the transformation characteristics of nitrogen and the isotope effect was biased toward the autotrophic denitrification process with increasing s2o3 2 s concentration 3 4 3 the dynamic relationship between δ15n and δ18o during typical cycle operation the rayleigh model was more appropriate to elaborate the fractionation effects of n and o isotope in a single reaction 15 ε or 18 ε mariotti et al 1981 and the variation characteristics of no2 n could be analyzed comprehensively by δ15nno2 δ18ono2 in denitrification involving multiple reactions fig 6 shows the characteristics of n and o migration and transformation in the process of no2 n removal in order to better understand the dynamic relationship between δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 in the no2 n removal process the proportional relationship analysis with δ18ono2 as the horizontal coordinate and δ15nno2 as the vertical coordinate revealed that δ15nno2 had an increase trend with the increase of δ18ono2 r1 r4 which showed a certain correlation fig 6b the slope of δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with the increase of s2o3 2 s concentration the maximum slope was 2 41 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l while the slope was 1 30 at the concentration of 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the maximum value of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 was between the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 and 156 1 2 mg l the characteristics of no2 n removal at s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l was basically the same as that without the addition of s2o3 2 s in the typical cycle denitrification process it indicated that no2 n removal process was not affected when s2o3 2 s was 78 0 6 mg l fig s1c however the no2 n removal was lagged significantly when the s2o3 2 s concentration was 156 1 2 mg l fig s1d indicating that the optimum s2o3 2 s concentration was in the range of 78 156 mg l the characteristics of no2 n removal were consistent with the change characteristics of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 indicating that the dynamic relationship of δ15nno2 δ18ono2 could indirectly guide the optimal addition of s2o3 2 s when the concentration of s2o3 2 s was 312 1 5 mg l δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 showed a negative correlation which was obviously different from the others fig 6b δ15nno2 showed a slow decreasing trend fig 5a while δ18ono2 showed a gradual increasing trend fig 5b and the o heavy isotopes were accumulated in summary the reduction of no3 n the oxidation of no2 n the reduction of no2 n and the o atom balance between no2 n and h2o worked together to promote the dynamic distribution of δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 meanwhile these processes occurred simultaneously in the coupled system instead of in a stepwise manner but this did not affect the characteristics analysis of no2 n isotopic changes martin and casciotti 2017 buchwald and casciotti 2013 the dynamic effects of the isotopes in this experiment were the result of multiple reactions δ15nno2 and δ18ono2 gradually exhibited the characteristics of autotrophic denitrification with increasing s2o3 2 s addition r1 r5 which was consistent with the denitrification performance with different s2o3 2 s addition amount meanwhile there was the exchange of o between no2 n and h2o during the reaction which affected the fractionation characteristics martin and casciotti 2016 buchwald and casciotti 2013 fig 7 presents the characteristics of n and o migration and transformation in the process of no3 n removal the changes of no3 n were derived from anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification thus the changes in δ15nno3 and δ18ono3 were attributed to the combined effect of both the increase of s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the sulfur autotrophic denitrification and reduced the fractionation of light and heavy isotopes resulting in the reduction of δ15nno3 from 50 63 3 54 to 26 93 5 13 fig 7a while δ18ono3 reduced from 25 39 14 11 to 11 95 5 23 fig 7c the stronger the autotrophic denitrification was the faster the reaction rate was which was not conducive to the fractionation of n and o isotopes in no3 n δ15nno3 showed a gradually increasing trend with the increase of δ18ono3 which showed a good correlation fig 7b the slope increased from 1 36 to 2 52 at the s2o3 2 s concentration from 0 to 78 0 6 mg l while the slope decreased from 2 52 to 2 27 when the s2o3 2 s concentration increased to 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the maximum value of δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was between 78 0 6 and 156 1 2 mg l of s2o3 2 s no3 n was not produced at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l and no data analysis was performed the isotope ratio also had the same slope change characteristics for the process of no2 n removal and the change characteristics as the process of no2 n removal and the change characteristics of δ15nno3 δ18ono3 could also indicate the optimal addition amount of s2o3 2 s δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was close to 1 in autotrophic denitrification or heterotrophic denitrification casciotti et al 2013 martin and casciotti 2016 anammox still dominated in the nitrogen removal no3 n produced in anammox was utilized by autotrophic denitrification and the no3 n removal were positively correlated to s2o3 2 s addition fig 1a d the removal of no3 n by sulfur autotrophic denitrification increased with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition the oxidation of no2 n to no3 n and the reduction of no3 n by autotrophic denitrification also involved the uptake and exchange of o in h2o with no2 n and no3 n while the addition of s2o3 2 s and the production of so4 2 s also affected the fractionation of o isotopes the fractionation of n atoms came from the formation and removal of no3 n while the exchange or substitution between no2 n and no3 n was relatively small in kinetic isotopes of n which was often not considered marine denitrification and assimilation reduction of no3 n decomposed n and o isotopes in a ratio of 1 1 casciotti et al 2002 the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 was 1 13 in the process of anammox coupled with sulfur autotrophic denitrification of freshwater bodies and the expression of both the n and o isotope fractionation in the water column can be significantly reduced at multiple spatial scales wenk et al 2014 the δ15nno3 δ18ono3 higher than 1 may be related to the differential expression of n o isotopes at the enzyme level there are four types of nitrate reductases bacterial membrane bound denitrification nar periplasmic denitrification nap cytoplasmic denitrification nas and eukaryotic denitrification euknr kritee et al 2012 wenk et al 2014 sulfurovum sp nbc37 1 and sulfurimonas denitrificans also contained nap in sulfide dependent denitrification of freshwater ecosystems which affected the migration and transformation of isotopes sievert et al 2008 no2 n and no3 n maybe also come from the nitrification process although the rate of nitrification was not directly monitored nitrifying bacteria could also complete the oxidation of nh4 n in a low do environment brunner et al 2013 the oxidation process of nh4 n decreased δ15nno2 and δ15nno3 wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2014 which were involved in nitrogen transformation this study did not distinguish individual reactions and only considered the isotope fractionation caused by the main denitrification process 3 5 microbial diversity analysis the dynamic changes of microbial community structure were analyzed at different s2o3 2 s addition r1 r5 otus showed a gradual decrease trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition amount fig s4 the microbial diversity shannon index and simpson index and community richness also showed a decrease trend table s1 indicating that excessive s2o3 2 s addition decreased the diversity of microbial community structure the depth coverage of microbial sequencing was above 99 table s1 indicating that the obtained sequence data could characterize the community structure of microbes genus based venn map showed the commonalities and differences of microbial community among the five reactors the number of unique otus in r1 r4 gradually decreased 32 16 2 3 with the s2o3 2 s concentration increasing from 0 to 156 1 2 mg l the anammox activities were significantly inhibited at the s2o3 2 s concentrations up to 312 1 5 mg l fig 1e and thus no2 n was utilized by s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification which promoted the differences of microbial community structure in r5 the number of unique otus in r5 was much more than that in r3 and r4 fig s4 proteobacteria planctomycetota chloroflexi and bacteroidota were dominant phyla fig s5 proteobacteria showed a significant increasing trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition while the other three phyla showed a gradual decrease trend 13 to 85 indicating that the s2o3 2 s addition changed the structure of microbial communities proteobacteria became the most dominant phylum in s2o3 2 s addition systems and most autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria belonged to proteobacteria yang et al 2020 planctomycetota contained all the genera of anammox gonzalez martinez et al 2015 the increase of s2o3 2 s addition limited the anammox process when the concentration of s2o3 2 s reached 312 1 5 mg l anammox was completely inhibited and the percentage of planctomycetota phylum was only 1 chloroflexi was reported as a coexistent in anammox reactors because its members degraded anammox bacterial cell materials tomonori et al 2012 chloroflexi was also the main phylum in autotrophic denitrification systems and the improvement of denitrification performance contributed to the increase in the percentage of functional phyla sun et al 2020 chen et al 2017 the percentage of chloroflexi increased to 8 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l fig 8 presented the microbial community at the genus level in different s2o3 2 s addition systems nitrospira as a functional microorganism of nitrification reaction tatari et al 2017 wahman and speitel 2015 accounted for 6 in r1 without s2o3 2 s addition which showed a significant decreasing trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s addition which accounted for up to 6 without s2o3 2 s addition fig 8 that suggested that s2o3 2 s addition had a negative impact on nitrification the addition of s2o3 2 s promoted the occurrence of autotrophic denitrification and made the coupled system easily maintain an anaerobic environment resulting in a decrease in the proportion of nitrospira meanwhile the presence of nitrospira reduced the do in the wastewater which maintained a good anaerobic environment for the anammox candidatus brocadia completed the denitrification process as a functional microorganism of anammox process candidatus brocadia as a functional microorganism of anammox accounted for 27 in r1 without s2o3 2 s addition and the system achieved efficient removal of nh4 n and no2 n fig 1a the s2o3 2 s addition enhanced the s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification and weakened the anammox leading to a gradually decreasing trend of the proportion of candidatus brocadia 22 3 4 and 1 fig 8 thiobacillus as a functional microorganism of autotrophic denitrification showed a gradual increase trend with the increase of s2o3 2 s the percentage of thiobacillus increased from 6 s2o3 2 s concentration of 39 0 4 mg l to 54 s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l indicating the role of s2o3 2 s driven autotrophic denitrification was gradually enhanced the relative abundance of norank f hydrogenophilaceae increased and then decreased and the highest percentage was 65 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 78 0 6 mg l but the percentage of abundance was only 3 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l the excessive s2o3 2 s not only inhibited the normal metabolism of candidatus brocadia but also significantly reduced the percentage of norank f hydrogenophilaceae contrastively thiobacillus and norank f hydrogenophilaceae acted as functional microorganisms for autotrophic denitrification which were not detected in r1 system of anammox without s2o3 2 s addition zhou et al 2021 ma et al 2020 yang et al 2020 meanwhile norank f hydrogenophilaceae proliferated rapidly in the reactors with s2o3 2 s addition resulting in the decrease of anammox abundance gong et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the increase of s2o3 2 s addition limited the denitrification process of anammox nevertheless it promoted sulfur autotrophic denitrification the advanced nitrogen removal was achieved in r4 at the s2o3 2 s concentration of 156 1 2 mg l indicating that the above mentioned candidatus brocadia 4 thiobacillus 40 and norank f hydrogenophilaceae 40 related to anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification mainly contributed to the nitrogen removal comamonas only appeared in the r5 system with a s2o3 2 s concentration of 312 1 5 mg l in this case the anammox basically did not play a role and only the autotrophic denitrification occurred fig 1e however comamonas frequently appeared in the processes of sulfate reduction anammox and partial nitrification kosugi et al 2020 and the abundance obviously varied with the changes of seasonal temperature zhou et al 2021 the s2o3 2 s addition promoted the occurrence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification synergy of multiple microorganisms related to nitrification anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification achieved completely nitrogen removal in this study the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal was successfully distinguished by natural abundance isotope effect and labeled nitrogen tracing technique the isotopic characteristics provided a technical means to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen losses and nitrogen transformation pathways in actual sewage denitrification the coexistence of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox bacteria in the coupling system was also revealed by microbial diversity which provided a reliable basis for the effective application of nitrogen removal process the successful performance of sulfur autotrophic denitrification coupled with anammox provided a new way of low energy consumption for the treatment of actual sewage with limited carbon sources 4 conclusion 1 the addition of s2o3 2 s realized the completely nitrogen removal of anammox coupled with autotrophic denitrification and the optimal addition range was 78 156 mg l the contribution of sulfur autotrophic denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal was 75 83 and 17 25 respectively 2 the isotope effects of n and o in no2 n and no3 n revealed the influence mechanism of s2o3 2 s addition on the coupling process which was able to successfully distinguish the contribution of anammox and sulfur autotrophic denitrification to the nitrogen removal 3 the microbial diversity was negatively correlated with the increase of s2o3 2 s the coexistence of autotrophic denitrifying and anammox bacteria could be promoted at s2o3 2 s concentrations of 39 156 mg l candidatus brocadia as the important anammox bacteria were completely inhibited at s2o3 2 s concentrations

15966,eutrophication due to excess anthropogenic nutrients in waterways is a significant issue worldwide the pressure stressor response of a waterway to excessive nutrient loading is reliant on numerous physical and biological factors including hydrodynamics and microbial processing while substantial progress has been made towards simulating these mechanisms there are limited multi disciplinary studies that relate the physical hydrodynamics of a site with the ecological response from linked laboratory and field studies this paper presents the development of a coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model expanded to include an integrated microbial loop that allows the explicit representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and dissolved organic nutrient mineralisation a unique long term water quality dataset at an estuary in south eastern australia was used to validate and assess the model s sensitivity to complex biophysical processes driving the observed water quality variability results indicate that explicit time varying bacterial mineralisation rates provide a substantially improved understanding of the broader aquatic ecosystem response than assigned fixed bulk rate parameter values which are typically derived from non local literature implementation of a microbial loop at the study site indicated that the model is sensitive to the boundary conditions in particular catchment loads with both net transport rates and the net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria demonstrating different responses under average flow conditions a smaller net transport and reduced nutrient availability has a pronounced effect of lowering net growth rates through the applied limitation factors during high flow conditions freshwater inflows increased net transport and nutrient loads which resulted in higher net growth rates further temporal variability in water temperature had a compounding effect on the model s response sensitivity this approach has broader application in other riverine systems subject to eutrophication and in interrogating linkages in hydrodynamic and microbial mediated processes e g productivity

introduction eutrophication is a global environmental problem and a major barrier to waterway sustainability corcoran et al 2010 liu et al 2020 rice and westerhoff 2017 romero et al 2019 ruprecht et al 2021 un water 2015 widespread wastewater pollution has contributed to nitrogen n and phosphorus p exceedances globally steffen et al 2015 and wastewater discharges are approximately 15 of all river inflows worldwide mateo sagasta et al 2015 wu et al 2019 nutrient enrichment leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems such as toxic algal blooms and major shifts in productivity cavicchioli et al 2019 hutchins and fu 2017 decreased recreational values bricker 1999 lipton and hicks 1999 and human health issues associated with pathogens johnson et al 2010 these problems are likely to worsen as population growth and urbanisation increase over the coming decades clark and johnston 2017 schindler 2006 small and nicholls 2003 in response to these concerns integrated management strategies are increasingly important and recognised worldwide salomons et al 2005 this requires a paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary studies and targeted data collection programs that can clarify linkages between biophysical processes driving water quality variability in waterways worldwide this is particularly important in estuaries where prolonged transit times i e 3 days may exist dettmann 2001 added complexities can also arise in estuaries when multiple tributaries and or a large floodplain sub catchment area contributes inflows and allochthonous outside of system nutrients at different temporal scales hitchcock and mitrovic 2015b this is compounded by the magnitude and timing of these freshwater inflows which may affect microbial dynamics carney et al 2015 these influences include but are not limited to temperature dependant net growth rates top down predation e g micro zooplankton grazing on heterotrophic bacteria mass transport and nutrient limitations i e n and p that can cause changes to the aquatic bacterial microbiome hitchcock and mitrovic 2015a hitchcock et al 2016 the complex and dynamic behaviour of estuaries means that responses to near and far field impacts of point and diffuse nutrient sources are typically difficult to assess from direct field observations laboratory testing or physical models alone as such numerical models are also often used to simulate system wide dynamics and facilitate planning decisions that ensure optimum economic social and environmental outcomes can be achieved phan et al 2021 in practice advanced aquatic ecosystem response models are used to simulate hydrology hydraulics and biogeochemical processes over broad spatial and temporal scales robson 2014 salmon et al 2017 these models operate across a variety of dimensional modes within the same simulation e g 0 d 1 d and 2 d or 3 d thus allowing changes to the level of approximation i e improved resolutions in areas of the system where more detailed information is required these models incorporate a wide variety of conservative and non conservative water quality constituents to represent real world processes and interactions however evidence based parameterisation of complex aquatic ecosystem response models is increasingly challenging and requires large amounts of multi parameter high frequency input data for calibration and validation hipsey et al 2020 robson et al 2018 this data is needed to accurately model and evaluate flow nutrient and physiochemical boundary conditions as well as for quantification of the net growth rate parameter values and biomass of represented functional groups and or individual species ruprecht et al 2022 model shortcomings may also be due to the model s structure or formulations for example key bacterial processes and functioning are typically assigned to fixed bulk rate terms or not considered at all instead of being modelled with explicit time varying feedback loops hellweger 2017 first conceptualised in the 1930s and more widely recognised in the 1980s the microbial loop concept is fundamental in understanding nutrient response processes azam et al 1983 williams and ducklow 2019 the concept has been subsequently included in numerical modelling applications but there are relatively few examples of existing models that include an integrated microbial loop gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b liu et al 2015 ruprecht et al 2022 these studies provide evidence that the integration of bacterial dynamics within aquatic ecosystem response models is needed to improve chlorophyll a chl a predictions over temporal and spatial domains and to explicitly represent key bacterial processes including the mineralisation of dissolved organic matter existing studies also typically rely on broad non location specific literature values for microbial parameter rate terms and typically ignore the effects of net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria and the sensitivity of the model s response ruprecht et al 2022 these limitations provide an opportunity to interrogate data from linked multi disciplinary laboratory and field studies to substantially improve understanding of the ecological response driven by the physical hydrodynamics of a site this study aims to link real world hydrodynamic responses with changes in microbe nutrient interactions associated with wastewater effluent discharges using interdisciplinary field laboratory and numerical modelling studies here we expanded a peer reviewed coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model for an estuary impacted by wastewater discharges in south eastern australia to explicitly include bacterial functional mineralisation processes in an integrated microbial loop a series of numerical simulations are compared with and without an integrated microbial loop to better understand the model s response sensitivity to different levels of representation for heterotrophic bacterial processes we present a novel process based understanding of net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria under average and high flow conditions we show the potential for a model with an explicit bacterial functional mineralisation process to better predict chl a temporal and spatial variability this approach has broader application in other riverine systems subject to eutrophication this study also has the capacity to inform water management decisions e g environmental flow rules that protect end of system flows that are aimed at maintaining unique instream habitats e g tidal pools and marine protected areas that maybe under threat from over extraction further this study has implications with regards to model fitness for purpose estimates of process sensitivity and in assessing related future data collection and modelling studies 2 methods 2 1 study site the hunter river estuary 151 8 e 32 9 s is located on the southeast coastline of nsw australia fig 1 a the hunter river and its 2 main tributaries the paterson and williams rivers form a large tidal pool that extends approximately 65 km from the port of newcastle with a surface water area of 30 km2 and a mean depth of approximately 3 m manly hydraulics laboratory 2003 the floodplain covers more than 1000 km2 or approximately 5 of the regional watershed basin the hunter river estuary has semi diurnal tides a mean tidal range of approximately 1 2 m and peak tidal velocities at the entrance during spring and neap tides of 1 m s manly hydraulics laboratory 2003 the hunter river estuary is characterised by a highly seasonal temperate climate the study site has a mean annual rainfall of approximately 1200 mm with typically higher rainfall in the australian autumn winter mar sept compared to summer nov feb the estuary is generally well mixed with limited stratification and a small net transport e g extended hydraulic retention time along the estuary gradient during periods of low rainfall in contrast catchment runoff events from intense or prolonged rainfall substantially increase the net transport in the system river discharges alter water transit times across the estuary which are typically 5 days in the mid and upper reaches during average flow conditions i e 50 itle flows and are highly dependent on tidal flushing in the lower sections the prevailing hydrodynamics also affects water temperatures along the estuary which typically vary from warm 20 30 c in summer to cooler 10 15 c in winter the study site is subject to ongoing development pressures and is typical of many regulated estuaries in developed coastal regions globally the hunter river estuary has several major wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging into the tidal pool which are representative of advanced secondary or tertiary level wastewater treatment practices that are designed to remove excess inorganic nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus asano et al 2007 however the estuary still receives high nutrient loads from the wwtps as well as urban and agricultural runoff these elevated nutrient loads result in nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios that are consistently below 16 the optimum ratio for algae uptake indicating that the hunter river estuary is typically nitrogen limited under average flow conditions ferguson et al 2018 2 2 water quality data availability a unique water quality dataset was available at the study site from a long term c 5 years from april 2010 to march 2015 field monitoring program completed by the nsw department of planning industry and environment dpie formerly dpi water and the university of technology sydney uts mitrovic and westhorpe 2015 unpublished data the field sampling program was designed to provide a sufficient spatial understanding of biophysiochemical water quality variability across the hunter river estuary the primary sampling protocol involved nominal monthly water quality measurements obtained on the rising high tide i e downstream to upstream at 7 key sites along the estuarine gradient shown as s1 7 in fig 1 a to control for any variation over the tidal cycle at the sampling sites the sampling sites were strategically located near major river confluences wwtps effluent discharges and water control infrastructure to characterise variations in the dataset to validate the monthly dataset for use in numerical model calibration and to better understand the variability in the water quality and biological parameters both temporally and spatially across the estuary additional water samples were collected at more frequent intervals bi weekly sampling was completed at the 7 sampling sites cf fig 1 a for 2 separate periods of 8 weeks commencing in november 2016 and february 2017 in addition hourly water samples were taken over a full tidal cycle 12 hr period to understand any localised short term changes sampling over a tidal cycle was completed at sampling sites 3 and 6 cf fig 1 a on 3 separate occasions november 22 and 23 2016 and february 14 2017 in this study a subset of the complete long term water quality dataset was used to support the numerical model testing the selected sampling periods 2010 2011 and 2013 2014 were representative of the full range of hydrodynamic conditions expected at the study site based on long term flow 1968 2018 and salinity 2013 2018 data in the hunter river cf fig 1 b full details of the complete water quality dataset and sampling methods are provided in glamore et al 2018 in brief a wide range of biophysiochemical water quality constituents were collected and analysed as part of the long term field sampling program these parameters included but are not limited to chlorophyll a chl a total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp filtered reactive phosphorus frp nitrate and nitrite nox ammonium nh4 dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic carbon doc temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do biological surveys were also completed for phytoplankton and zooplankton composition and abundance as well as heterotrophic bacterial abundance and biomass nutrient and chl a water samples were collected in triplicate near the water surface at the 7 sampling sites and stored on ice before being frozen until analysis according to standard methods apha 2005 nutrient samples were collected in 50 ml pet containers and dissolved nutrients were filtered in the field with 0 45 μm polycarbonate filters nitrogen and phosphorus samples were analysed using a segmented flow analyser oi analytical model fs3100 chlorophyll a was determined by filtering 250 ml of water onto glass microfiber filters grade gf c applying the grinding technique and acetone as a solute with correction for phaeophytin a detection limit of 1 µg l was used for the chl a analysis bacterial abundance and biomass was obtained at sampling sites 1 2 and 6 only field samples were collected in sterile 10 ml centrifuge tubes fixed with 0 4 ml of concentrated formalin 37 formaldehyde and stored at 4 c samples were processed following the protocol outlined in hitchcock and mitrovic 2013 each 2 ml water sample was stained with dapi 4 6 diamindion 2 phenylindole at a final concentration of 1 mg ml for 15 mins and filtered through a polycarbonate black 0 2 μm filter porter and feig 1980 the polycarbonate filters were mounted onto glycerol based microscope slides and citfluor non fluorescence immersion oil was used to prevent fading of the dye slides were examined at 100 times magnification using a fluorescence equipped olympus bx41 compound microscope for each slide a minimum of 10 images were captured containing 500 bacterial cells images were captured using an olympus dp72 camera and cellsens standard software v1 3 images were analysed for cell abundance and volume using cellc software selinummi et al 2005 bacterial biomass was calculated using the formula given by romanova and sazhin 2010 2 3 model test description in this study a series of numerical simulations were compared with and without an integrated microbial loop to assess the validity and sensitivity of different levels of representation for heterotrophic bacterial growth and mineralisation processes within a coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model three test cases labelled test 0 2 were considered for this application these simulations covered the period from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2014 in addition 3 shorter duration sensitivity tests labelled sensitivity test a c were performed on test 2 and covered the period from january to december 2011 all numerical simulations were run on a 15 min timestep model results were output at each timestep for the hydrodynamics and every 4 h for water quality constituents parameter values used in the model assessment are given in table 1 model parameter values were sourced from recent studies cf glamore et al 2019b and ruprecht et al 2022 a summary of the model constituents represented in each test case and their input data are provided in supplementary table 1 model performance was assessed based on visual inspection of time series plots of simulated and observed data for chl a tn tp and heterotrophic bacteria cf section 2 2 along with the determination of root mean squared error rmse values supplementary figs 1 8 further details on the modelling platform and the numerical test cases are provided below 2 3 1 modelling platform numerical simulations were conducted with the rma modelling suite which included rma 2 hydrodynamic model and rma 11 aquatic ecosystem response model http ikingrma iinet net au the rma modelling suite provides well established simulation and visualisation tools that have been successfully applied in a range of freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems worldwide ezzatti et al 2011 glamore et al 2019a king 2017 rma 2 is a depth averaged hydrodynamic model that uses the finite element method to numerically solve the non linear shallow water equations together with the continuity equation on a flexible mesh it is suitable for complex estuary applications and includes wetting drying processes it can operate in a fully coupled 1 d 2 d mode with rma 11 rma 11 is a depth averaged aquatic ecosystem response model that uses the finite element method to numerically solve the general mass transport equation for multiple water quality constituents at each time step it uses rma 2 results as inputs to drive mass transport and biogeochemical interactions rma 11 computes individual constituent mass changes i e growth and decay in terms of total biomass concentrations in g m3 or mg l the net growth rate rslt of biological constituents is determined by the sum of the growth minus loss terms such that 1 rsl t i μ i ρ i q i p i s i where µi growth ρi respiration qi excretion pi mortality and si settling are the temperature adjusted specific rate parameters of each constituent i rma 11 employs a monod expression monod 1949 to determine the specific growth rate of each biological constituent which requires specification of a maximum potential growth rate µmax at the reference temperature of 20 c and half saturation constants for limiting nutrients e g c n and p up to 5 algal species can be specified in rma 11 with additional limitations on growth regarding light availability and salinity the net growth terms for all biological constituents are rate adjusted using a temperature multiplier according to the simplified arrhenius equation 2 3 2 test 0 base case model an existing peer reviewed fully integrated 1d 2d hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model of the hunter river estuary was used as the base case model the base case model was developed as part of an earlier comprehensive study hunter river modelling study to assess total catchment water planning and management options for the hunter river estuary glamore et al 2019a a significant amount of data was sourced to support the hunter river modelling study that included existing datasets of bathymetry boundary conditions flow gauging and water quality cf section 2 2 where critical knowledge gaps remained additional data was collected to supplement the existing datasets a key aspect of this data gap filling exercise was the completion of a novel combination of field and laboratory microbial ecotoxicology studies with supporting genomics and physiochemical data as detailed in ruprecht et al 2020a this data was used to support the calibration and validation of the base case model applied in the hunter river modelling study full details of the base case model design and methodology as well as the data and procedures used in the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response models are provided in glamore and deiber 2017 and glamore et al 2019b respectively in brief the calibrated hydrodynamic model was determined to be fit for the purpose of driving the aquatic ecosystem response model and simulating nutrient transport in the hunter river estuary robson and cuddy 2019 the combination of the catchment water budget and statistical models used in the hunter river modelling study were suitable to provide inflow boundary conditions for the receiving aquatic ecosystem response model a machine learning model was used to provide the best predicted water quality concentrations at the upstream boundaries based on flow water temperature and a seasonal indicator event mean concentrations for key water quality constituents including tn and tp were applied at the floodplain sub catchment boundaries based on local spatial land use data dpie 2018 and typical catchment runoff concentrations from fletcher et al 2004 and duncan 2006 the aquatic ecosystem response model was developed in line with current standard practice harmel et al 2014 and included a one at a time parameter sensitivity analyses that was performed using over 50 model runs during the model calibration glamore et al 2019b the coupled model was shown to be capable of simulating a range of nutrients and biogeochemical processes including tn and tp variability in the hunter river estuary robson and cuddy 2019 however the base case model had limited ability to accurately simulate variations in chl a or zooplankton at specific locations within the estuary robson and cuddy 2019 the structure of the rma 11 base case model included representation of phytoplankton 2 algal species freshwater and marine diatoms and zooplankton copepods macro and rotifers nauplii micro species as well as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved oxygen dynamics and transport the 2 algal species chosen for the base case model were the dominant species at the study site and due to the lack of calibration data and limited guidance on options for representation of multiple functional groups as there are a few competing approaches in the literature a simpler algal model was adopted algal concentrations were converted to equivalent chl a concentrations using standard conversion factors the model also included benthic nutrient and sediment stores key benthic biogeochemical processes sediment water interactions associated with settling and resuspension of particulate materials and dissolved nutrient benthic flux a total of 21 constituents in the water column and 13 constituents in the bed were modelled it is important to note that key bacterial processes including mineralisation nitrification and denitrification were assigned to fixed bulk rate terms in the base case model based on relevant literature and model sensitivity testing glamore et al 2019b an overview of the modelled trophic structure and associated complex series of constituent interactions is provided in fig 2 2 3 3 test 1 base case model modified with corrected mineralisation rates the parameter rate values for the bacterial mineralisation processes in test 0 were 0 03 per day for don to nh4 and 0 2 per day dop to po4 these parameter rate values were found to be higher than realistically required as demonstrated in ruprecht et al 2022 based on the findings of ruprecht et al 2022 a simple approach to estimate mineralisation parameter rate values in relation to the prevailing heterotrophic bacteria and dissolved organic nutrient concentrations was implemented to this end mean concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria 0 07 mg l don 0 3 mg l and dop 0 03 mg l in the hunter river estuary were determined from the long term water quality dataset cf section 2 2 this data was used to estimate the nominal mineralisation parameter rate values for don and dop that were then assigned in test 1 the parameter rate values in test 1 were 0 02 per day for both don and dop mineralisation no other changes were made to the base case model data that was re run in test 1 2 3 4 test 2 base case model modified with an integrated microbial loop in test 2 the base case model was expanded to include an integrated microbial loop by explicitly allowing dynamic predictions of heterotrophic bacteria simulated in terms of carbon mg c l 1 and their role in the mineralisation of dissolved organic nutrients i e doc don and dop the net growth kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria cf eq 1 is assumed to be primarily limited by the dissolved organic matter concentrations and is dependent on the oxygen availability in the water column while there is an assumption in this study that heterotrophic bacterial activity is a linear function of concentration defined by a monod function it provides an initial basis for understanding the model s sensitivity to the complex dynamic biophysical processes in the hunter river estuary a default factor of 0 9 is used to account for heterotrophic bacteria competing with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients while preferencing dissolved organic nutrients kirchman 1994 heterotrophic bacteria also produce inorganic nutrients e g co2 nh3 and frp for phytoplankton growth the role of bacteria in other microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are unchanged from the base case model an overview of the expanded model interactions implemented in test 2 is provided in fig 2 a summary of the equations used in the bacteria sub model of the current research version of rma 11 is provided in appendix a the assigned rate parameter values driving the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria in test 2 were based on previous modelling detailed in ruprecht et al 2022 the authors presented a depth averaged box model that was developed based on the design of the laboratory ecotoxicology tests to represent the microbial and nutrient dynamics observed during the experiment ruprecht et al 2021 2020a 2020b the heterotrophic bacteria rate values were derived using the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 1992 combined with monte carlo sampling from uniform prior distributions of individual parameters a maximum of 10 000 random monte carlo simulations were used for each application of the glue methodology to define the parameter space 3 results 3 1 detecting model sensitivity to bacterial mineralisation rates numerical simulations with and without a microbial loop cf fig 2 supplementary table 1 identified that lower time varying bacterial mineralisation rates improved the prediction of key biological and chemical state variables revealing new insights on parameter sensitivity in aquatic ecosystem response models specifically lower fixed bulk rate parameter values for don and dop mineralisation used in test 1 improved i e rmse reduced by up to approx 30 model prediction of tp at all estuary sampling sites 1 7 cf fig 1 when compared to the base case model test 0 over the simulation period supplementary figs 3 6 calculated rmse values of chl a improved by up to approx 20 at sampling sites 1 4 6 and 7 in 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 1 while there were no significant improvements of chl a in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 4 rmse values of tn varied between approx 10 at all sampling sites over the simulation period supplementary figs 2 5 further improvements in the model performance metrics were achieved for chl a tp and tn when bacterial mineralisation was explicitly simulated in test 2 supplementary figs 1 6 fig 3 shows the effective time varying rate parameter values per day for the bacterial mineralisation of don and dop determined at the sampling sites 1 7 based on the combined model results from test 2 in 2010 and 2011 the effective mineralisation rates from test 2 depict higher rates for don and dop at sampling sites 3 4 and 6 while lower rates were found at sampling sites 1 2 5 and 7 despite some localised variability across the sampling sites the median effective mineralisation rate parameter values per day for don ranged from 0 005 to 0 030 median average 0 02 while dop ranged from 0 005 to 0 033 median average 0 02 the time variable rates of don and dop mineralisation resulted in greater relative reductions i e improvements in the calculated rmse values of chl a tn and tp in test 2 compared to the base case test 0 cf supplementary figs 1 6 the most significant improvements in model performance were seen at the lower estuary sampling sites 6 and 7 furthest away from the upstream model boundaries rmse values of chl a improved by up to approx 10 at sampling sites 6 and 7 in 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 1 and by 40 at sampling site 7 in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 4 all other calculated rmse values of chl a were higher than the base case model model performance of tn improved at all estuary sampling sites except for sampling site 3 in 2010 and 2011 with the highest reductions in rmse values up to 20 at sampling sites 6 and 7 supplementary fig 2 there were no significant improvements of tn in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 5 similar relative reductions i e improvements in the rmse values of tp occurred at all estuary sampling sites over the simulation period in tests 1 and 2 supplementary figs 3 6 3 2 temporal variability in model s response the temporal variability in the model response for chl a tn and tp against the observed data cf section 2 2 at sampling site 6 is provided from 2010 to 2011 fig 4 and from 2013 to 2014 fig 5 sampling site 6 was selected for this purpose as it is mid estuary site which showed the greatest differences in the predicted variability between the numerical model tests there were no clear seasonal patterns or significant blooms in chl a observed at this site from 2010 to 2014 with mean concentrations of less than 10 µg l 1 at times peak concentrations in chl a followed large rainfall events cf fig 5 supplementary fig 9 nutrient concentrations were relatively high and varied seasonally during the monitoring period fig 4 there was a pattern of higher concentrations of tn and tp over the winter period june september and early summer and in many cases the lowest nutrient concentrations occurred in autumn differences in the model s predictive capability were related to the level of representation of microbial ecosystem functioning in test 0 variability in tn and tp was generally under predicted while variability in chl a concentrations was often over predicted figs 4 and 5 the base case model predicted consistent algal bloom events at times where blooms were not observed indicating that the model required further refinement to better understand the biogeochemical processes involved in test 1 the model again under predicted tp and over predicted chl a concentrations while subtle changes were observed in the prediction of tn figs 4 and 5 however decreasing the fixed rate mineralisation parameters for don and dop generally improved the model performance for tp and chl a in test 1 compared to test 0 cf section 3 1 in test 2 there were noticeable improvements in the observed variability timing and patterns of chl a and tn figs 4 and 5 in terms of chl a the model in test 2 reproduced some of the observed interannual variation in the average and peak biomass values in addition the model captured the observed variability in tn over the simulation period suggesting that the model in test 2 is more sensitive to the role of bacterial processes in the decay of organic material and potential shifts in nitrogen to phosphorus ratios modelled bacterial dynamics versus observations cf section 2 2 at sampling sites 1 2 and 6 are shown in figs 6 and 7 the observed heterotrophic bacterial biomass data across the estuary displayed limited seasonal variation with mean concentrations consistently less than 0 1 mg c l 1 throughout the simulation period while the model performed well in simulating the observed low concentration bacterial dynamics during winter the model generally over predicted interannual bacteria growth during summer with peak concentrations of approximately 1 0 mg c l 1 this indicates that temperature dependant growth rates may have a strong influence on the predicted variability of heterotrophic bacteria in the model the marked increase in modelled bacterial biomass in summer also corresponded to higher predicted chl a concentrations cf figs 4 and 5 this may be in part related to the influence of grazing by higher trophic levels e g zooplankton which is not well represented in these simulations cf section 2 3 as a result the simulated bacteria values did not always match the observed variations and peaks which impacted the rmse values used to assess model performance supplementary figs 7 8 4 discussion interrogating the complex relationships between hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes driving water quality variability in waterways is important as it assists in understanding the broader aquatic ecosystem response on the pathway to sustainable water management within numerical models the accurate representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and their ability to mineralise organic matter i e n and p is increasingly important it was found that the explicit representation of heterotrophic bacterial dynamics associated with functional mineralisation processes improved the prediction of chl a at the lower estuary sampling sites 6 and 7 however the model is highly sensitive to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria and mass transport processes i e advection dispersion dilution driven by the applied hydrodynamic boundary conditions an example of the interactions of hydrodynamic boundary conditions and heterotrophic bacterial process rate kinetics in the hunter river estuary is provided in fig 8 this is demonstrated at sampling site 6 for 2 different river flow conditions including average i e dry weather fig 8 a and high i e flushing event flows fig 8 b which are typical of temperate estuaries in australia hitchcock and mitrovic 2015b sampling site 6 is suitable for this purpose as it is located within the mixing zone of the hunter river estuary approximately 26 km upstream from the ocean boundary cf fig 1 further this site showed high sensitivity to changes in the model structure cf section 3 1 and highlights the interplay of sub daily tidal variations and intermittent flushing events on bacterial dynamics the selected time periods for each flow condition captures the full range of predicted average water temperatures at sampling site 6 where the values transition from a warming period in spring and summer i e october february to a cooling period in autumn i e march rmatrk king 2020 which is adapted from degeorge 1996 was used to simulate particle transport at the study site a single particle i e ignoring any dispersion was released at 2 locations including the upstream boundary of the hunter river labelled bg in fig 8 a 8 b and at sampling site 6 labelled s6 in fig 8 a 8 b to illustrate the tidal excursion i e net transport across the estuary after 72 h i e approximately 3 diurnal tidal cycles under different river flow conditions this analysis reflects the estuary transit times and is used to show the effects of hydrodynamics on the model response sensitivity to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria a representative modelled response to average flow conditions at the study site was observed during the period from january to march in 2011 fig 8 a supplementary fig 9 this period shows that under average flow conditions the mid estuary is strongly influenced by the flood and ebb tidal flows e g shown by the predicted variability in the heterotrophic bacteria concentration and received relatively low upstream catchment freshwater inflows 5000 ml day it should be noted that similar average flow conditions were observed in the adjoining major tributaries including the paterson and williams rivers supplementary fig 9 under average flow conditions a particle dropped at the upstream boundary of the hunter river moved approximately 9 kms downstream due to the modelled inflows where the tidal signal is weaker however a particle dropped at sampling site 6 is shown to travel approximately 3 kms upstream and downstream of its starting position due to stronger tidal influences while there is negligible net transport over the same period this indicates that point source nutrient additions including moderate 10 concentrations of wastewater effluent discharges ruprecht et al 2021 could have a pronounced effect on the ecological response in the system under average flow conditions this study revealed that the model s response sensitivity is affected by variability in tn concentrations under average flow conditions in early january 2011 the predicted heterotrophic bacteria biomass increased over 2 weeks due to a positive net growth rate and high tn concentrations fig 8 a this activity subsequently reduced the tn available to the heterotrophic bacteria for growth i e increases nitrogen limitation which caused a decline in net growth rates negative net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria led to a die off event that extended until mid february 2011 during the die off period the natural mortality of heterotrophic bacteria likely contributed to the labile autochthonous within the system organic material in the water column this was supplemented by a relatively small inflow event in mid to late february that delivered allochthonous outside the system nutrients and increased tn concentrations it is worth noting that the available nutrients across the estuary are concerned with additional sources and sinks including the net growth rate components of algae linked via a microbial loop this may also affect the model s response sensitivity which is linked to the dynamic relationship between available nutrient concentrations and the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria similarly the model s response sensitivity for heterotrophic bacteria was strongly dependant on the variability of water temperatures under average flow conditions a small inflow event in mid to late february 2011 increased the predicted average water temperatures by approximately 3 c at sampling site 6 this caused the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria to increase from approximately 0 5 to 0 1 per day which resulted in a boom more than 200 increase in biomass over the period from late february to early march 2011 fig 8 a there is also clear evidence to indicate that the tidal influence resulted in higher predicted variability in the heterotrophic bacteria concentrations at this site fig 8 a this cyclic process described above continued throughout march 2011 and highlights the sensitivity of the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria as the predicted average water temperatures deviated from the reference value of 20 c applied in the temperature function in contrast this study showed a significantly different model response during modelled high flow conditions a large flushing event was observed in late november 2011 fig 8 b under these higher flow conditions a particle dropped at the upstream boundary of the hunter river on the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is transported past sampling site 6 after approximately 39 h fig 8 b the modelled response to the flushing event suggests that localised overland freshwater inflows from the surrounding floodplain also played a relatively important role in the timing of the peak downstream this has potential implications on the model s response sensitivity due to the event mean concentration values applied at these sub catchment boundaries cf section 2 3 2 however this flushing event was selected because it was predominately constrained to the hunter river catchment and eliminated the additional complexities in understanding the model s response sensitivity to the co occurrence of flooding in the adjoining paterson and williams river s catchments supplementary fig 9 the results from this study also suggest that nutrient availability and water temperatures during high flow conditions have implications on the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria e g sampling site 6 the weeks preceding the large flushing event in late november 2011 corresponded to relatively average flow conditions cf fig 8 a b at average water temperatures of approximately 25 c there was moderate tn availability for heterotrophic bacteria growth which resulted in relatively stable net growth rates of approximately 0 1 per day and concentrations around 0 2 0 3 mg l the flushing event caused a substantial step change in these parameters as the site discharge increased up to approximately 70 000 ml day with the flood hydrograph rising and falling over approximately 2 weeks predicted average water temperatures increased by approximately 3 c and high tn concentrations resulted in a net growth rate change from approximately 0 0 to 0 5 per day despite a relatively high positive net growth rate and the available nutrients the freshwater inflows caused a sudden drop in the heterotrophic bacteria concentration to a value of 0 07 mg l which is equal to the applied constant boundary condition value the long duration event resulted in these conditions extending for several days at sampling site 6 as the freshwater inflows transported mass through the system further the modelled system response indicated the sensitivity of the net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria as the flood hydrograph receded in december 2011 this sensitivity was likely due to the high variability in the predicted average water temperatures and nutrient availability in early december 2011 the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria halved caused by a drop in the predicted average water temperatures and tn concentrations in mid december 2011 a relatively moderate inflow event 15 500 ml day was followed by higher predicted average water temperatures that increased the net growth rate and led to a boom of heterotrophic bacteria in late december 2011 there was a significant increase in heterotrophic bacteria biomass as average flow conditions returned at sampling site 6 this coincided with a drop in the net growth rate caused by lower predicted average water temperatures and tn availability this further emphasises the importance of modelling accurate boundary conditions and highlights how the model s response sensitivity to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria can be affected spatially across an estuary during high flow conditions a series of sensitivity tests are provided to demonstrate the challenges of calibrating mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models which was beyond the scope of this study and interrogating their response against observed data the sensitivity tests a c are shown at sampling site 6 for 2011 fig 9 the sensitivity tests were compared against test 2 supplementary table 2 and 3 different test cases were examined by changing several heterotrophic bacterial rate parameters these included i a reduction in the net nominal growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria by changing the maximum specific growth rate doc excretion rate and the natural mortality rate sensitivity test a ii a reduction in the temperature multiplier applied to all heterotrophic bacterial rate parameters except natural mortality sensitivity test b and iii a reduction of the half saturation coefficient for nitrogen as the hunter river estuary was nitrogen limited sensitivity test c the sensitivity tests revealed that there was no change in the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria during the large flushing event in late november 2011 while i lowering the net growth rate reduced concentrations across all other conditions ii lowering the temperature multiplier showed limited sensitivity increasing growth in winter and reducing growth in summer and iii lowering the half saturation coefficient for nitrogen increased sensitivity to nutrient availability particularly after the flushing event in this study the observed dataset is scientifically robust and beyond what most large modelling studies have available for model calibration and testing while parameter sensitivity made it difficult to discern the accuracy of the model predictions the sensitivity tests fig 9 revealed that the model can over predict the observed data and supressing the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria by approximately 25 sensitivity test a improved the model fit in november 2011 the model predictions from the sensitivity tests indicated a peak concentration that may have occurred due to high heterotrophic bacteria growth is quickly returned to the applied constant boundary condition value here we have assumed for demonstration purposes that the same concentration of heterotrophic bacteria enters during average and high flow conditions this is a conservative assumption and it is likely that the concentration would change when a large flushing event occurs carney et al 2015 which could affect the model s response sensitivity for example a decreased concentration before or during the flushing event could lower the starting heterotrophic bacteria concentrations for the december 2011 period where growth occurs cf figs 8 and 9 it is possible that the microbial field sampling missed the peak heterotrophic bacteria concentrations that occurred before the flood effects were evident further it is possible that current zooplankton boundary concentrations and initial conditions are too high possibly due to an issue in converting from biomass to nitrogen content as represented in the model and microbial algae and heterotrophic bacteria growth rates are too high to counteract the resulting excess grazing pressure this highlights the importance of understanding and measuring the system hydrodynamics before designing a microbial field sampling program and further calibration driven by a more systematic exploration of the parameter space 5 conclusion this study highlights that an overarching co ordinated modelling approach is needed to address waterway pollution in riverine catchments including potential eutrophication impacts from wastewater discharges in this regard a renewed focus on integrated ecological and physical processes is recommended to better inform best practice management of aquatic ecosystem values and functions to improve the water management outcomes for a large estuary in south eastern australia an existing coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model was expanded to include an integrated microbial loop allowing explicit representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and their role in mineralising dissolved organic nutrients a unique long term water quality dataset at the study site was opportunistically used to validate and assess the model s response sensitivity to complex biophysical processes driving the observed water quality variability it was revealed that explicit time varying bacterial mineralisation rates provide an improved understanding of the broader aquatic ecosystem response than assigned fixed parameter rate values which are typically derived from wide non location specific literature ranges we have shown that boundary conditions are critical in driving the system response with both net transport rates and the net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria indicating different model sensitivities under average flow conditions a smaller net transport and reduced nutrient availability had a pronounced effect on lowering net growth rates through the applied limitation factors during high flow conditions freshwater inflows increased net transport and nutrient loads which resulted in higher net growth rates credit authorship contribution statement

15966,eutrophication due to excess anthropogenic nutrients in waterways is a significant issue worldwide the pressure stressor response of a waterway to excessive nutrient loading is reliant on numerous physical and biological factors including hydrodynamics and microbial processing while substantial progress has been made towards simulating these mechanisms there are limited multi disciplinary studies that relate the physical hydrodynamics of a site with the ecological response from linked laboratory and field studies this paper presents the development of a coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model expanded to include an integrated microbial loop that allows the explicit representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and dissolved organic nutrient mineralisation a unique long term water quality dataset at an estuary in south eastern australia was used to validate and assess the model s sensitivity to complex biophysical processes driving the observed water quality variability results indicate that explicit time varying bacterial mineralisation rates provide a substantially improved understanding of the broader aquatic ecosystem response than assigned fixed bulk rate parameter values which are typically derived from non local literature implementation of a microbial loop at the study site indicated that the model is sensitive to the boundary conditions in particular catchment loads with both net transport rates and the net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria demonstrating different responses under average flow conditions a smaller net transport and reduced nutrient availability has a pronounced effect of lowering net growth rates through the applied limitation factors during high flow conditions freshwater inflows increased net transport and nutrient loads which resulted in higher net growth rates further temporal variability in water temperature had a compounding effect on the model s response

introduction eutrophication is a global environmental problem and a major barrier to waterway sustainability corcoran et al 2010 liu et al 2020 rice and westerhoff 2017 romero et al 2019 ruprecht et al 2021 un water 2015 widespread wastewater pollution has contributed to nitrogen n and phosphorus p exceedances globally steffen et al 2015 and wastewater discharges are approximately 15 of all river inflows worldwide mateo sagasta et al 2015 wu et al 2019 nutrient enrichment leads to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems such as toxic algal blooms and major shifts in productivity cavicchioli et al 2019 hutchins and fu 2017 decreased recreational values bricker 1999 lipton and hicks 1999 and human health issues associated with pathogens johnson et al 2010 these problems are likely to worsen as population growth and urbanisation increase over the coming decades clark and johnston 2017 schindler 2006 small and nicholls 2003 in response to these concerns integrated management strategies are increasingly important and recognised worldwide salomons et al 2005 this requires a paradigm shift towards interdisciplinary studies and targeted data collection programs that can clarify linkages between biophysical processes driving water quality variability in waterways worldwide this is particularly important in estuaries where prolonged transit times i e 3 days may exist dettmann 2001 added complexities can also arise in estuaries when multiple tributaries and or a large floodplain sub catchment area contributes inflows and allochthonous outside of system nutrients at different temporal scales hitchcock and mitrovic 2015b this is compounded by the magnitude and timing of these freshwater inflows which may affect microbial dynamics carney et al 2015 these influences include but are not limited to temperature dependant net growth rates top down predation e g micro zooplankton grazing on heterotrophic bacteria mass transport and nutrient limitations i e n and p that can cause changes to the aquatic bacterial microbiome hitchcock and mitrovic 2015a hitchcock et al 2016 the complex and dynamic behaviour of estuaries means that responses to near and far field impacts of point and diffuse nutrient sources are typically difficult to assess from direct field observations laboratory testing or physical models alone as such numerical models are also often used to simulate system wide dynamics and facilitate planning decisions that ensure optimum economic social and environmental outcomes can be achieved phan et al 2021 in practice advanced aquatic ecosystem response models are used to simulate hydrology hydraulics and biogeochemical processes over broad spatial and temporal scales robson 2014 salmon et al 2017 these models operate across a variety of dimensional modes within the same simulation e g 0 d 1 d and 2 d or 3 d thus allowing changes to the level of approximation i e improved resolutions in areas of the system where more detailed information is required these models incorporate a wide variety of conservative and non conservative water quality constituents to represent real world processes and interactions however evidence based parameterisation of complex aquatic ecosystem response models is increasingly challenging and requires large amounts of multi parameter high frequency input data for calibration and validation hipsey et al 2020 robson et al 2018 this data is needed to accurately model and evaluate flow nutrient and physiochemical boundary conditions as well as for quantification of the net growth rate parameter values and biomass of represented functional groups and or individual species ruprecht et al 2022 model shortcomings may also be due to the model s structure or formulations for example key bacterial processes and functioning are typically assigned to fixed bulk rate terms or not considered at all instead of being modelled with explicit time varying feedback loops hellweger 2017 first conceptualised in the 1930s and more widely recognised in the 1980s the microbial loop concept is fundamental in understanding nutrient response processes azam et al 1983 williams and ducklow 2019 the concept has been subsequently included in numerical modelling applications but there are relatively few examples of existing models that include an integrated microbial loop gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a li et al 2014b liu et al 2015 ruprecht et al 2022 these studies provide evidence that the integration of bacterial dynamics within aquatic ecosystem response models is needed to improve chlorophyll a chl a predictions over temporal and spatial domains and to explicitly represent key bacterial processes including the mineralisation of dissolved organic matter existing studies also typically rely on broad non location specific literature values for microbial parameter rate terms and typically ignore the effects of net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria and the sensitivity of the model s response ruprecht et al 2022 these limitations provide an opportunity to interrogate data from linked multi disciplinary laboratory and field studies to substantially improve understanding of the ecological response driven by the physical hydrodynamics of a site this study aims to link real world hydrodynamic responses with changes in microbe nutrient interactions associated with wastewater effluent discharges using interdisciplinary field laboratory and numerical modelling studies here we expanded a peer reviewed coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model for an estuary impacted by wastewater discharges in south eastern australia to explicitly include bacterial functional mineralisation processes in an integrated microbial loop a series of numerical simulations are compared with and without an integrated microbial loop to better understand the model s response sensitivity to different levels of representation for heterotrophic bacterial processes we present a novel process based understanding of net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria under average and high flow conditions we show the potential for a model with an explicit bacterial functional mineralisation process to better predict chl a temporal and spatial variability this approach has broader application in other riverine systems subject to eutrophication this study also has the capacity to inform water management decisions e g environmental flow rules that protect end of system flows that are aimed at maintaining unique instream habitats e g tidal pools and marine protected areas that maybe under threat from over extraction further this study has implications with regards to model fitness for purpose estimates of process sensitivity and in assessing related future data collection and modelling studies 2 methods 2 1 study site the hunter river estuary 151 8 e 32 9 s is located on the southeast coastline of nsw australia fig 1 a the hunter river and its 2 main tributaries the paterson and williams rivers form a large tidal pool that extends approximately 65 km from the port of newcastle with a surface water area of 30 km2 and a mean depth of approximately 3 m manly hydraulics laboratory 2003 the floodplain covers more than 1000 km2 or approximately 5 of the regional watershed basin the hunter river estuary has semi diurnal tides a mean tidal range of approximately 1 2 m and peak tidal velocities at the entrance during spring and neap tides of 1 m s manly hydraulics laboratory 2003 the hunter river estuary is characterised by a highly seasonal temperate climate the study site has a mean annual rainfall of approximately 1200 mm with typically higher rainfall in the australian autumn winter mar sept compared to summer nov feb the estuary is generally well mixed with limited stratification and a small net transport e g extended hydraulic retention time along the estuary gradient during periods of low rainfall in contrast catchment runoff events from intense or prolonged rainfall substantially increase the net transport in the system river discharges alter water transit times across the estuary which are typically 5 days in the mid and upper reaches during average flow conditions i e 50 itle flows and are highly dependent on tidal flushing in the lower sections the prevailing hydrodynamics also affects water temperatures along the estuary which typically vary from warm 20 30 c in summer to cooler 10 15 c in winter the study site is subject to ongoing development pressures and is typical of many regulated estuaries in developed coastal regions globally the hunter river estuary has several major wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging into the tidal pool which are representative of advanced secondary or tertiary level wastewater treatment practices that are designed to remove excess inorganic nutrients e g nitrogen and phosphorus asano et al 2007 however the estuary still receives high nutrient loads from the wwtps as well as urban and agricultural runoff these elevated nutrient loads result in nitrogen to phosphorus molar ratios that are consistently below 16 the optimum ratio for algae uptake indicating that the hunter river estuary is typically nitrogen limited under average flow conditions ferguson et al 2018 2 2 water quality data availability a unique water quality dataset was available at the study site from a long term c 5 years from april 2010 to march 2015 field monitoring program completed by the nsw department of planning industry and environment dpie formerly dpi water and the university of technology sydney uts mitrovic and westhorpe 2015 unpublished data the field sampling program was designed to provide a sufficient spatial understanding of biophysiochemical water quality variability across the hunter river estuary the primary sampling protocol involved nominal monthly water quality measurements obtained on the rising high tide i e downstream to upstream at 7 key sites along the estuarine gradient shown as s1 7 in fig 1 a to control for any variation over the tidal cycle at the sampling sites the sampling sites were strategically located near major river confluences wwtps effluent discharges and water control infrastructure to characterise variations in the dataset to validate the monthly dataset for use in numerical model calibration and to better understand the variability in the water quality and biological parameters both temporally and spatially across the estuary additional water samples were collected at more frequent intervals bi weekly sampling was completed at the 7 sampling sites cf fig 1 a for 2 separate periods of 8 weeks commencing in november 2016 and february 2017 in addition hourly water samples were taken over a full tidal cycle 12 hr period to understand any localised short term changes sampling over a tidal cycle was completed at sampling sites 3 and 6 cf fig 1 a on 3 separate occasions november 22 and 23 2016 and february 14 2017 in this study a subset of the complete long term water quality dataset was used to support the numerical model testing the selected sampling periods 2010 2011 and 2013 2014 were representative of the full range of hydrodynamic conditions expected at the study site based on long term flow 1968 2018 and salinity 2013 2018 data in the hunter river cf fig 1 b full details of the complete water quality dataset and sampling methods are provided in glamore et al 2018 in brief a wide range of biophysiochemical water quality constituents were collected and analysed as part of the long term field sampling program these parameters included but are not limited to chlorophyll a chl a total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp filtered reactive phosphorus frp nitrate and nitrite nox ammonium nh4 dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic carbon doc temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do biological surveys were also completed for phytoplankton and zooplankton composition and abundance as well as heterotrophic bacterial abundance and biomass nutrient and chl a water samples were collected in triplicate near the water surface at the 7 sampling sites and stored on ice before being frozen until analysis according to standard methods apha 2005 nutrient samples were collected in 50 ml pet containers and dissolved nutrients were filtered in the field with 0 45 μm polycarbonate filters nitrogen and phosphorus samples were analysed using a segmented flow analyser oi analytical model fs3100 chlorophyll a was determined by filtering 250 ml of water onto glass microfiber filters grade gf c applying the grinding technique and acetone as a solute with correction for phaeophytin a detection limit of 1 µg l was used for the chl a analysis bacterial abundance and biomass was obtained at sampling sites 1 2 and 6 only field samples were collected in sterile 10 ml centrifuge tubes fixed with 0 4 ml of concentrated formalin 37 formaldehyde and stored at 4 c samples were processed following the protocol outlined in hitchcock and mitrovic 2013 each 2 ml water sample was stained with dapi 4 6 diamindion 2 phenylindole at a final concentration of 1 mg ml for 15 mins and filtered through a polycarbonate black 0 2 μm filter porter and feig 1980 the polycarbonate filters were mounted onto glycerol based microscope slides and citfluor non fluorescence immersion oil was used to prevent fading of the dye slides were examined at 100 times magnification using a fluorescence equipped olympus bx41 compound microscope for each slide a minimum of 10 images were captured containing 500 bacterial cells images were captured using an olympus dp72 camera and cellsens standard software v1 3 images were analysed for cell abundance and volume using cellc software selinummi et al 2005 bacterial biomass was calculated using the formula given by romanova and sazhin 2010 2 3 model test description in this study a series of numerical simulations were compared with and without an integrated microbial loop to assess the validity and sensitivity of different levels of representation for heterotrophic bacterial growth and mineralisation processes within a coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical model three test cases labelled test 0 2 were considered for this application these simulations covered the period from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2014 in addition 3 shorter duration sensitivity tests labelled sensitivity test a c were performed on test 2 and covered the period from january to december 2011 all numerical simulations were run on a 15 min timestep model results were output at each timestep for the hydrodynamics and every 4 h for water

of the model constituents represented in each test case and their input data are provided in supplementary table 1 model performance was assessed based on visual inspection of time series plots of simulated and observed data for chl a tn tp and heterotrophic bacteria cf section 2 2 along with the determination of root mean squared error rmse values supplementary figs 1 8 further details on the modelling platform and the numerical test cases are provided below 2 3 1 modelling platform numerical simulations were conducted with the rma modelling suite which included rma 2 hydrodynamic model and rma 11 aquatic ecosystem response model http ikingrma iinet net au the rma modelling suite provides well established simulation and visualisation tools that have been successfully applied in a range of freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems worldwide ezzatti et al 2011 glamore et al 2019a king 2017 rma 2 is a depth averaged hydrodynamic model that uses the finite element method to numerically solve the non linear shallow water equations together with the continuity equation on a flexible mesh it is suitable for complex estuary applications and includes wetting drying processes it can operate in a fully coupled 1 d 2 d mode with rma 11 rma 11 is a depth averaged aquatic ecosystem response model that uses the finite element method to numerically solve the general mass transport equation for multiple water quality constituents at each time step it uses rma 2 results as inputs to drive mass transport and biogeochemical interactions rma 11 computes individual constituent mass changes i e growth and decay in terms of total biomass concentrations in g m3 or mg l the net growth rate rslt of biological constituents is determined by the sum of the growth minus loss terms such that 1 rsl t i μ i ρ i q i p i s i where µi growth ρi respiration qi excretion pi mortality and si settling are the temperature adjusted specific rate parameters of each constituent i rma 11 employs a monod expression monod 1949 to determine the specific growth rate of each biological constituent which requires specification of a maximum potential growth rate µmax at the reference temperature of 20 c and half saturation constants for limiting nutrients e g c n and p up to 5 algal species can be specified in rma 11 with additional limitations on growth regarding light availability and salinity the net growth terms for all biological constituents are rate adjusted using a temperature multiplier according to the simplified arrhenius equation 2 3 2 test 0 base case model an existing peer reviewed fully integrated 1d 2d hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model of the hunter river estuary was used as the base case model the base case model was developed as part of an earlier comprehensive study hunter river modelling study to assess total catchment water planning and management options for the hunter river estuary glamore et al 2019a a significant amount of data was sourced to support the hunter river modelling study that included existing datasets of bathymetry boundary conditions flow gauging and water quality cf section 2 2 where critical knowledge gaps remained additional data was collected to supplement the existing datasets a key aspect of this data gap filling exercise was the completion of a novel combination of field and laboratory microbial ecotoxicology studies with supporting genomics and physiochemical data as detailed in ruprecht et al 2020a this data was used to support the calibration and validation of the base case model applied in the hunter river modelling study full details of the base case model design and methodology as well as the data and procedures used in the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response models are provided in glamore and deiber 2017 and glamore et al 2019b respectively in brief the calibrated hydrodynamic model was determined to be fit for the purpose of driving the aquatic ecosystem response model and simulating nutrient transport in the hunter river estuary robson and cuddy 2019 the combination of the catchment water budget and statistical models used in the hunter river modelling study were suitable to provide inflow boundary conditions for the receiving aquatic ecosystem response model a machine learning model was used to provide the best predicted water quality concentrations at the upstream boundaries based on flow water temperature and a seasonal indicator event mean concentrations for key water quality constituents including tn and tp were applied at the floodplain sub catchment boundaries based on local spatial land use data dpie 2018 and typical catchment runoff concentrations from fletcher et al 2004 and duncan 2006 the aquatic ecosystem response model was developed in line with current standard practice harmel et al 2014 and included a one at a time parameter sensitivity analyses that was performed using over 50 model runs during the model calibration glamore et al 2019b the coupled model was shown to be capable of simulating a range of nutrients and biogeochemical processes including tn and tp variability in the hunter river estuary robson and cuddy 2019 however the base case model had limited ability to accurately simulate variations in chl a or zooplankton at specific locations within the estuary robson and cuddy 2019 the structure of the rma 11 base case model included representation of phytoplankton 2 algal species freshwater and marine diatoms and zooplankton copepods macro and rotifers nauplii micro species as well as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and dissolved oxygen dynamics and transport the 2 algal species chosen for the base case model were the dominant species at the study site and due to the lack of calibration data and limited guidance on options for representation of multiple functional groups as there are a few competing approaches in the literature a simpler algal model was adopted algal concentrations were converted to equivalent chl a concentrations using standard conversion factors the model also included benthic nutrient and sediment stores key benthic biogeochemical processes sediment water interactions associated with settling and resuspension of particulate materials and dissolved nutrient benthic flux a total of 21 constituents in the water column and 13 constituents in the bed were modelled it is important to note that key bacterial processes including mineralisation nitrification and denitrification were assigned to fixed bulk rate terms in the base case model based on relevant literature and model sensitivity testing glamore et al 2019b an overview of the modelled trophic structure and associated complex series of constituent interactions is provided in fig 2 2 3 3 test 1 base case model modified with corrected mineralisation rates the parameter rate values for the bacterial mineralisation processes in test 0 were 0 03 per day for don to nh4 and 0 2 per day dop to po4 these parameter rate values were found to be higher than realistically required as demonstrated in ruprecht et al 2022 based on the findings of ruprecht et al 2022 a simple approach to estimate mineralisation parameter rate values in relation to the prevailing heterotrophic bacteria and dissolved organic nutrient concentrations was implemented to this end mean concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria 0 07 mg l don 0 3 mg l and dop 0 03 mg l in the hunter river estuary were determined from the long term water quality dataset cf section 2 2 this data was used to estimate the nominal mineralisation parameter rate values for don and dop that were then assigned in test 1 the parameter rate values in test 1 were 0 02 per day for both don and dop mineralisation no other changes were made to the base case model data that was re run in test 1 2 3 4 test 2 base case model modified with an integrated microbial loop in test 2 the base case model was expanded to include an integrated microbial loop by explicitly allowing dynamic predictions of heterotrophic bacteria simulated in terms of carbon mg c l 1 and their role in the mineralisation of dissolved organic nutrients i e doc don and dop the net growth kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria cf eq 1 is assumed to be primarily limited by the dissolved organic matter concentrations and is dependent on the oxygen availability in the water column while there is an assumption in this study that heterotrophic bacterial activity is a linear function of concentration defined by a monod function it provides an initial basis for understanding the model s sensitivity to the complex dynamic biophysical processes in the hunter river estuary a default factor of 0 9 is used to account for heterotrophic bacteria competing with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients while preferencing dissolved organic nutrients kirchman 1994 heterotrophic bacteria also produce inorganic nutrients e g co2 nh3 and frp for phytoplankton growth the role of bacteria in other microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are unchanged from the base case model an overview of the expanded model interactions implemented in test 2 is provided in fig 2 a summary of the equations used in the bacteria sub model of the current research version of rma 11 is provided in appendix a the assigned rate parameter values driving the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria in test 2 were based on previous modelling detailed in ruprecht et al 2022 the authors presented a depth averaged box model that was developed based on the design of the laboratory ecotoxicology tests to represent the microbial and nutrient dynamics observed during the experiment ruprecht et al 2021 2020a 2020b the heterotrophic bacteria rate values were derived using the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 1992 combined with monte carlo sampling from uniform prior distributions of individual parameters a maximum of 10 000 random monte carlo simulations were used for each application of the glue methodology to define the parameter space 3 results 3 1 detecting model sensitivity to bacterial mineralisation rates numerical simulations with and without a microbial loop cf fig 2 supplementary table 1 identified that lower time varying bacterial mineralisation rates improved the prediction of key biological and chemical state variables revealing new insights on parameter sensitivity in aquatic ecosystem response models specifically lower fixed bulk rate parameter values for don and dop mineralisation used in test 1 improved i e rmse reduced by up to approx 30 model prediction of tp at all estuary sampling sites 1 7 cf fig 1 when compared to the base case model test 0 over the simulation period supplementary figs 3 6 calculated rmse values of chl a improved by up to approx 20 at sampling sites 1 4 6 and 7 in 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 1 while there were no significant improvements of chl a in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 4 rmse values of tn varied between approx 10 at all sampling sites over the simulation period supplementary figs 2 5 further improvements in the model performance metrics were achieved for chl a tp and tn when bacterial mineralisation was explicitly simulated in test 2 supplementary figs 1 6 fig 3 shows the effective time varying rate parameter values per day for the bacterial mineralisation of don and dop determined at the sampling sites 1 7 based on the combined model results from test 2 in 2010 and 2011 the effective mineralisation rates from test 2 depict higher rates for don and dop at sampling sites 3 4 and 6 while lower rates were found at sampling sites 1 2 5 and 7 despite some localised variability across the sampling sites the median effective mineralisation rate parameter values per day for don ranged from 0 005 to 0 030 median average 0 02 while dop ranged from 0 005 to 0 033 median average 0 02 the time variable rates of don and dop mineralisation resulted in greater relative reductions i e improvements in the calculated rmse values of chl a tn and tp in test 2 compared to the base case test 0 cf supplementary figs 1 6 the most significant improvements in model performance were seen at the lower estuary sampling sites 6 and 7 furthest away from the upstream model boundaries rmse values of chl a improved by up to approx 10 at sampling sites 6 and 7 in 2010 and 2011 supplementary fig 1 and by 40 at sampling site 7 in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 4 all other calculated rmse values of chl a were higher than the base case model model performance of tn improved at all estuary sampling sites except for sampling site 3 in 2010 and 2011 with the highest reductions in rmse values up to 20 at sampling sites 6 and 7 supplementary fig 2 there were no significant improvements of tn in 2013 and 2014 supplementary fig 5 similar relative reductions i e improvements in the rmse values of tp occurred at all estuary sampling sites over the simulation period in tests 1 and 2 supplementary figs 3 6 3 2 temporal variability in model s response the temporal variability in the model response for chl a tn and tp against the observed data cf section 2 2 at sampling site 6 is provided from 2010 to 2011 fig 4 and from 2013 to 2014 fig 5 sampling site 6 was selected for this purpose as it is mid estuary site which showed the greatest differences in the predicted variability between the numerical model tests there were no clear seasonal patterns or significant blooms in chl a observed at this site from 2010 to 2014 with mean concentrations of less than 10 µg l 1 at times peak concentrations in chl a followed large rainfall events cf fig 5 supplementary fig 9 nutrient concentrations were relatively high and varied seasonally during the monitoring period fig 4 there was a pattern of higher concentrations of tn and tp over the winter period june september and early summer and in many cases the lowest nutrient concentrations occurred in autumn differences in the model s predictive capability were related to the level of representation of microbial ecosystem functioning in test 0 variability in tn and tp was generally under predicted while variability in chl a concentrations was often over predicted figs 4 and 5 the base case model predicted consistent algal bloom events at times where blooms were not observed indicating that the model required further refinement to better understand the biogeochemical processes involved in test 1 the model again under predicted tp and over predicted chl a concentrations while subtle changes were observed in the prediction of tn figs 4 and 5 however decreasing the fixed rate mineralisation parameters for don and dop generally improved the model performance for tp and chl a in test 1 compared to test 0 cf section 3 1 in test 2 there were noticeable improvements in the observed variability timing and patterns of chl a and tn figs 4 and 5 in terms of chl a the model in test 2 reproduced some of the observed interannual variation in the average and peak biomass values in addition the model captured the observed variability in tn over the simulation period suggesting that the model in test 2 is more sensitive to the role of bacterial processes in the decay of organic material and potential shifts in nitrogen to phosphorus ratios modelled bacterial dynamics versus observations cf section 2 2 at sampling sites 1 2 and 6 are shown in figs 6 and 7 the observed heterotrophic bacterial biomass data across the estuary displayed limited seasonal variation with mean concentrations consistently less than 0 1 mg c l 1 throughout the simulation period while the model performed well in simulating the observed low concentration bacterial dynamics during winter the model generally over predicted interannual bacteria growth during summer with peak concentrations of approximately 1 0 mg c l 1 this indicates that temperature dependant growth rates may have a strong influence on the predicted variability of heterotrophic bacteria in the model the marked increase in modelled bacterial biomass in summer also corresponded to higher predicted chl a concentrations cf figs 4 and 5 this may be in part related to the influence of grazing by higher trophic levels e g zooplankton which is not well represented in these simulations cf section 2 3 as a result the simulated bacteria values did not always match the observed variations and peaks which impacted the rmse values used to assess model performance supplementary figs 7 8 4 discussion interrogating the complex relationships between hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes driving water quality variability in waterways is important as it assists in understanding the broader aquatic ecosystem response on the pathway to sustainable water management within numerical models the accurate representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and their ability to mineralise organic matter i e n and p is increasingly important it was found that the explicit representation of heterotrophic bacterial dynamics associated with functional mineralisation processes improved the prediction of chl a at the lower estuary sampling sites 6 and 7 however the model is highly sensitive to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria and mass transport processes i e advection dispersion dilution driven by the applied hydrodynamic boundary conditions an example of the interactions of hydrodynamic boundary conditions and heterotrophic bacterial process rate kinetics in the hunter river estuary is provided in fig 8 this is demonstrated at sampling site 6 for 2 different river flow conditions including average i e dry weather fig 8 a and high i e flushing event flows fig 8 b which are typical of temperate estuaries in australia hitchcock and mitrovic 2015b sampling site 6 is suitable for this purpose as it is located within the mixing zone of the hunter river estuary approximately 26 km upstream from the ocean boundary cf fig 1 further this site showed high sensitivity to changes in the model structure cf section 3 1 and highlights the interplay of sub daily tidal variations and intermittent flushing events on bacterial dynamics the selected time periods for each flow condition captures the full range of predicted average water temperatures at sampling site 6 where the values transition from a warming period in spring and summer i e october february to a cooling period in autumn i e march rmatrk king 2020 which is adapted from degeorge 1996 was used to simulate particle transport at the study site a single particle i e ignoring any dispersion was released at 2 locations including the upstream boundary of the hunter river labelled bg in fig 8 a 8 b and at sampling site 6 labelled s6 in fig 8 a 8 b to illustrate the tidal excursion i e net transport across the estuary after 72 h i e approximately 3 diurnal tidal cycles under different river flow conditions this analysis reflects the estuary transit times and is used to show the effects of hydrodynamics on the model response sensitivity to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria a representative modelled response to average flow conditions at the study site was observed during the period from january to march in 2011 fig 8 a supplementary fig 9 this period shows that under average flow conditions the mid estuary is strongly influenced by the flood and ebb tidal flows e g shown by the predicted variability in the heterotrophic bacteria concentration and received relatively low upstream catchment freshwater inflows 5000 ml day it should be noted that similar average flow conditions were observed in the adjoining major tributaries including the paterson and williams rivers supplementary fig 9 under average flow conditions a particle dropped at the upstream boundary of the hunter river moved approximately 9 kms downstream due to the modelled inflows where the tidal signal is weaker however a particle dropped at sampling site 6 is shown to travel approximately 3 kms upstream and downstream of its starting position due to stronger tidal influences while there is negligible net transport over the same period this indicates that point source nutrient additions including moderate 10 concentrations of wastewater effluent discharges ruprecht et al 2021 could have a pronounced effect on the ecological response in the system under average flow conditions this study revealed that the model s response sensitivity is affected by variability in tn concentrations under average flow conditions in early january 2011 the predicted heterotrophic bacteria biomass increased over 2 weeks due to a positive net growth rate and high tn concentrations fig 8 a this activity subsequently reduced the tn available to the heterotrophic bacteria for growth i e increases nitrogen limitation which caused a decline in net growth rates negative net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria led to a die off event that extended until mid february 2011 during the die off period the natural mortality of heterotrophic bacteria likely contributed to the labile autochthonous within the system organic material in the water column this was supplemented by a relatively small inflow event in mid to late february that delivered allochthonous outside the system nutrients and increased tn concentrations it is worth noting that the available nutrients across the estuary are concerned with additional sources and sinks including the net growth rate components of algae linked via a microbial loop this may also affect the model s response sensitivity which is linked to the dynamic relationship between available nutrient concentrations and the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria similarly the model s response sensitivity for heterotrophic bacteria was strongly dependant on the variability of water temperatures under average flow conditions a small inflow event in mid to late february 2011 increased the predicted average water temperatures by approximately 3 c at sampling site 6 this caused the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria to increase from approximately 0 5 to 0 1 per day which resulted in a boom more than 200 increase in biomass over the period from late february to early march 2011 fig 8 a there is also clear evidence to indicate that the tidal influence resulted in higher predicted variability in the heterotrophic bacteria concentrations at this site fig 8 a this cyclic process described above continued throughout march 2011 and highlights the sensitivity of the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria as the predicted average water temperatures deviated from the reference value of 20 c applied in the temperature function in contrast this study showed a significantly different model response during modelled high flow conditions a large flushing event was observed in late november 2011 fig 8 b under these higher flow conditions a particle dropped at the upstream boundary of the hunter river on the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is transported past sampling site 6 after approximately 39 h fig 8 b the modelled response to the flushing event suggests that localised overland freshwater inflows from the surrounding floodplain also played a relatively important role in the timing of the peak downstream this has potential implications on the model s response sensitivity due to the event mean concentration values applied at these sub catchment boundaries cf section 2 3 2 however this flushing event was selected because it was predominately constrained to the hunter river catchment and eliminated the additional complexities in understanding the model s response sensitivity to the co occurrence of flooding in the adjoining paterson and williams river s catchments supplementary fig 9 the results from this study also suggest that nutrient availability and water temperatures during high flow conditions have implications on the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria e g sampling site 6 the weeks preceding the large flushing event in late november 2011 corresponded to relatively average flow conditions cf fig 8 a b at average water temperatures of approximately 25 c there was moderate tn availability for heterotrophic bacteria growth which resulted in relatively stable net growth rates of approximately 0 1 per day and concentrations around 0 2 0 3 mg l the flushing event caused a substantial step change in these parameters as the site discharge increased up to approximately 70 000 ml day with the flood hydrograph rising and falling over approximately 2 weeks predicted average water temperatures increased by approximately 3 c and high tn concentrations resulted in a net growth rate change from approximately 0 0 to 0 5 per day despite a relatively high positive net growth rate and the available nutrients the freshwater inflows caused a sudden drop in the heterotrophic bacteria concentration to a value of 0 07 mg l which is equal to the applied constant boundary condition value the long duration event resulted in these conditions extending for several days at sampling site 6 as the freshwater inflows transported mass through the system further the modelled system response indicated the sensitivity of the net growth rate kinetics for heterotrophic bacteria as the flood hydrograph receded in december 2011 this sensitivity was likely due to the high variability in the predicted average water temperatures and nutrient availability in early december 2011 the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria halved caused by a drop in the predicted average water temperatures and tn concentrations in mid december 2011 a relatively moderate inflow event 15 500 ml day was followed by higher predicted average water temperatures that increased the net growth rate and led to a boom of heterotrophic bacteria in late december 2011 there was a significant increase in heterotrophic bacteria biomass as average flow conditions returned at sampling site 6 this coincided with a drop in the net growth rate caused by lower predicted average water temperatures and tn availability this further emphasises the importance of modelling accurate boundary conditions and highlights how the model s response sensitivity to the net growth rate kinetics of heterotrophic bacteria can be affected spatially across an estuary during high flow conditions a series of sensitivity tests are provided to demonstrate the challenges of calibrating mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models which was beyond the scope of this study and interrogating their response against observed data the sensitivity tests a c are shown at sampling site 6 for 2011 fig 9 the sensitivity tests were compared against test 2 supplementary table 2 and 3 different test cases were examined by changing several heterotrophic bacterial rate parameters these included i a reduction in the net nominal growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria by changing the maximum specific growth rate doc excretion rate and the natural mortality rate sensitivity test a ii a reduction in the temperature multiplier applied to all heterotrophic bacterial rate parameters except natural mortality sensitivity test b and iii a reduction of the half saturation coefficient for nitrogen as the hunter river estuary was nitrogen limited sensitivity test c the sensitivity tests revealed that there was no change in the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria during the large flushing event in late november 2011 while i lowering the net growth rate reduced concentrations across all other conditions ii lowering the temperature multiplier showed limited sensitivity increasing growth in winter and reducing growth in summer and iii lowering the half saturation coefficient for nitrogen increased sensitivity to nutrient availability particularly after the flushing event in this study the observed dataset is scientifically robust and beyond what most large modelling studies have available for model calibration and testing while parameter sensitivity made it difficult to discern the accuracy of the model predictions the sensitivity tests fig 9 revealed that the model can over predict the observed data and supressing the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria by approximately 25 sensitivity test a improved the model fit in november 2011 the model predictions from the sensitivity tests indicated a peak concentration that may have occurred due to high heterotrophic bacteria growth is quickly returned to the applied constant boundary condition value here we have assumed for demonstration purposes that the same concentration of heterotrophic bacteria enters during average and high flow conditions this is a conservative assumption and it is likely that the concentration would change when a large flushing event occurs carney et al 2015 which could affect the model s response sensitivity for example a decreased concentration before or during the flushing event could lower the starting heterotrophic bacteria concentrations for the december 2011 period where growth occurs cf figs 8 and 9 it is possible that the microbial field sampling missed the peak heterotrophic bacteria concentrations that occurred before the flood effects were evident further it is possible that current zooplankton boundary concentrations and initial conditions are too high possibly due to an issue in converting from biomass to nitrogen content as represented in the model and microbial algae and heterotrophic bacteria growth rates are too high to counteract the resulting excess grazing pressure this highlights the importance of understanding and measuring the system hydrodynamics before designing a microbial field sampling program and further calibration driven by a more systematic exploration of the parameter space 5 conclusion this study highlights that an overarching co ordinated modelling approach is needed to address waterway pollution in riverine catchments including potential eutrophication impacts from wastewater discharges in this regard a renewed focus on integrated ecological and physical processes is recommended to better inform best practice management of aquatic ecosystem values and functions to improve the water management outcomes for a large estuary in south eastern australia an existing coupled hydrodynamic and aquatic ecosystem response model was expanded to include an integrated microbial loop allowing explicit representation of heterotrophic bacteria growth and their role in mineralising dissolved organic nutrients a unique long term water quality dataset at the study site was opportunistically used to validate and assess the model s response sensitivity to complex biophysical processes driving the observed water quality variability it was revealed that explicit time varying bacterial mineralisation rates provide an improved understanding of the broader aquatic ecosystem response than assigned fixed parameter rate values which are typically derived from wide non location specific literature ranges we have shown that boundary conditions are critical in driving the system response with both net transport rates and the net growth rates of heterotrophic bacteria indicating different model sensitivities under average flow conditions a smaller net transport and reduced nutrient availability had a pronounced effect on lowering net growth rates through the applied limitation factors during high flow conditions freshwater inflows increased net transport and nutrient loads which resulted in higher net growth rates credit authorship contribution statement

dsil load j at a specific wwtp was estimated using the following equation 1 l o a d j f j c j p j where cj is the concentration of sil or dsil in wwtp j fj is the flow rate of influent wastewater in wwtp j pj is the model population served by wwtp j in this study the per capita consumption of sil m s i l j at a specific wwtp was estimated using the following equation 2 m s i l j f j m s i l p j x s i l x d s i l c s i l j m s i l c d s i l j m d s i l where csil j is the concentration of sil in wwtp j cdsil j is the concentration of dsil in wwtp j m s i l is the molecular weight of sil m d s i l is the molecular weight of dsil x s i l is the excretion rate of sil and x d s i l is the excretion rate of dsil the per capita daily consumption of other compounds m i at a specific wwtp was estimated using the following equation 3 m i j c i j f j c f p j where ci j is the concentration of biomarkers in wwtp j and cf is the correction factor for the compounds as shown in the supplementary information appendix c table c1 population is an important parameter in back calculation the population currently used mainly includes the service population of wwtps du et al 2015 the population of water quality parameter models zheng et al 2019 and the population of mobile phone signals plosz et al 2013 to accurately assess the service population of a wwtp a population model was established using ammonia nitrogen nh4 n cot and flow population the correlation coefficients of flow population with nh4 n population and cot were 0 81 and 0 79 respectively according to the analytic hierarchy process the population model was established by the judgment matrix deduced from the coefficient matrix using the following equation 4 p m o d e l 0 53 p f l o w 0 33 p n h 4 n 0 14 p c o t the correlation between the model population and the other three populations were above 0 9 thereby indicating that the model population had high accuracy appendix c the prevalence of sil can be calculated by using the mean consumption typical dose and frequency based on the following equation 5 j m i j r 15 d i n d where r 15 is the proportion of the adult population aged over 15 years old among the general population d is the dose 50 mg cohen 2000 and n d is the average frequency of use once per week xiang et al 2021 2 6 statistical analysis all calculations and statistical tests were performed using spss and origin 2021 software differences between individual groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova and correlations were calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient statistical significance was set at p 0 05 a monte carlo simulation was used to analyze the prevalence and its parameter distribution is presented in appendix d geographic information was obtained using arcgis version 10 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sil and dsil occurrence in wastewater the investigated compounds in the influent of 33 chinese cities are shown in the supplementary information appendix e fig e1 the stability of these compunds is an important parameter to evaluate the consumption previous studies have shown that these compounds were relatively stable in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 choi et al 2020 croft et al 2020 gao et al 2018 lin et al 2021 for the stability of sil and dsil causanilles et al 2016 have reported that they were relatively stable at natural ph and 4 c over 48 h causanilles et al 2016 in this study the detection frequency of sil and dsil in the wastewater was 100 the concentrations of sil in wastewater ranged from 2 16 to 50 9 ng l with a mean value of 12 ng l which was lower than that in uk 25 ng l baker and barbara 2019 xiamen china 30 ng l sun et al 2014 beuerbach germany 32 ng l nieto et al 2010 korea 75 ng l hong et al 2021 and greece 104 ng l papageorgiou et al 2016 and similar to that in eight european cities 15 ng l causanilles et al 2018 the concentration of its metabolite dsil ranged from loq to 104 ng l with a mean value of 24 ng l which was similar to that in european cities 24 ng l causanilles et al 2018 to our knowledge there is limited information on the excretion rate of sil however it can be calculated based on the concentration ratio of sil to its metabolites in wastewater causanilles et al 2018 reported that the excretion rate of desethylsildenafil desil sil metabolite and dsil in wastewater was 27 the concentration ratios of desil to dsil and dsil to sil in wastewater was 2 08 and 1 57 respectively causanilles et al 2018 table e1 in this study the dsil concentration in wastewater were significantly correlated with sil r 2 0 72 p 0 05 fig e2 and the concentration ratio 1 63 is highly consistent with that reported by causanilles et al 2018 1 57 thereby indicating that they were highly homologous metabolized by humans no external source therefore the concentration ratio of desil dsil and sil may be approximately equal to the excretion rate based on the concentration ratios reported by causanilles et al 2018 we calculated the excretion rates of desil dsil and sil to be 18 1 8 9 and 5 7 respectively fig e3 in addition venhuis et al 2014b reported that the excretion rate of sil was assessed by the ratio of sil mass load to sil consumption venhuis et al 2014b they found that the excretion rate of sil was 10 which was consistent with oral bioavailability 92 in literature sil is excreted as metabolites does not contain unchanged sil predominantly in the feces approximately 80 of the administered oral dose and to a lesser extent in the urine approximately 13 of the administered oral dose https labeling pfizer com showlabeling aspx id 645 section 11 2 indicating that an oral bioavailability of sil was 93 also consistented with the value in the literature of 92 the remaining 7 does not enter the systemic circulation which is directly excreted as a parent drug in this study the excretion rate of sil 5 7 recalculated by the ratio of metabolite concentrations in wastewater was close to 7 the excretion rate of sil in this study was lower than that reported by venhuis et al 2014b due to differences in estimation methods venhuis et al 2014b the excretion rate used for sil consumption estimates were uncertain and the mass loads of sil and dsil are listed in table e2 3 2 spatio temporal profiles of sil use the consumption of sil in 38 wwtps was estimated by using the correction factor 5 7 of sil and 8 9 of dsil and model population the highest consumption of sil was found in qd 132 mg d 1000 people followed by xa 115 mg d 1000 people and dx 104 mg d 1000 people with the lowest consumption in scz 10 6 mg d 1000 people appendix f fig f1 the mean consumption of sil was 53 mg d 1000 people in china which was calculated by using population weight which was higher than eight european cities 41 8 mg d 1000 people causanilles et al 2018 according to the total population 1 38 billion and the mean per capita consumption the actual consumption of sil was estimated to be 26842 kg and the total market value was 18 8 billion rmb 50 mg tablet for 35 rmb in china in 2018 the results showed that prescription sales data 3570 kg accounted for only 13 3 of actual use the estimated sil excretion rate in this study may increase the uncertainty in evaluating the use of unregistered sil based on the report by venhuis et al 2014b the excretion rate of sil 10 was used to estimate the consumption of sil with the mean value of 33 2 mg d 1000 people and the total consumption of 16722 kg indicating that prescription sales data accounted for 20 of the actual use venhuis et al 2014b table f1 although the excretion rates of sil used varied these results indicated that unregistered sil was used in large quantities and this phenomenon was common in some countries causanilles et al 2018 hong et al 2021 venhuis et al 2014a for example causanilles et al 2018 reported that non prescription sales data of sil accounted for 47 of use in europe thereby reflecting the high risk of illicit sil use causanilles et al 2018 as the population ages and the incidence of ed increases the potential market for sil increasing the low risk of prosecution and the ease of selling via internet pharmacies means that more counterfeiters are taking advantage of this growing market for high financial returns consumers often expose themselves to unnecessary health risks by taking sil containing products or buying counterfeit medicines via irregular channels to our knowledge this is the first report of the spatial use of sil in china sil consumption was the highest in northwest china 86 1 mg d 1000 people followed by east china 70 2 mg d 1000 people and south china 61 mg d 1000 people with low consumption in north china 24 6 mg d 1000 people and central china 26 6 mg d 1000 people fig 1 the consumption indicated at most wwtps in northwest china was significantly above the mean one way anova found that the mean value in northwest china was significantly higher than east southwest and central china p 0 05 furthermore the consumption of sil in north china 72 mg d 1000 people is significantly higher than south china 41 4 mg d 1000 people which was due to the significant differences in demographics economy transport and marital status between north and south china as determined by analyzing 32 descriptors sil consumption calculated by wbe and population were used to calculate the sil use in each province in 2018 the sil consumption calculated by wbe in guangdong henan and shandong provinces were 2000 kg whereas that in ningxia xizang and qinghai provinces was less than 200 kg because of their small populations fig f2 and table f2 to accurately assess the prevalence of sil in the population monte carlo simulation was used and the results showed that the prevalence of sil in males aged 15 years was 2 24 appendix d fig d1 previous epidemiological surveys have shown that the incidence of ed in asian men ranges from 10 to 70 kessler et al 2019 as determined by the international index of erectile function iief and self satisfaction identification cappelleri et al 2005 the proportion of men with ed was higher than the prevalence of sil use thereby indicating a low proportion of men diagnosed with ed in the iief taking the medication for treatment kessler et al 2019 maestre lorén et al 2021 these results imply that the potential market for sil use in china is infinite 3 3 factors affecting sil use the incidence of ed in men may be related to multiple factors lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use increase the risk of ed kohn et al 2021 some comorbidities may affect erectile function in men socio economic factors are also intrinsically linked to the disease with single divorced and unemployed men at higher risk allen and walter 2019 in this study factors affecting the sil use were confirmed by the difference in medical use in north and south china the incidence of the disease with respect to sex and other clinical studies 3 3 1 sil use with comorbidities wbe is a powerful tool for extracting the use of different chemicals in wastewater from which relevant medical information can be obtained lai et al 2013 ort et al 2010 senta et al 2015 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2005 the relationship between sil use and comorbidities was determined by analyzing the correlations with the consumption of medicines selected for this study gout as shown in fig 3 sil consumption was positively correlated with alp use r2 0 5 p 0 001 the mean consumption of alp was 21 g d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 26 g d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 10 4 g d 1000 people p 0 05 thereby indicating that the prevalence of gout in north china 5 2 was higher than that in south china 2 07 the prevalence of gout was 3 37 which was calculated by the alp consumption dose 500 mg d and frequency 1 dose d a traditional epidemiological study reported that the prevalence of gout was 2 39 3 61 in males and 1 39 in females yang et al 2019 the male population is affected by gout and has a large overlap with the population with ed therefore patients with these two diseases are relatively consistent the incidence of ed in patients with gout exceeds that in patients without gout and increases with age gelber 2015 in addition we found that alp consumption was positively correlated with hyd use r2 0 4 p 0 01 thereby strongly suggesting that some diseases do not exist alone and are associated with high incidence of chronic diseases in contemporary society hypertension there was a positive correlation between sil and hyd use r2 0 6 p 0 001 the mean consumption of hyd was 9 18 mg d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 10 5 mg d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 7 mg d 1000 people p 0 05 which was similar to the spatial pattern of sil use kapur and schwarz 2007 reported that ed occurs in 30 of patients with hypertension because endothelial dysfunction can lead to increased vascular smooth muscle contraction during hypertension and or ed kapur and schwarz 2007 nunes et al 2012 hyd is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and studies have shown that ed is the highest in patients treated with diuretics hypertension shares the same risk factors as ed such as diabetes smoking hyperlipidemia and lifestyle factors burchardt et al 2000 illicit drugs diabetes and depression liu et al 2021 and shao et al 2020 investigated the use of methamphetamine ketamine heroin codeine morphine and methadone in different regions of china we used these data to analyze the correlation between illicit drugs and sil use but there was no correlation in the sampling cities p 0 05 liu et al 2021 shao et al 2020 indicating that these compounds were not co consumed with sil appendix g fig g1 to our knowledge there were few reports on tra and oxy in china du et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 and the correlation between opioids and ed has not been reported in this study we found that there was no correlation between the consumption of sil and the consumption of oxy and tra oxy was detected in only four wwtps in china with a small national use so there was no correlation with sil use the mean consumption of tra was 21 mg d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 35 8 mg d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 14 2 mg d 1000 people the geographical differences between tra and sil use was the same but the differences in tra use were not significant table 1 fig 2 for diabetes we investigated the use of metformin met in previous work but there was no correlation between met and sil use p 0 05 shao et al 2021 therefore no association was found between sil use and diabetes in the sample cities for depression there was no correlation between the use of par and sil par consumption in north china 0 97 mg d 1000 people was lower than that in south china 1 24 mg d 1000 people which was different from sil use depression and ed are subjective diseases the treatment of which depends on the patient s condition and doctor s advice however some patients do not seek medical care for the condition moreover 10 of men with ed have depression which is a risk factor for ed okulate et al 2003 3 3 2 sil use and lifestyle factors smoking most comorbidities are related to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption derby et al 2000 we found a positive correlation between the consumption of nicotine nic and sil r2 0 3 p 0 05 nic consumption in north china was higher than that in south china gao et al 2020 shao et al 2021 which was similar to the spatial difference in sil use the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that 27 7 of chinese adults aged 15 and older smoke including 52 1 of males and 2 7 of females ccdc 2015 the results suggest that there is an overlap between smokers and sil users furthermore clinical and basic scientific studies have shown that smoking affects erectile function by impairing endothelium dependent smooth muscle relaxation smoking increases the likelihood of moderate or complete ed by 2 fold thereby reflecting the intrinsic association between smoking and sil use mcvary et al 2001 alcohol use there were positive correlation between alcohol consumption and sil r2 0 4 p 0 05 and alp use r2 0 6 p 0 001 the mean consumption of alcohol was 8 36 ml d people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 10 7 ml d people was higher than that in south china 5 65 ml d people p 0 05 which was similar to the spatial difference in sil use the world health organization reported that the prevalence of alcohol dependence is higher in men 4 4 than in women 0 1 thereby indicating that alcohol use is consistent with sil consumption who 2018 contrary to the popular belief that alcohol is an aphrodisiac there is scientific evidence that long term drinking can cause sexual dysfunction prabhakaran et al 2018 the risk of alcohol use is directly related to the diastolic peak velocity and male alcohol dependent patients have a higher incidence of sexual dysfunction dachille et al 2008 similarly the correlation between alp and alcohol use overlapped which indirectly supported the influence of alcohol consumption on sil use 3 3 3 sil use and socio economic factors in this study 34 representative descriptors were investigated to reflect the socio economic factors appendix g pearson correlation analysis showed that the total consumption of sil estimated by per capital consumption and total population in each province was positively correlated with the population aged over 64 po retire r2 0 46 p 0 03 the orderly dependency ratio odr r2 0

to 15 among men aged 40 to 70 years feldman et al 1994 sil consumption increases as the population ages johannes et al 2000 internet and transportation had a significant positive correlation with sil use with the internet being the preferred way to purchase sil thereby reflecting the influence of convenient transportation conditions on sil use according to this study sil is easily obtained on the internet as an ingredient in fake medicine tonic food and chinese traditional medicine moreover based on the analysis of the demographic structure sil is mainly used by men over the age of 15 who are married in contrast negative correlations were found between sil consumption and people working in accommodation po accommodation r2 0 5 p 0 02 and the unemployment rate uneployment r2 0 51 p 0 01 thereby reflecting the influence of occupation on sil use sil is used less in cities with high unemployment because there is no fixed income 4 conclusion this study determined that prescription sales of sil account for 13 3 of actual use in china mainly because sil is often mixed with food and medicinal diet as an ingredient or used as a recreational medicine in addition sil consumption was significantly higher in north china than in south china which was influenced by socioeconomic factors correlation studies showed that sil consumption was positively correlated with alp and hyd consumption which is consistent with traditional epidemiological investigations unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use increase the consumption of sil and may increase the risk of ed combining wbe studies with traditional epidemiological and clinical studies may help to assess the legitimate use of sil for the treatment of ed and provide evidence for comorbid drivers and social factors that influence sil use declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest to declare acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation

15967,sildenafil sil is widely used to treat erectile dysfunction information on its consumption and the factors influencing its use is limited in china in this study we sampled composite influent wastewater samples from 33 chinese cities and analyzed sil using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry sil consumption was estimated using wastewater based epidemiology wbe and ranged from 10 6 mg d 1000 people to 132 mg d 1000 people with a mean of 53 mg d 1000 people prescription sales 3570 kg accounted for 13 3 of the estimated sil use 26842 kg in 2018 thereby implying that sil illicit use was greater than prescription use in china some regional differences were observed in sil use which was significantly higher in north china than south china p 0 05 thereby reflecting that the prevalence of sil was affected by differences in lifestyle and socioeconomic factors we found significant positive correlations between sil use and consumption of allopurinol hydrochlorothiazide nicotine and alcohol thereby suggesting that the prevalence of sil was associated with the prevalence of gout hypertension smoking and drinking moreover age structures internet use and marriage rates were positively correlated with sil use whereas the unemployment rate was negatively correlated with sil use our study demonstrates that wbe is valuable for medical research to investigate licit and illicit drug use and to assess the underlying associations of different chemical uses graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sildenafil comorbidities lifestyles correlation wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors pde 5i are used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ed among which sildenafil sil has significant efficacy and improvement of male sexual function mulhall 1997 with high sales in various countries in china baiyun mountain pharmaceutical company has been producing generic versions of sil and offering them at a lower price since the pfizer patent expired in 2012 the sil prescription sales data of the company showed that 47 7 million tablets 2384 kg of sil were sold in 2018 accounting for 66 8 of national sales in addition pfizer and jiangsu yabang aipusen pharmaceutical co ltd accounted for 28 54 and 4 66 of national sales respectively https www menet com cn the total prescription sales were 3570 kg in china however unregistered analogs on the market are also produced and sold in tonics dietary supplements and health food products hong et al 2021 therefore the potential market demand for sil and its use as an illicit ingredient are unknown in china surveys of self reported use and seizure data are not suitable for assessing the consumption of sil as an ingredient the best option at present is to use wastewater based epidemiology wbe wastewater is a potential agglomeration of chemicals used by population and powerful tool for distinguishing licit and illicit compound use it is widely used to investigate illicit drugs lai et al 2011 mathieu et al 2011 plosz et al 2013 thai et al 2014 new psychoactive substances bade et al 2021 castiglioni et al 2021 and personal care products gao et al 2018 senta et al 2015 meanwhile various biomarkers in wastewater represent different chemical usage and lifestyle factors of the population analysis of the potential relationships between these biomarkers can be used to assess correlations between chemical use and population behavior and health status castiglioni et al 2011 choi et al 2019 shao et al 2021 the detection frequency of sil in wastewater is higher than that of vardenafil and tadalafil thereby proving that sil is the most widely used pde 5i nieto et al 2010 a study in korea found that the sil concentration significantly increased on weekends especially in the areas where adult entertainment businesses are common the study concluded that people ingested a large amount of pde 5i without a legitimate prescription hong et al 2021 a survey in eight european cities found similar conclusions with the use of unregistered sil accounting for 53 causanilles et al 2018 moreover venhuis et al 2014a found at least 60 of the wastewater loads of sil were from unregistered sil in the netherlands venhuis et al 2014a there has been no national survey of the sil market to evaluate ed treatment in china the objective of our work was to investigate the potential market demand for sil and the spatio temporal profiles of sil use in 38 wastewater treatment plants wwtps from 33 cities in 7 regions of china the use of illicit ingredients was calculated by comparing the actual use from wbe and prescription sales data we analyzed biomarkers representing comorbidities and lifestyle factors in wastewater to determine their associations with chemical use in addition 34 representative descriptors from 33 chinese cities were investigated to compare geographical differences and explore the relevant factors influencing the use of sil these descriptors were grouped into ten categories including population occupation economy housing communications transport education health marital status and weight 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of analytes in total nine analytes were classified into three categories as possible biomarkers for evaluating the sil correlations between opioids comorbidities and lifestyle factors for biomarkers of opioids the parent compounds of tramadol tra and oxycodone oxy were included the selection of comorbidity biomarkers were based on the use of medicines for hypertension gout and depression which have a high impact on the urban chinese population the main medications for classical comorbidities were included in the analysis to compare their use namely sil and its metabolite of desmethylsildenafil dsil for ed oxypurinol oxp as the main metabolite of allopurinol alp for gout hydrochlorothiazide hyd for hypertension and paroxetine par for depression for lifestyle biomarkers of cotinine cot of nicotine and ethyl hydrogen sulfate ets metabolite of alcohol were included 2 2 reagents and materials the analytes sil dsil cot ets cotinine d3 ethyl hydrogen sulphate

using ammonia nitrogen nh4 n cot and flow population the correlation coefficients of flow population with nh4 n population and cot were 0 81 and 0 79 respectively according to the analytic hierarchy process the population model was established by the judgment matrix deduced from the coefficient matrix using the following equation 4 p m o d e l 0 53 p f l o w 0 33 p n h 4 n 0 14 p c o t the correlation between the model population and the other three populations were above 0 9 thereby indicating that the model population had high accuracy appendix c the prevalence of sil can be calculated by using the mean consumption typical dose and frequency based on the following equation 5 j m i j r 15 d i n d where r 15 is the proportion of the adult population aged over 15 years old among the general population d is the dose 50 mg cohen 2000 and n d is the average frequency of use once per week xiang et al 2021 2 6 statistical analysis all calculations and statistical tests were performed using spss and origin 2021 software differences between individual groups were analyzed by one way analysis of variance anova and correlations were calculated using the pearson correlation coefficient statistical significance was set at p 0 05 a monte carlo simulation was used to analyze the prevalence and its parameter distribution is presented in appendix d geographic information was obtained using arcgis version 10 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 sil and dsil occurrence in wastewater the investigated compounds in the influent of 33 chinese cities are shown in the supplementary information appendix e fig e1 the stability of these compunds is an important parameter to evaluate the consumption previous studies have shown that these compounds were relatively stable in wastewater ahmed et al 2020 choi et al 2020 croft et al 2020 gao et al 2018 lin et al 2021 for the stability of sil and dsil causanilles et al 2016 have reported that they were relatively stable at natural ph and 4 c over 48 h causanilles et al 2016 in this study the detection frequency of sil and dsil in the wastewater was 100 the concentrations of sil in wastewater ranged from 2 16 to 50 9 ng l with a mean value of 12 ng l which was lower than that in uk 25 ng l baker and barbara 2019 xiamen china 30 ng l sun et al 2014 beuerbach germany 32 ng l nieto et al 2010 korea 75 ng l hong et al 2021 and greece 104 ng l papageorgiou et al 2016 and similar to that in eight european cities 15 ng l causanilles et al 2018 the concentration of its metabolite dsil ranged from loq to 104 ng l with a mean value of 24 ng l which was similar to that in european cities 24 ng l causanilles et al 2018 to our knowledge there is limited information on the excretion rate of sil however it can be calculated based on the concentration ratio of sil to its metabolites in wastewater causanilles et al 2018 reported that the excretion rate of desethylsildenafil desil sil metabolite and dsil in wastewater was 27 the concentration ratios of desil to dsil and dsil to sil in wastewater was 2 08 and 1 57 respectively causanilles et al 2018 table e1 in this study the dsil concentration in wastewater were significantly correlated with sil r 2 0 72 p 0 05 fig e2 and the concentration ratio 1 63 is highly consistent with that reported by causanilles et al 2018 1 57 thereby indicating that they were highly homologous metabolized by humans no external source therefore the concentration ratio of desil dsil and sil may be approximately equal to the excretion rate based on the concentration ratios reported by causanilles et al 2018 we calculated the excretion rates of desil dsil and sil to be 18 1 8 9 and 5 7 respectively fig e3 in addition venhuis et al 2014b reported that the excretion rate of sil was assessed by the ratio of sil mass load to sil consumption venhuis et al 2014b they found that the excretion rate of sil was 10 which was consistent with oral bioavailability 92 in literature sil is excreted as metabolites does not contain unchanged sil predominantly in the feces approximately 80 of the administered oral dose and to a lesser extent in the urine approximately 13 of the administered oral dose https labeling pfizer com showlabeling aspx id 645 section 11 2 indicating that an oral bioavailability of sil was 93 also consistented with the value in the literature of 92 the remaining 7 does not enter the systemic circulation which is directly excreted as a parent drug in this study the excretion rate of sil 5 7 recalculated by the ratio of metabolite concentrations in wastewater was close to 7 the excretion rate of sil in this study was lower than that reported by venhuis et al 2014b due to differences in estimation methods venhuis et al 2014b the excretion rate used for sil consumption estimates were uncertain and the mass loads of sil and dsil are listed in table e2 3 2 spatio temporal profiles of sil use the consumption of sil in 38 wwtps was estimated by using the correction factor 5 7 of sil and 8 9 of dsil and model population the highest consumption of sil was found in qd 132 mg d 1000 people followed by xa 115 mg d 1000 people and dx 104 mg d 1000 people with the lowest consumption in scz 10 6 mg d 1000 people appendix f fig f1 the mean consumption of sil was 53 mg d 1000 people in china which was calculated by using population weight which was higher than eight european cities 41 8 mg d 1000 people causanilles et al 2018 according to the total population 1 38 billion and the mean per capita consumption the actual consumption of sil was estimated to be 26842 kg and the total market value was 18 8 billion rmb 50 mg tablet for 35 rmb in china in 2018 the results showed that prescription sales data 3570 kg accounted for only 13 3 of actual use the estimated sil excretion rate in this study may increase the uncertainty in evaluating the use of unregistered sil based on the report by venhuis et al 2014b the excretion rate of sil 10 was used to estimate the consumption of sil with the mean value of 33 2 mg d 1000 people and the total consumption of 16722 kg indicating that prescription sales data accounted for 20 of the actual use venhuis et al 2014b table f1 although the excretion rates of sil used varied these results indicated that unregistered sil was used in large quantities and this phenomenon was common in some countries causanilles et al 2018 hong et al 2021 venhuis et al 2014a for example causanilles et al 2018 reported that non prescription sales data of sil accounted for 47 of use in europe thereby reflecting the high risk of illicit sil use causanilles et al 2018 as the population ages and the incidence of ed increases the potential market for sil increasing the low risk of prosecution and the ease of selling via internet pharmacies means that more counterfeiters are taking advantage of this growing market for high financial returns consumers often expose themselves to unnecessary health risks by taking sil containing products or buying counterfeit medicines via irregular channels to our knowledge this is the first report of the spatial use of sil in china sil consumption was the highest in northwest china 86 1 mg d 1000 people followed by east china 70 2 mg d 1000 people and south china 61 mg d 1000 people with low consumption in north china 24 6 mg d 1000 people and central china 26 6 mg d 1000 people fig 1 the consumption indicated at most wwtps in northwest china was significantly above the mean one way anova found that the mean value in northwest china was significantly higher than east southwest and central china p 0 05 furthermore the consumption of sil in north china 72 mg d 1000 people is significantly higher than south china 41 4 mg d 1000 people which was due to the significant differences in demographics economy transport and marital status between north and south china as determined by analyzing 32 descriptors sil consumption calculated by wbe and population were used to calculate the sil use in each province in 2018 the sil consumption calculated by wbe in guangdong henan and shandong provinces were 2000 kg whereas that in ningxia xizang and qinghai provinces was less than 200 kg because of their small populations fig f2 and table f2 to accurately assess the prevalence of sil in the population monte carlo simulation was used and the results showed that the prevalence of sil in males aged 15 years was 2 24 appendix d fig d1 previous epidemiological surveys have shown that the incidence of ed in asian men ranges from 10 to 70 kessler et al 2019 as determined by the international index of erectile function iief and self satisfaction identification cappelleri et al 2005 the proportion of men with ed was higher than the prevalence of sil use thereby indicating a low proportion of men diagnosed with ed in the iief taking the medication for treatment kessler et al 2019 maestre lorén et al 2021 these results imply that the potential market for sil use in china is infinite 3 3 factors affecting sil use the incidence of ed in men may be related to multiple factors lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use increase the risk of ed kohn et al 2021 some comorbidities may affect erectile function in men socio economic factors are also intrinsically linked to the disease with single divorced and unemployed men at higher risk allen and walter 2019 in this study factors affecting the sil use were confirmed by the difference in medical use in north and south china the incidence of the disease with respect to sex and other clinical studies 3 3 1 sil use with comorbidities wbe is a powerful tool for extracting the use of different chemicals in wastewater from which relevant medical information can be obtained lai et al 2013 ort et al 2010 senta et al 2015 thomas et al 2012 zuccato et al 2005 the relationship between sil use and comorbidities was determined by analyzing the correlations with the consumption of medicines selected for this study gout as shown in fig 3 sil consumption was positively correlated with alp use r2 0 5 p 0 001 the mean consumption of alp was 21 g d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 26 g d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 10 4 g d 1000 people p 0 05 thereby indicating that the prevalence of gout in north china 5 2 was higher than that in south china 2 07 the prevalence of gout was 3 37 which was calculated by the alp consumption dose 500 mg d and frequency 1 dose d a traditional epidemiological study reported that the prevalence of gout was 2 39 3 61 in males and 1 39 in females yang et al 2019 the male population is affected by gout and has a large overlap with the population with ed therefore patients with these two diseases are relatively consistent the incidence of ed in patients with gout exceeds that in patients without gout and increases with age gelber 2015 in addition we found that alp consumption was positively correlated with hyd use r2 0 4 p 0 01 thereby strongly suggesting that some diseases do not exist alone and are associated with high incidence of chronic diseases in contemporary society hypertension there was a positive correlation between sil and hyd use r2 0 6 p 0 001 the mean consumption of hyd was 9 18 mg d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 10 5 mg d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 7 mg d 1000 people p 0 05 which was similar to the spatial pattern of sil use kapur and schwarz 2007 reported that ed occurs in 30 of patients with hypertension because endothelial dysfunction can lead to increased vascular smooth muscle contraction during hypertension and or ed kapur and schwarz 2007 nunes et al 2012 hyd is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and studies have shown that ed is the highest in patients treated with diuretics hypertension shares the same risk factors as ed such as diabetes smoking hyperlipidemia and lifestyle factors burchardt et al 2000 illicit drugs diabetes and depression liu et al 2021 and shao et al 2020 investigated the use of methamphetamine ketamine heroin codeine morphine and methadone in different regions of china we used these data to analyze the correlation between illicit drugs and sil use but there was no correlation in the sampling cities p 0 05 liu et al 2021 shao et al 2020 indicating that these compounds were not co consumed with sil appendix g fig g1 to our knowledge there were few reports on tra and oxy in china du et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 and the correlation between opioids and ed has not been reported in this study we found that there was no correlation between the consumption of sil and the consumption of oxy and tra oxy was detected in only four wwtps in china with a small national use so there was no correlation with sil use the mean consumption of tra was 21 mg d 1000 people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 35 8 mg d 1000 people was higher than that in south china 14 2 mg d 1000 people the geographical differences between tra and sil use was the same but the differences in tra use were not significant table 1 fig 2 for diabetes we investigated the use of metformin met in previous work but there was no correlation between met and sil use p 0 05 shao et al 2021 therefore no association was found between sil use and diabetes in the sample cities for depression there was no correlation between the use of par and sil par consumption in north china 0 97 mg d 1000 people was lower than that in south china 1 24 mg d 1000 people which was different from sil use depression and ed are subjective diseases the treatment of which depends on the patient s condition and doctor s advice however some patients do not seek medical care for the condition moreover 10 of men with ed have depression which is a risk factor for ed okulate et al 2003 3 3 2 sil use and lifestyle factors smoking most comorbidities are related to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption derby et al 2000 we found a positive correlation between the consumption of nicotine nic and sil r2 0 3 p 0 05 nic consumption in north china was higher than that in south china gao et al 2020 shao et al 2021 which was similar to the spatial difference in sil use the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported that 27 7 of chinese adults aged 15 and older smoke including 52 1 of males and 2 7 of females ccdc 2015 the results suggest that there is an overlap between smokers and sil users furthermore clinical and basic scientific studies have shown that smoking affects erectile function by impairing endothelium dependent smooth muscle relaxation smoking increases the likelihood of moderate or complete ed by 2 fold thereby reflecting the intrinsic association between smoking and sil use mcvary et al 2001 alcohol use there were positive correlation between alcohol consumption and sil r2 0 4 p 0 05 and alp use r2 0 6 p 0 001 the mean consumption of alcohol was 8 36 ml d people in 33 chinese cities and that in north china 10 7 ml d people was higher than that in south china 5 65 ml d people p 0 05 which was similar to the spatial difference in sil use the world health organization reported that the prevalence of alcohol dependence is higher in men 4 4 than in women 0 1 thereby indicating that alcohol use is consistent with sil consumption who 2018 contrary to the popular belief that alcohol is an aphrodisiac there is scientific evidence that long term drinking can cause sexual dysfunction prabhakaran et al 2018 the risk of alcohol use is directly related to the diastolic peak velocity and male alcohol dependent patients have a higher incidence of sexual dysfunction dachille et al 2008 similarly the correlation between alp and alcohol use overlapped which indirectly supported the influence of alcohol consumption on sil use 3 3 3 sil use and socio economic factors in this study 34 representative descriptors were investigated to reflect the socio economic factors appendix g pearson correlation analysis showed that the total consumption of sil estimated by per capital consumption and total population in each province was positively correlated with the population aged over 64 po retire r2 0 46 p 0 03 the orderly dependency ratio odr r2 0

0 46 p 0 03 highway freight volume vo highway r2 0 46 p 0 03 and marriage rate married r2 0 72 p 0 01 fig 4 the principal risk factor associated with the incidence of ed is age which increases from 5 to 15 among men aged 40 to 70 years feldman et al 1994 sil consumption increases as the population ages johannes et al 2000 internet and transportation had a significant positive correlation with sil use with the internet being the preferred way to purchase sil thereby reflecting the influence of convenient transportation conditions on sil use according to this study sil is easily obtained on the internet as an ingredient in fake medicine tonic food and chinese traditional medicine moreover based on the analysis of the demographic structure sil is mainly used by men over the age of 15 who are married in contrast negative correlations were found between sil consumption and people working in accommodation po accommodation r2 0 5 p 0 02 and the unemployment rate uneployment r2 0 51 p 0 01 thereby reflecting the influence of occupation on sil use sil is used less in cities with high unemployment because there is no fixed income 4 conclusion this study determined that prescription sales of sil account for 13 3 of actual use in china mainly because sil is often mixed with food and medicinal diet as an ingredient or used as a recreational medicine in addition sil consumption was significantly higher in north china than in south china which was influenced by socioeconomic factors correlation studies showed that sil consumption was positively correlated with alp and hyd consumption which is consistent with traditional epidemiological investigations unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use increase the consumption of sil and may increase the risk of ed combining wbe studies with traditional epidemiological and clinical studies may help to assess the legitimate use of sil for the treatment of ed and provide evidence for comorbid drivers and social factors that influence sil use declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict of interest to declare acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation

15968,water systems need to become more locally robust and sustainable in view of increased population demands and supply uncertainties decentralized treatment is often assumed to have the potential to improve the technical environmental and economic performance of current technologies the techno economic feasibility of implementing independent building scale decentralized systems combining rainwater harvesting potable water production and wastewater treatment and recycling was assessed for six main types of buildings ranging from single family dwellings to high rise buildings five different treatment layouts were evaluated under five different climatic conditions for each type of building the layouts considered varying levels of source separation i e black grey yellow brown and combined wastewater using the corresponding toilet types vacuum urine diverting and conventional and the appropriate pipes and pumping requirements our results indicate that the proposed layouts could satisfy 100 of the water demand for the three smallest buildings in all but the aridest climate conditions for the three larger buildings rainwater would offset annual water needs by approximately 74 to 100 a comprehensive economic analysis considering capex and opex indicated that the cost of installing on site water harvesting and recycling systems would increase the overall construction cost of multi family buildings by around 6 and single family dwellings by about 12 with relatively low space requirements for buildings or combined water systems with more than 300 people the estimated total price of on site water provision including harvesting treatment recycling and monitoring ranged from 1 5 m3 to 2 7 m 3 which is considerably less than the typical tariffs collected by utilities in the united states and western europe where buildings can avoid the need to connect to centralized supplies for potable water and sewage disposal water costs could be even lower urine diversion has the potential to yield the least expensive solution but is the least well developed and had higher uncertainty in the cost analysis more mature layouts e g membrane bioreactors exhibited less cost uncertainty and were economically competitive our analysis indicates that existing technologies can be used to create economically viable systems that greatly reduce demands on centralized utilities and under some conditions eliminate the need for centralized water supply or sewage collection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords decentralization sustainability resilient water 1 introduction freshwater resources face unprecedented pressure due to population growth climate change and poor management arora et al 2015 damania et al 2017 doell et al 2009 sedlak 2014 the historic reliance on a linear approach to water infrastructure imported water centralized water distribution energy intensive treatment and disposal to surface waters is being questioned because of its environmental and economic shortcoming as well as its lack of resilience daigger 2009 vázquez rowe et al 2017 approaches integrating source separation and resource recovery together with radical improvements in water use efficiency and energy positive concepts have been suggested as alternatives that could improve economic and environmental sustainability reliability and resilience of urban water systems garrido baserba et al 2018 larsen et al 2016 mccarty et al 2011 piratla and goverdhanam 2015 remy 2010 roefs et al 2016 despite the attestations from proponents of alternative approaches that conventional urban water infrastructures are becoming obsolete and that the benefits from a paradigm shift in water and wastewater infrastructure would outweigh potential risks change has been slow in coming in part the reluctance to change can be attributed to the challenge of technology lock in an inability to transition to better practices due to institutional inertia and a lack of willingness to take risks on unproven approaches larsen et al 2016 tchobanoglous et al 2004 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 however even in places where lock in is less of a problem and alternatives have inherent advantages such as rapidly urbanizing countries or in parts of cities where urban infill or suburban expansion is putting strain on urban water systems alternatives have been slow to develop gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 setegn and donoso 2015 the slow progress in alternative approaches is largely due to regulatory impediments as well as the challenges of operating less conventional systems adding risk and slowing down their implementation furthermore there is a historic correlation between project size and transaction costs for project management that favours to larger projects haaskjold et al 2021 rabaey et al 2020 provided a comprehensive discussion on existing bottlenecks towards decentralization including confidence in emerging technologies the sunk cost of existing infrastructure and other key aspects nevertheless increasing recognition of the potential advantages of alternative approaches is leading to major efforts from both public and private institutions nyc wrr 2022 ocwd 2022 tokyowrc 2022 uswateralliance 2022 the widespread uptake of reuse initiatives and on site water systems and successful long term operation prove that past impediments are starting to disappear at the same time cheaper and more reliable sensors and actuators are enhancing technology performance while the costs of key technologies such as mbr ro and other types of equipment continue to drop sustainablewater 2022 watertech 2022 similarly with new technological advances in connectivity and remote control decentralized initiatives are no longer limited to decentralized management multiple facilities and operations can be remotely managed in a centralized fashion opsctrl 2022 among the emerging paradigms for urban water systems extreme decentralization the practice of integrating building scale water recycling within cities with existing centralized water systems is attractive because it is compatible with existing water governance because it provides a means for cities facing water stress to adjust to water stress without abandoning existing infrastructure or making large investments to rapidly transition away from existing approaches rabaey et al 2020 assessed the viability of implementing a household scale water system that relied on rainwater capture and greywater reuse as an alternative to expansion of existing centralized water infrastructure or trucked water for ease of adoption for a single household the authors considered a relatively simple process train consisting of a membrane bioreactor mbr and ultraviolet uv disinfection unit for greywater treatment and a reverse osmosis ro system followed by a second uv unit for production of drinking water under conditions typical of most locations the system had an initial payback time of around 10 years in addition to costs savings and independence from the drinking water network the household scale water system could lead to the emergence of new features such as the possibility of adjusting water quality for specific uses e g softened water for cleaning improved aesthetics e g adjusting ion composition to suit personal taste or even accessing health benefits through the addition of supplements to drinking water acknowledging the potential benefits of decentralized urban water systems larsen et al 2013 li et al 2021 rabaey et al 2020 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 here we have extended the analysis by providing a detailed economic analysis of systems that are likely to be considered at the scale of individual homes and multi family dwellings using standardized cost assessment methods to account for more complex types of distributed wastewater treatment technologies e g anaerobic and membrane technologies that might be viable in multi family buildings as well as resource recovery approaches that require source separation we have included a range of new and emerging technologies under different housing scenarios the technical and economic feasibility of five personalized treatment trains table 1 has been evaluated in dwellings ranging from a 2 3 to 300 people equivalent through i a detailed economic analysis considering capital and operating expenditures and revenues for the in house sewer system pumps and treatment modules ii an estimation of the required space for tanks and technology iii an assessment of the final water quality the overall costs of implementing the systems in already existing buildings are presented as well as the fraction of the total construction investment they represent for new buildings this multidisciplinary effort illustrating the current state of the practice and potential benefits of decentralization is meant to provide a rigorous baseline for further development of sustainable urban water systems and it does not represent a conclusive case on extreme decentralisation rather it is likely that new technologies and better controls will lead to other more efficient configurations 2 methodology 2 1 research approach 2 1 1 housing types to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of implementing decentralized urban water facilities we considered six housing types i e single family homes low rise dwellings low medium rise medium rise medium high rise and high rise buildings representative of residential housing in many cities fig 1 an occupancy rate typical of europe i e 2 3 inhabitants per dwelling was assumed with an average apartment floor space per capita of 30 m2 negro and economidou 2014 roefs et al 2016 the assumed area per story i e the area available for rooftop rainwater collection representing the total floor space i e including the space for staircases lifts hallways was estimated for typical european buildings through eq 1 where as and ahh are the areas per story and household respectively m2 γ is a constant equal to 1 15 and nhh is the number of households in the designed building the extra surface assigned to the average area destined to common spaces is that of 30 m2 per story 1 a s γ a h h n h h 30 2 1 2 treatment layouts five treatment layouts were compared involving the use of vacuum urine diverting and conventional toilets table 1 the first two layouts employed vacuum toilets v1 and v2 while the second two scenarios involved a more conservative approach using conventional toilets c1 and c2 the last scenario considered the potential benefits of source separation of urine ud thus the use of toilets diverting urine within its corresponding treatment train was also assessed error reference source not found summarizes the principal characteristics of each of the proposed scenarios two main conceptual approaches based on the different wastewater qualities were evaluated for the five source separated approaches fig 2 the main treatment processes employed for black water and grey water functioning in series fig 2a this concept was implemented in four of the five source separated approaches v1 v2 c1 and c2 the only exception is the urine diverting scenario ud where the black water stream was divided in a yellow and a brown water sub system instead fig 2b in both scenarios harvested rainwater is used to supply potable water while recycled water is used for home appliances toilet flushing and showering biological anaerobic treatment was included in all cases except for one scenario which included conventional toilets and aerobic wastewater treatment c1 anaerobic treatment results in the conversion of organic matter into biogas while struvite reactors and the electrochemical cell in the urine source separation scenario enable the recovery of phosphate nitrogen that is not incorporated into struvite is eliminated through the anammox process this approach based on the biological removal of nitrogen was chosen over ammonia recovery by stripping because it has proven to be more cost effective garrido baserba et al 2018 in the urine diverted ud system nitrogen was converted into nitrate because nitrification occurs in the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr the liquid solution obtained in this process can be used as fertilizer in all scenarios the fraction of the treated wastewater that is not recycled is suitable for landscape irrigation for the purpose of this analysis the treatment systems discharge excess water to the centralized sewer system as needed future permutations of this system could use the treated wastewater for irrigation during seasons when there is demand and discharge to surface or groundwater at other times of the year tanks and required equipment for each treatment train were accordingly seized see supplementary information 4 5 and the basement of each building was assumed as the location for the water storage and treatment modules 2 1 3 water usage water use per pe was derived from a reported global indoor average of 108 l day 1 the per capita potable water demand for potable uses exclusively i e drinking kitchen sink and bathroom was 26 5 l day 1 in all scenarios rabaey et al 2020 to assess the sensitivity of this assumption the performance of the rainwater capture system was also assessed by assuming a lower potable water demand of 15 l person 1 day 1 who 2011 in terms of wastewater production the per capita volume of grey or blackwater depended on the type of toilets employed in the dwellings 40 l day 1 15 l day 1 or 5 l day 1 of black water were considered depending on the use of conventional urine diverting or vacuum toilets respectively de graaff et al 2010 larsen et al 2013 despite having higher capital and operational costs vacuum toilets may offer economic and environmental benefits because less water is required and more concentrated blackwater is obtained their use is coupled with the treatment of the collected wastewater both in a two separated biological treatment stages anaerobic and aerobic treatment in a uasb and an mbr or b a single anaerobic stage in an anmbr the feasibility of a configuration involving the use of conventional toilets which yield more diluted blackwater was also assessed the additional flushing water would decrease constituents loads which would allow the biological treatment system to achieve the required bod and total phosphorus objectives without the anaerobic stage of the mbr however vacuum based systems coupled with nutrient recovery typically yield the lowest energy footprint kjerstadius et al 2015 finally urine source separation was considered because yellow water contributes 80 of n and 50 of p to residential wastewater jimenez et al 2015 rossi et al 2009 the collection and recovery of nutrients from urine could provide a revenue stream and reduce energy use in the treatment system de paepe et al 2018 larsen et al 2015 lienert and larsen 2010 2010b maurer et al 2006 remy 2010 existing technologies for on site urine treatment are still not sufficiently mature to yield reliable results however we estimated the costs of an innovative treatment scheme involving the electrochemical treatment of urine coupled with nitrification in an mabr to determine the merits of further development of on site urine treatment and resource recovery systems 2 1 4 influent and effluent composition constituents concentrations in grey and black water are shown in table 2 and are calculated using average daily constituent load per capita as described by larsen et al 2013 the results are in concordance with kujawa roeleveld zeeman 2006 dhadwal 2020 dhadwal et al 2021 sun et al 2020 urea hydrolysis i e 90 of total nitrogen converting to ammonia is assumed in all scenarios except for ud hence the high total ammonia concentration in bw gao et al 2019 larsen et al 2013 influent variability is assumed to be low as the collected wastewater originates solely from residential dwellings however deviations in influent concentrations stemming from seasonal or specific events may occur for the ud scenario we considered that bw consists of a mixture of yellow and brown waters i e urine and faeces plus toilet paper respectively in the modeled scenario urine and faeces were assumed to be collected separately using urine diverting toilets laufen switzerland which use 3l per simple flush a urine production of 1 5 l p d and a recovery efficiency in households of 75 of the flow considering technological and performance limitations to complete recovery were assumed lienert and larsen 2010 rossi et al 2009 all non recovered urine was assumed to mix with brown water thus the latter s concentration has been calculated accordingly the per capita daily volume of brown water produced is assumed to be 15 l p d table 3 shows the concentration of the resulting flow yellow and non mixed brown water effluent concentrations and performance were obtained based on reported removal efficiencies supplementary information tables 4 25 each of the treatment layouts was also modelled using the software simba ifak 2021 the simulations were used to evaluate both the performance and feasibility of the process flow diagrams the effluent characteristics obtained from both the modelling approach and the reported based calculations supplementary information tables 4 25 were compared to ensure the correctness of the calculations fig 3 shows the model of the v1 layout to treat black and grey water elaborated using simba 2 2 sewer infrastructure the required pipe lengths were calculated using the urban water infrastructure model uwim for sewers maurer et al 2013 pipes were assumed to originate at the center of every housing ground floor story lengths were calculated based on housing density and settlement area the latter of which was adapted to the floor space of each building the model parameter f2 representing the housing shape factor was estimated for each scenario maurer et al 2013 sewer methodology and calculation are detailed in supplementary information section 2 greywater and rainwater pipes made of unreinforced concrete were assumed for gravity water collection in contrast blackwater pipes were assumed to be operated either by vacuum as required in the v1 and v2 scenarios or by gravity c1 c2 and ud and were assumed to be composed of hdpe costs associated with vacuum pumps and pumps needed to return treated water to the apartments were included in the economic analysis see supplementary information section 6 a constant vacuum system cvs was included for blackwater pumping from vacuum toilets because it has proven to be more cost effective than a vacuum on demand system vod especially when pump prices and capacities are compared in multi family dwellings dometic sweden jest vacuum as norway a double pipeline was assumed for black water

enabled the uncoupling of the solids retention time srt from the hydraulic retention time hrt the system was assured to operate with an hrt of 7 15 days and a srt of 30 days the common practice in full scale anaerobic digestion facilities is to convert a fraction of the produced biogas into heat to satisfy heat requirements while producing energy via gas microturbines or combined heat and power chp we adopted this approach because it also has been employed in small scale applications adami et al 2020 baccioli et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 one of the challenges when operating uasbs and anmbrs is the high percentage up to 50 of methane gas dissolved in the effluent that could escape which could lower energy recovery efficiencies and increase greenhouse gas ghg emissions cookney et al 2016 shin et al 2014 shoener et al 2016 velasco et al 2018a thus a degassing membrane contactor was included in the treatment train with a separated reactor separating the gas and liquid phases henares et

biogas producing treatment plants involves upgrading i e purifying the biogas to achieving 99 methane purity and selling it as fuel for electricity production or transport applications gas or liquified both natural gas and co2 have a value market that could allow additional revenues to offset some of the system operating costs 2 3 2 organic matter removal and gas production anaerobic

2013 muñoz sierra et al 2019 the combination of membrane technology and anaerobic treatment allows for the decoupling of hrt from srt which helps lower overall costs while continuing to provide adequate treatment with shorter hrts ariunbaatar et al 2021 foglia et al 2020 ribera pi et al 2020 van den berg et al 2020 anmbrs modeled in this study were sized according to their hrt the low

anmbrs achieve a high solids separation the clogging of the pores is not expected to be major concern membrana wuppertal germany microporous contactors designed for low flow rates instead than non porous membranes appear to be the best approaches for higher methane recovery yields 2 3 3 organic matter removal aerobic membrane bioreatcors mbrs a flat sheet reverse osmosis ro membrane dupont de nemours inc delaware usa was assumed as a means of meeting current guidelines for phosphorus concentrations in wastewater reuse the selected membrane offered the highest removal efficiency for pollutants including nh4 n p relative to similar models van voorthuizen et al 2005 the use of the ro membrane improved the final water quality and provided another barrier against pathogen exposure in showers baths or incidental contact with recycled water the mbrs were assumed to use a rejection side stream configuration and included a combination of biological treatment in an aeration tank and ultrafiltration in a crossflow multi tube membrane loop e g polyethersulphone membranes berghoff gmbh eningen germany prior to ro the hydraulic residence time in the reactors was assumed to be 15 8 h for scenario v1 and 40 h for scenario c1 the volume of the system was calculated using eq 57 in the supplementary material fletcher et al 2007 wen et al 1999 xing et al 2001 2 3 4 nitrogen removal oxygen limited autotrophic nitritation denitrification oland process the removal of nitrogen was assumed to take place in a single stage oland process suitable for wastewater with high loads of

required biofilm surface is provided in supplementary information section 4 2 nitrate production during the oland process was assumed to be negligible 2 3 5 phosphorus removal struvite recovery small scale phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite which would be accompanied by ammoniacal nitrogen removal was assumed to take place in a crystallizer followed by a decanter ali 2005 kataki et al 2016 shaddel et al 2020 removal efficiencies design calculations energy demand and the mass of added mg oh 2 s needed to maintain supersaturation at a ph of 8 were calculated to obtain the effluent concentrations and operational costs see supplementary information 4 3 phosphorus recovery through struvite recovery is likely to become more important to sustainability in the water sector however this approach still presents operational challenges even in large facilities its implementation may only take place as operators gain more experience and pilot scale treatment systems demonstrate reliabel system perfornance however even if the struvite recovery only addresses the prevention of capacity loss due to detrimental struvite precipitation inside reactors and piping significant infrastructural sustainability goals would still be achieved 2 3 6 urine treatment as part of the urine diversion scenario yellow water was assumed to be treated through a combination of two technologies first we assumed that the urea in the urine will be allowed to hydrolyze resulting in the production of ammonia and bicarbonate as a result of the ph increase associated with this process

acids to inhibit microbial activity and thus prevent urea hydrolysis an electrochemical cell similar to the unit proposed by de paepe et al 2020 was included see supplementary information 4 7 2 3 7 storage tanks tanks used to store recycled water or potable water were assumed to be composed of fpp flexible polypropylene liners whereas tanks used for storage of black grey brown water or sewage were assumed to use pvc polyvinyl chloride liners smaller tanks were assumed for rainwater collection since smaller volumes are required and larger steel tanks with the indicated liners were employed

selected from among the smallest models available further details can be found in supplementary information 4 8 2 4 rainwater capture the total demand of drinking water m3 month for potable uses i e drinking and cooking for each type of building was calculated considering a per capita water consumption of 26 5l day rabaey et al 2020 multiplied by the number of building inhabitants for 31 days per month the daily amount of 26 5l represents an approximate 30 of the overall water usage 80 l day and does not consider other uses such as flushing toilets 25 cleaning 20 washing clothes 15 gardening etc to estimate the supply of rainwater m3 month average monthly rainfall mm data was extracted from climate data org 2021 the authors acknowledge that rainfall regimes and overall extreme variability are being impacted by climate change ipcc 2022 ipcc 2021 slater et al 2021 unep 2021 and that estimates based on historic averages or return periods might be inaccurate in the coming decades to assess the potential of rainwater systems to complement the existing access to a centralized water supply it would be more appropriate to consider a particularly dry period e g the driest year in a 20 or 50 year period nevertheless according to the latest ipcc report this approach could be very short lived as extreme variability is expected to change drastically in the upcoming decades ipcc 2022 future studies on rainwater capture capacity should include these most recent forecasts furthermore other options for storing precipitation generated by shorter more intense storms e g managed aquifer

according to eq 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainwater capture and domestic water recovery potential the extent to which rainwater can satisfy potable water demand depends on location and rainfall patterns fig 4 for single family dwellings and the two smallest multi family dwellings rainwater alone could supply potable water for all locations other than the driest location i e santiago de chile for the taller buildings rainwater was only adequate for several months per year buildings in hong kong miami and toronto could rely upon harvested rainwater for almost half of the year although significant savings can be obtained from rainwater harvesting for potable water supply the most significant reductions in water consumption were attributable to the continuous recycling of the black and grey water wastewater recycling satisfied the water demand of toilet flushing home appliances and showering fig 4 illustrates the recovery capacity per building type and indicates the volumes of grey and black water recycled by the treatment systems on an annual basis a minimum of about 74 of the total water demand including potable water can be satisfied in the worst scenarios high rise buildings without enough rain smaller buildings and buildings located in climates with rainfall regimes that are more conducive to harvesting will be able to fully satisfy an even greater fraction of the total water demand through the combination of rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling in most of the scenarios because potable water only accounts for about 17 20 of overall household water use epa 2021 3 1 1 rainwater treatment scheme the use of rainwater as a secure source of potable water is a proven concept that has found worldwide acceptance campisano et al 2017 liu et al 2021 peterson 2016 smit 2019 different treatment schemes can meet the strict health standards in wealthy countries alim et al 2020 piemontese et al 2020 suleiman et al 2020 in this study a ro uv system with customizable remineralization was used to treat rainwater dirisu et al 2019 rabaey et al 2020 this configuration was chosen for its reliable performance and its potential to satisfy health guidelines the ability of ro to remove nearly all constituents of rainwater might necessitate remineralization with ions such as magnesium calcium and fluoride to protect health and improve taste naser et al 2017 sedlak 2019 many of the ro commercially available today already include remineralization filters e g waterdropfilter 2021 bottled water obtained through ro based filtration has

ilemobade et al 2013 especially among leading technology companies microsoft 2017 salesforce 2021 although potable water reuse is still not widely accepted in many countries using recycled water in showers and baths is likely to engender less hesitancy and was therefore considered in this study without this application the demand for the rainwater tanks would have been considerably greater and the system would have been less attractive if recycled water is not considered acceptable other alternatives for reducing demand on the rainwater tanks e g recirculating showers could be considered

englehardt 2016 3 2 space requirements 3 2 1 holding capacity the space requirements of on site water systems depend on the desired degree of autonomy of the building the sizing of the tanks in our analysis was designed according to the desired duration or capacity for holding the produced wastewater and treated water before its reuse or treatment respectively similarly the sizing of the solids holding tanks was also designed according to the desired duration for storing the produced sludge two main degrees of autonomy for the recycling systems were evaluated in the first approach half of a week of autonomy was evaluated in this approach equalization conditioning and storage tanks were sized to hold wastewater for 3 5 days solids holding tanks were sized to allow for the accumulation of a week s worth of sludge production in a second approach all equalization conditioning and storage tanks water tanks were sized to hold the wastewater and sludge for only over 24 hours after sizing all the required units and equipment for the two degrees of autonomy the theoretical space requirements as a percentage of the basement floor were calculated table 5 fig 5 a basement floor with a ceiling height of 3 m was assumed as the location of the treatment units and related equipment plus other building equipment that is normally put in the basement level e g electrical equipment hvac elevators results of our analysis fig 5 indicate that the water storage and recycling equipment will occupy approximately between 8 and 40 of the basement or a further underground floor space under the lowest degree of autonomy scenario the estimated area ranges from 15 to 120 of the basement area under the larger storage capacity scenario table with all space requirements per building and layout can be found see supplementary information section 11 the single family dwelling and the two largest apartment buildings sacrificed the greatest fraction of the basement space to the treatment systems the highest floor occupancy corresponds to hr buildings and is 91 4 and 28 7 for longer and shorter water holding periods the remaining basement space could be reserved for future plant changes or destined for other uses such as vehicle parking or additional storage further details can be found in supplementary information sizing section 4 1 to 4 9 space requirement discussion 11 3 3 economic assessment 3 3 1 alternatives economic comparison total costs capex and opex were estimated for the six types of buildings fig 5 among the five treatment trains the v1 scenario i e vacuum toilets combined with anaerobic uasb and aerobic mbr was the most expensive costing about 50 more than each of the other scenarios the v1 option provides a smaller footprint due to the small volume of wastewater from vacuum toilets and incorporates the most proven technologies providing the most reliable data on sizing costing and performance conversely anmbrs allows for considerable cost reductions both in terms of capex and opex v2 c1 and c2 the urine diverting configuration achieves the lowest opex but shows higher capex than all other configurations except for v1 the novelty of the treatments involved in the ud scenario causes uncertainty in the cost calculation of this layout which could be easily reduced with further development i e mec and mabr positioning the ud scenario as the layout with the highest potential in terms of cost effectiveness and resource recovery 3 3 2 the economics of extreme decentralization the total costs of the six types of buildings were also evaluated in terms of m3 and per capita fig 6 the economies of scale show a significant reduction in the cost of water as the number of people serviced increases fig 6 fig 6 also illustrates how the total costs of the five treatment trains for each of six types of buildings would compare with current water prices in different regions of the world these cost estimates do not consider the avoided costs benefits from both rainwater harvesting and recycling water 74 100 as discussed in section 3 36 income assessment estimates shown in fig 6 illustrate how the most expensive of the presented decentralized systems v1 in buildings with more than 100 inhabitants could be competitive with the cost of water in wealthier regions such as north america and western europe 4 3 3 9 m3 similarly for buildings larger than 300 inhabitants such as large buildings districts or city blocks with populations between 300 to 2 000 could become the most cost effective decentralized solutions this study indicates that large buildings or interconnected buildings could result in the most cost effective approach when considering current technologies monitoring requirements and infrastructure costs i e pipelines especially when compared with existing centralized systems nevertheless decentralized district scale approaches with smaller buildings resulting in lower population densities may not achieve similar economic advantages in previous studies estimating the costs of decentralized approaches covering neighborhoods or districts pipeline related costs i e installation maintenance and pumping accounted for more than 60 of total costs garrido baserba et al 2018 roefs et al 2016 the present study which was focused on independent apartment blocks did not consider interconnected sewer networks between neighboring buildings which limited the length of the pipeline and reduced its impact on the overall capex and opex future studies should identify the most economically feasible density ratios for different district organizations such as large buildings interconnected buildings in city blocks with short pipeline connections and modular treatment designs or smaller housing at district scale 3 3 3 the cost of including decentralized water systems in new building construction the total cost of the most expensive decentralized solution v1 was compared to the total construction costs for each type of building under study fig 7 fig 7 shows the percentage of the total construction costs for scenario v1 however the relationships will be similar for the other scenarios the installation cost could increase construction costs by 6 9 the opex over a 30 year period was equivalent to 3 24 of construction costs see supplementary information section 5 construction costs 3 3 4 cost breakdown the most expensive among the five treatment trains the v1 scenario i e vacuum toilets combined with anaerobic uasb and aerobic mbr was used to illustrate the cost breakdown of decentralized treatment in buildings an extended discussion covering all the main cost contributors explaining the main differences between treatment trains e g sewer pipes dual reticulation piping specialized toilets treatment technologies can be found in supplementary information section 12 similarly the breakdown of costs and obtained benefits for all treatment configurations can be found in the supplementary material see section 7 and section 8 fig 8 shows that the recycling of grey water and black water accounts for about 65 80 of the overall cost with a higher percentage of the costs in larger buildings within the treatment systems the capex and opex costs are of a similar magnitude partially due to the necessity of vacuum pumping to evacuate the highly concentrated waters and the high costs of operating the uasb reactors nevertheless the overall deployment of the grey water sewer pipeline is more costly than black water sewer since pipe diameters are larger to hold bigger volumes the remainder of the costs were related to monitoring and rainwater harvesting monitoring costs were high accounting for the majority of the remaining costs fig 9 see supplementary for monitoring break down costs and discussion section 13 process monitoring as discussed a conservative approach with the highest standards on monitoring was assumed in this analysis monitoring is a crucial and expensive process sensors sampling control lims personnel etc and is standardized to assure health and safety therefore similar requirements were deemed necessary independently of the size therefore no significant economies of scale were attributable to monitoring and the monitoring costs for larger buildings 14 increased substantially for smaller buildings 50 research is needed to identify approaches for reducing monitoring costs especially in smaller systems through the use of new or soft sensors or performance based monitoring strategies rainwater collection and treatment accounts for a relatively small fraction of the overall cost 5 8 across all buildings and scenarios entailing low capital investment and low operating and maintenance costs ro and uv treatment consume large amounts of energy judd 2017 sanz 2013 but the volume of rainwater requiring treatment was small which limited the opex of the rainwater system to 1 2 of total costs for all scenarios 3 3 5 process monitoring to ensure public acceptance the highest standards on monitoring need to be satisfied water reuse should satisfy the most stringent of the quality requirements demanding an advanced robust and safe treatment system able to comply with the tighter health and monitoring standards to avoid a negative perception towards this type of approach the presented system must yield the highest water qualities such as potable water even if none of the reused water will be recycled as a direct potable source a very conservative estimation of the monitoring requirements was purposely chosen to demonstrate that the most rigorous and advanced monitoring routine could be achieved avoiding concerns about safety and control the monitoring costs were calculated as in three main blocks 1 laboratory tests outside lab 2 sensors capex and opex external service contract 3 real time remote monitoring external service contract see section 8 in supplementary information the real time remote monitoring was selected to enable remote monitoring of these decentralized systems allowing the necessary technical and operational expertise to operate and maintain in real time such complex systems a centralized management of these different decentralized units was considered to allow experts to control and coordinate with technicians the laboratory test routine designed follows the guidelines from the sampling workbook sampling questionnaire and matrix developed by the water environment federation wef task group on wastewater treatment plant data collection the workbook indicates the required sampling locations within the treatment process and the type and frequency of analyses required to meet the process control goals including the requirements for process simulators the compiled laboratory costs were obtained from several commercial laboratories and costs should be updated and adapted accordingly it must be noted that the cost of using outside laboratories is the most expensive option and it was selected to reflect the worst economic scenario and to assume no need for further investment or space requirements the operating budget could be significantly reduced by analyzing in situ some of them and especially decreasing the number of lab tests from the recommended sampling routine once a stable performance is obtained in parallel some service contracts could be reduced depending on process performance maintenance routine etc nevertheless we anticipate monitoring costs to further decrease in upcoming years with cheaper and better sensors capabilities new development of reliable soft sensors and more breakthroughs in control theory vanrolleghem and lee 2003 3 3 6 income assessment the recovery of resources by the water recycling system could offset the cost of installing and operating the systems section 3 3 2 each treatment train considered in the analysis enabled the recovery of energy and several also included nutrient recovery although the production of fertilizer might be popular in community gardening initiatives and the produced biogas could help offset project greenhouse gas emissions these two sources of revenue account for less than 2 of the total estimated opex see supplementary information section 4 1 4 for details instead the most most important offset was related to the decrease in water demand from the centralized water system which could offset a substantial fraction of the annual operational costs i e 74 100 figure fig 10 compares the theoretical savings of reducing the dependency of utility water with the total capex and opex of each treatment train i e water consumption charges minus infrastructure charges which are accounted for separately and assuming an average water price of 2 m3 ajuntament de barcelona 2019 fig 10 shows that water savings account for 57 to 135 of total costs even with a theoretical increase in the water price lower than the inflation the proposed systems are assumed to have connection to the centralized sewer system to provide a means for disposing of excess water and providing redundancy if the treatment system is taken out fo service for repairs nevertheless there may be sceanrios in which it is advantageous to avoid connecting the system to a centralized the sewer system e g buildings located on the edges of cities where sewers have not yet been installed places where landscape irrigation and the use of treated wastewater for ecological pruposes or groundwater recharge are attractive the construction and maintenance costs of the connection to the water main 110 mm pe were also included and obtained using architecture and engineering prices simulation software cype the described considerations result in capital and monthly savings of approximately 8 17 see supplementary information section 6 4 conclusions a detailed techno economic and feasibility evaluation of the costs of extreme decentralization indicates that costs to builders and residents will be comparable to or lower than those of current systems while also reducing per capita water demand using existing on site treatment technologies and approaches that are likely to become mature in the next two decades we made several observations the complete set of tanks and treatment equipment required for wastewater treatment and rainwater capture could fit into space that is available in existing basement space for the smallest buildings the equipment occupied a considerable fraction of the available basement space the effluents of the presented treatment line configurations meet current quality regulations in terms of greywater reuse and drinking water public perception and limiting legislation therefore remain the principal impediments to wastewater recycling for domestic and even drinkning purposes the capacity of the installations for covering potable water demand from rainwater capture in average households depends on the building size and regional climate rainwater could only meet water demand for the entire year on the small buildings in the wetter climates however greywater could be recycled multiple times assuring that building equiped with on site treatment sysyems would have a substantially smaller per capita water demand than other types of housing decentralized plants allow for a drastic reduction in sewer disposal costs biological treatment units i e mbrs anmbrs and uasb reactors and black water pumping account for the largest capital and operational costs while struvite recovery uv and ro systems provide significant benefits to the plants performance and final water quality requiring lower investments during the construction of new residential blocks only 5 6 11 6 of additional investment would be required to incorporate the required pipeline network and equipment installation exhaustive monitoring and maintenance is necessary to ensure health safety the substitution of uasb reactors with anmbrs together with the consideration of source separation of urine approaches can drastically lower the plants operational costs especially in large buildings and offer an opportunity to minimize costs and maximize resource recovery 5

15968,water systems need to become more locally robust and sustainable in view of increased population demands and supply uncertainties decentralized treatment is often assumed to have the potential to improve the technical environmental and economic performance of current technologies the techno economic feasibility of implementing independent building scale decentralized systems combining rainwater harvesting potable water production and wastewater treatment and recycling was assessed for six main types of buildings ranging from single family dwellings to high rise buildings five different treatment layouts were evaluated under five different climatic conditions for each type of building the layouts considered varying levels of source separation i e black grey yellow brown and combined wastewater using the corresponding toilet types vacuum urine diverting and conventional and the appropriate pipes and pumping requirements our results indicate that the proposed layouts could satisfy 100 of the water demand for the three smallest buildings in all but the aridest climate conditions for the three larger buildings rainwater would offset annual water needs by approximately 74 to 100 a comprehensive economic analysis considering capex and opex indicated that the cost of installing on site water harvesting and recycling systems would increase the overall construction cost of multi family buildings by around 6 and single family dwellings by about 12 with relatively low space requirements for buildings or combined water systems with more than 300 people the estimated total price of on site water provision including harvesting treatment recycling and monitoring ranged from 1 5 m3 to 2 7 m 3 which is considerably less than the typical tariffs collected by utilities in the united states and western europe where buildings can avoid the need to connect to centralized supplies for potable water and sewage disposal water costs could be even lower urine diversion has the potential to yield the least expensive solution but is the least well developed and had higher uncertainty in the cost analysis more mature layouts e g membrane bioreactors exhibited less cost uncertainty and were economically competitive our analysis indicates that existing technologies can be used to create economically viable systems that greatly reduce demands on centralized utilities

that conventional urban water infrastructures are becoming obsolete and that the benefits from a paradigm shift in water and wastewater infrastructure would outweigh potential risks change has been

been slow to develop gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 setegn and donoso 2015 the slow progress in alternative approaches is largely due to regulatory impediments as well as the challenges of operating less conventional systems adding risk and slowing down their implementation furthermore there is a historic correlation between project size and transaction costs for project management that favours to larger projects haaskjold et al 2021 rabaey et al 2020 provided a comprehensive discussion on existing bottlenecks towards decentralization including confidence in emerging technologies the sunk cost of existing infrastructure and other key aspects nevertheless increasing recognition of the potential advantages of alternative approaches is leading to major efforts from both public and private institutions nyc wrr 2022 ocwd 2022 tokyowrc 2022 uswateralliance 2022 the widespread uptake of reuse initiatives and on site water systems and successful long term operation prove that past impediments are starting to disappear at the same time cheaper and more reliable sensors and actuators are enhancing technology performance while the costs of key technologies such as mbr ro and other types of equipment continue to drop sustainablewater 2022 watertech 2022 similarly with new technological advances in connectivity and remote control decentralized initiatives are no longer limited to decentralized management multiple facilities and operations can be remotely managed in a centralized fashion opsctrl 2022 among the emerging paradigms for urban water systems extreme decentralization the practice of integrating building scale water recycling within cities with existing centralized water systems is attractive because it is compatible with existing water governance because it provides a means for cities facing water stress to adjust to water stress without abandoning existing infrastructure or making large investments to rapidly transition away from existing approaches rabaey et al 2020 assessed the viability of implementing a household scale water system that relied on rainwater capture and greywater reuse as an alternative to expansion of existing centralized water infrastructure or trucked water for ease of adoption for a single household the authors considered a relatively simple process train consisting of a membrane bioreactor mbr and ultraviolet uv disinfection unit for greywater treatment and a reverse osmosis ro system followed by a second uv unit for production of drinking water under conditions typical of most locations the system had an initial payback time of around 10 years in addition to costs savings and independence from the drinking water network the household scale water system could lead to the emergence of new features such as the possibility of adjusting water quality for specific uses e g softened water for cleaning improved aesthetics e g adjusting ion composition to suit personal taste or even accessing health benefits through the addition of supplements to drinking water acknowledging the potential benefits of decentralized urban water systems larsen et al 2013 li et al 2021 rabaey et al 2020 singh et al 2015 sun et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yang et al 2021 here we have extended the analysis by providing a detailed economic analysis of systems that are likely to be considered at the scale of individual homes and multi family dwellings using standardized cost assessment methods to account for more complex types of distributed wastewater treatment technologies e g anaerobic and membrane technologies that might be viable in multi family buildings as well as resource recovery approaches that require source separation we have included a range of new and emerging technologies under different housing scenarios the technical and economic feasibility of five personalized treatment trains table 1 has been evaluated in dwellings ranging from a 2 3 to 300 people equivalent through i a detailed economic analysis considering capital and operating expenditures and revenues for the in house sewer system pumps and treatment modules ii an estimation of the required space for tanks and technology iii an assessment of the final water quality the overall costs of implementing the systems in already existing buildings are presented as well as the fraction of the total construction investment they represent for new buildings this multidisciplinary effort illustrating the current state of the practice and potential benefits of decentralization is meant to provide a rigorous baseline for further development of sustainable urban water systems and it does not represent a conclusive case on extreme decentralisation rather it is likely that new technologies and better controls will lead to other more efficient configurations 2 methodology 2 1 research approach 2 1 1 housing types to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of implementing decentralized urban water facilities we considered six housing types i e single family homes low rise dwellings low medium rise medium rise medium high rise and high rise buildings representative of residential housing in many cities fig 1 an occupancy rate typical of europe i e 2 3 inhabitants per dwelling was assumed with an average apartment floor space per capita of 30 m2 negro and economidou 2014 roefs et al 2016 the assumed area per story i e the area available for rooftop rainwater collection representing the total floor space i e including the space for staircases lifts hallways was estimated for typical european buildings through eq 1 where as and ahh are the areas per story and household respectively m2 γ is a constant equal to 1 15 and nhh is the number of households in the designed building the extra surface assigned to the average area destined to common spaces is that of 30 m2 per story 1 a s γ a h h n h h 30 2 1 2 treatment layouts five treatment layouts were compared involving the use of vacuum urine diverting and conventional toilets table 1 the first two layouts employed vacuum toilets v1 and v2 while the second two scenarios involved a more conservative approach using conventional toilets c1 and c2 the last scenario considered the potential benefits of source separation of urine ud thus the use of toilets diverting urine within its corresponding treatment train was also assessed error reference source not found summarizes the principal characteristics of each of the proposed scenarios two main conceptual approaches based on the different wastewater qualities were evaluated for the five source separated approaches fig 2 the main treatment processes employed for black water and grey water functioning in series fig 2a this concept was implemented in four of the five source separated approaches v1 v2 c1 and c2 the only exception is the urine diverting scenario ud where the black water stream was divided in a yellow and a brown water sub system instead fig 2b in both scenarios harvested rainwater is used to supply potable water while recycled water is used for home appliances toilet flushing and showering biological anaerobic treatment was included in all cases except for one scenario which included conventional toilets and aerobic wastewater treatment c1 anaerobic treatment results in the conversion of organic matter into biogas while struvite reactors and the electrochemical cell in the urine source separation scenario enable the recovery of phosphate nitrogen that is not incorporated into struvite is eliminated through the anammox process this approach based on the biological removal of nitrogen was chosen over ammonia recovery by stripping because it has proven to be more cost effective garrido baserba et al 2018 in the urine diverted ud system nitrogen was converted into nitrate because nitrification occurs in the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr the liquid solution obtained in this process can be used as fertilizer in all scenarios the fraction of the treated wastewater that is not recycled is suitable for landscape irrigation for the purpose of this analysis the treatment systems discharge excess water to the centralized sewer system as needed future permutations of this system could use the treated wastewater for irrigation during seasons when there is demand and discharge to surface or groundwater at other times of the year tanks and required equipment for each treatment train were accordingly seized see supplementary information 4 5 and the basement of each building was assumed as the location for the water storage and treatment modules 2 1 3 water usage water use per pe was derived from a reported global indoor average of 108 l day 1 the per capita potable water demand for potable uses exclusively i e drinking kitchen sink and bathroom was 26 5 l day 1 in all scenarios rabaey et al 2020 to assess the sensitivity of this assumption the performance of the rainwater capture system was also assessed by assuming a lower potable water demand of 15 l person 1 day 1 who 2011 in terms of wastewater production the per capita volume of grey or blackwater depended on the type of toilets employed in the dwellings 40 l day 1 15 l day 1 or 5 l day 1 of black water were considered depending on the use of conventional urine diverting or vacuum toilets respectively de graaff et al 2010 larsen et al 2013 despite having higher capital and operational costs vacuum toilets may offer economic and environmental benefits because less water is required and more concentrated blackwater is obtained their use is coupled with the treatment of the collected wastewater both in a two separated biological treatment stages anaerobic and aerobic treatment in a uasb and an mbr or b a single anaerobic stage in an anmbr the feasibility of a configuration involving the use of conventional toilets which yield more diluted blackwater was also assessed the additional flushing water would decrease constituents loads which would allow the biological treatment system to achieve the required bod and total phosphorus objectives without the anaerobic stage of the mbr however vacuum based systems coupled with nutrient recovery typically yield the lowest energy footprint kjerstadius et al 2015 finally urine source separation was considered because yellow water contributes 80 of n and 50 of p to residential wastewater jimenez et al 2015 rossi et al 2009 the collection and recovery of nutrients from urine could provide a revenue stream and reduce energy use in the treatment system de paepe et al 2018 larsen et al 2015 lienert and larsen 2010 2010b maurer et al 2006 remy 2010 existing technologies for on site urine treatment are still not sufficiently mature to yield reliable results however we estimated the costs of an innovative treatment scheme involving the electrochemical treatment of urine coupled with nitrification in an mabr to determine the merits of further development of on site urine treatment and resource recovery systems 2 1 4 influent and effluent composition constituents concentrations in grey and black water are shown in table 2 and are calculated using average daily constituent load per capita as described by larsen et al 2013 the results are in concordance with kujawa roeleveld zeeman 2006 dhadwal 2020 dhadwal et al 2021 sun et al 2020 urea hydrolysis i e 90 of total nitrogen converting to ammonia is assumed in all scenarios except for ud hence the high total ammonia concentration in bw gao et al 2019 larsen et al 2013 influent variability is assumed to be low as the collected wastewater originates solely from residential dwellings however deviations in influent concentrations stemming from seasonal or specific events may occur for the ud scenario we considered that bw consists of a mixture of yellow and brown waters i e urine and faeces plus toilet paper respectively in the modeled scenario urine and faeces were assumed to be collected separately using urine diverting toilets laufen switzerland which use 3l per simple flush a urine production of 1 5 l p d and a recovery efficiency in households of 75 of the flow considering technological and performance limitations to complete recovery were assumed lienert and larsen 2010 rossi et al 2009 all non recovered urine was assumed to mix with brown water thus the latter s concentration has been calculated accordingly the per capita daily volume of brown water produced is assumed to be 15 l p d table 3 shows the concentration of the resulting flow yellow and non mixed brown water effluent concentrations and performance were obtained based on reported removal efficiencies supplementary information tables 4 25 each of the treatment layouts was also modelled using the software simba ifak 2021 the simulations were used to evaluate both the performance and feasibility of the process flow diagrams the effluent characteristics obtained from both the modelling approach and the reported based calculations supplementary information tables 4 25 were compared to ensure the correctness of the calculations fig 3 shows the model of the v1 layout to treat black and grey water elaborated using simba 2 2 sewer infrastructure the required pipe lengths were calculated using the urban water infrastructure model uwim for sewers maurer et al 2013 pipes were assumed to originate at the center of every housing ground floor story lengths were calculated based on housing density and settlement area the latter of which was adapted to the floor space of each building the model parameter f2 representing the housing shape factor was estimated for each scenario maurer et al 2013 sewer methodology and calculation are detailed in supplementary information section 2 greywater and rainwater pipes made of unreinforced concrete were assumed for gravity water collection in contrast blackwater pipes were assumed to be operated either by vacuum as required in the v1 and v2 scenarios or by gravity c1 c2 and ud and were assumed to be composed of hdpe costs associated with vacuum pumps and pumps needed to return treated water to the apartments were included in the economic analysis see supplementary information section 6 a constant vacuum system cvs was included for blackwater pumping from vacuum toilets because it has proven to be more cost effective than a vacuum on demand system vod especially when pump prices and capacities are compared in multi family dwellings dometic sweden jest vacuum as norway a double pipeline was assumed for black water in the urine diversion scenario 2 3 treatment technologies 2 3 1 organic matter removal and gas production upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb the uasb reactors considered in scenario v1 enabled the uncoupling of the solids retention time srt from the hydraulic retention time hrt the system was assured to operate with an hrt of 7 15 days and a srt of 30 days the common practice in full scale anaerobic digestion facilities is to convert a fraction of the produced biogas into heat to satisfy heat requirements while producing energy via gas microturbines or combined heat and power chp we adopted this approach because it also has been employed in small scale applications adami et al 2020 baccioli et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 one of the challenges when operating uasbs and anmbrs is the high percentage up to 50 of methane gas dissolved in the effluent that could escape which could lower energy recovery efficiencies and increase greenhouse gas ghg emissions cookney et al 2016 shin et al 2014 shoener et al 2016 velasco et al 2018a thus a degassing membrane contactor was included in the treatment train with a separated reactor separating the gas and liquid phases henares et al 2016 velasco et al 2018b uasb design calculations removal efficiencies and costs can be found in supplementary information section 4 1 depending on scenario conditions e g location space availability budget constraints legislation different biogas management options are possible rodero et al 2018 salihu and alam 2015 yentekakis and goula 2017 arguably the most common solution in biogas producing treatment plants involves upgrading i e purifying the biogas to achieving 99 methane purity and selling it as fuel for electricity production or transport applications gas or liquified both natural gas and co2 have a value market that could allow additional revenues to offset some of the system operating costs 2 3 2 organic matter removal and gas production anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs alternative configurations were considered in which anmbrs were employed these systems provide the advantages of anaerobic wastewater treatment e g production of biogas lower energy consumption and less excess sludge production while overcoming the technology s main challenge of inferior organic carbon removal foglia et al 2020 guo et al 2016 li et al 2020 lin et al 2013 muñoz sierra et al 2019 the combination of membrane technology and anaerobic treatment allows for the decoupling of hrt from srt which helps lower overall costs while continuing to provide adequate treatment with shorter hrts ariunbaatar et al 2021 foglia et al 2020 ribera pi et al 2020 van den berg et al 2020 anmbrs modeled in this study were sized according to their hrt the low strength wastewater i e greaywater could be successfully treated using anmbr technology gouveia et al 2015 martin garcia et al 2013 shin et al 2014 wang et al 2018b 2018a it must to be noted that as anmbrs achieve a high solids separation the clogging of the pores is not expected to be major concern membrana wuppertal germany microporous contactors designed for low flow rates instead than non porous membranes appear to be the best approaches for higher methane recovery yields 2 3 3 organic matter removal aerobic membrane bioreatcors mbrs a flat sheet reverse osmosis ro membrane dupont de nemours inc delaware usa was assumed as a means of meeting current guidelines for phosphorus concentrations in wastewater reuse the selected membrane offered the highest removal efficiency for pollutants including nh4 n p relative to similar models van voorthuizen et al 2005 the use of the ro membrane improved the final water quality and provided another barrier against pathogen exposure in showers baths or incidental contact with recycled water the mbrs were assumed to use a rejection side stream configuration and included a combination of biological treatment in an aeration tank and ultrafiltration in a crossflow multi tube membrane loop e g polyethersulphone membranes berghoff gmbh eningen germany prior to ro the hydraulic residence time in the reactors was assumed to be 15 8 h for scenario v1 and 40 h for scenario c1 the volume of the system was calculated using eq 57 in the supplementary material fletcher et al 2007 wen et al 1999 xing et al 2001 2 3 4 nitrogen removal oxygen limited autotrophic nitritation denitrification oland process the removal of nitrogen was assumed to take place in a single stage oland process suitable for wastewater with high loads of organic matter in decentralized small scale treatment systems larsen et al 2013 lv et al 2011 nhu hien et al 2017 windey et al 2005 the oland process removal efficiencies and the calculation for the required biofilm surface is provided in supplementary information section 4 2 nitrate production during the oland process was assumed to be negligible 2 3 5 phosphorus removal struvite recovery small scale phosphorus recovery in the form of struvite which would be accompanied by ammoniacal nitrogen removal was assumed to take place in a crystallizer followed by a decanter ali 2005 kataki et al 2016 shaddel et al 2020 removal efficiencies design calculations energy demand and the mass of added mg oh 2 s needed to maintain supersaturation at a ph of 8 were calculated to obtain the effluent concentrations and operational costs see supplementary information 4 3 phosphorus recovery through struvite recovery is likely to become more important to sustainability in the water sector however this approach still presents operational challenges even in large facilities its implementation may only take place as operators gain more experience and pilot scale treatment systems demonstrate reliabel system perfornance however even if the struvite recovery only addresses the prevention of capacity loss due to detrimental struvite precipitation inside reactors and piping significant infrastructural sustainability goals would still be achieved 2 3 6 urine treatment as part of the urine diversion scenario yellow water was assumed to be treated through a combination of two technologies first we assumed that the urea in the urine will be allowed to hydrolyze resulting in the production of ammonia and bicarbonate as a result of the ph increase associated with this process the precipitation of struvite and other minerals e g mg ca k and na salts maurer et al 2006 occurs increasing the risk of clogging pipes and equipment odor nuisance ammonia loss through volatilization are other challenges associated with urea hydrolysis christiaens et al 2017 de paepe et al 2020 de paepe et al 2020b maurer et al 2006 rossi et al 2009 to avoid the need to add chemicals i e caustics acids to inhibit microbial activity and thus prevent urea hydrolysis an electrochemical cell similar to the unit proposed by de paepe et al 2020 was included see supplementary information 4 7 2 3 7 storage tanks tanks used to store recycled water or potable water were assumed to be composed of fpp flexible polypropylene liners whereas tanks used for storage of black grey brown water or sewage were assumed to use pvc polyvinyl chloride liners smaller tanks were assumed for rainwater collection since smaller volumes are required and larger steel tanks with the indicated liners were employed for grey and black water management enduramaxx ltd lincolnshire united kingdom power plastics ltd north yorkshire united kingdom a rotary screen was included in the design before the bioreactor to reduce membrane fouling and clogging seizing and costing calculation can be found in supplementary information 4 11 2 3 8 rainwater treatment rainwater treatment employed a combination of pre filters such as downspout diverters and first flush filters rainharvestsystems llc 2021 in tank filtration ro followed by uv treatment combination the rainwater disinfection and treatment systems were selected from among the smallest models available further details can be found in supplementary information 4 8 2 4 rainwater capture the total demand of drinking water m3 month for potable uses i e drinking and cooking for each type of building was calculated considering a per capita water consumption of 26 5l day rabaey et al 2020 multiplied by the number of building inhabitants for 31 days per month the daily amount of 26 5l represents an approximate 30 of the overall water usage 80 l day and does not consider other uses such as flushing toilets 25 cleaning 20 washing clothes 15 gardening etc to estimate the supply of rainwater m3 month average monthly rainfall mm data was extracted from climate data org 2021 the authors acknowledge that rainfall regimes and overall extreme variability are being impacted by climate change ipcc 2022 ipcc 2021 slater et al 2021 unep 2021 and that estimates based on historic averages or return periods might be inaccurate in the coming decades to assess the potential of rainwater systems to complement the existing access to a centralized water supply it would be more appropriate to consider a particularly dry period e g the driest year in a 20 or 50 year period nevertheless according to the latest ipcc report this approach could be very short lived as extreme variability is expected to change drastically in the upcoming decades ipcc 2022 future studies on rainwater capture capacity should include these most recent forecasts furthermore other options for storing precipitation generated by shorter more intense storms e g managed aquifer recharge should be considered for this analysis five cities were selected to cover a variety of climates according to the köppen geiger climate classification which considers temperature and precipitation patterns i miami north america which exhibits an equatorial climate ii santiago de chile south america which was representative of an arid climate iii barcelona europe which has mediterranean climate with a dry summer iv hong kong asia which is a warm climate with dry winters and v toronto north america which is a representative temperate climate zone precipitation patterns i

and a correction factor for roof losses of 0 9 was included drinking water demands and rainwater accumulations were estimated for each type of building and location rainwater accumulated in the storage tanks was carried over to between months 2 5 economic analysis information from technology manufacturers was used to calculate the capital capex and operational opex costs of the water and wastewater treatments systems for all building types and scenarios courtens et al 2014 etter et al 2011 fletcher et al 2007 lo et al 2015 lozano et al 2007 values obtained from the cost estimation simulator capdetworks were employed for the assessment of the uasb reactor benefits from the recovery of nutrients and biogas were estimated and included in the economic analysis deng and hägg 2010

according to eq 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainwater capture and domestic water recovery potential the extent to which rainwater can satisfy potable water demand depends on location and rainfall patterns fig 4 for single family dwellings and the two smallest multi family dwellings rainwater alone could supply potable water for all locations other than the driest location i e santiago de chile for the taller buildings rainwater was only adequate for several months per year buildings in hong kong miami and toronto could rely upon harvested rainwater for almost half of the year although significant savings can be obtained from rainwater harvesting for potable water supply the most significant reductions in water consumption were attributable to the continuous recycling of the black and grey water wastewater recycling satisfied the water demand of toilet flushing home appliances and showering fig 4 illustrates the recovery capacity per building type and indicates the volumes of grey and black water recycled by the treatment systems on an annual basis a minimum of about 74 of the total water demand including potable water can be satisfied in the worst scenarios high rise buildings without enough rain smaller buildings and buildings located in climates with rainfall regimes that are more conducive to harvesting will be able to fully satisfy an even greater fraction of the total water demand through the combination of rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling in most of the scenarios because potable water only accounts for about 17 20 of overall household water use epa 2021 3 1 1 rainwater treatment scheme the use of rainwater as a secure source of potable water is a proven concept that has found worldwide acceptance campisano et al 2017 liu et al 2021 peterson 2016 smit 2019 different treatment schemes can meet the strict health standards in wealthy countries alim et al 2020 piemontese et al 2020 suleiman et al 2020 in this study a ro uv system with customizable remineralization was used to treat rainwater dirisu et al 2019 rabaey et al 2020 this configuration was chosen for its reliable performance and its potential to satisfy health guidelines the ability of ro to remove nearly all constituents of rainwater might necessitate remineralization with ions such as magnesium calcium and fluoride to protect health and improve taste naser et al 2017 sedlak 2019 many of the ro commercially available today already include remineralization filters e g waterdropfilter 2021 bottled water obtained through ro based filtration has steadily grown in the last decades chen et al 2021 eke et al 2020 hawkins 2017 sustainablewater 2022 an increasing portion of the population prefers bottled water over tap due to its security perception taste qian 2018 wu et al 2021 and likely good marketing therefore existing and popular ro filtration schemes ensuring the recommended level of minerals and appealing taste could be easily adopted to ensure public acceptance 3 1 2 recycled water scheme from black and grey water loops the proposed treatment trains for the recovery of the generated wastewater produced an effluent that meets the guidelines of us epa epa 600 r 12 618 who gdwq 2011 2006 and eu regulation 2020 741 for reuse in urban and bathing applications the summary of the effluent quality obtained for each layout can be found in supplementary information section 10 in terms of water volumes bathing applications i e showers and baths are the most critical uses of recycled water in this study recycling domestic

and altamonte springs fl among others ocwd 2021 van rensburg 2016 tortajada and nambiar 2019 wrf 2019 watereuse 2019 recent years have also seen the appearance of specialized companies satisfying the private demand for domestic recycled water for drinking purposes tangent 2021 together with a wide plethora of research studies kehrein et al 2021 2020 khan 2013 wrf 2016 wrrf 2015 wu and englehardt 2016 stating domestic recycling as a reliable alternative the use of recycled water for toilet flushing cooling towers landscaping and industrial purposes is widely accepted amaris et al 2020 ilemobade et al 2013 especially among leading technology companies microsoft 2017 salesforce 2021 although potable water reuse is still not widely accepted in many countries using recycled water in showers and baths is likely to engender less hesitancy and was therefore considered in this study without this application the demand for the rainwater tanks would have been considerably greater and the system would have been less attractive if recycled water is not considered acceptable other alternatives for reducing demand on the rainwater tanks e g recirculating showers could be considered the treatment train employed in our analysis includes ro followed by disinfection with an ultraviolet uv lamp after mbr treatment this approach is predicted to satisfy drinking water requirements including an ammonia concentration lower than 1 5 mg l and a cod of 10 mg l agrawal 2009 hespanhol and prost 1994 who 2011 this mbr ro uv combination of technologies has been proven to eliminate bacteria and viruses friedler and gilboa 2010 ghernaot et al 2019 tang et al 2018 one of the most significant risks to public acceptance of showering or bathing in recycled water involves undesirable smells previous research indicates that some odorous compounds can pass through ro systems when treating sewage streams agus et al 2011 suggesting that complementary treatments such as advanced oxidation processes aops may be necessary to ensure public adoption different authors have already demonstrated the efficacy of aop for potable reuse barazesh et al 2015 weng et al 2020 wu and englehardt 2016 3 2 space requirements 3 2 1 holding capacity the space requirements of on site water systems depend on the desired degree of autonomy of the building the sizing of the tanks in our analysis was designed according to the desired duration or capacity for holding the produced wastewater and treated water before its reuse or treatment respectively similarly the sizing of the solids holding tanks was also designed according to the desired duration for storing the produced sludge two main degrees of autonomy for the recycling systems were evaluated in the first approach half of a week of autonomy was evaluated in this approach equalization conditioning and storage tanks were sized to hold wastewater for 3 5 days solids holding tanks were sized to allow for the accumulation of a week s worth of sludge production in a second approach all equalization conditioning and storage tanks water tanks were sized to hold the wastewater and sludge for only over 24 hours after sizing all the required units and equipment for the two degrees of autonomy the theoretical space requirements as a percentage of the basement floor were calculated table 5 fig 5 a basement floor with a ceiling height of 3 m was assumed as the location of the treatment units and related equipment plus other building equipment that is normally put in the basement level e g electrical equipment hvac elevators results of our analysis fig 5 indicate that the water storage and recycling equipment will occupy approximately between 8 and 40 of the basement or a further underground floor space under the lowest degree of autonomy scenario the estimated area ranges from 15 to 120 of the basement area under the larger storage capacity scenario table with all space requirements per building and layout can be found see supplementary information section 11 the single family dwelling and the two largest apartment buildings sacrificed the greatest fraction of the basement space to the treatment systems the highest floor occupancy corresponds to hr buildings and is 91 4 and 28 7 for longer and shorter water holding periods the remaining basement space could be reserved for future plant changes or destined for other uses such as vehicle parking or additional storage further details can be found in supplementary information sizing section 4 1 to 4 9 space requirement discussion 11 3 3 economic assessment 3 3 1 alternatives economic comparison total costs capex and opex were estimated for the six types of buildings fig 5 among the five treatment trains the v1 scenario i e vacuum toilets combined with anaerobic uasb and aerobic mbr was the most expensive costing about 50 more than each of the other scenarios the v1 option provides a smaller footprint due to the small volume of wastewater from vacuum toilets and incorporates the most proven technologies providing the most reliable data on sizing costing and performance conversely anmbrs allows for considerable cost reductions both in terms of capex and opex v2 c1 and c2 the urine diverting configuration achieves the lowest opex but shows higher capex than all other configurations except for v1 the novelty of the treatments involved in the ud scenario causes uncertainty in the cost calculation of this layout which could be easily reduced with further development i e mec and mabr positioning the ud scenario as the layout with the highest potential in terms of cost effectiveness and resource recovery 3 3 2 the economics of extreme decentralization the total costs of the six types of buildings were also evaluated in terms of m3 and per capita fig 6 the economies of scale show a significant reduction in the cost of water as the number of people serviced increases fig 6 fig 6 also illustrates how the total costs of the five treatment trains for each of six types of buildings would compare with current water prices in different regions of the world these cost estimates do not consider the avoided costs benefits from both rainwater harvesting and recycling water 74 100 as discussed in section 3 36 income assessment estimates shown in fig 6 illustrate how the most expensive of the presented decentralized systems v1 in buildings with more than 100 inhabitants could be competitive with the cost of water in wealthier regions such as north america and western europe 4 3 3 9 m3 similarly for buildings larger than 300 inhabitants such as large buildings districts or city blocks with populations between 300 to 2 000 could become the most cost effective decentralized solutions this study indicates that large buildings or interconnected buildings could result in the most cost effective approach when considering current technologies monitoring requirements and infrastructure costs i e pipelines especially when compared with existing centralized systems nevertheless decentralized district scale approaches with smaller buildings resulting in lower population densities may not achieve similar economic advantages in previous studies estimating the costs of decentralized approaches covering neighborhoods or districts pipeline related costs i e installation maintenance and pumping accounted for more than 60 of total costs garrido baserba et al 2018 roefs et al 2016 the present study which was focused on independent apartment blocks did not consider interconnected sewer networks between neighboring buildings which limited the length of the pipeline and reduced its impact on the overall capex and opex future studies should identify the most economically feasible density ratios for different district organizations such as large buildings interconnected buildings in city blocks with short pipeline connections and modular treatment designs or smaller housing at district scale 3 3 3 the cost of including decentralized water systems in new building construction the total cost of the most expensive decentralized solution v1 was compared to the total construction costs for each type of building under study fig 7 fig 7 shows the percentage of the total construction costs for scenario v1 however the relationships will be similar for the other scenarios the installation cost could increase construction costs by 6 9 the opex over a 30 year period was equivalent to 3 24 of construction costs see supplementary information section 5 construction costs 3 3 4 cost breakdown the most expensive among the five treatment trains the v1 scenario i e vacuum toilets combined with anaerobic uasb and aerobic mbr was used to illustrate the cost breakdown of decentralized treatment in buildings an extended discussion covering all the main cost contributors explaining the main differences between treatment trains e g sewer pipes dual reticulation piping specialized toilets treatment technologies can be found in supplementary information section 12 similarly the breakdown of costs and obtained benefits for all treatment configurations can be found in the supplementary material see section 7 and section 8 fig 8 shows that the recycling of grey water and black water accounts for about 65 80 of the overall cost with a higher percentage of the costs in larger buildings within the treatment systems the capex and opex costs are of a similar magnitude partially due to the necessity of vacuum pumping to evacuate the highly concentrated waters and the high costs of operating the uasb reactors nevertheless the overall deployment of the grey water sewer pipeline is more costly than black water sewer since pipe diameters are larger to hold bigger volumes the remainder of the costs were related to monitoring and rainwater harvesting monitoring costs were high accounting for the majority of the remaining costs fig 9 see supplementary for monitoring break down costs and discussion section 13 process monitoring as discussed a conservative approach with the highest standards on monitoring was assumed in this analysis monitoring is a crucial and expensive process sensors sampling control lims personnel etc and is standardized to assure health and safety therefore similar requirements were deemed necessary independently of the size therefore no significant economies of scale were attributable to monitoring and the monitoring costs for larger buildings 14 increased substantially for smaller buildings 50 research is needed to identify approaches for reducing monitoring costs especially in smaller systems through the use of new or soft sensors or performance based monitoring strategies rainwater collection and treatment accounts for a relatively small fraction of the overall cost 5 8 across all buildings and scenarios entailing low capital investment and low operating and maintenance costs ro and uv treatment consume large amounts of energy judd 2017 sanz 2013 but the volume of rainwater requiring treatment was small which limited the opex of the rainwater system to 1 2 of total costs for all scenarios 3 3 5 process monitoring to ensure public acceptance the highest standards on monitoring need to be satisfied water reuse should satisfy the most stringent of the quality requirements demanding an advanced robust and safe treatment system able to comply with the tighter health and monitoring standards to avoid a negative perception towards this type of approach the presented system must yield the highest water qualities such as potable water even if none of the reused water will be recycled as a direct potable source a very conservative estimation of the monitoring requirements was purposely chosen to demonstrate that the most rigorous and advanced monitoring routine could be achieved avoiding concerns about safety and control the monitoring costs were calculated as in three main blocks 1 laboratory tests outside lab 2 sensors capex and opex external service contract 3 real time remote monitoring external service contract see section 8 in supplementary information the real time remote monitoring was selected to enable remote monitoring of these decentralized systems allowing the necessary technical and operational expertise to operate and maintain in real time such complex systems a centralized management of these different decentralized units was considered to allow experts to control and coordinate with technicians the laboratory test routine designed follows the guidelines from the sampling workbook sampling questionnaire and matrix developed by the water environment federation wef task group on wastewater treatment plant data collection the workbook indicates the required sampling locations within the treatment process and the type and frequency of analyses required to meet the process control goals including the requirements for process simulators the compiled laboratory costs were obtained from several commercial laboratories and costs should be updated and adapted accordingly it must be noted that the cost of using outside laboratories is the most expensive option and it was selected to reflect the worst economic scenario and to assume no need for further investment or space requirements the operating budget could be significantly reduced by analyzing in situ some of them and especially decreasing the number of lab tests from the recommended sampling routine once a stable performance is obtained in parallel some service contracts could be reduced depending on process performance maintenance routine etc nevertheless we anticipate monitoring costs to further decrease in upcoming years with cheaper and better sensors capabilities new development of reliable soft sensors and more breakthroughs in control theory vanrolleghem and lee 2003 3 3 6 income assessment the recovery of resources by the water recycling system could offset the cost of installing and operating the systems section 3 3 2 each treatment train considered in the analysis enabled the recovery of energy and several also included nutrient recovery although the production of fertilizer might be popular in community gardening initiatives and the produced biogas could help offset project greenhouse gas emissions these two sources of revenue account for less than 2 of the total estimated opex see supplementary information section 4 1 4 for details instead the most most important offset was related to the decrease in water demand from the centralized water system which could offset a substantial fraction of the annual operational costs i e 74 100 figure fig 10 compares the theoretical savings of reducing the dependency of utility water with the total capex and opex of each treatment train i e water consumption charges minus infrastructure charges which are accounted for separately and assuming an average water price of 2 m3 ajuntament de barcelona 2019 fig 10 shows that water savings account for 57 to 135 of total costs even with a theoretical increase in the water price lower than the inflation the proposed systems are assumed to have connection to the centralized sewer system to provide a means for disposing of excess water and providing redundancy if the treatment system is taken out fo service for repairs nevertheless there may be sceanrios in which it is advantageous to avoid connecting the system to a centralized the sewer system e g buildings located on the edges of cities where sewers have not yet been installed places where landscape irrigation and the use of treated wastewater for ecological pruposes or groundwater recharge are attractive the construction and maintenance costs of the connection to the water main 110 mm pe were also included and obtained using architecture and engineering prices simulation software cype the described considerations result in capital and monthly savings of approximately 8 17 see supplementary information section 6 4 conclusions a detailed techno economic and feasibility evaluation of the costs of extreme decentralization indicates that costs to builders and residents will be comparable to or lower than those of current systems while also reducing per capita water demand using existing on site treatment technologies and approaches that are likely to become mature in the next two decades we made several observations the complete set of tanks and treatment equipment required for wastewater treatment and rainwater capture could fit into space that is available in existing basement space for the smallest buildings the equipment occupied a considerable fraction of the available basement space the effluents of the presented treatment line configurations meet current quality regulations in terms of greywater reuse and drinking water public perception and limiting legislation therefore remain the principal impediments to wastewater recycling for domestic and even drinkning purposes the capacity of the installations for covering potable water demand from rainwater capture in average households depends on the building size and regional climate rainwater could only meet water demand for the entire year on the small buildings in the wetter climates however greywater could be recycled multiple times assuring that building equiped with on site treatment sysyems would have a substantially smaller per capita water demand than other types of housing decentralized plants allow for a drastic reduction in sewer disposal costs biological treatment units i e mbrs anmbrs and uasb reactors and black water pumping account for the largest capital and operational costs while struvite recovery uv and ro systems provide significant benefits to the plants performance and final water quality requiring lower investments during the construction of new residential blocks only 5 6 11 6 of additional investment would be required to incorporate the required pipeline network and equipment installation exhaustive monitoring and maintenance is necessary to ensure health safety the substitution of uasb reactors with anmbrs together with the consideration of source separation of urine approaches can drastically lower the plants operational costs especially in large buildings and offer an opportunity to minimize costs and maximize resource recovery 5

15969,halophenolic disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water have attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to their wide occurrence and high toxicity the liver has been demonstrated as a major target organ for several halophenolic dbps however little is known about the underlying mechanisms of liver damage caused by halophenolic dbps in this study 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp and 2 4 6 triiodiophenol tip were selected as representative halophenolic dbps and exposed to c57bl 6 mice at an environmentally relevant concentration 0 5 μg l and two toxicological concentrations 10 and 200 μg l for 12 weeks then a combination of histopathologic and biochemical examination liver transcriptome serum metabolome and gut microbiome was adopted it was found that trihalophenol exposure significantly elevated the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and albumin liver inflammation was observed at toxicological concentrations in the histopathological examination transcriptome results showed that the three trihalophenols could impact immune related pathways at 0 5 μg l which further contributed to the disturbance of pathways in infectious diseases and cancers notably tbp and tip had higher immunosuppressive effects than tcp which might lead to uncontrolled infection and cancer in terms of serum metabolic profiles energy metabolism pathway of citrate cycle and amino acid metabolism pathways of valine leucine and isoleucine were also significantly affected integration of the metabolomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a 12 week trihalophenol exposure could prominently disturb the glutathione metabolism pathway indicating the impaired antioxidation and detoxification abilities in liver moreover the disorder of the intestinal flora could interfere with immune regulation and host metabolism this study reveals the toxic effects of halophenolic dbps on mammalian liver and provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenolic disinfection byproducts drinking water in vivo toxicity multi omics immunotoxicity 1 introduction disinfection byproducts dbps have been intensively investigated since they were first put forward in 1974 halophenolic dbps were first identified in chlorinated drinking water by zhai and zhang 2011 after that a nearly complete list of all halophenolic dbps including halo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes halo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids halo salicylic acids and halophenols etc were found to be present in various water samples pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 li et al 2021 more recently it was proven that the halophenolic dbp fractions exhibited a greater developmental toxicity than aliphatic halogenated dbp fractions in chlorinated drinking water han et al 2021 with regard to their potential high toxicity halophenolic dbps have attracted increasing concerns among halophenolic dbps 2 4 6 trihalophenols were reported to be tens to hundreds of times more cytotoxic developmentally toxic and growth inhibiting than many aliphatic halogenated dbps and a few halophenolic dbps such as halohydroxybenzaldehydes and halohydroxybenzoic acids yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 2 4 6 trihalophenols were also found to be developmentally toxic genotoxic and cytotoxic to human extended pluripotent stem eps cells zebrafish liver and mouse macrophage raw264 7 cells respectively liu et al 2021 xie et al 2019 yin et al 2009 furthermore 2 4 6 trichlorophenols induced organism damages and possible carcinogenicity using rodents as models national toxicology program 1979 huff 2012 as a result 2 4 6 trichlorophenol has been listed as a group of priority pollutants in china and the united states health and ecological criteria division 1991 xia et al 2004 and classified as potential carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer and the world health organization igbinosa et al 2013 it is suspected that a long term and sustainable exposure of 2 4 6 trihalophenol dbps in drinking water may cause potential harm to human health although a few studies have been focusing on in vivo assays of 2 4 6 trihalophenols to mammals the concentrations of 2 4 6 trihalophenols adopted in these studies 1000 μg l were much higher than the levels that might occur in real drinking water bercz et al 1990 lyubimov et al 1998 igbinosa et al 2013 for instance huff 2012 reported clear evidence of carcinogenicity in mice liver after long term exposure to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol at 5000 and 10 000 mg l in addition the methods used in previous in vivo toxicity assessments of 2 4 6 trihalophenols were restricted to apparent phenomena such as disposition knudsen et al 2019 organ weight changes bercz et al 1990 and focal area huff 2012 lacking systematic evaluation of genetic and metabolic factors from the molecular level thus it is imperative to reveal the potential genetic and metabolic effects of 2 4 6 trihalophenols at environmentally relevant concentrations gut microbiota plays an essential role in host metabolism gut immunity and modulates organ functions aziz et al 2013 the intestinal blood content activates liver functions and the liver affects intestinal functions through bile secretion in turn cesaro et al 2011 gut microbiota involves in liver diseases and hepatotoxicity development schnabl and brenner 2014 several studies reported dbps like trichloroacetamide and 2 2 dichloroacetamide could interfere with gut composition and host gut microbiota co metabolism xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 factors that cannot be mimicked in vitro such as enterohepatic circulation might be involved in the mutagenicity of the haloacetic acids nelson et al 2001 however there lacks substantial evidence of the association between the gut microbiome and hepatotoxicity of 2 4 6 trihalophenols accordingly we designed this study to investigate the toxic effects of trihalophenols on the mice liver with integrated bioinformatics analyses as well as clinical medicine methods this study will be of great significance in revealing the effects of trihalophenols on the mammalian liver at environmentally relevant concentrations and providing a novel perspective on the mechanisms of liver damage 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp 98 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp 99 and 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip 97 were purchased from tci shanghai details about the chemicals are described

housed in a pathogen free laboratory and food and water were provided ad libitum after one week a total of 80 mice were randomly divided into 10 groups eight for each group including a control group ultrapure water was provided on every monday and thursday food and water were provided ad libitum and nine treated groups tcp tbp or tip containing water was provided on every monday and thursday food and water were provided ad libitum concentrations of trihalophenol dbps were set at an environmentally relevant value 0 5 μg l pan and zhang 2013 and two toxicological values 10 and 200 μg l yin et al 2009 xia et al 2016 limited number of concentration values were tested for mice due to the animal ethical requirements of 3rs refinement reduction and replacement at the end of feeding period all mice were sacrificed after anesthetization with diethyl ether and necropsied the livers were collected blood was collected and centrifuged to obtain serum samples then immediately stored at 80 c feces were collected from each mouse at weeks 4 8 and 12 and then frozen at 80 c the animal tests received approval from the animal ethics committee of nanjing medical university and all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved guidelines permit number njmu iacuc 1711010 2 3 histopathology and biochemical assays four mice from each group were randomly chosen for pathological studies tissue sections of mouse liver and intestine were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde pbs dehydrated in a graded series of alcohol solutions embedded in paraffin and then sectioned 4 5 μm then the slides were

previous study conducted by shi et al 2012 these experiments were performed as blind trials four serum biochemical indexes which indicate liver function were detected using the hitachi 7100 automatic biochemical analyzer hitachi japan including alanine aminotransferase alt aspartate aminotransferase ast alkaline phosphatase alp and albumin alb 2 4 transcriptomic analysis liver sections collected after sacrifice were maintained overnight in rna later solution qiagen u s at 4 c and subsequently stored at 20 c in each experimental group the liver tissues of three mice were randomly chosen and rna from the liver of each mouse was separately extracted and cleaned using trizol reagent invitrogen usa and the qiagen rneasy minirna cleanup kit qiagen usa respectively three replicates of rna sequencing rna seq by illumina hiseqxten pe150 were applied for each experimental group firstly the raw data denoising was performed using the trimmomatic software version 0 38 and then the obtained clean reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome using salmon version 1 1 0 with the default parameters read counting was performed using htseq with the a option to specify a minimum score of 10 for the alignment quality then the resulting read counts were directly processed by edger package in the r studio software version 4 0 3 to identify differentially expressed genes degs degs were identified using the generalized linear model glm likelihood ratio test genes with log2 fold change 1 and p value 0 05 were considered to be differentially expressed liu et al 2013 biological significance of degs were analyzed by the functional annotation package clusterprofiler in the r studio software version 4 0 3 based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway

discussion 3 1 water intake body weight histopathological observation and biochemical indexes of mice after a 12 week exposure to tcp tbp and tip no death or significant changes in daily water consumption was observed for the control and experimental groups p 0 05 table s3 the net body weight gain of several experimental groups at week 4 and 8 were lower than those of the control group on week 12 the net body weight gains of all the experimental groups were still increasing slightly but no significant increase was found in the control group 0 5 g fig s1 exposure to 200 μg l tcp significantly increased the hepatosomatic index hsi p 0 01 fig s2 indicating the hepatomegaly caused by tcp while the other experimental groups showed no significant effect p 0 05 previous studies have reported an increase in relative weights of the liver in rats gavaged with tcp at 240 and 720 mg kg per day bercz et al 1990 and the incidence of inflammatory events in the oreochromis niloticus liver when exposed to 50 ng g of 2 4 6 tbp folle et al 2021 however exposure to trihalophenol dbps at environmentally relevant concentration 0 5 μg l did not cause any observable inflammation slight inflammation probably caused by cytotoxicity was found at 10 and 200 μg l trihalophenols exposure fig 1 a notably the liver inflammation induced by tip exposure was almost similar to that caused by tcp and tbp which was different from the cytotoxicity results that iodo dbps were far more toxic than their bromo and chloro analogs plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 accordingly we hypothesized that the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of tcp tbp and tip might be different and thus changes of hepatic function that occurred at the molecular level were further explored in terms of serum biochemical indexes of liver function alt and ast are enzymes used as indicators of hepatic damage el demerdash 2011 however there were no statistical significance in the levels of these two enzymes between the trihalophenol exposed groups and the control group fig 1b alp is also a parameter included in biochemical liver test intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary obstruction and inflammatory stimuli could increase the levels of alp haarhaus et al 2017 lescot et al 2012 in this study the elevated levels of alp in serum were observed after trihalophenol exposure indicating the biliary obstruction or inflammation in liver alb a major serum protein synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes is of paramount importance in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure and immune homeostasis don and kaysen 2004 the levels of serum alb were up regulated by trihalophenol exposure it has been reported that aromatic halogenated dbps could bind with alb to change its secondary structure yamauchi and sai 2011 zhang et al 2019 which may exacerbate the compensating production of alb this might be the cause of increased levels of alb in the trihalophenol exposure groups 3 2 hepatic transcriptomic profiles after trihalophenols exposure to identify underlying toxicological mechanisms of trihalophenols at the molecular level the hepatic transcriptomic profiles were analyzed opls da analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed obvious discrepancies among the control and trihalophenol dbps exposure groups fig 2 a indicating significant changes of the hepatic transcriptome in response to trihalophenol dbps exposure the distance from the control group appeared to increase from tcp to tip suggesting that transcriptome perturbation induced by tip exposure was the most significant the distinction in toxicity of trihalophenol dbps might be due to the toxicity of electrophilic dbp to nucleophilic sites and the toxicity of nucleophilic dbp to electrophilic sites yang and zhang 2013 after a 12 week exposure to 200 μg l of tcp tbp and tip there were 682 805 and 1333 degs and 14 8 and 58 saps on the basis of kegg pathway database respectively fig 2b fig s3 table s4 s6 exposure to 0 5 μg l tcp tbp and tip resulted in 1327 833 1001 degs and 34 23 and 41 saps respectively the numbers of degs and saps alone could not fully reflect the toxic effects as some degs might not be important in the related toxicological phenotype pathways so further analysis of the degs functions was required all these saps were mainly involved in five categories including organismal systems environmental information processing metabolism human diseases and cellular processes significantly altered genes with the highest fold changes among all the experimental groups were listed in table s7 including t complex protein tcp11 protocadherin gamma pcdhgc5 glycoprotein gpnmb cytochrome p450 cyp2c40 and carbonyl reductase cbr3 the remarkable changes of these genes indicated the disturbed immune responses impaired antioxidant and detoxification abilities and promoted carcinogenesis of mouse livers after trihalophenol exposure degs shared by different concentrations of each trihalophenol fig 2b were mapped for kegg pathway enrichment respectively fig 2c as shown in fig 2c tbp exposure altered african trypanosomiasis pathway while tip exposure altered tuberculosis and malaria pathway etc moreover the results of enrichment of individual degs for each trihalophenol at 0 5 and 200 μg l fig s4 also showed that the signaling pathways of various infectious diseases were significantly altered after tbp and tip treatment the most disturbed saps and related degs of nine experimental groups were displayed in fig s5 respectively results suggested that several degs participated in immunity functions including lymphocytes activation leukocyte transendothelial migration and primary immunodeficiency indicating that the immunity of liver was disturbed since immunodeficiency may contribute to uncontrolled infection and cancer xie et al 2019 it s no wonder that pathways in infectious diseases and cancers were also significantly altered after trihalophenol exposure 3 3 serum metabolomic profiles after the trihalophenol dbps exposure the nmr data sets of serum metabolomic profiles were normalized and analyzed by pls da as shown in fig 3 a the trihalophenol dbps exposure groups were clearly separated from the control group indicating a disturbance of metabolism of mice serum the dose dependent manner was observed in the serum metabolomic profiles but liver transcriptomics profiles did not show this trend previous research on the cytotoxicity developmental toxicity and growth inhibition of the halogenated dbps all showed an obvious dose dependent manner yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 this might be due to the complexity of the in vivo mammalian toxicity which is quite different from the in vitro systems or non mammalian models moreover a total of 30 sams were identified table s8 for the next step biological pathway enrichment analysis of these sams and the sams shared by tcp tbp and tip exposure groups was performed and shown in fig 3b and fig 3c the sams were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism e g valine leucine and isoleucine metabolism carbohydrate metabolism e g glycolysis or gluconeogenesis lipid metabolism e g glycerophospholipid metabolism and citrate cycle tca cycle valine could promote recovery from liver injury and leucine is a branched amino acid involved in liver protein synthesis chang et al 2017 altered valine leucine and isoleucine metabolism pathway after trihalophenol exposure indicated the impaired liver function furthermore the levels of key intermediates within the tca cycle citrate and pyruvate were significantly down regulated after trihalophenol exposure as well as the up regulation of succinate suggesting the perturbed energy metabolism among the 30 sams identified in the exposure groups phosphorylcholine phenylalanine pyruvate trimethylamine n oxide succinate acetate and choline were host gut microbiota co metabolites fernández veledo and vendrell 2019 suggesting possible perturbations in the gut microbiome integration of the transcriptomic and metabolomic data suggested that following a 12 week trihalophenol exposure fig 4 several pathways were affected among them the glutathione metabolism pathway was the most prominently disturbed pathway with both changed metabolites glutathione l glutamate and l glutamine and genes glul gstt1 gstp2 gls ggt1 and ggt5 glutamine is considered as a fuel for the immune system calder and yaqoob 1999 cruzat et al 2018 while glutathione exerts important physiological functions in antioxidation detoxification and immune regulation bansal and simon 2018 thus the results indicated that trihalophenol exposure could induce oxidative stress in liver by perturbing the metabolism of glutathione 3 4 gut microbiome changes induced by trihalophenol dbps chronic inflammation in the submucosa of the intestinal wall leads to an accumulation of the extracellular matrix which causes obstructive symptomatology and thickening of all layers of the intestinal wall suzuki et al 2011 through pathological analyses it was found that 200 μg l tip exposure caused submucosa composed of collagen fibrils in the bowel wall thickening fig 5 a suggesting intestinal chronic inflammation injury induced by tip the dynamics of the microbial community in mice guts during exposure show that firmicutes 20 4 62 8 bacteroidetes 31 6 62 0 and proteobacteria 0 774 17 2 were the dominant populations of mouse gut microbiota fig s6 the disrupted firmicutes bacteroidetes f b ratio indicated the affected host lipid and energy metabolism fig s7 in each sample taxonomic counts were normalized by otus the pls da results showed that the exposure groups were successfully separated from the control group fig s8 as time passed by the parallel samples in the trihalophenol dbps exposure group tended to become more aggregated and the distinction between the exposure groups and the control group was more obvious in addition the function of gut microbiota was investigated by the picrust tool langille et al 2013 as shown in fig s9 there were 30 8 and 9 saps in the 0 5 μg l tcp tbp and tip exposure groups respectively suggesting the effects of intestinal microbiome disturbance on host metabolism inflammatory regulation and cancer development after trihalophenol exposure to further investigate specific bacteria that differed in the exposure group the normalized data was also screened and visualized by heatmap analysis fig 5b results showed that the most predominant family in top priority otus was the porphyromonadaceae and erysipelotrichaceae family the abundance of erysipelotrichaceae and lactobacillaceae in several 2 4 6 trihalophenol exposure groups was much higher than the control group at all time points 4 8 12 weeks gram positive erysipelotrichaceae was considered to be the major genera associated with active tuberculosis as well as chronic inflammatory disease khaliq et al 2021 interestingly tuberculosis pathway also significantly altered in the liver transcriptome which commensurate to that observed in gut microbiome this result suggested that the disorder in the intestinal flora might be related to pathways of infectious diseases in the transcriptome lactobacillaceae are effective at enhancing innate and adaptive immunity tsai et al 2012 the increased abundance of lactobacillaceae indicated their participation in immune regulation 3 5 effects of trihalophenolic dbps on immune cells to further affirm the immunosuppression effects of trihalophenols found in liver transcriptome and serum metabolome primary macrophages isolated from mouse peritoneal cavity were adopted to measure their immunotoxicity macrophages are vital players in immunity with remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues macrophages can rapidly switch their phenotypes into m1 polarized or m2 polarized status which corresponds to pro inflammatory or anti inflammatory function zanganeh et al 2016 xie et al 2019 it has been widely known that inos is the marker of m1 and arg 1 is a classical hallmark of m2 rath et al 2014 song et al 2017 as shown in fig s10 the expression of arg 1 remarkably increased after the treatment with tbp and tip while the expression of inos was down regulated after trihalophenol dbps exposure these results suggested that tbp and tip could significantly induce m2 polarization which may contribute to the immunosuppression in liver and promote tissue repair sindrilaru et al 2011 this result may explain why similar liver injury and inflammation were observed for all the three trihalophenols the greater tissue repair ability of tip and tbp may partially counteract their higher cytotoxicity than tcp xie et al 2019 liu et al 2021 moreover previous studies have pointed out long term exposure to environmental pollutants leads to immune dysfunction and inflammation such as bisphenol s perfluorooctanoic acid and toxic metal qiu et al 2019 skalny et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the strong immunosuppressive effects of trihalophenols suggested high risks of infection and cancer which mediated the toxicity of trihalophenols 4 conclusions this study first reported effects on mammalian organs after chronic exposure to trihalophenol dbps in drinking water the separation between the trihalophenol dbps exposure group and the control group in the molecular profiles showed that exposure to trihalophenols induced significant alterations in liver transcriptome and serum metabolic profiles as well as perturbed the composition of intestinal microorganisms the trihalophenols all caused immune regulation effects which probably mediated the hepatotoxicity of trihalophenols including the infectious diseases related pathway alteration chronic inflammation and carcinogenicity these results provided new insights into the health risks of trihalophenol dbps exposure via drinking water consumption further studies are required to explore immune mediated

15969,halophenolic disinfection byproducts dbps in drinking water have attracted considerable concerns in recent years due to their wide occurrence and high toxicity the liver has been demonstrated as a major target organ for several halophenolic dbps however little is known about the underlying mechanisms of liver damage caused by halophenolic dbps in this study 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp and 2 4 6 triiodiophenol tip were selected as representative halophenolic dbps and exposed to c57bl 6 mice at an environmentally relevant concentration 0 5 μg l and two toxicological concentrations 10 and 200 μg l for 12 weeks then a combination of histopathologic and biochemical examination liver transcriptome serum metabolome and gut microbiome was adopted it was found that trihalophenol exposure significantly elevated the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and albumin liver inflammation was observed at toxicological concentrations in the histopathological examination transcriptome results showed that the three trihalophenols could impact immune related pathways at 0 5 μg l which further contributed to the disturbance of pathways in infectious diseases and cancers notably tbp and tip had higher immunosuppressive effects than tcp which might lead to uncontrolled infection and cancer in terms of serum metabolic profiles energy metabolism pathway of citrate cycle and amino acid metabolism pathways of valine leucine and isoleucine were also significantly affected integration of the metabolomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a 12 week trihalophenol exposure could prominently disturb the glutathione metabolism pathway indicating the impaired antioxidation and detoxification abilities in liver moreover the disorder of the intestinal flora could interfere with immune regulation and host metabolism this study reveals the toxic effects of halophenolic dbps on mammalian liver and provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of hepatotoxicity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phenolic disinfection byproducts drinking water in vivo toxicity multi omics immunotoxicity 1 introduction disinfection byproducts dbps have been intensively investigated since they were first put forward in 1974 halophenolic dbps were first identified in chlorinated drinking water by zhai and zhang 2011 after that a nearly complete list of all halophenolic dbps including halo 4 hydroxybenzaldehydes halo 4 hydroxybenzoic acids halo salicylic acids and halophenols etc were found to be present in various water samples pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 li et al 2021 more recently it was proven that the halophenolic dbp fractions exhibited a greater developmental toxicity than aliphatic halogenated dbp fractions in chlorinated drinking water han et al 2021 with regard to their potential high toxicity halophenolic dbps have attracted increasing concerns among halophenolic dbps 2 4 6 trihalophenols were reported to be tens to hundreds of times more cytotoxic developmentally toxic and growth inhibiting than many aliphatic halogenated dbps and a few halophenolic dbps such as halohydroxybenzaldehydes and halohydroxybenzoic acids yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 2 4 6 trihalophenols were also found to be developmentally toxic genotoxic and cytotoxic to human extended pluripotent stem eps cells zebrafish liver and mouse macrophage raw264 7 cells respectively liu et al 2021 xie et al 2019 yin et al 2009 furthermore 2 4 6 trichlorophenols induced organism damages and possible carcinogenicity using rodents as models national toxicology program 1979 huff 2012 as a result 2 4 6 trichlorophenol has been listed as a group of priority pollutants in china and the united states health and ecological criteria division 1991 xia et al 2004 and classified as potential carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer and the world health organization igbinosa et al 2013 it is suspected that a long term and sustainable exposure of 2 4 6 trihalophenol dbps in drinking water may cause potential harm to human health although a few studies have been focusing on in vivo assays of 2 4 6 trihalophenols to mammals the concentrations of 2 4 6 trihalophenols adopted in these studies 1000 μg l were much higher than the levels that might occur in real drinking water bercz et al 1990 lyubimov et al 1998 igbinosa et al 2013 for instance huff 2012 reported clear evidence of carcinogenicity in mice liver after long term exposure to 2 4 6 trichlorophenol at 5000 and 10 000 mg l in addition the methods used in previous in vivo toxicity assessments of 2 4 6 trihalophenols were restricted to apparent phenomena such as disposition knudsen et al 2019 organ weight changes bercz et al 1990 and focal area huff 2012 lacking systematic evaluation of genetic and metabolic factors from the molecular level thus it is imperative to reveal the potential genetic and metabolic effects of 2 4 6 trihalophenols at environmentally relevant concentrations gut microbiota plays an essential role in host metabolism gut immunity and modulates organ functions aziz et al 2013 the intestinal blood content activates liver functions and the liver affects intestinal functions through bile secretion in turn cesaro et al 2011 gut microbiota involves in liver diseases and hepatotoxicity development schnabl and brenner 2014 several studies reported dbps like trichloroacetamide and 2 2 dichloroacetamide could interfere with gut composition and host gut microbiota co metabolism xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 factors that cannot be mimicked in vitro such as enterohepatic circulation might be involved in the mutagenicity of the haloacetic acids nelson et al 2001 however there lacks substantial evidence of the association between the gut microbiome and hepatotoxicity of 2 4 6 trihalophenols accordingly we designed this study to investigate the toxic effects of trihalophenols on the mice liver with integrated bioinformatics analyses as well as clinical medicine methods this study will be of great significance in revealing the effects of trihalophenols on the mammalian liver at environmentally relevant concentrations and providing a novel perspective on the mechanisms of liver damage 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp 98 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp 99 and 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip 97 were purchased from tci shanghai details about the chemicals are described

discussion 3 1 water intake body weight histopathological observation and biochemical indexes of mice after a 12 week exposure to tcp tbp and tip no death or significant changes in daily water consumption was observed for the control and experimental groups p 0 05 table s3 the net body weight gain of several experimental groups at week 4 and 8 were lower than those of the control group on week 12 the net body weight gains of all the experimental groups were still increasing slightly but no significant increase was found in the control group 0 5 g fig s1 exposure to 200 μg l tcp significantly increased the hepatosomatic index hsi p 0 01 fig s2 indicating the hepatomegaly caused by tcp while the other experimental groups showed no significant effect p 0 05 previous studies have reported an increase in relative weights of the liver in rats gavaged with tcp at 240 and 720 mg kg per day bercz et al 1990 and the incidence of inflammatory events in the oreochromis niloticus liver when exposed to 50 ng g of 2 4 6 tbp folle et al 2021 however exposure to trihalophenol dbps at environmentally relevant concentration 0 5 μg l did not cause any observable inflammation slight inflammation probably caused by cytotoxicity was found at 10 and 200 μg l trihalophenols exposure fig 1 a notably the liver inflammation induced by tip exposure was almost similar to that caused by tcp and tbp which was different from the cytotoxicity results that iodo dbps were far more toxic than their bromo and chloro analogs plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2008 accordingly we hypothesized that the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of tcp tbp and tip might be different and thus changes of hepatic function that occurred at the molecular level were further explored in terms of serum biochemical indexes of liver function alt and ast are enzymes used as indicators of hepatic damage el demerdash 2011 however there were no statistical significance in the levels of these two enzymes between the trihalophenol exposed groups and the control group fig 1b alp is also a parameter included in biochemical liver test intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary obstruction and inflammatory stimuli could increase the levels of alp haarhaus et al 2017 lescot et al 2012 in this study the elevated levels of alp in serum were observed after trihalophenol exposure indicating the biliary obstruction or inflammation in liver alb a major serum protein synthesized and secreted by hepatocytes is of paramount importance in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure and immune homeostasis don and kaysen 2004 the levels of serum alb were up regulated by trihalophenol exposure it has been reported that aromatic halogenated dbps could bind with alb to change its secondary structure yamauchi and sai 2011 zhang et al 2019 which may exacerbate the compensating production of alb this might be the cause of increased levels of alb in the trihalophenol exposure groups 3 2 hepatic transcriptomic profiles after trihalophenols exposure to identify underlying toxicological mechanisms of trihalophenols at the molecular level the hepatic transcriptomic profiles were analyzed opls da analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed obvious discrepancies among the control and trihalophenol dbps exposure groups fig 2 a indicating significant changes of the hepatic transcriptome in response to trihalophenol dbps exposure the distance from the control group appeared to increase from tcp to tip suggesting that transcriptome perturbation induced by tip exposure was the most significant the distinction in toxicity of trihalophenol dbps might be due to the toxicity of electrophilic dbp to nucleophilic sites and the toxicity of nucleophilic dbp to electrophilic sites yang and zhang 2013 after a 12 week exposure to 200 μg l of tcp tbp and tip there were 682 805 and 1333 degs and 14 8 and 58 saps on the basis of kegg pathway database respectively fig 2b fig s3 table s4 s6 exposure to 0 5 μg l tcp tbp and tip resulted in 1327 833 1001 degs and 34 23 and 41 saps respectively the numbers of degs and saps alone could not fully reflect the toxic effects as some degs might not be important in the related toxicological phenotype pathways so further analysis of the degs functions was required all these saps were mainly involved in five categories including organismal systems environmental information processing metabolism human diseases and cellular processes significantly altered genes with the highest fold changes among all the experimental groups were listed in table s7 including t complex protein tcp11 protocadherin gamma pcdhgc5 glycoprotein gpnmb cytochrome p450 cyp2c40 and carbonyl reductase cbr3 the remarkable changes of these genes indicated the disturbed immune responses impaired antioxidant and detoxification abilities and promoted carcinogenesis of mouse livers after trihalophenol exposure degs shared by different concentrations of each trihalophenol fig 2b were mapped for kegg pathway enrichment respectively fig 2c as shown in fig 2c tbp exposure altered african trypanosomiasis pathway while tip exposure altered tuberculosis and malaria pathway etc moreover the results of enrichment of individual degs for each trihalophenol at 0 5 and 200 μg l fig s4 also showed that the signaling pathways of various infectious diseases were significantly altered after tbp and tip treatment the most disturbed saps and related degs of nine experimental groups were displayed in fig s5 respectively results suggested that several degs participated in immunity functions including lymphocytes activation leukocyte transendothelial migration and primary immunodeficiency indicating that the immunity of liver was disturbed since immunodeficiency may contribute to uncontrolled infection and cancer xie et al 2019 it s no wonder that pathways in infectious diseases and cancers were also significantly altered after trihalophenol exposure 3 3 serum metabolomic profiles after the trihalophenol dbps exposure the nmr data sets of serum metabolomic profiles were normalized and analyzed by pls da as shown in fig 3 a the trihalophenol dbps exposure groups were clearly separated from the control group indicating a disturbance of metabolism of mice serum the dose dependent manner was observed in the serum metabolomic profiles but liver transcriptomics profiles did not show this trend previous research on the cytotoxicity developmental toxicity and growth inhibition of the halogenated dbps all showed an obvious dose dependent manner yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2020 this might be due to the complexity of the in vivo mammalian toxicity which is quite different from the in vitro systems or non mammalian models moreover a total of 30 sams were identified table s8 for the next step biological pathway enrichment analysis of these sams and the sams shared by tcp tbp and tip exposure groups was performed and shown in fig 3b and fig 3c the sams were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism e g valine leucine and isoleucine metabolism carbohydrate metabolism e g glycolysis or gluconeogenesis lipid metabolism e g glycerophospholipid metabolism and citrate cycle tca cycle valine could promote recovery from liver injury and leucine is a branched amino acid involved in liver protein synthesis chang et al 2017 altered valine leucine and isoleucine metabolism pathway after trihalophenol exposure indicated the impaired liver function furthermore the levels of key intermediates within the tca cycle citrate and pyruvate were significantly down regulated after trihalophenol exposure as well as the up regulation of succinate suggesting the perturbed energy metabolism among the 30 sams identified in the exposure groups phosphorylcholine phenylalanine pyruvate trimethylamine n oxide succinate acetate and choline were host gut microbiota co metabolites fernández veledo and vendrell 2019 suggesting possible perturbations in the gut microbiome integration of the transcriptomic and metabolomic data suggested that following a 12 week trihalophenol exposure fig 4 several pathways were affected among them the glutathione metabolism pathway was the most prominently disturbed pathway with both changed metabolites glutathione l glutamate and l glutamine and genes glul gstt1 gstp2 gls ggt1 and ggt5 glutamine is considered as a fuel for the immune system calder and yaqoob 1999 cruzat et al 2018 while glutathione exerts important physiological functions in antioxidation detoxification and immune regulation bansal and simon 2018 thus the results indicated that trihalophenol exposure could induce oxidative stress in liver by perturbing the metabolism of glutathione 3 4 gut microbiome changes induced by trihalophenol dbps chronic inflammation in the submucosa of the intestinal wall leads to an accumulation of the extracellular matrix which causes obstructive symptomatology and thickening of all layers of the intestinal wall suzuki et al 2011 through pathological analyses it was found that 200 μg l tip exposure caused submucosa composed of collagen fibrils in the bowel wall thickening fig 5 a suggesting intestinal chronic inflammation injury induced by tip the dynamics of the microbial community in mice guts during exposure show that firmicutes 20 4 62 8 bacteroidetes 31 6 62 0 and proteobacteria 0 774 17 2 were the dominant populations of mouse gut microbiota fig s6 the disrupted firmicutes bacteroidetes f b ratio indicated the affected host lipid and energy metabolism fig s7 in each sample taxonomic counts were normalized by otus the pls da results showed that the exposure groups were successfully separated from the control group fig s8 as time passed by the parallel samples in the trihalophenol dbps exposure group tended to become more aggregated and the distinction between the exposure groups and the control group was more obvious in addition the function of gut microbiota was investigated by the picrust tool langille et al 2013 as shown in fig s9 there were 30 8 and 9 saps in the 0 5 μg l tcp tbp and tip exposure groups respectively suggesting the effects of intestinal microbiome disturbance on host metabolism inflammatory regulation and cancer development after trihalophenol exposure to further investigate specific bacteria that differed in the exposure group the normalized data was also screened and visualized by heatmap analysis fig 5b results showed that the most predominant family in top priority otus was the porphyromonadaceae and erysipelotrichaceae family the abundance of erysipelotrichaceae and lactobacillaceae in several 2 4 6 trihalophenol exposure groups was much higher than the control group at all time points 4 8 12 weeks gram positive erysipelotrichaceae was considered to be the major genera associated with active tuberculosis as well as chronic inflammatory disease khaliq et al 2021 interestingly tuberculosis pathway also significantly altered in the liver transcriptome which commensurate to that observed in gut microbiome this result suggested that the disorder in the intestinal flora might be related to pathways of infectious diseases in the transcriptome lactobacillaceae are effective at enhancing innate and adaptive immunity tsai et al 2012 the increased abundance of lactobacillaceae indicated their participation in immune regulation 3 5 effects of trihalophenolic dbps on immune cells to further affirm the immunosuppression effects of trihalophenols found in liver transcriptome and serum metabolome primary macrophages isolated from mouse peritoneal cavity were adopted to measure their immunotoxicity macrophages are vital players in immunity with remarkable plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues macrophages can rapidly switch their phenotypes into m1 polarized or m2 polarized status which corresponds to pro inflammatory or anti inflammatory function zanganeh et al 2016 xie et al 2019 it has been widely known that inos is the marker of m1 and arg 1 is a classical hallmark of m2 rath et al 2014 song et al 2017 as shown in fig s10 the expression of arg 1 remarkably increased after the treatment with tbp and tip while the expression of inos was down regulated after trihalophenol dbps exposure these results suggested that tbp and tip could significantly induce m2 polarization which may contribute to the immunosuppression in liver and promote tissue repair sindrilaru et al 2011 this result may explain why similar liver injury and inflammation were observed for all the three trihalophenols the greater tissue repair ability of tip and tbp may partially counteract their higher cytotoxicity than tcp xie et al 2019 liu et al 2021 moreover previous studies have pointed out long term exposure to environmental pollutants leads to immune dysfunction and inflammation such as bisphenol s perfluorooctanoic acid and toxic metal qiu et al 2019 skalny et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the strong immunosuppressive effects of trihalophenols suggested high risks of infection and cancer which mediated the toxicity of trihalophenols 4 conclusions this study first reported effects on mammalian organs after chronic exposure to trihalophenol dbps in drinking water the separation between the trihalophenol dbps exposure group and the control group in the molecular profiles showed that exposure to trihalophenols induced significant alterations in liver transcriptome and serum metabolic profiles as well as perturbed the composition of intestinal microorganisms the trihalophenols all caused immune regulation effects which probably mediated the hepatotoxicity of trihalophenols including the infectious diseases related pathway alteration chronic inflammation and carcinogenicity these results provided new insights into the health risks of trihalophenol dbps exposure via drinking water consumption further studies are required to explore immune mediated
