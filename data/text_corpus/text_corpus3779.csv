18895,the toxicity of contaminants in freshwater ecosystems can increase in combination with environmental stress leading to a potential underestimation of risk in conventional assessments the number of multiple stress experiments in ecotoxicology is growing constantly but pharmaceuticals have mostly been disregarded as an omnipresent pharmaceutical in the water cycle the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine cbz was chosen as test substance for our 28 day binary stress experiments with the non biting midge chironomus riparius elevated population densities food limitation temperature and a reduction of organic matter om were chosen as relevant environmental stressors in five stress intensities they were combined with the 10 lethal concentration lc10 of cbz to investigate the joint effect of stress and cbz exposure we were able to demonstrate that the toxicity of cbz increased with higher larval densities and reduced om mortality of the midges exposed to cbz increased by a factor of 1 69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by a factor of 2 87 at 0 25 om compared to the conventional test protocol while the stressors alone did not reduce survival conventional low stress laboratory tests as conducted for the risk assessment of chemicals would have underestimated the toxicity of cbz even though it is necessary that more than binary stressor combinations are included in future experiments the present results extend our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals such as cbz in stressful environments and emphasize the importance of including pharmaceuticals in multiple stress experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords temperature density feeding pharmaceutical joint hazard 1 introduction in aquatic ecotoxicology the toxicity of xenobiotics for regulatory purposes is commonly assessed in standardized and controlled laboratory experiments e g according to oecd or us epa protocols which facilitates the comparison and validation of toxicity data unlike conditions in the laboratory organisms naturally live in complex habitats and community structures under variable and oftentimes unfavorable environmental conditions this includes the exposure to biotic e g intraspecific competition and abiotic e g temperature environmental stressors by standardizing the ecotoxicological assessment an extrapolation of the test results to environmental conditions became necessary in order to predict safe environmental concentrations of chemicals and reduce the risk of underestimation even though laboratory based effect data are adjusted to these uncertainties by adding a safety factor ec 2003 2011 the discrepancy between the response to xenobiotics under laboratory and field conditions remains unclear to be able to reliably predict the toxicity of contaminants in natural habitats and as a consequence provide more accurate risk assessments we need to understand and predict joint stressor effects similar to mixture toxicity environmental stressors can have additive equal to the sum of the single effects synergistic positive interaction bigger than the sum of the single effects and antagonistic negative interaction smaller than the sum of the single effects effects on the toxicity of contaminants depending on stressor combinations investigated endpoints and level of biological organization crain et al 2008 heugens et al 2001 holmstrup et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 several reviews and data analyses provide comprehensive databases on contaminant stressor interactions but mostly for pesticides and metals heugens et al 2001 holmstrup et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 laskowski et al 2010 liess et al 2016 meanwhile very little is known about changes in the toxicity of pharmaceuticals from laboratory to field conditions even though the interaction with environmental stress can differ from one substance to another holmstrup et al 2010 pharmaceuticals are omnipresent in the water cycle aus der beek et al 2016 but only very few studies have addressed their toxicity in combination with environmental stress martins et al 2013 nieto et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 as one of the most frequently reported pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems luo et al 2014 the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine cbz has been chosen as test substance for the present investigation in a previous study by our group we gained essential information about the toxicity of cbz its behavior in toxicity tests including the adsorption to sediment and its stability in the test system heye et al 2019 as the most sensitive organism in this investigation and a model organism in previous studies in ecology e g ristola et al 1999 and ecotoxicology e g heye et al 2016 the non biting midge chironomus riparius was chosen as test organism for the present stress experiment we focused our study on four biotic and abiotic environmental stressors that have previously been identified as relevant for c riparius population density goedkoop and peterson 2003 food limitation postma et al 1994 reduced organic matter om ristola et al 1999 and temperature müller et al 2012 all four stressors were tested as continuous variables with and without the addition of the 10 lethal concentration lc10 of cbz as determined in our previous experiment heye et al 2019 for a better understanding of the toxicity of contaminants under stressful conditions we aimed to determine i the impact of population density food limitation om and temperature on c riparius and ii a potential increase in cbz toxicity due to a positive interaction between single stressors and cbz exposure we hypothesized that the sensitivity of our test organism to cbz increases with stress 2 material and methods 2 1 test organism and culturing conditions the test organism c riparius originated from an in house culture of the department aquatic ecotoxicology at goethe university frankfurt germany and was kept at 20 2 c and a light dark cycle of 16 8 hours midges were bred in crystallizing dishes ø 190 mm containing quartz sand baumit bad hindelang germany washed and heated to 200 c for 24 hours and reconstituted water m4 medium according to elendt and bias 1990 three times per week the larvae were fed with freshly ground fish food tetramin tetra gmbh melle germany 2 2 stress experiments all four stress experiments were conducted based on the oecd test guideline 219 oecd 2004 a cbz concentration of 400 μg l was chosen based on a previous life cycle experiment where a lc10 of 406 μg l was published using the same test set up as in the current experiments heye et al 2019 the experiments were conducted in 600 ml test beakers kavalier simax prague czech republic 9 cm diameter which contained 118 g of washed and sterilized heated to 200 c for 24 h quartz sand baumit bad hindelang germany and 0 6 g of dried pulverized 0 5 mm autoclaved stinging nettle urtica dioica caelo hilden germany and handpicked alder leaves alnus glutinosa which corresponded to 1 organic matter om the sediment components were mixed and 400 ml of reconstituted water m4 medium was poured onto the sediment in the experiment the midges were either exposed to 400 μg cbz l or to dimethyl sulfoxide dmso cas number 298 46 4 purity 99 sigma aldrich steinheim germany final concentration of 30 μl l as a solvent control in earlier studies this dmso concentration has shown to be without any toxic effects in chironomid larvae heye et al 2019 for each of the stress intensities four replicates with 400 μg l cbz and four with dmso were prepared one additional replicate was set up for chemical analysis in the cbz and dmso treatments each of the test vessels were covered with gauze and aerated for five days for the equilibration of the test substance after five days the experiment was initiated by the addition of 20 first instar larvae 24 hours old aeration was stopped for at least 4 h to enable the larvae to burrow themselves into the sediment test vessels were checked for emerged midges daily which were removed from the test vessels sexed and killed by freezing to 20 c subsequently the midges were dried at 100 c for 48 h to determine their dry weight larvae were fed three times per week with 0 25 mg larva day of tetramin from day 0 to day 8 and day 21 until the end of the experiment in between the food ration was increased to 0 5 mg larva day the whole experiment was conducted at 20 1 c and a light dark cycle of 16 8 h evaporated water was replaced with deionized water the lowest stress intensity of all stress experiments was always based on the general experimental design low stress treatment 20 c 20 larvae vessel 0 5 mg tetramin larva day as maximal food ration 1 om in the four different experiments one of these factors was altered while the other factors were kept constant with and without the addition of cbz 2 2 1 larval density for the density stress experiment the number of introduced organisms was increased from 20 to 40 60 80 and 100 larvae per test vessel this corresponds to around 0 32 0 64 0 95 1 26 and 1 58 larvae cm2 respectively the amount of food was adjusted to the number of larvae 2 2 2 feeding to investigate the effect of food limitation on the toxicity of cbz the maximum food ration was decreased from 0 5 to 0 25 0 125 0 0625 and 0 mg tetramin larva day to investigate whether an increase in food ration decreases toxicity an extra treatment was added with 1 mg larva day 2 2 3 organic matter the original content of om was 1 of stinging nettle 0 6 g and black alder leaves 0 6 g for the stress experiment the om was reduced from 1 to 0 75 0 5 0 25 and 0 of the total sediment 2 2 4 temperature in the temperature experiment larvae were exposed to 20 22 24 26 and 28 c the temperature was recorded every 6 h with a temperature data logger hobo 64k pendant temperature logger onset cape cod ma usa after adding the test organisms the test vessels were transferred immediately into a plastic box 55 x 35 15 cm filled with water heated to the actual test temperature by using an automatic aquarium heater 50 w tetra melle germany 2 3 chemical analysis for the chemical analysis water samples were taken at the time of larval insertion day 0 and at the end of the experiment day 28 the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose syringe filter spartan 30 0 45 rc ge healthcare little chalfont uk and diluted to a concentration of 1 μg cbz l chemical analysis was conducted according to a validated method previously published by hermes et al 2018 in brief cbz analysis was perfomed by lc ms ms using an agilent 1260 series lc system agilent technologies waldbronn germany coupled to a triple quadrupole ms sciex triple quad 6500 which was operated with electrospray ionization esi in the positive ionization mode a detailed description of the method can be found in heye et al 2019 from measured cbz concentrations at the beginning and the end of the experiment time weighted means twm were calculated according to annex 6 of the oecd test guideline 211 oecd 2006 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 data residuals were checked for normality and variance homogeneity by means of the shapiro wilk test and bartlett test respectively α 0 05 in cases in which the hypothesis was rejected data were transformed by a box cox transformation power transformation using the r package mass venables and ripley 2002 a multiple linear regression analysis was chosen to analyze interaction effects between the continuous temperature amount of tetramin om or number of larvae and the categorical cbz cbz independent variable on mortality mean time to emergence emt50 and adult dry weight as dependent variables to do so linear models of decreasing complexity equation 1 a c were compared by means of an f test α 0 05 and a minimal adequate model no statistical difference to the more complex model was identified by excluding all non significant variables 1a y ß0 ß1x1 ß2x2 ß3 x1 x2 interactive effect 1b y ß0 ß1x1 ß2x2 additive effect 1c y ß0 ß1x1 or y ß0 ß2x2 one main effect with y as dependent response variable ß0 as intercept ß1 and ß2 as slopes and x as independent variables stress and cbz exposure for the statistical analysis the stress variables were converted to stress intensities where the value 0 was allocated to the low stress treatment x 0 in chronic toxicity tests with chironomids the food ration refers to the number of larvae initially added to the test system however high mortality rates lead to a decrease of the actual number of larvae in the test vessels and consequently to an increase of the individual food ration to investigate whether this increase in food ration affects the outcome of the stress experiments the results of the standard food ration of 0 5 mg tetramin were compared to a higher food portion of 1 mg tetramin by a t test parametric α 0 05 or mann whitney test non parametric α 0 05 the extra food treatment of 1 mg tetramin larva day was not included in the previously described regression model and was used to gain additional information for the discussion of the test results results can be found in the supplementary information a correlation between twm and stress intensity was investigated by computing pearson correlation coefficients and significance levels for a pearson correlation α 0 05 both factors were considered as independent when no correlation between stress intensity and cbz concentration was present in those cases statistical analyses of the life cycle parameters were conducted without including an alteration in exposure as another variable 3 results to identify interaction effects between larval density food limitation om and temperature with cbz exposure c riparius was exposed to five different stress intensities with and without the addition of the lc10 of cbz 3 1 chemical analyses results of the chemical analyses are given as twm in table 1 in all of the solvent controls cbz concentration was below the limit of quantification 20 ng l the correlation between the stress variables and cbz concentration was not significant in any of the experiments table 1 therefore only cbz exposure but not the concentration itself was included as variable in the further analyses at the end of the experiment water concentrations were similar in all treatments however while there was no gap in the mass balance for the density and feeding experiments only 51 of cbz was detected in a representative measurement at the beginning of the om and temperature study as a result the twms of the latter two experiments were lower 3 2 stress experiment as the dry weight and emt50 of male and female midges gave similar results in most experiments for the sake of clarity only graphs of female midges are presented graphs including male data can be found in the supplementary information data on male and female emt50 had to be box cox transformed p values and adjusted r squares for all experiments and investigated endpoints can be found in table 2 all values mentioned in the text are means standard deviation 3 2 1 larval density without the addition of cbz an increase in larval density from 20 to 100 larvae per vessel had no effect on mortality but affected the developmental time computed as emt50 and dry weight of male and female midges negatively table 2 fig 1 a c e cbz the emt50 of female midges increased from 16 1 0 143 to 18 9 0 255 days from the lowest to the highest larval density fig 1c cbz when elevated larval densities were combined with cbz exposure the emt50 increased and dry weight decreased just as in the single stressor treatment fig 1c e cbz the observed joint effects were additive and no interaction between both variables could be determined table 2 however midges exposed to cbz were heavier compared to their unexposed conspecifics when looking at the two regression lines for mortality table 2 fig 1a an increase from 28 8 12 5 to 47 5 6 81 with increasing larval density could be observed in comparison mortality in the high stress treatment 100 larvae without the addition of cbz stayed at 12 3 6 34 as a consequence a significant difference in slopes could be determined both variables interacted synergistically and resulted in a 1 69 fold higher mortality table 2 3 2 2 feeding a decrease in food ration affected the emt50 and dry weight of female midges significantly while the emt50 of females increased their dry weight decreased from 1 51 0 0752 to 1 14 0 130 mg between 0 5 and 0 mg of tetramin larva day table 2 fig 1d f cbz however despite a box cox transformation the female emt50 did not fulfill the assumption of variance homogeneity the results for this life cycle parameter are potentially biased and difficult to interpret all the other endpoints were not affected when food reduction acted as a single factor table 2 fig 1b d f cbz with the addition of cbz mean mortality increased from 30 0 4 08 to 42 5 10 4 when the food ration was reduced to 0 mg tetramin larva day fig 1b cbz no interaction between both factors was found table 2 the observed effect was additive as the slopes of both regression lines were not significantly different a doubling of the food ration did not affect any of the investigated life cycle parameters neither with nor without the addition of cbz table s2 3 2 3 organic matter a decrease in om alone did not result in an increase in mortality but the emt50 and dry weight of midges were significantly affected table 2 fig 2 a c e cbz midges did not only emerge later but were also lighter the dry weight of female midges decreased from 1 63 0 0238 to 1 16 0 115 mg from 1 to 0 om fig 2e cbz however despite the box cox transformation male dry weight did not fulfill the assumption of variance homogeneity results for this life cycle parameter are potentially biased and difficult to interpret when cbz was added the regression lines for emt50 and dry weight became flatter fig 2e cbz for male and female dry weight this difference in slopes between both treatment groups was significant and revealed a negative interaction between cbz exposure and the reduction of om table 2 a negative effect on dry weight was compensated by the addition of cbz and the midges exposed to cbz were 25 heavier than those not exposed to cbz at low levels of om a similar trend was observed for the emt50 even though it was not significant fig 2c mortality increased with decreasing om from 28 8 18 9 to a maximum of 82 5 6 30 fig 2a cbz as a decrease in the om alone had no effect on mortality the joint effect was synergistic i e the slopes of both regression lines were significantly different table 2 a positive interaction between reduced om and cbz increased the toxicity of cbz the mortality of the midges increased by a factor of 2 87 compared to the cbz exposure at 1 om fig 2a 3 2 4 temperature an increase in temperature from 20 to 28 c had a significant effect on all investigated life cycle parameters table 2 fig 2b d f cbz mortality increased from 15 0 10 8 to 30 0 4 08 fig 2b between the lowest and highest temperatures the emt50 of male and female midges was also affected table 2 midges emerged almost twice as fast at higher temperatures fig 2d cbz while emergence usually begins 15 days after hatching at 20 c emergence at 28 c started at day 9 for female midges this resulted in a decrease of the emt50 from 18 3 2 18 days at 20 c to 11 1 1 01 days at 28 c and 25 lower adult dry weight fig 2f cbz when cbz was added the mortality increased with increasing temperature from 36 3 11 1 to 67 5 19 4 fig 2b cbz this effect was additive and could be explained by the temperature related increase in mortality and its high variability table 2 in contrast to mortality the emt50 and dry weight were not affected by cbz exposure table 2 fig 2e and f cbz the measured test temperatures deviated only slightly from the nominal temperatures with average values of 19 7 0 321 c 22 4 0 183 c 24 2 0 188 c 26 4 0 203 c 28 4 0 202 c 3 2 5 cbz toxicity under low stress levels in each of the four stress experiments there was one treatment with and without the addition of 400 μg cbz l which was the same in all experiments low stress treatment 20 c 20 larvae vessel 0 5 mg tetramin larva day and 1 om we compare the results of all four experiments in the low stress treatment in order to review the reproducibility of results in chironomid tests and compare the deviation around the mean of different life cycle parameters mean values and standard deviation can be found in the supplementary information table s3 the variation was highest for mortality table 3 especially due the great variation in the temperature experiments of 15 0 10 8 table s3 the variation of female and male dry weight was lowest but only slightly higher for the emt50 table 3 even though the toxicity of cbz in the low stress treatment should be similar in all four experiments results were not always consistent table 2 figs 1 and 2 while in three of the four experiments only mortality increased due to the addition of cbz in one experiment all of the investigated life cycle parameters were affected by cbz 4 discussion 4 1 stress response our results demonstrate that larval density and om positively interact with cbz exposure the mortality of midges exposed to cbz increased on average by a factor of 1 69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by 2 87 at 0 25 om as a single factor the stressors did not reduce survival goedkoop and peterson 2003 came to the same result in their larval density experiment in their study larval density interacted positively with lindane toxicity but also increased bioturbation and the transfer of lindane from the sediment to water the water concentrations in the current experiment did not correlate with increasing larval density and therefore cannot explain the observed increase in toxicity until now most studies suggested density effects in chironomids to be a result of food limitation péry et al 2002 postma et al 1994 this is also the reason why most studies did not focus on density effects itself but incorporated food limitation by not adjusting the food ration to the increase in larval density hooper et al 2003a 2005 postma et al 1994 rasmussen 1985 even though we did not see any adverse effects on survival all the other life cycle parameters were negatively affected by an increase in larval density despite the food adjustment density regulation may play an important role in this observation a number of 5000 eggs m2 has been described as the maximum density for chironomids above this density very little increase in the number of developed larvae occurs mclachlan 1977 sediment tubes of chironomid larvae keep a minimum distance between each other described as feeding territory this space may either be kept by physical or chemical signals and it regulates the density of larvae in the sediment not only food but also space for shelter can be a limited resource mclachlan 1977 one of the costs of territoriality is the time and energy spent defending a territory which increases with food limitation and competitor density hart 1987 the described maximum density observed by mclachlan 1977 is similar to the 40 larvae per vessel treatment in the current experiment this could potentially explain the slower development and lower weight of larvae in the present study which has also been observed for chironomids by goedkoop and peterson 2003 and forbes and cold 2005 does the energy demand increase under stress less energy is available for reproduction development and growth but also to cope with additional stressors calow 1991 koehn and bayne 1989 kooijman and metz 1984 sokolova et al 2012 moreover an increase in developmental time may affect populations of c riparius by the raised chance of predation due to the prolonged aquatic life phase and a reduced number of offspring generations per year in addition reduced female dry weight as we observed it in all of our stress experiments affects reproduction success and as a result midges at the population level hooper et al 2003b sibley et al 2001 eggs ropes that are produced by light females do not only have lower fertility rates but they are also smaller than those of heavier female midges hooper et al 2003b sibley et al 2001 similar results were published for food limitation and temperature goedkoop and peterson 2003 müller et al 2012 postma et al 1994 sibley et al 1997 in previous studies the simultaneous investigation of female dry weight and reproduction seldom led to reliable results many studies have reported a high variability of female dry weight which might be due to the fact that the oviposition of eggs reduces the weight of females vogt et al 2007a we demonstrated that dry weight can be a very reliable parameter adult dry weight had the lowest variability of all our investigated endpoints when midges were killed and dried directly after the emergence in the larval density experiment we observed that the dry weight of female and male midges exposed to cbz was higher than that of their unexposed conspecifics cbz is not known to increase or decrease the dry weight of midges heye et al 2019 and observations in the density experiment could not be reproduced in the other three stress experiments higher food availability per larvae due to an increased mortality rate cannot explain the observation as we did not see any positive effect of an increased food ration on weight in a parallel experiment a food ration of 0 5 mg seemed to be ad libitum péry et al 2002 came to a similar conclusion when they found no difference in emergence time or reproduction between 0 5 and 1 4 mg of tetramin larva day results were also confirmed in an unpublished pre experiment even though we added one additional food treatment to rule out an impact of increased food availability on the results the actual feeding experiment was focused on the impact of food limitation food limitation as a single factor is known to increase developmental time and mortality to reduce the production of eggs life span of imagines dry weight and population growth rate and to affect the offspring of chironomids ankley et al 1993 hooper et al 2003a péry et al 2002 postma et al 1994 earlier studies even demonstrated that a limitation in food can increase the sensitivity of organisms to toxicants by affecting their physiological state metabolic rate and their ability to cope with chemical stressors heugens et al 2001 2006 nevertheless in the current experiment no synergistic effect between the amount of tetramin and cbz exposure was observed tetramin limitation did affect the emergence time and dry weight of female midges but not cbz toxicity however in addition to tetramin stinging nettle and black alder leaves were added to the test vessels both have already successfully been used as an adequate food source in experiments with c riparius jungmann et al 2009 oetken et al 2005 which may explain the lower sensitivity to the joint effect of both stressors plant material is known to have higher carbohydrate content but lower lipid nitrogen and phosphorus content compared to industrial fish food adhikari et al 2016 taylor 2009 vos et al 2000 while carbohydrates are an important energy source nutrients are essential for the production of new tissue and growth vos et al 2000 midges do survive in natural sediments without additional feeding if there is enough om to feed on ristola et al 1999 as demonstrated by the present results larvae survived but developed slower and less in size when om was the sole food source this observation is confirmed by egeler et al 2010 and vos et al 2000 who have detected higher developmental rates and smaller organisms when larvae were fed with plant material compared to tetramin in a study with increasing food quality and quantity goedkoop et al 2007 demonstrated that size was affected by food quality and quantity while emergence and developmental time was only a matter of quantity results from the current om and feeding experiment support the theory of goedkoop et al 2007 that survival only depends on food quantity regardless of the quality adverse effects on survival by the limitation of one of the two food sources were compensated by the other similar to tetramin limitation a decrease in om resulted in delayed time to emergence and lower weight despite the constant feeding with tetramin but it did not decrease survival however effects in the latter experiment were more severe and not only female but also male midges were affected compared to the feeding experiment with tetramin when we compared the life history traits of midges kept without tetramin but 1 om with those constantly fed with tetramin but without om in the same experiment females emerged earlier in the first group and males weighted more than those in the second group unpublished results the major part of energy under stressful conditions is used for maintenance which leaves less energy for development growth and reproduction koehn and bayne 1989 sokolova et al 2012 in contrast to the previous statements on food quality one could conclude prematurely that stinging nettle and black alder leaves are similar or even more essential as food sources compared to tetramin this could also explain the similar effects in the density experiment om as food source in the sediment was not adjusted to the increasing larval densities however without any information about the ad libitum om content and tetramin as only food source we cannot draw a final conclusion whether emergence time and weight are affected by food quality and or quantity to overcome these limitations the next steps should be to identify the ad libitum food portion of tetramin and om when added as a sole food source and subsequently repeat the experiments including ad libitum feeding whether the increase in cbz toxicity in the om experiment is due to a limitation of food is difficult to conclude as an increase in toxicity was only detected in the om but not in the feeding experiment with tetramin down to 0 25 om the water concentration of cbz stayed constant and therefore cannot explain the increase in mortality the observed compensation of negative effects on weight negative interaction and in tendencies on emergence time could however be a result of the selection on life history traits e g weight developmental time due to increased mortality under cbz exposure acting as a single factor elevated temperatures resulted in faster emergence and lower weight of midges midges grew and developed faster but they could not compensate for the shortened feeding time as a result smaller egg ropes lower fertility but higher population growth rates have been reported maier et al 1990 müller et al 2012 oetken et al 2009 vogt et al 2007b in combination with chemical exposure elevated temperatures can increase the toxicity of chemicals heugens et al 2001 including cbz nieto et al 2016 a higher solubility and therefore bioavailability of chemicals an impact on the toxicokinetic of a substance like increased uptake harwood et al 2009 fisher and wadleigh 1985 and adverse effects on the organism itself like the induction of oxidative stress park and kwak 2014 can be a result of elevated temperatures contrary to our expectations in the current experiment with cbz toxicity did not increase with temperature stress an increase in toxicity is predicted when temperature and toxicant act on similar targets harwood et al 2009 or metabolic processes such as energy metabolism or respiration heugens et al 2001 until now the mode of action of cbz in c riparius is still unknown heye et al 2016 but late developmental stages seem to be most affected heye et al 2019 a central role in late development plays the ecdysone receptor which is crucial for molting and pupation riddiford and truman 1993 the receptor s genes are not only activated by ecdysone but also at high temperatures park and kwak 2014 cbz on the other hand is hypothesized to inhibit the ecdysone receptor oetken et al 2005 but this could not be confirmed in a molecular dynamics simulation heye et al 2016 also the induction of biotransformation by cbz as observed in crustaceans cnidarians and fish valdés et al 2016 vernouillet et al 2010 can compensate for toxicity the increase in metabolic rates at elevated temperatures does not only increase uptake but also the elimination and detoxification of a substance harwood et al 2009 the predominance of one of the factors is substance and organism specific as already demonstrated by harwood et al 2009 this does however mean that the joint effect between xenobiotics and temperature cannot be generalized 4 2 implications for hazard assessment we demonstrated that environmental stress increases the sensitivity of c riparius to cbz exposure in binary combinations while in previous investigations 400 μg l has been set as no observed effect concentration noec for cbz heye et al 2019 the same concentration in the present stress experiment resulted in 82 5 mortality when only a single parameter om was altered although in the present case study with cbz test concentrations are higher than environmental concentrations of around 0 2 μg l aus der beek et al 2016 minguez et al 2014 these results illustrate that a slight change in test conditions can change the estimation of the environmental hazard of a contaminant considerably the risk of underestimating toxic effects in freshwater ecosystems is reinforced by the fact that the sensitivity of midges to low levels of cbz lc10 increased at stress intensities that did not induce mortality themselves the present observations refer to laboratory conditions and low level binary stress combinations in freshwater ecosystems organisms are exposed to environmental stressors such as those included in the present study but in combination with a variety of other chemical and non chemical stressors if organisms are exposed to higher levels of stress this will likely lead to a further increase in their susceptibility to cbz and other contaminants enhanced stress intensities have previously been predicted to increase the sensitivity to a chemical stressor by up to a factor of 100 liess et al 2016 which challenges the environmental risk assessment of chemicals in its present form at the moment assessment factors between 10 and 100 are applied to chronic standardized toxicity data to extrapolate from laboratory to field conditions and predict the environmental hazard and risk of contaminants in the environment ec 2003 2011 these factors could easily be exceeded when organisms are exposed to chemical and non chemical stressors as illustrated by the present results and the stress addition model by liess et al 2016 they may be sufficient to cover the difference in the sensitivity of midges between a laboratory experiment with and without the addition of a second stressor but they also need to cover the toxicity of contaminants under realistic field conditions and more than binary stressor combinations moreover the present results demonstrate that not all stressor combinations can be predicted by the addition of single stressor effects whether additive synergistic or antagonistic interactions are more prevalent in freshwater ecosystems is still under debate jackson et al 2016 concluded that interactions are mostly antagonistic while holmstrup et al 2010 found synergistic interaction in 50 of their reviewed studies environmental stressors in the present investigation interacted additively synergistically and antagonistically depending on the stressor and the investigated endpoint and they were difficult to predict without understanding their mechanistic action in addition the present results were not always in accordance with previous findings for other chemicals and organisms the experience of stress and consequently the sensitivity to toxicants in natural settings also depends on the species stress tolerance and its ecological niche sokolova et al 2012 van straalen 2003 which supports a more stress ecological focus in ecotoxicology for a reliable extrapolation from the laboratory to the field in order to predict the toxicity of contaminants in the environment not only the exposure to chemicals but also the response of organisms to natural stressors needs to be understood the present study contributes to this understanding by providing essential information on the stress response of c riparius to biotic and abiotic natural stressors with and without the addition of cbz as a representative contaminant 5 conclusion the present results increase our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals like cbz in the environment we demonstrated that the toxicity of cbz increases with environmental stress which gives reason for concern about an underestimation of hazard when laboratory test results are used to predict the toxicity of contaminants in the environment sufficient knowledge about the toxicity of chemicals in the field can only be achieved by understanding the interaction of species communities with their environment however to do so mechanistic knowledge about chemical and non chemical stressors is essential also in order to predict their interaction interactive effects depend on stressor combinations which validates the need to investigate additional groups of contaminants and stressors in more than binary combinations upcoming publications within the niddaman project will include a multiple stress artificial indoor stream experiment to investigate the toxicity of cbz in a more complex

18895,the toxicity of contaminants in freshwater ecosystems can increase in combination with environmental stress leading to a potential underestimation of risk in conventional assessments the number of multiple stress experiments in ecotoxicology is growing constantly but pharmaceuticals have mostly been disregarded as an omnipresent pharmaceutical in the water cycle the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine cbz was chosen as test substance for our 28 day binary stress experiments with the non biting midge chironomus riparius elevated population densities food limitation temperature and a reduction of organic matter om were chosen as relevant environmental stressors in five stress intensities they were combined with the 10 lethal concentration lc10 of cbz to investigate the joint effect of stress and cbz exposure we were able to demonstrate that the toxicity of cbz increased with higher larval densities and reduced om mortality of the midges exposed to cbz increased by a factor of 1 69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by a factor of 2 87 at 0 25 om compared to the conventional test protocol while the stressors alone did not reduce survival conventional low stress laboratory tests as conducted for the risk assessment of chemicals would have underestimated the toxicity of cbz even though it is necessary that more than binary stressor combinations are included in future experiments the present results extend our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals such as cbz in stressful environments and emphasize the importance of including pharmaceuticals in multiple stress experiments graphical abstract image 1 keywords temperature density feeding pharmaceutical joint hazard 1 introduction in aquatic ecotoxicology the toxicity of xenobiotics for regulatory purposes is commonly assessed in standardized and controlled laboratory experiments e g according to oecd or us epa protocols which facilitates the comparison and validation of toxicity data unlike conditions in the laboratory organisms naturally live in complex habitats and community structures under variable and oftentimes unfavorable environmental conditions this includes the exposure to biotic e g intraspecific competition and abiotic e g temperature environmental stressors by standardizing the ecotoxicological assessment an extrapolation of the test results to environmental conditions became necessary in order to predict safe environmental concentrations of chemicals and reduce the risk of underestimation even though laboratory based effect data are adjusted to these uncertainties by adding a safety factor ec 2003 2011 the discrepancy between the response to xenobiotics under laboratory and field conditions remains unclear to be able to reliably predict the toxicity of contaminants in natural habitats and as a consequence provide more accurate risk assessments we need to understand and predict joint stressor effects similar to mixture toxicity environmental stressors can have additive equal to the sum of the single effects synergistic positive interaction bigger than the sum of the single effects and antagonistic negative interaction smaller than the sum of the single effects effects on the toxicity of contaminants depending on stressor combinations investigated endpoints and level of biological organization crain et al 2008 heugens et al 2001 holmstrup et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 several reviews and data analyses provide comprehensive databases on contaminant stressor interactions but mostly for pesticides and metals heugens et al 2001 holmstrup et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 laskowski et al 2010 liess et al 2016 meanwhile very little is known about changes in the toxicity of pharmaceuticals from laboratory to field conditions even though the interaction with environmental stress can differ from one substance to another holmstrup et al 2010 pharmaceuticals are omnipresent in the water cycle aus der beek et al 2016 but only very few studies have addressed their toxicity in combination with environmental stress martins et al 2013 nieto et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2014 as one of the most frequently reported pharmaceuticals in freshwater ecosystems luo et al 2014 the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine cbz has been chosen as test substance for the present investigation in a previous study by our group we gained essential information about the toxicity of cbz its behavior in toxicity tests including the adsorption to sediment and its stability in the test system heye et al 2019 as the most sensitive organism in this investigation and a model organism in previous studies in ecology e g ristola et al 1999 and ecotoxicology e g heye et al 2016 the non biting midge chironomus riparius was chosen as test organism for the present stress experiment we focused our study on four biotic and abiotic environmental stressors that have previously been identified as relevant for c riparius population density goedkoop and peterson 2003 food limitation postma et al 1994 reduced organic matter om ristola et al 1999 and temperature müller et al 2012 all four stressors were tested as continuous variables with and without the addition of the 10 lethal concentration lc10 of cbz as determined in our previous experiment heye et al 2019 for a better understanding of the toxicity of contaminants under stressful conditions we aimed to determine i the impact of population density food limitation om and temperature on c riparius and ii a potential increase in cbz toxicity due to a positive interaction between single stressors and cbz exposure we hypothesized that the sensitivity of our test organism to cbz increases with stress 2 material and methods 2 1 test organism and culturing conditions the test organism c riparius originated from an in house culture of the department aquatic ecotoxicology at goethe university frankfurt germany and was kept at 20 2 c and a light dark cycle of 16 8 hours midges were bred in crystallizing dishes ø 190 mm containing quartz sand baumit bad hindelang germany washed and heated to 200 c for 24 hours and reconstituted water m4 medium according to elendt and bias 1990 three times per week the larvae were fed with freshly ground fish food tetramin tetra gmbh melle germany 2 2 stress experiments all four stress experiments were conducted based on the oecd test guideline 219 oecd 2004 a cbz concentration of 400 μg l was chosen based on a previous life cycle experiment where a lc10 of 406 μg l was published using the same test set up as in the current experiments heye et al 2019 the experiments were conducted in 600 ml test beakers kavalier simax prague czech republic 9 cm diameter which contained 118 g of washed and sterilized heated to 200 c for 24 h quartz sand baumit bad hindelang germany and 0 6 g of dried pulverized 0 5 mm autoclaved stinging nettle urtica dioica caelo hilden germany and handpicked alder leaves alnus glutinosa which corresponded to 1 organic matter om the sediment components were mixed and 400 ml of reconstituted water m4 medium was poured onto the sediment in the experiment the midges were either exposed to 400 μg cbz l or to dimethyl sulfoxide dmso cas number 298 46 4 purity 99 sigma aldrich steinheim germany final concentration of 30 μl l as a solvent control in earlier studies this dmso concentration has shown to be without any toxic effects in chironomid larvae heye et al 2019 for each of the stress intensities four replicates with 400 μg l cbz and four with dmso were prepared one additional replicate was set up for chemical analysis in the cbz and dmso treatments each of the test vessels were covered with gauze and aerated for five days for the equilibration of the test substance after five days the experiment was initiated by the addition of 20 first instar larvae 24 hours old aeration was stopped for at least 4 h to enable the larvae to burrow themselves into the sediment test vessels were checked for emerged midges daily which were removed from the test vessels sexed and killed by freezing to 20 c subsequently the midges were dried at 100 c for 48 h to determine their dry weight larvae were fed three times per week with 0 25 mg larva day of tetramin from day 0 to day 8 and day 21 until the end of the experiment in between the food ration was increased to 0 5 mg larva day the whole experiment was conducted at 20 1 c and a light dark cycle of 16 8 h evaporated water was replaced with deionized water the lowest stress intensity of all stress experiments was always based on the general experimental design low stress treatment 20 c 20 larvae vessel 0 5 mg tetramin larva day as maximal food ration 1 om in the four different experiments one of these factors was altered while the other factors were kept constant with and without the addition of cbz 2 2 1 larval density for the density stress experiment the number of introduced organisms was increased from 20 to 40 60 80 and 100 larvae per test vessel this corresponds to around 0 32 0 64 0 95 1 26 and 1 58 larvae cm2 respectively the amount of food was adjusted to the number of larvae 2 2 2 feeding to investigate the effect of food limitation on the toxicity of cbz the maximum food ration was decreased from 0 5 to 0 25 0 125 0 0625 and 0 mg tetramin larva day to investigate whether an increase in food ration decreases toxicity an extra treatment was added with 1 mg larva day 2 2 3 organic matter the original content of om was 1 of stinging nettle 0 6 g and black alder leaves 0 6 g for the stress experiment the om was reduced from 1 to 0 75 0 5 0 25 and 0 of the total sediment 2 2 4 temperature in the temperature experiment larvae were exposed to 20 22 24 26 and 28 c the temperature was recorded every 6 h with a temperature data logger hobo 64k pendant temperature logger onset cape cod ma usa after adding the test organisms the test vessels were transferred immediately into a plastic box 55 x 35 15 cm filled with water heated to the actual test temperature by using an automatic aquarium heater 50 w tetra melle germany 2 3 chemical analysis for the chemical analysis water samples were taken at the time of larval insertion day 0 and at the end of the experiment day 28 the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose syringe filter spartan 30 0 45 rc ge healthcare little chalfont uk and diluted to a concentration of 1 μg cbz l chemical analysis was conducted according to a validated method previously published by hermes et al 2018 in brief cbz analysis was perfomed by lc ms ms using an agilent 1260 series lc system agilent technologies waldbronn germany coupled to a triple quadrupole ms sciex triple quad 6500 which was operated with electrospray ionization esi in the positive ionization mode a detailed description of the method can be found in heye et al 2019 from measured cbz concentrations at the beginning and the end of the experiment time weighted means twm were calculated according to annex 6 of the oecd test guideline 211 oecd 2006 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 data residuals were checked for normality and variance homogeneity by means of the shapiro wilk test and bartlett test respectively α 0 05 in cases in which the hypothesis was rejected data were transformed by a box cox transformation power transformation using the r package mass venables and ripley 2002 a multiple linear regression analysis was chosen to analyze interaction effects between the continuous temperature amount of tetramin om or number of larvae and the categorical cbz cbz independent variable on mortality mean time to emergence emt50 and adult dry weight as dependent variables to do so linear models of decreasing complexity equation 1 a c were compared by means of an f test α 0 05 and a minimal adequate model no statistical difference to the more complex model was identified by excluding all non significant variables 1a y ß0 ß1x1 ß2x2 ß3 x1 x2 interactive effect 1b y ß0 ß1x1 ß2x2 additive effect 1c y ß0 ß1x1 or y ß0 ß2x2 one main effect with y as dependent response variable ß0 as intercept ß1 and ß2 as slopes and x as independent variables stress and cbz exposure for the statistical analysis the stress variables were converted to stress intensities where the value 0 was allocated to the low stress treatment x 0 in chronic toxicity tests with chironomids the food ration refers to the number of larvae initially added to the test system however high mortality rates lead to a decrease of the actual number of larvae in the test vessels and consequently to an increase of the individual food ration to investigate whether this increase in food ration affects the outcome of the stress experiments the results of the standard food ration of 0 5 mg tetramin were compared to a higher food portion of 1 mg tetramin by a t test parametric α 0 05 or mann whitney test non parametric α 0 05 the extra food treatment of 1 mg tetramin larva day was not included in the previously described regression model and was used to gain additional information for the discussion of the test results results can be found in the supplementary information a correlation between twm and stress intensity was investigated by computing pearson correlation coefficients and significance levels for a pearson correlation α 0 05 both factors were considered as independent when no correlation between stress intensity and cbz concentration was present in those cases statistical analyses of the life cycle parameters were conducted without including an alteration in exposure as another variable 3 results to identify interaction effects between larval density food limitation om and temperature with cbz exposure c riparius was exposed to five different stress intensities with and without the addition of the lc10 of cbz 3 1 chemical analyses results of the chemical analyses are given as twm in table 1 in all of the solvent controls cbz concentration was below the limit of quantification 20 ng l the correlation between the stress variables and cbz concentration was not significant in any of the experiments table 1 therefore only cbz exposure but not the concentration itself was included as variable in the further analyses at the end of the experiment water concentrations were similar in all treatments however while there was no gap in the mass balance for the density and feeding experiments only 51 of cbz was detected in a representative measurement at the beginning of the om and temperature study as a result the twms of the latter two experiments were lower 3 2 stress experiment as the dry weight and emt50 of male and female midges gave similar results in most experiments for the sake of clarity only graphs of female midges are presented graphs including male data can be found in the supplementary information data on male and female emt50 had to be box cox transformed p values and adjusted r squares for all experiments and investigated endpoints can be found in table 2 all values mentioned in the text are means standard deviation 3 2 1 larval density without the addition of cbz an increase in larval density from 20 to 100 larvae per vessel had no effect on mortality but affected the developmental time computed as emt50 and dry weight of male and female midges negatively table 2 fig 1 a c e cbz the emt50 of female midges increased from 16 1 0 143 to 18 9 0 255 days from the lowest to the highest larval density fig 1c cbz when elevated larval densities were combined with cbz exposure the emt50 increased and dry weight decreased just as in the single stressor treatment fig 1c e cbz the observed joint effects were additive and no interaction between both variables could be determined table 2 however midges exposed to cbz were heavier compared to their unexposed conspecifics when looking at the two regression lines for mortality table 2 fig 1a an increase from 28 8 12 5 to 47 5 6 81 with increasing larval density could be observed in comparison mortality in the high stress treatment 100 larvae without the addition of cbz stayed at 12 3 6 34 as a consequence a significant difference in slopes could be determined both variables interacted synergistically and resulted in a 1 69 fold higher mortality table 2 3 2 2 feeding a decrease in food ration affected the emt50 and dry weight of female midges significantly while the emt50 of females increased their dry weight decreased from 1 51 0 0752 to 1 14 0 130 mg between 0 5 and 0 mg of tetramin larva day table 2 fig 1d f cbz however despite a box cox transformation the female emt50 did not fulfill the assumption of variance homogeneity the results for this life cycle parameter are potentially biased and difficult to interpret all the other endpoints were not affected when food reduction acted as a single factor table 2 fig 1b d f cbz with the addition of cbz mean mortality increased from 30 0 4 08 to 42 5 10 4 when the food ration was reduced to 0 mg tetramin larva day fig 1b cbz no interaction between both factors was found table 2 the observed effect was additive as the slopes of both regression lines were not significantly different a doubling of the food ration did not affect any of the investigated life cycle parameters neither with nor without the addition of cbz table s2 3 2 3 organic matter a decrease in om alone did not result in an increase in mortality but the emt50 and dry weight of midges were significantly affected table 2 fig 2 a c e cbz midges did not only emerge later but were also lighter the dry weight of female midges decreased from 1 63 0 0238 to 1 16 0 115 mg from 1 to 0 om fig 2e cbz however despite the box cox transformation male dry weight did not fulfill the assumption of variance homogeneity results for this life cycle parameter are potentially biased and difficult to interpret when cbz was added the regression lines for emt50 and dry weight became flatter fig 2e cbz for male and female dry weight this difference in slopes between both treatment groups was significant and revealed a negative interaction between cbz exposure and the reduction of om table 2 a negative effect on dry weight was compensated by the addition of cbz and the midges exposed to cbz were 25 heavier than those not exposed to cbz at low levels of om a similar trend was observed for the emt50 even though it was not significant fig 2c mortality increased with decreasing om from 28 8 18 9 to a maximum of 82 5 6 30 fig 2a cbz as a decrease in the om alone had no effect on mortality the joint effect was synergistic i e the slopes of both regression lines were significantly different table 2 a positive interaction between reduced om and cbz increased the toxicity of cbz the mortality of the midges increased by a factor of 2 87 compared to the cbz exposure at 1 om fig 2a 3 2 4 temperature an increase in temperature from 20 to 28 c had a significant effect on all investigated life cycle parameters table 2 fig 2b d f cbz mortality increased from 15 0 10 8 to 30 0 4 08 fig 2b between the lowest and highest temperatures the emt50 of male and female midges was also affected table 2 midges emerged almost twice as fast at higher temperatures fig 2d cbz while emergence usually begins 15 days after hatching at 20 c emergence at 28 c started at day 9 for female midges this resulted in a decrease of the emt50 from 18 3 2 18 days at 20 c to 11 1 1 01 days at 28 c and 25 lower adult dry weight fig 2f cbz when cbz was added the mortality increased with increasing temperature from 36 3 11 1 to 67 5 19 4 fig 2b cbz this effect was additive and could be explained by the temperature related increase in mortality and its high variability table 2 in contrast to mortality the emt50 and dry weight were not affected by cbz exposure table 2 fig 2e and f cbz the measured test temperatures deviated only slightly from the nominal temperatures with average values of 19 7 0 321 c 22 4 0 183 c 24 2 0 188 c 26 4 0 203 c 28 4 0 202 c 3 2 5 cbz toxicity under low stress levels in each of the four stress experiments there was one treatment with and without the addition of 400 μg cbz l which was the same in all experiments low stress treatment 20 c 20 larvae vessel 0 5 mg tetramin larva day and 1 om we compare the results of all four experiments in the low stress treatment in order to review the reproducibility of results in chironomid tests and compare the deviation around the mean of different life cycle parameters mean values and standard deviation can be found in the supplementary information table s3 the variation was highest for mortality table 3 especially due the great variation in the temperature experiments of 15 0 10 8 table s3 the variation of female and male dry weight was lowest but only slightly higher for the emt50 table 3 even though the toxicity of cbz in the low stress treatment should be similar in all four experiments results were not always consistent table 2 figs 1 and 2 while in three of the four experiments only mortality increased due to the addition of cbz in one experiment all of the investigated life cycle parameters were affected by cbz 4 discussion 4 1 stress response our results demonstrate that larval density and om positively interact with cbz exposure the mortality of midges exposed to cbz increased on average by a factor of 1 69 with 100 larvae per vessel and by 2 87 at 0 25 om as a single factor the stressors did not reduce survival goedkoop and peterson 2003 came to the same result in their larval density experiment in their study larval density interacted positively with lindane toxicity but also increased bioturbation and the transfer of lindane from the sediment to water the water concentrations in the current experiment did not correlate with increasing larval density and therefore cannot explain the observed increase in toxicity until now most studies suggested density effects in chironomids to be a result of food limitation péry et al 2002 postma et al 1994 this is also the reason why most studies did not focus on density effects itself but incorporated food limitation by not adjusting the food ration to the increase in larval density hooper et al 2003a 2005 postma et al 1994 rasmussen 1985 even though we did not see any adverse effects on survival all the other life cycle parameters were negatively affected by an increase in larval density despite the food adjustment density regulation may play an important role in this observation a number of 5000 eggs m2 has been described as the maximum density for chironomids above this density very little increase in the number of developed larvae occurs mclachlan 1977 sediment tubes of chironomid larvae keep a minimum distance between each other described as feeding territory this space may either be kept by physical or chemical signals and it regulates the density of larvae in the sediment not only food but also space for shelter can be a limited resource mclachlan 1977 one of the costs of territoriality is the time and energy spent defending a territory which increases with food limitation and competitor density hart 1987 the described maximum density observed by mclachlan 1977 is similar to the 40 larvae per vessel treatment in the current experiment this could potentially explain the slower development and lower weight of larvae in the present study which has also been observed for chironomids by goedkoop and peterson 2003 and forbes and cold 2005 does the energy demand increase under stress less energy is available for reproduction development and growth but also to cope with additional stressors calow 1991 koehn and bayne 1989 kooijman and metz 1984 sokolova et al 2012 moreover an increase in developmental time may affect populations of c riparius by the raised chance of predation due to the prolonged aquatic life phase and a reduced number of offspring generations per year in addition reduced female dry weight as we observed it in all of our stress experiments affects reproduction success and as a result midges at the population level hooper et al 2003b sibley et al 2001 eggs ropes that are produced by light females do not only have lower fertility rates but they are also smaller than those of heavier female midges hooper et al 2003b sibley et al 2001 similar results were published for food limitation and temperature goedkoop and peterson 2003 müller et al 2012 postma et al 1994 sibley et al 1997 in previous studies the simultaneous investigation of female dry weight and reproduction seldom led to reliable results many studies have reported a high variability of female dry weight which might be due to the fact that the oviposition of eggs reduces the weight of females vogt et al 2007a we demonstrated that dry weight can be a very reliable parameter adult dry weight had the lowest variability of all our investigated endpoints when midges were killed and dried directly after the emergence in the larval density experiment we observed that the dry weight of female and male midges exposed to cbz was higher than that of their unexposed conspecifics cbz is not known to increase or decrease the dry weight of midges heye et al 2019 and observations in the density experiment could not be reproduced in the other three stress experiments higher food availability per larvae due to an increased mortality rate cannot explain the observation as we did not see any positive effect of an increased food ration on weight in a parallel experiment a food ration of 0 5 mg seemed to be ad libitum péry et al 2002 came to a similar conclusion when they found no difference in emergence time or reproduction between 0 5 and 1 4 mg of tetramin larva day results were also confirmed in an unpublished pre experiment even though we added one additional food treatment to rule out an impact of increased food availability on the results the actual feeding experiment was focused on the impact of food limitation food limitation as a single factor is known to increase developmental time and mortality to reduce the production of eggs life span of imagines dry weight and population growth rate and to affect the offspring of chironomids ankley et al 1993 hooper et al 2003a péry et al 2002 postma et al 1994 earlier studies even demonstrated that a limitation in food can increase the sensitivity of organisms to toxicants by affecting their physiological state metabolic rate and their ability to cope with chemical stressors heugens et al 2001 2006 nevertheless in the current experiment no synergistic effect between the amount of tetramin and cbz exposure was observed tetramin limitation did affect the emergence time and dry weight of female midges but not cbz toxicity however in addition to tetramin stinging nettle and black alder leaves were added to the test vessels both have already successfully been used as an adequate food source in experiments with c riparius jungmann et al 2009 oetken et al 2005 which may explain the lower sensitivity to the joint effect of both stressors plant material is known to have higher carbohydrate content but lower lipid nitrogen and phosphorus content compared to industrial fish food adhikari et al 2016 taylor 2009 vos et al 2000 while carbohydrates are an important energy source nutrients are essential for the production of new tissue and growth vos et al 2000 midges do survive in natural sediments without additional feeding if there is enough om to feed on ristola et al 1999 as demonstrated by the present results larvae survived but developed slower and less in size when om was the sole food source this observation is confirmed by egeler et al 2010 and vos et al 2000 who have detected higher developmental rates and smaller organisms when larvae were fed with plant material compared to tetramin in a study with increasing food quality and quantity goedkoop et al 2007 demonstrated that size was affected by food quality and quantity while emergence and developmental time was only a matter of quantity results from the current om and feeding experiment support the theory of goedkoop et al 2007 that survival only depends on food quantity regardless of the quality adverse effects on survival by the limitation of one of the two food sources were compensated by the other similar to tetramin limitation a decrease in om resulted in delayed time to emergence and lower weight despite the constant feeding with tetramin but it did not decrease survival however effects in the latter experiment were more severe and not only female but also male midges were affected compared to the feeding experiment with tetramin when we compared the life history traits of midges kept without tetramin but 1 om with those constantly fed with tetramin but without om in the same experiment females emerged earlier in the first group and males weighted more than those in the second group unpublished results the major part of energy under stressful conditions is used for maintenance which leaves less energy for development growth and reproduction koehn and bayne 1989 sokolova et al 2012 in contrast to the previous statements on food quality one could conclude prematurely that stinging nettle and black alder leaves are similar or even more essential as food sources compared to tetramin this could also explain the similar effects in the density experiment om as food source in the sediment was not adjusted to the increasing larval densities however without any information about the ad libitum om content and tetramin as only food source we cannot draw a final conclusion whether emergence time and weight are affected by food quality and or quantity to overcome these limitations the next steps should be to identify the ad libitum food portion of tetramin and om when added as a sole food source and subsequently repeat the experiments including ad libitum feeding whether the increase in cbz toxicity in the om experiment is due to a limitation of food is difficult to conclude as an increase in toxicity was only detected in the om but not in the feeding experiment with tetramin down to 0 25 om the water concentration of cbz stayed constant and therefore cannot explain the increase in mortality the observed compensation of negative effects on weight negative interaction and in tendencies on emergence time could however be a result of the selection on life history traits e g weight developmental time due to increased mortality under cbz exposure acting as a single factor elevated temperatures resulted in faster emergence and lower weight of midges midges grew and developed faster but they could not compensate for the shortened feeding time as a result smaller egg ropes lower fertility but higher population growth rates have been reported maier et al 1990 müller et al 2012 oetken et al 2009 vogt et al 2007b in combination with chemical exposure elevated temperatures can increase the toxicity of chemicals heugens et al 2001 including cbz nieto et al 2016 a higher solubility and therefore bioavailability of chemicals an impact on the toxicokinetic of a substance like increased uptake harwood et al 2009 fisher and wadleigh 1985 and adverse effects on the organism itself like the induction of oxidative stress park and kwak 2014 can be a result of elevated temperatures contrary to our expectations in the current experiment with cbz toxicity did not increase with temperature stress an increase in toxicity is predicted when temperature and toxicant act on similar targets harwood et al 2009 or metabolic processes such as energy metabolism or respiration heugens et al 2001 until now the mode of action of cbz in c riparius is still unknown heye et al 2016 but late developmental stages seem to be most affected heye et al 2019 a central role in late development plays the ecdysone receptor which is crucial for molting and pupation riddiford and truman 1993 the receptor s genes are not only activated by ecdysone but also at high temperatures park and kwak 2014 cbz on the other hand is hypothesized to inhibit the ecdysone receptor oetken et al 2005 but this could not be confirmed in a molecular dynamics simulation heye et al 2016 also the induction of biotransformation by cbz as observed in crustaceans cnidarians and fish valdés et al 2016 vernouillet et al 2010 can compensate for toxicity the increase in metabolic rates at elevated temperatures does not only increase uptake but also the elimination and detoxification of a substance harwood et al 2009 the predominance of one of the factors is substance and organism specific as already demonstrated by harwood et al 2009 this does however mean that the joint effect between xenobiotics and temperature cannot be generalized 4 2 implications for hazard assessment we demonstrated that environmental stress increases the sensitivity of c riparius to cbz exposure in binary combinations while in previous investigations 400 μg l has been set as no observed effect concentration noec for cbz heye et al 2019 the same concentration in the present stress experiment resulted in 82 5 mortality when only a single parameter om was altered although in the present case study with cbz test concentrations are higher than environmental concentrations of around 0 2 μg l aus der beek et al 2016 minguez et al 2014 these results illustrate that a slight change in test conditions can change the estimation of the environmental hazard of a contaminant considerably the risk of underestimating toxic effects in freshwater ecosystems is reinforced by the fact that the sensitivity of midges to low levels of cbz lc10 increased at stress intensities that did not induce mortality themselves the present observations refer to laboratory conditions and low level binary stress combinations in freshwater ecosystems organisms are exposed to environmental stressors such as those included in the present study but in combination with a variety of other chemical and non chemical stressors if organisms are exposed to higher levels of stress this will likely lead to a further increase in their susceptibility to cbz and other contaminants enhanced stress intensities have previously been predicted to increase the sensitivity to a chemical stressor by up to a factor of 100 liess et al 2016 which challenges the environmental risk assessment of chemicals in its present form at the moment assessment factors between 10 and 100 are applied to chronic standardized toxicity data to extrapolate from laboratory to field conditions and predict the environmental hazard and risk of contaminants in the environment ec 2003 2011 these factors could easily be exceeded when organisms are exposed to chemical and non chemical stressors as illustrated by the present results and the stress addition model by liess et al 2016 they may be sufficient to cover the difference in the sensitivity of midges between a laboratory experiment with and without the addition of a second stressor but they also need to cover the toxicity of contaminants under realistic field conditions and more than binary stressor combinations moreover the present results demonstrate that not all stressor combinations can be predicted by the addition of single stressor effects whether additive synergistic or antagonistic interactions are more prevalent in freshwater ecosystems is still under debate jackson et al 2016 concluded that interactions are mostly antagonistic while holmstrup et al 2010 found synergistic interaction in 50 of their reviewed studies environmental stressors in the present investigation interacted additively synergistically and antagonistically depending on the stressor and the investigated endpoint and they were difficult to predict without understanding their mechanistic action in addition the present results were not always in accordance with previous findings for other chemicals and organisms the experience of stress and consequently the sensitivity to toxicants in natural settings also depends on the species stress tolerance and its ecological niche sokolova et al 2012 van straalen 2003 which supports a more stress ecological focus in ecotoxicology for a reliable extrapolation from the laboratory to the field in order to predict the toxicity of contaminants in the environment not only the exposure to chemicals but also the response of organisms to natural stressors needs to be understood the present study contributes to this understanding by providing essential information on the stress response of c riparius to biotic and abiotic natural stressors with and without the addition of cbz as a representative contaminant 5 conclusion the present results increase our knowledge about the toxicity of pharmaceuticals like cbz in the environment we demonstrated that the toxicity of cbz increases with environmental stress which gives reason for concern about an underestimation of hazard when laboratory test results are used to predict the toxicity of contaminants in the environment sufficient knowledge about the toxicity of chemicals in the field can only be achieved by understanding the interaction of species communities with their environment however to do so mechanistic knowledge about chemical and non chemical stressors is essential also in order to predict their interaction interactive effects depend on stressor combinations which validates the need to investigate additional groups of contaminants and stressors in more than binary combinations upcoming publications within the niddaman project will include a multiple stress artificial indoor stream experiment to investigate the toxicity of cbz in a more complex

18896,a microbial fuel cell system with intimately coupled photocatalytic electrogenic anode photocatalytic mfc was proposed for the synergetic degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp which has a structure of three chlorine groups connecting to a phenol ring and is well recognized as a recalcitrant pollutant for its high toxicity bioaccumulation and persistence the photocatalytic electrogenic anode was prepared by coating mpg c3n4 on a carbon felt anode followed by inoculating with municipal sewage and acclimating with 2 4 6 tcp at gradient concentrations improved tcp degradation was achieved showing 79 3 of tcp removal in 10 h with an original concentration of 200 mg l 1 which was higher than that obtained with the unilluminated mfc 66 0 and the photocatalytic only process 56 1 the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process demonstrated different degradation pathways compared with the photocatalytic only process with one open chain compound 2 chloro 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid 2 cma detected in the photocatalytic mfc system microbial community analysis revealed that pseudomonas instead of geobacter observed in the unilluminated mfc bioanode dominated in the photocatalytic electrogenic anode mfc biofilm which might be responsible for enhanced current generation in the coupled system in addition biofilm rich with rhodococcus on air cathode was also responsible for the enhanced tcp removal this research provides an efficient strategy for the treatment of wastewater with recalcitrant contaminants by intimate coupling of the photocatalytic and the electrogenic processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol microbial fuel cell photocatalysis coupled photocatalytic electrogenic anode wastewater treatment 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs are promising wastewater treatment technologies with simultaneous energy recovery from waste organics logan et al 2006 however the anodic electrogenic biofilm in mfcs are prone to utilize more biodegradable organic molecules e g acetate glucose lactate freguia et al 2010 liu et al 2005 rabaey et al 2003 rosenbaum et al 2007 and its capability of degrading recalcitrant organics are very limited due to the biotoxicity of target chemicals even at trace concentration stein et al 2010 the degradation of phenolic compounds in mfcs demonstrated that it was the anaerobic digestion process that firstly converted the contaminants to more biodegradable intermediates e g 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxy 3 methylbenzoic acid acetate which were preferred to be further utilized by the electrogenic biofilm hedbavna et al 2016 what s more higher concentrations of the recalcitrant compounds will significantly affect the formation of biofilms and result in distinct decrease of microbial activity and contaminant removal in mfcs luo et al 2009 song et al 2014 photocatalysis that generates hydroxyl and super oxide radicals with the excitation of uv or visible light has the potential of non selective degradation of recalcitrant organics such as chlorophenol barakat et al 2005 dye lachheb et al 2002 antibiotic yan et al 2016 into small molecules however the photonic efficiency of photocatalysis is limited due to the fast recombination of photoelectron hole pairs the combination of photocatalysis and electrochemistry as one of the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops so called photoelectrocatalysis pec has been proposed to overcome this issue garcia segura and brillas 2017 also photocatalytic intermediate products such as carboxylic acids formic acid acetic acid lactic acid etc are relatively stable and difficult to be further carbonized meng et al 2015 microbial strategy for fouling mitigation has also been discussed for wastewater treatment sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 the coupling of photocatalysis with biodegradation have been developed in the forms of sequential coupling where wastewater is pretreated with photocatalytic process to generate intermediates that could be further utilized by the biodegradation process su et al 2015 yahiat et al 2011 however the first stage of photocatalytic process could excessively degrade organics to less biodegradable products not suitable for the following biodegradation process which is a waste of reactive radicals and may decrease the system efficiency intimate coupling of the two processes have been demonstrated with tio2 loaded on sponge type biofilm carriers where the products of the exterior photocatalytic process with uv excitation could be readily used by the interior protected biofilm achieving enhanced 2 4 5 triclorophenol mineralization with an original concentration of 50 μm li et al 2011 visible light excitation of the intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation for phenol degradation by using tio2 with er3 and yalo3 dopants was also demonstrated showing 99 8 of phenol removal and 64 0 of dissolved organic carbon doc removal zhou et al 2015 by using acetate as the co substrate tetracycline was successfully carbonized in an intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb system by loading nano particulate ag tio2 onto polyurethane cubes xiong et al 2018 multiple processes including adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation were revealed to be responsible for the improved performances table s1 the coupling of photocatalysis and microbial electrochemical systems mess have emerged recently aiming to improve extracellular electron transfer with photocatalytic enhanced anodic or cathodic performances power generation of 1 5 fold higher was obtained by electrically connecting a separate tio2 nanotube array electrode to the biofilm anode kim et al 2018 the coupling of photocatalysis and bioanode of a microbial electrolysis cells using α fe2o3 as the photocatalyst accelerated biofilm formation and extracellular electron transfer with sodium acetate as the substrate feng et al 2016 enhanced electrochemical interaction between shewanella and a hematite nanowire photoanode was also obtained producing 1 5 fold higher current than that of the abiotic control qian et al 2014 over expression of the d lactate transporter so1522 in shewanella was able to supply more electrons than the wild type which was responsible for the improved incident photon to current conversion efficiency gao et al 2008 zhu et al 2017 most recent studies of the intimate coupling of photocatalytic electrogenic bioanode have been focused on the enhancement of extracellular electron transfer of mess e g power generation in mfcs however researches aiming for the degradation of recalcitrant organics in such coupled systems have not been investigated and the mechanism of the synergic effect between photocatalysis and electrogenic biofilms for recalcitrant organics degradation have not been explored yet herein this study we investigated the intimate coupling of photocatalysis and electrogenic biofilm of mfcs for the synergic degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp tcp tcp is a by product in many industrial processes and is recognized as mutagenesis carcinogenesis teratogenesis refractory organic pollutant urgent to be well disposed gaya et al 2010 the ld50 median lethal dose 50 of tcp is 820 mg kg for rat especially it is extremely toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects for the lc50 lethal concentration 50 of which is 2 26 mg l 1 96 h for fish tcp may cause skin irritation and severe eye irritation as well in our research a visible light induced photocatalyst mpg c3n4 was synthesized and incorporated on the outer layer of the fibrous carbon felt anode the synergic degradation of tcp was characterized and the enhanced energy recovery in the photocatalytic mfc system was also explored the changes in degradation pathways of the coupled system compared with the photocatalytic process were characterized in addition the variations of microbial communities of both the coupled photocatalytic mfcs and that without coupling photocatalysis were discussed this research could provide a comprehensive understanding of the working mechanisms of the hybrid photocatalytic electrogenic anode in mfcs for recalcitrant organics degradation paving the road for industrial wastewater treatment and simultaneous energy harvest with microbial electrochemical systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the mpg c3n4 photocatalytic electrogenic anode the mpg c3n4 photocatalyst with visible light response was prepared via a hard template method cui et al 2012 typically nh4scn of 10 g was dissolved in 10 ml deionized water then x g of silica sol 40 with diameters of colloid silicon dioxide around 12 nm x 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 12 5 g was introduced into the solution and stirred at 100 c until water evaporated the obtained white dry solid was subsequently placed in a muffle furnace and calcinated at 550 c for 2 h silica template nanoparticles were removed from the resulting yellow powder with 100 ml nh4hf2 solution 4 mol l 1 by stirring for 24 h in a fume hood and then ultimately washed by deionized water and ethyl ethanol for several times and

photocatalyst loaded was facing outside for light illumination and a carbon felt electrode without mpg c3n4 were used as the control the air cathode with a diameter of 4 8 cm was prepared according to

50 mg l 1 was injected into the reactor with 1 g l 1 sodium acetate as a co substrate after the voltage output reached its steady state the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp was further increased to 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 successively the buffer of all culture solutions were 50 mm phosphate buffer solution mfcs working under different operational conditions including mfcs working under closed circuit condition with light illumination cc light mfcs working under open circuit condition with light illumination oc light mfcs working under closed circuit condition without light illumination cc dark and mfcs working under open circuit condition without light illumination oc dark were characterized all mfcs were conducted in duplicates under fed batch mode with a cycle duration of 72 h at a constant temperature of 25 c for photocatalytic tests with illumination a 500 w xe lamp beijing aulight technology co ltd china using a 420 nm cut off filter was applied as the light source for the first 10 h of each mfc cycle the wavelength range of which was from 420 nm to 780 nm the intensity of the incident light was measured with a digital light meter and controlled at 1500 lux 2 3 analysis and characterization voltage outputs of all mfcs were collected every 10 min by a data acquisition system keithley 2750 tektronix usa power densities of mfcs were normalized according to the reactor volume 66 ml cyclic voltammetry cv was carried out at a sweep rate of 5 mv s 1 and a potential range from 0 4 v to 0 4 v electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed at a sweep frequency ranged from 105 hz to 0 01 hz with an amplitude of 10 mv both of the cv and eis experiments were conducted by an electrochemical potentiostat sa bio logic france using anode as the working electrode air cathode as the counter electrode and ag agcl standard electrode as the reference electrode the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa equipped with an ultraviolet detector and a column of poroshell120ec c180 4 μm 4 6 150 mm the mobile phase consisted of 70 methanol and 30 acetic acid 2 v v with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the wavelength was set at 290 nm all samples were filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filter before determination total organic carbon toc was measured by the multi n c 2100 analyzer analytik jena ag germany the intermediate products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms saturn 2100 t agilent usa equipped with an hp 5ms column 30 m 250 μm 0 25 μm the intermediate samples with photocatalysis were collected after 5 h illumination first sample of 10 ml was extracted filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filter and then mixed vigorously with 15 ml dichloromethane ch2cl2 ar in a separatory funnel for 3 min the lower organic phase was collected after settling for 15 min and then subjected to repetitive extraction operation for another 3 times the ultimate organic solvent was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate then filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter and concentrated to 1 ml on a rotary evaporator re 52aa shanghai yarong china the initial temperature of gc ms was maintained at 80 c for 2 min and then the temperature was elevated to 250 c with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and kept for 1 min the gasification temperature is 250 c the flow rate of the carrier gas

illumina usa which were performed by major bio co ltd shanghai china dna was extracted using the fast dna spin kit for soil omega usa dna purity was determined by nano drop 2000 and dna integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis age scanning electron microscopy sem of anodes with and without photocatalyst loading were measured with sirion 200 of fei company the density functional theory dft calculation was accomplished using dmol3 module of materials studio package with the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional and general gradient approximation gga double numerical basis set plus d functions dnd 3 5 basis set and the orbital cutoff was set to medium quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performance of the photocatalytic mfc 3 1 1 characterization of the photocatalyst loaded anode mesoporous mpg c3n4 photocatalyst synthesized with silicon dioxide as template demonstrated highly porous structures with a specific area of 471 m2 g 1 which would provide more active sites for photocatalytic reactions and promote the diffusion of reactants drs analysis fig s1 showed that the synthesized mpg c3n4 had a band gap of 2 70 ev and a cut off adsorption wavelength of 470 nm the mesoporous photocatalyst was successfully loaded on to the carbon felt fiber showing roughly covered filaments under sem imaging compared to the smooth filaments without photocatalyst coupling fig 1 carbon graphite filament network provides a high specific area for the attachment of photocatalyst and electrogenic microbes and the highly porous structure is also beneficial to the efficient mass transfer of substrate and degraded intermediates the 3d networks of the carbon felt filaments might also have effect on the integrity and distribution of the electrogenic biofilm 3 1 2 improved electrochemical performance the acclimation of the mfc anode biofilm was realized with the co culture of sodium acetate and stepwise increased concentrations of tcp of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 a three continuous cycles under each tcp concentration demonstrated gradual increase of voltage output proving the successful adaption of the biofilm to tcp it finally reached the maximum voltage of 419 mv with 200 mg l 1 tcp which is similar to that using sodium acetate as the only substrate the life cycle increased with the increase of tcp concentration showing 36 1 h 56 5 h and 72 9 h with the addition of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 tcp cutoff voltage of 50 mv average of 3 cycles which also suggested that the mfc anode was gradually building up its tolerance to tcp the illumination of the photocatalytic electrogenic anode enabled faster acclimation of the output voltage to a higher steady state which was 1 3 h to reach 439 mv compared to 2 3 h to reach 385 mv of mfc without light illumination fig 2b the power generation of the photocatalytic mfc yielded a higher maximum power density of 19 8 w m 3 while mfc without illumination produced a maximum power density of 17 6 w m 3 this is consistent with previous study that power generation was enhanced from 850 mw m 2 to 1284 mw m 2 by connecting a photocatalytic anode to the bioanode of a microbial fuel cell kim et al 2018 upon illumination the photocatalyst loaded electrode generated photo electrons which may add into the external circuit and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction at the air cathode improving the overall electricity generation performance of the mfc cv results demonstrated that there were distinct differences between the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode and the unilluminated electrogenic anode with tcp addition fig 3 a there is only one reduction peak at 0 14 v vs she in the unilluminated electrogenic anode without any oxidation peaks observed suggesting that the direct oxidation of tcp might be very trivial or not likely to happen without light illumination previous results show that the macroscopic redox potential windows of g sulfurreducens cytochromes mostly covered the negative values and there is the omcf that covers the positive value santos et al 2015 however the electrogenic anode with sodium acetate as substrate showed no reduction peak inset of fig 3a indicating that the distinction of electrolyte makes the difference so we attribute the only reduction peak to 200 mg l 1 tcp in the electrolyte either the redox substances produced by the domesticated biofilm or the chemical redox reactions might bring about the reduction peak in accord with the microbial community analysis hereinafter phenazine as a redox mediator secreted by pseudomonas which dominated in the biofilm of anode inoculated by tcp might be the most likely reason for the reduction peak in the unilluminated group jayapriya and ramamurthy 2012 qiao et al 2017 moreover both reduction and oxidation peaks were observed with the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode it might be attributed to the oxidation of tcp by photo excited holes which would not happen in systems without light illumination liang and zhu 2016 in addition the reduction peak of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode was shifted to a more positive value compared to the unilluminated one 0 25 v versus 0 14 v vs she this might be due to the photocatalytic process generating photo excited electrons that had a higher energy to reduce tcp in the electrolyte also the photo excited electrons might also transfer to the cathode and reduce tcp on the cathode electrode it is worth to notice that the current of the illuminated system was 1 9 fold of the unilluminated one 5 34 a m2 vs 2 80 a m2 fig 3a showing that the coupled system significantly enhanced the electron transfer compared to the electrogenic biofilm anode this is consistent with the improved voltage output and power generation fig 2b and c improved power generation was also explained by eis analysis fig 3b the ohmic resistance of the unilluminated electrogenic anode was 7 0 ω which was 2 8 fold of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode 2 5 ω and the charge transfer resistance of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode was 3 8 ω which was much lower than that of the unilluminated electrogenic anode 17 5 ω the results indicate that faster mass transfer might achieved under light illumination there were several reactions might progress regarding the electron transfer under light illumination both holes and photo electrons had the possibility to directly react with tcp and promote the electron transfer and the photo electrons could also migrate to the cathode via the external circuit and reacted with oxygen or tcp resulting in the increase of electron transfer rate and the reduction of mfc resistances 3 2 tcp degradation of photocatalytic mfc tcp degradation efficiencies were analyzed in mfc systems with and without illumination under open circuit and closed circuit to verify the contribution of the following process 1 the non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under open circuit condition without illumination oc dark including biodegradation processes on the anode biofilm non electrogenic in the solution and on the cathode biofilm 2 the electrogenic and non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under closed circuit condition without illumination cc dark 3 the photocatalytic degradation process and the non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under open circuit condition with illumination oc light and 4 the photocatalytic process electrogenic process and non electrogenic process operated under closed circuit condition with illumination cc light with lower tcp concentration of 50 mg l 1 the degradation of tcp in mfcs operated under the cc light condition completed within 24 h which was faster than all other working conditions specifically the illuminated mfc cc light showed 20 4 more tcp degradation than the one without illumination cc dark in the first 10 h showing advantages of the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process tcp with low initial concentration 50 mg l 1 could be degraded within 72 h even under the oc dark condition suggesting that the non electrogenic process was very critical for tcp removal with the increase of tcp to 100 mg l 1 all operational conditions demonstrated lower removal efficiencies it took 48 h for the coupled photocatlytic electrogenic system cc light to completely degrade tcp which was longer than the 24 h for 50 mg l 1 tcp this was due to the toxicity of tcp that decreased the efficiency of the biodegradation processes drastic advantages of the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic system cc light was observed over all other operating conditions when tcp concentration was elevated to a higher concentration of 200 mg l 1 fig 4 c tcp degradation of 79 3 was achieved in 10 h which was 20 1 higher than the one without photocatalysis 66 0 for cc dark and complete tcp degradation was achieved in 72 h comparing mfcs without photocatalysis oc dark and cc dark the extracellular electron transfer process of the electrogenic biofilm was responsible for 23 7 of the tcp degradation in 72 h 93 6 for cc dark vs 69 9 for oc dark for open circuit system with illumination oc light the tcp degradation improved by 16 3 86 2 for oc light vs 69 9 for oc dark the effect of photocatalysis became weakened as the concentration became higher by comparing the differences between tcp degradation of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 in oc light and oc dark fig 4a c this is consistent with traditional photocatalytic process that the degradation efficiency decreases with the increase of contaminant concentration benbachir et al 2017 the inset of fig 4c indicates that there existed 2 stage reaction rates once light was turned off for oc light and cc light after 10 h the reaction rate k1 of cc light of the first 10 h 0 157 h 1 light on is the highest of all k1 and k2 rates suggesting that the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process improved the degradation of tcp at a higher reaction rate by removing the light of cc light after 10 h the reaction rate decreased to 0 032 h 1 showing the decreased tcp removal efficiency by removing the photocatalytic process however k2 of cc light was still the highest among all operating conditions suggesting that by integrating the photocatalytic process the intermediate degradation products were easier to be biodegraded by a normal mfc toc removal efficiencies of tcp with 1 g l 1 sodium acetate as co substrate showed the same trend with three original concentrations cc light cc dark oc light oc dark fig 4d cc light demonstrated the best performance of 95 1 removal which was higher than oc dark at 86 0 the toc removal of oc light was lower than the cc dark mode 91 4 for oc light vs 91 9 for cc dark showing that the carbonization capability of photocatalysis was not as efficient as the electrogenic biofilm with the intimate coupling of photocatalytic electrogenic biofilm cc light the toc removal was higher than cc dark and oc light showing that the coupling of both strategies was beneficial for the degradation of tcp within a wide range of original concentration what s more important a relatively long cycle was selected to ensure the complete degradation of tcp in at least one operation condition 72 h the advantages of the intimate coupling of the photocatalytic electrogenic process would become more tremendous with short cycles due to its higher degradation kinetics thus the realization of treating practical wastewater using this intimately coupled system is in prospect and further research of nutrient removal will be needed due to the complicated composition of practical wastewater babaei et al 2018 further investigations on how the anode potential would affect the tcp removal efficiency would be necessary as well and applying an external voltage to the system might also increase tcp removal zhang et al 2019 3 3 degradation pathways of tcp based on the determination of intermediate products conducted by gc ms and lc ms the degradation pathway was studied with the density functional theory dft approach fig 5 several major intermediates 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzenediol 2 6 dchq 6 chloro 1 2 4 benzenetriol 6 chq 2 chlorophenol 2 mcp p benzoquinone pbq and 2 chloro 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid 2 cma were determined after 5 h degradation in the coupled system fig 5a while 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 mcp and 2 6 dchq were observed in the photocatalytic only system fig 5b the reactivity of the initial reactant and the intermediates were evaluated by calculations of molecular electrostatic potential mep fukui function and bond order table 1 the mep plays an important role in the initial interaction of two molecules when they are approaching each other as the electrophilic species prefer to attack a molecule at sites where the mep is most negative politzer and murray 2007 the electrostatic potential map isovalue 0 016 a u of 2 4 6 tcp demonstrated the most active sites for the electrophilic attack are cl9 and o12 table 1 according to frontier orbital theory the fukui function describes the change of electron density with the insertion or loss of an electron in the homo or lumo orbitals the fukui function could predict the most active sites for electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical f 0 attack of a molecule presenting by the fukui indices cheng et al 2017 the f of cl9 was only second to cl11 in 2 4 6 tcp so the electrophilic substitution was preferred at cl9 position and cl9 was dechlorinated to generate 2 4 dcp in addition the f 0at cl11 was maximum which explained the generation of 2 6 dchq as the consequence of free radical oh attack at cl11 2 4 dcp the electrophilic attack product of 2 4 6 tcp exhibits negative mep region at o10 and cl12 as indicated by the red cloud in table 1 which was vulnerable to electrophilic attack moreover the f of cl12 was maximum in 2 4 dcp thus cl12 was easily oxidized to produce 2 mcp for 2 mep it shows the mep map that negative region was located around o12 and the aromatic ring although the meps provide insight into molecular recognition processes such as enzyme substrate and drug receptor interactions they may overlook the polarization of the molecule by the incoming species levine 2012 on this occasion the fukui function f played a leading role to determine the electrophilic sites as cl11 of 2 mcp demonstrated the maximum f function cl11 was most likely to be removed to generate phenol through microbial metabolism phenol was further oxidized to benzoquinone and mineralized to co2 eventually as the radical attack product of 2 4 6 tcp 2 6 dchq was prone to radical attack at cl12 with a maximum f 0 value and transformed to 6 chq moreover it was possible for 2 6 dchq to be dechlorinated and oxidized to pbq from the perspective of the mep and the fukui function f the mep map of 6 chq displayed strong negative potential region around o13 which was vulnerable to electrophilic attack and be oxidized to generate 2 cma it calls for special attention that one open chain compound 2 cma was only detected in the photocatalytic mfc system but not in the photocatalytic only process the further breaking of the c cl of 2 cma would generate 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid and then convert to 3 ketoadipic acid forming a series of small molecules of organic acid that lead to the final carbonization comparing to photocatalytic only process microbial metabolism played an important role in decomposing the small molecules which were not detected by gc ms or lc ms in the coupled system as a result the microbial behaviors might regulate the degradation pathway of the coupled system and increased mineralization efficiency as a conclusion the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic system was more capable of ring cleavage for complete mineralization of tcp than the photocatalytic only process 3 4 microbial community analysis of photocatalytic mfc relative abundances of the anode biofilm genera were shown in fig 6 a only the genera whose proportion of community abundance 2 was indicated there were 3 types of anode biofilm being analyzed anode cultivated using sodium acetate as the only substrate naac anode anode cultivated by co substrate of sodium acetate and 2 4 6 tcp naac tcp anode and anode cultivated with co substrate with photo illumination photo naac tcp anode th as geobacter 46 0 which is a standard electrogenic species widely observed in mfcs kumar et al 2015 logan and regan 2006 nevertheless the most abundant genera in biofilms of the naac tcp anode and photo naac tcp anode was pseudomonas which has critical functionalities in electrogenic biofilm by promoting the acclimation biofilms and enhances the degradation of tcp with its abundant metabolic pathways light illumination also has a significant impact on microbial population which further increased the abundance of pseudomonas to 54 3 compared to the one without illumination naac tcp anode 21 9 zhang et al 2012 besides there was a small amount of rhodococcus determined with abundances of 11 5 and 6 8 in naac tcp anode and photo naac tcp anode respectively which was recognized to be capable of degrading a variety of aromatic compounds especially chlorophenols xiao et al 2015 xie et al 2017 both pseudomonas and rhodococcus were not found in anode cultivated with sodium acetate naac anode and geobacter which was rich in the naac anode was not observed in the naac tcp anode and only 6 7 in the photo naac tcp anode suggesting that geobacter was poorly tolerant to tcp and the integration of photocatalysis helped reducing the toxicity and enabling a few amount of geobacter to grow in the biofilm what s more it was the abundance of pseudomonas that enhanced the mfc performance and tcp degradation performance in the co substrate system naac tcp anode microbial analysis of the biofilm formed on the air cathode showed that the dominant genera were pseudomonas 4 1 and bacteroidetes 11 8 in mfcs with naac as the only substrate fig 6b the latter one of which was well recognized as a fermentation bacteria capable of hydrolyzing organic matter in mfcs borole et al 2011 dennis et al 2013 pseudomonas naac tcp cathode of 5 2 vs photo naac tcp cathode of 15 6 and rhodococcus naac tcp cathode of 53 7 vs photo naac tcp cathode of 31 4 became the dominant genera in the co substrate cultivated mfc besides the amount of rhodococcus in cathode biofilm was much more than that in the homologous anode implying that microorganisms in the cathode biofilm played a crucial role in degrading tcp further experiments using two chamber microbial fuel cells separating the anode and cathode would be beneficial for deep understanding of the contribution of the biofilms on anode and cathode respectively the degradation mechanism was summarized based on the above analysis of intermediates and microbial population as shown in fig 7 the following processes were suggested 1 the photocatalytic process 2 the electrogenic process 3 the coupled photocatalytic process 4 the non electrogenic biodegradation process on cathode and in solution that are actively involved in the final mineralization of tcp 4 conclusion an intimately coupled photocatalytic electrogenic mfc system was developed for synergic degradation of tcp by integrating mpg c3n4 on the anode the coupled system demonstrated higher electrochemical performance with higher power generation and tcp removal compared to mfcs without photocatalysis the degradation pathways of tcp were considered to be the combination of photocatalytic process and mfc process which integrated to enhance the mineralization of tcp by utilizing intermediates produced with photocatalysis by the biofilm anode pseudomonas instead of geobacter was revealed to dominate in the mfc biofilm with tcp and the photocatalytic process further increased the proportion of pseudomonas rhodococcus was found rich in cathode biofilm suggesting that the cathode biofilm was also critical for tcp removal in conclusion this coupled photocatalytic mfc optimized the microbial population and formed synergetic effect on recalcitrant organics removal by combining the photocatalytic and electrogenic processes demonstrating its capability for industrial wastewater treatment with simultaneous electricity production to improve the performances the configuration of the photocatalytic mfc reactor could be further investigated to combine the advantages of current photocatalytic reactor for large scale applications watanabe 2008 and the effect of anodic potential on the performance of the photocatalytic

18896,a microbial fuel cell system with intimately coupled photocatalytic electrogenic anode photocatalytic mfc was proposed for the synergetic degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp which has a structure of three chlorine groups connecting to a phenol ring and is well recognized as a recalcitrant pollutant for its high toxicity bioaccumulation and persistence the photocatalytic electrogenic anode was prepared by coating mpg c3n4 on a carbon felt anode followed by inoculating with municipal sewage and acclimating with 2 4 6 tcp at gradient concentrations improved tcp degradation was achieved showing 79 3 of tcp removal in 10 h with an original concentration of 200 mg l 1 which was higher than that obtained with the unilluminated mfc 66 0 and the photocatalytic only process 56 1 the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process demonstrated different degradation pathways compared with the photocatalytic only process with one open chain compound 2 chloro 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid 2 cma detected in the photocatalytic mfc system microbial community analysis revealed that pseudomonas instead of geobacter observed in the unilluminated mfc bioanode dominated in the photocatalytic electrogenic anode mfc biofilm which might be responsible for enhanced current generation in the coupled system in addition biofilm rich with rhodococcus on air cathode was also responsible for the enhanced tcp removal this research provides an efficient strategy for the treatment of wastewater with recalcitrant contaminants by intimate coupling of the photocatalytic and the electrogenic processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords 2 4 6 trichlorophenol microbial fuel cell photocatalysis coupled photocatalytic electrogenic anode wastewater treatment 1 introduction microbial fuel cells mfcs are promising wastewater treatment technologies with simultaneous energy recovery from waste organics logan et al 2006 however the anodic electrogenic biofilm in mfcs are prone to utilize more biodegradable organic molecules e g acetate glucose lactate freguia et al 2010 liu et al 2005 rabaey et al 2003 rosenbaum et al 2007 and its capability of degrading recalcitrant organics are very limited due to the biotoxicity of target chemicals even at trace concentration stein et al 2010 the degradation of phenolic compounds in mfcs demonstrated that it was the anaerobic digestion process that firstly converted the contaminants to more biodegradable intermediates e g 4 hydroxybenzoic acid and 4 hydroxy 3 methylbenzoic acid acetate which were preferred to be further utilized by the electrogenic biofilm hedbavna et al 2016 what s more higher concentrations of the recalcitrant compounds will significantly affect the formation of biofilms and result in distinct decrease of microbial activity and contaminant removal in mfcs luo et al 2009 song et al 2014 photocatalysis that generates hydroxyl and super oxide radicals with the excitation of uv or visible light has the potential of non selective degradation of recalcitrant organics such as chlorophenol barakat et al 2005 dye lachheb et al 2002 antibiotic yan et al 2016 into small molecules however the photonic efficiency of photocatalysis is limited due to the fast recombination of photoelectron hole pairs the combination of photocatalysis and electrochemistry as one of the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops so called photoelectrocatalysis pec has been proposed to overcome this issue garcia segura and brillas 2017 also photocatalytic intermediate products such as carboxylic acids formic acid acetic acid lactic acid etc are relatively stable and difficult to be further carbonized meng et al 2015 microbial strategy for fouling mitigation has also been discussed for wastewater treatment sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 the coupling of photocatalysis with biodegradation have been developed in the forms of sequential coupling where wastewater is pretreated with photocatalytic process to generate intermediates that could be further utilized by the biodegradation process su et al 2015 yahiat et al 2011 however the first stage of photocatalytic process could excessively degrade organics to less biodegradable products not suitable for the following biodegradation process which is a waste of reactive radicals and may decrease the system efficiency intimate coupling of the two processes have been demonstrated with tio2 loaded on sponge type biofilm carriers where the products of the exterior photocatalytic process with uv excitation could be readily used by the interior protected biofilm achieving enhanced 2 4 5 triclorophenol mineralization with an original concentration of 50 μm li et al 2011 visible light excitation of the intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation for phenol degradation by using tio2 with er3 and yalo3 dopants was also demonstrated showing 99 8 of phenol removal and 64 0 of dissolved organic carbon doc removal zhou et al 2015 by using acetate as the co substrate tetracycline was successfully carbonized in an intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb system by loading nano particulate ag tio2 onto polyurethane cubes xiong et al 2018 multiple processes including adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation were revealed to be responsible for the improved performances table s1 the coupling of photocatalysis and microbial electrochemical systems mess have emerged recently aiming to improve extracellular electron transfer with photocatalytic enhanced anodic or cathodic performances power generation of 1 5 fold higher was obtained by electrically connecting a separate tio2 nanotube array electrode to the biofilm anode kim et al 2018 the coupling of photocatalysis and bioanode of a microbial electrolysis cells using α fe2o3 as the photocatalyst accelerated biofilm formation and extracellular electron transfer with sodium acetate as the substrate feng et al 2016 enhanced electrochemical interaction between shewanella and a hematite nanowire photoanode was also obtained producing 1 5 fold higher current than that of the abiotic control qian et al 2014 over expression of the d lactate transporter so1522 in shewanella was able to supply more electrons than the wild type which was responsible for the improved incident photon to current conversion efficiency gao et al 2008 zhu et al 2017 most recent studies of the intimate coupling of photocatalytic electrogenic bioanode have been focused on the enhancement of extracellular electron transfer of mess e g power generation in mfcs however researches aiming for the degradation of recalcitrant organics in such coupled systems have not been investigated and the mechanism of the synergic effect between photocatalysis and electrogenic biofilms for recalcitrant organics degradation have not been explored yet herein this study we investigated the intimate coupling of photocatalysis and electrogenic biofilm of mfcs for the synergic degradation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 4 6 tcp tcp tcp is a by product in many industrial processes and is recognized as mutagenesis carcinogenesis teratogenesis refractory organic pollutant urgent to be well disposed gaya et al 2010 the ld50 median lethal dose 50 of tcp is 820 mg kg for rat especially it is extremely toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects for the lc50 lethal concentration 50 of which is 2 26 mg l 1 96 h for fish tcp may cause skin irritation and severe eye irritation as well in our research a visible light induced photocatalyst mpg c3n4 was synthesized and incorporated on the outer layer of the fibrous carbon felt anode the synergic degradation of tcp was characterized and the enhanced energy recovery in the photocatalytic mfc system was also explored the changes in degradation pathways of the coupled system compared with the photocatalytic process were characterized in addition the variations of microbial communities of both the coupled photocatalytic mfcs and that without coupling photocatalysis were discussed this research could provide a comprehensive understanding of the working mechanisms of the hybrid photocatalytic electrogenic anode in mfcs for recalcitrant organics degradation paving the road for industrial wastewater treatment and simultaneous energy harvest with microbial electrochemical systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of the mpg c3n4 photocatalytic electrogenic anode the mpg c3n4 photocatalyst with visible light response was prepared via a hard template method cui et al 2012 typically nh4scn of 10 g was dissolved in 10 ml deionized water then x g of silica sol 40 with diameters of colloid silicon dioxide around 12 nm x 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 12 5 g was introduced into the solution and stirred at 100 c until water evaporated the obtained white dry solid was subsequently placed in a muffle furnace and calcinated at 550 c for 2 h silica template nanoparticles were removed from the resulting yellow powder with 100 ml nh4hf2 solution 4 mol l 1 by stirring for 24 h in a fume hood and then ultimately washed by deionized water and ethyl ethanol for several times and

photocatalyst loaded was facing outside for light illumination and a carbon felt electrode without mpg c3n4 were used as the control the air cathode with a diameter of 4 8 cm was prepared according to

50 mg l 1 was injected into the reactor with 1 g l 1 sodium acetate as a co substrate after the voltage output reached its steady state the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp was further increased to 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 successively the buffer of all culture solutions were 50 mm phosphate buffer solution mfcs working under different operational conditions including mfcs working under closed circuit condition with light illumination cc light mfcs working under open circuit condition with light illumination oc light mfcs working under closed circuit condition without light illumination cc dark and mfcs working under open circuit condition without light illumination oc dark were characterized all mfcs were conducted in duplicates under fed batch mode with a cycle duration of 72 h at a constant temperature of 25 c for photocatalytic tests with illumination a 500 w xe lamp beijing aulight technology co ltd china using a 420 nm cut off filter was applied as the light source for the first 10 h of each mfc cycle the wavelength range of which was from 420 nm to 780 nm the intensity of the incident light was measured with a digital light meter and controlled at 1500 lux 2 3 analysis and characterization voltage outputs of all mfcs were collected every 10 min by a data acquisition system keithley 2750 tektronix usa power densities of mfcs were normalized according to the reactor volume 66 ml cyclic voltammetry cv was carried out at a sweep rate of 5 mv s 1 and a potential range from 0 4 v to 0 4 v electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed at a sweep frequency ranged from 105 hz to 0 01 hz with an amplitude of 10 mv both of the cv and eis experiments were conducted by an electrochemical potentiostat sa bio logic france using anode as the working electrode air cathode as the counter electrode and ag agcl standard electrode as the reference electrode the concentration of 2 4 6 tcp was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa equipped with an ultraviolet detector and a column of poroshell120ec c180 4 μm 4 6 150 mm the mobile phase consisted of 70 methanol and 30 acetic acid 2 v v with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the wavelength was set at 290 nm all samples were filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filter before determination total organic carbon toc was measured by the multi n c 2100 analyzer analytik jena ag germany the intermediate products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms saturn 2100 t agilent usa equipped with an hp 5ms column 30 m 250 μm 0 25 μm the intermediate samples with photocatalysis were collected after 5 h illumination first sample of 10 ml was extracted filtered with 0 22 μm ptfe filter and then mixed vigorously with 15 ml dichloromethane ch2cl2 ar in a separatory funnel for 3 min the lower organic phase was collected after settling for 15 min and then subjected to repetitive extraction operation for another 3 times the ultimate organic solvent was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate then filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter and concentrated to 1 ml on a rotary evaporator re 52aa shanghai yarong china the initial temperature of gc ms was maintained at 80 c for 2 min and then the temperature was elevated to 250 c with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 and kept for 1 min the gasification temperature is 250 c the flow rate of the carrier gas 99 999 he was 1 ml min 1 with a solvent delay of 4 min the structure of the microbial community was analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction followed by high throughput sequencing hiseq 2500 illumina usa which were performed by major bio co ltd shanghai china dna was extracted using the fast dna spin kit for soil omega usa dna purity was determined by nano drop 2000 and dna integrity by

calculation was accomplished using dmol3 module of materials studio package with the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional and general gradient approximation gga double numerical basis set plus d functions dnd 3 5 basis set and the orbital cutoff was set to medium quality 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical performance of the photocatalytic mfc 3 1 1 characterization of the photocatalyst loaded anode mesoporous mpg c3n4 photocatalyst synthesized with silicon dioxide as template demonstrated highly porous structures with a specific area of 471 m2 g 1 which would provide more active sites for photocatalytic reactions and promote the diffusion of reactants drs analysis fig s1 showed that the synthesized mpg c3n4 had a band gap of 2 70 ev and a cut off adsorption wavelength of 470 nm the mesoporous photocatalyst was successfully loaded on to the carbon felt fiber showing roughly covered filaments under sem imaging compared to the smooth filaments without photocatalyst coupling fig 1 carbon graphite filament network provides a high specific area for the attachment of photocatalyst and electrogenic microbes and the highly porous structure is also beneficial to the efficient mass transfer of substrate and degraded intermediates the 3d networks of the carbon felt filaments might also have effect on the integrity and distribution of the electrogenic biofilm 3 1 2 improved electrochemical performance the acclimation of the mfc anode biofilm was realized with the co culture of sodium acetate and stepwise increased concentrations of tcp of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 a three continuous cycles under each tcp concentration demonstrated gradual increase of voltage output proving the successful adaption of the biofilm to tcp it finally reached the maximum voltage of 419 mv with 200 mg l 1 tcp which is similar to that using sodium acetate as the only substrate the life cycle increased with the increase of tcp concentration showing 36 1 h 56 5 h and 72 9 h with the addition of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 tcp cutoff voltage of 50 mv average of 3 cycles which also suggested that the mfc anode was gradually building up its tolerance to tcp the illumination of the photocatalytic electrogenic anode enabled faster acclimation of the output voltage to a higher steady state which was 1 3 h to reach 439 mv compared to 2 3 h to reach 385 mv of mfc without light illumination fig 2b the power generation of the photocatalytic mfc yielded a higher maximum power density of 19 8 w m 3 while mfc without illumination produced a maximum power density of 17 6 w m 3 this is consistent with previous study that power generation was enhanced from 850 mw m 2 to 1284 mw m 2 by connecting a photocatalytic anode to the bioanode of a microbial fuel cell kim et al 2018 upon illumination the photocatalyst loaded electrode generated photo electrons which may add into the external circuit and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction at the air cathode improving the overall electricity generation performance of the mfc cv results demonstrated that there were distinct differences between the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode and the unilluminated electrogenic anode with tcp addition fig 3 a there is only one reduction peak at 0 14 v vs she in the unilluminated electrogenic anode without any oxidation peaks observed suggesting that the direct oxidation of tcp might be very trivial or not likely to happen without light illumination previous results show that the macroscopic redox potential windows of g sulfurreducens cytochromes mostly covered the negative values and there is the omcf that covers the positive value santos et al 2015 however the electrogenic anode with sodium acetate as substrate showed no reduction peak inset of fig 3a indicating that the distinction of electrolyte makes the difference so we attribute the only reduction peak to 200 mg l 1 tcp in the electrolyte either the redox substances produced by the domesticated biofilm or the chemical redox reactions might bring about the reduction peak in accord with the microbial community analysis hereinafter phenazine as a redox mediator secreted by pseudomonas which dominated in the biofilm of anode inoculated by tcp might be the most likely reason for the reduction peak in the unilluminated group jayapriya and ramamurthy 2012 qiao et al 2017 moreover both reduction and oxidation peaks were observed with the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode it might be attributed to the oxidation of tcp by photo excited holes which would not happen in systems without light illumination liang and zhu 2016 in addition the reduction peak of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode was shifted to a more positive value compared to the unilluminated one 0 25 v versus 0 14 v vs she this might be due to the photocatalytic process generating photo excited electrons that had a higher energy to reduce tcp in the electrolyte also the photo excited electrons might also transfer to the cathode and reduce tcp on the cathode electrode it is worth to notice that the current of the illuminated system was 1 9 fold of the unilluminated one 5 34 a m2 vs 2 80 a m2 fig 3a showing that the coupled system significantly enhanced the electron transfer compared to the electrogenic biofilm anode this is consistent with the improved voltage output and power generation fig 2b and c improved power generation was also explained by eis analysis fig 3b the ohmic resistance of the unilluminated electrogenic anode was 7 0 ω which was 2 8 fold of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode 2 5 ω and the charge transfer resistance of the illuminated photocatalytic electrogenic anode was 3 8 ω which was much lower than that of the unilluminated electrogenic anode 17 5 ω the results indicate that faster mass transfer might achieved under light illumination there were several reactions might progress regarding the electron transfer under light illumination both holes and photo electrons had the possibility to directly react with tcp and promote the electron transfer and the photo electrons could also migrate to the cathode via the external circuit and reacted with oxygen or tcp resulting in the increase of electron transfer rate and the reduction of mfc resistances 3 2 tcp degradation of photocatalytic mfc tcp degradation efficiencies were analyzed in mfc systems with and without illumination under open circuit and closed circuit to verify the contribution of the following process 1 the non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under open circuit condition without illumination oc dark including biodegradation processes on the anode biofilm non electrogenic in the solution and on the cathode biofilm 2 the electrogenic and non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under closed circuit condition without illumination cc dark 3 the photocatalytic degradation process and the non electrogenic biodegradation process operated under open circuit condition with illumination oc light and 4 the photocatalytic process electrogenic process and non electrogenic process operated under closed circuit condition with illumination cc light with lower tcp concentration of 50 mg l 1 the degradation of tcp in mfcs operated under the cc light condition completed within 24 h which was faster than all other working conditions specifically the illuminated mfc cc light showed 20 4 more tcp degradation than the one without illumination cc dark in the first 10 h showing advantages of the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process tcp with low initial concentration 50 mg l 1 could be degraded within 72 h even under the oc dark condition suggesting that the non electrogenic process was very critical for tcp removal with the increase of tcp to 100 mg l 1 all operational conditions demonstrated lower removal efficiencies it took 48 h for the coupled photocatlytic electrogenic system cc light to completely degrade tcp which was longer than the 24 h for 50 mg l 1 tcp this was due to the toxicity of tcp that decreased the efficiency of the biodegradation processes drastic advantages of the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic system cc light was observed over all other operating conditions when tcp concentration was elevated to a higher concentration of 200 mg l 1 fig 4 c tcp degradation of 79 3 was achieved in 10 h which was 20 1 higher than the one without photocatalysis 66 0 for cc dark and complete tcp degradation was achieved in 72 h comparing mfcs without photocatalysis oc dark and cc dark the extracellular electron transfer process of the electrogenic biofilm was responsible for 23 7 of the tcp degradation in 72 h 93 6 for cc dark vs 69 9 for oc dark for open circuit system with illumination oc light the tcp degradation improved by 16 3 86 2 for oc light vs 69 9 for oc dark the effect of photocatalysis became weakened as the concentration became higher by comparing the differences between tcp degradation of 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 in oc light and oc dark fig 4a c this is consistent with traditional photocatalytic process that the degradation efficiency decreases with the increase of contaminant concentration benbachir et al 2017 the inset of fig 4c indicates that there existed 2 stage reaction rates once light was turned off for oc light and cc light after 10 h the reaction rate k1 of cc light of the first 10 h 0 157 h 1 light on is the highest of all k1 and k2 rates suggesting that the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic process improved the degradation of tcp at a higher reaction rate by removing the light of cc light after 10 h the reaction rate decreased to 0 032 h 1 showing the decreased tcp removal efficiency by removing the photocatalytic process however k2 of cc light was still the highest among all operating conditions suggesting that by integrating the photocatalytic process the intermediate degradation products were easier to be biodegraded by a normal mfc toc removal efficiencies of tcp with 1 g l 1 sodium acetate as co substrate showed the same trend with three original concentrations cc light cc dark oc light oc dark fig 4d cc light demonstrated the best performance of 95 1 removal which was higher than oc dark at 86 0 the toc removal of oc light was lower than the cc dark mode 91 4 for oc light vs 91 9 for cc dark showing that the carbonization capability of photocatalysis was not as efficient as the electrogenic biofilm with the intimate coupling of photocatalytic electrogenic biofilm cc light the toc removal was higher than cc dark and oc light showing that the coupling of both strategies was beneficial for the degradation of tcp within a wide range of original concentration what s more important a relatively long cycle was selected to ensure the complete degradation of tcp in at least one operation condition 72 h the advantages of the intimate coupling of the photocatalytic electrogenic process would become more tremendous with short cycles due to its higher degradation kinetics thus the realization of treating practical wastewater using this intimately coupled system is in prospect and further research of nutrient removal will be needed due to the complicated composition of practical wastewater babaei et al 2018 further investigations on how the anode potential would affect the tcp removal efficiency would be necessary as well and applying an external voltage to the system might also increase tcp removal zhang et al 2019 3 3 degradation pathways of tcp based on the determination of intermediate products conducted by gc ms and lc ms the degradation pathway was studied with the density functional theory dft approach fig 5 several major intermediates 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzenediol 2 6 dchq 6 chloro 1 2 4 benzenetriol 6 chq 2 chlorophenol 2 mcp p benzoquinone pbq and 2 chloro 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid 2 cma were determined after 5 h degradation in the coupled system fig 5a while 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp 2 mcp and 2 6 dchq were observed in the photocatalytic only system fig 5b the reactivity of the initial reactant and the intermediates were evaluated by calculations of molecular electrostatic potential mep fukui function and bond order table 1 the mep plays an important role in the initial interaction of two molecules when they are approaching each other as the electrophilic species prefer to attack a molecule at sites where the mep is most negative politzer and murray 2007 the electrostatic potential map isovalue 0 016 a u of 2 4 6 tcp demonstrated the most active sites for the electrophilic attack are cl9 and o12 table 1 according to frontier orbital theory the fukui function describes the change of electron density with the insertion or loss of an electron in the homo or lumo orbitals the fukui function could predict the most active sites for electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical f 0 attack of a molecule presenting by the fukui indices cheng et al 2017 the f of cl9 was only second to cl11 in 2 4 6 tcp so the electrophilic substitution was preferred at cl9 position and cl9 was dechlorinated to generate 2 4 dcp in addition the f 0at cl11 was maximum which explained the generation of 2 6 dchq as the consequence of free radical oh attack at cl11 2 4 dcp the electrophilic attack product of 2 4 6 tcp exhibits negative mep region at o10 and cl12 as indicated by the red cloud in table 1 which was vulnerable to electrophilic attack moreover the f of cl12 was maximum in 2 4 dcp thus cl12 was easily oxidized to produce 2 mcp for 2 mep it shows the mep map that negative region was located around o12 and the aromatic ring although the meps provide insight into molecular recognition processes such as enzyme substrate and drug receptor interactions they may overlook the polarization of the molecule by the incoming species levine 2012 on this occasion the fukui function f played a leading role to determine the electrophilic sites as cl11 of 2 mcp demonstrated the maximum f function cl11 was most likely to be removed to generate phenol through microbial metabolism phenol was further oxidized to benzoquinone and mineralized to co2 eventually as the radical attack product of 2 4 6 tcp 2 6 dchq was prone to radical attack at cl12 with a maximum f 0 value and transformed to 6 chq moreover it was possible for 2 6 dchq to be dechlorinated and oxidized to pbq from the perspective of the mep and the fukui function f the mep map of 6 chq displayed strong negative potential region around o13 which was vulnerable to electrophilic attack and be oxidized to generate 2 cma it calls for special attention that one open chain compound 2 cma was only detected in the photocatalytic mfc system but not in the photocatalytic only process the further breaking of the c cl of 2 cma would generate 4 keto 2 hexenedioic acid and then convert to 3 ketoadipic acid forming a series of small molecules of organic acid that lead to the final carbonization comparing to photocatalytic only process microbial metabolism played an important role in decomposing the small molecules which were not detected by gc ms or lc ms in the coupled system as a result the microbial behaviors might regulate the degradation pathway of the coupled system and increased mineralization efficiency as a conclusion the coupled photocatalytic electrogenic system was more capable of ring cleavage for complete mineralization of tcp than the photocatalytic only process 3 4 microbial community analysis of photocatalytic mfc relative abundances of the anode biofilm genera were shown in fig 6 a only the genera whose proportion of community abundance 2 was indicated there were 3 types of anode biofilm being analyzed anode cultivated using sodium acetate as the only substrate naac anode anode cultivated by co substrate of sodium acetate and 2 4 6 tcp naac tcp anode and anode cultivated with co substrate with photo illumination photo naac tcp anode th as geobacter 46 0 which is a standard electrogenic species widely observed in mfcs kumar et al 2015 logan and regan 2006 nevertheless the most abundant genera in biofilms of the naac tcp anode and photo naac tcp anode was pseudomonas which has critical functionalities in electrogenic biofilm by promoting the acclimation biofilms and enhances the degradation of tcp with its abundant metabolic pathways light illumination also has a significant impact on microbial population which further increased the abundance of pseudomonas to 54 3 compared to the one without illumination naac tcp anode 21 9 zhang et al 2012 besides there was a small amount of rhodococcus determined with abundances of 11 5 and 6 8 in naac tcp anode and photo naac tcp anode respectively which was recognized to be capable of degrading a variety of aromatic compounds especially chlorophenols xiao et al 2015 xie et al 2017 both pseudomonas and rhodococcus were not found in anode cultivated with sodium acetate naac anode and geobacter which was rich in the naac anode was not observed in the naac tcp anode and only 6 7 in the photo naac tcp anode suggesting that geobacter was poorly tolerant to tcp and the integration of photocatalysis helped reducing the toxicity and enabling a few amount of geobacter to grow in the biofilm what s more it was the abundance of pseudomonas that enhanced the mfc performance and tcp degradation performance in the co substrate system naac tcp anode microbial analysis of the biofilm formed on the air cathode showed that the dominant genera were pseudomonas 4 1 and bacteroidetes 11 8 in mfcs with naac as the only substrate fig 6b the latter one of which was well recognized as a fermentation bacteria capable of hydrolyzing organic matter in mfcs borole et al 2011 dennis et al 2013 pseudomonas naac tcp cathode of 5 2 vs photo naac tcp cathode of 15 6 and rhodococcus naac tcp cathode of 53 7 vs photo naac tcp cathode of 31 4 became the dominant genera in the co substrate cultivated mfc besides the amount of rhodococcus in cathode biofilm was much more than that in the homologous anode implying that microorganisms in the cathode biofilm played a crucial role in degrading tcp further experiments using two chamber microbial fuel cells separating the anode and cathode would be beneficial for deep understanding of the contribution of the biofilms on anode and cathode respectively the degradation mechanism was summarized based on the above analysis of intermediates and microbial population as shown in fig 7 the following processes were suggested 1 the photocatalytic process 2 the electrogenic process 3 the coupled photocatalytic process 4 the non electrogenic biodegradation process on cathode and in solution that are actively involved in the final mineralization of tcp 4 conclusion an intimately coupled photocatalytic electrogenic mfc system was developed for synergic degradation of tcp by integrating mpg c3n4 on the anode the coupled system demonstrated higher electrochemical performance with higher power generation and tcp removal compared to mfcs without photocatalysis the degradation pathways of tcp were considered to be the combination of photocatalytic process and mfc process which integrated to enhance the mineralization of tcp by utilizing intermediates produced with photocatalysis by the biofilm anode pseudomonas instead of geobacter was revealed to dominate in the mfc biofilm with tcp and the photocatalytic process further increased the proportion of pseudomonas rhodococcus was found rich in cathode biofilm suggesting that the cathode biofilm was also critical for tcp removal in conclusion this coupled photocatalytic mfc optimized the microbial population and formed synergetic effect on recalcitrant organics removal by combining the photocatalytic and electrogenic processes demonstrating its capability for industrial wastewater treatment with simultaneous electricity production to improve the performances the configuration of the photocatalytic mfc reactor could be further investigated to combine the advantages of current photocatalytic reactor for large scale applications watanabe 2008 and the effect of anodic potential on the performance of the photocatalytic process as well as the electrogenic process should also be considered acknowledgement this work was supported jointly by natural science foundation of china 51878309 51608217 51508213 21607046

18897,cyanobacterial blooms represent a worldwide problem in freshwater as well as marine ecosystems as producers of various toxic compounds this study provides environmentally important information about the common presence of mixtures of retinoids in various water bodies associated with the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms dominated by many different species the study documents for the first time that retinoids are produced by environmental cyanobacterial blooms dominated by species belonging to different genera such as microcystis dolichospermum planktothrix woronichinia pseudanabaena and others samples of biomass of cyanobacterial blooms and their surrounding water were collected from seventeen independent freshwater bodies across the czech republic during summer 2015 retinoid like activity was detected by an in vitro reporter gene bioassay in water samples from 8 out of 17 localities with a maximal activity of 263 ng all trans retinoic acid equivalent req l in comparison in vitro assessment of biomass extracts documented retinoid like activity at 11 out of 17 localities with a maximal retinoid like activity of 867 ng req g dry mass dm individual retinoids were detected by chemical analyses in all water samples and in 16 out of 17 biomass samples with 4keto retinal and all trans 5 6epoxy retinoic acid being detected in aquatic ecosystems for the first time further all trans 4keto retinoic acid and retinal were the most commonly detected compounds in both types of samples with respect to retinoid like activity a large proportion was explained in some samples by contributions of individual detected retinoids calculated from their concentrations and relative potencies however results also indicate that other unknown compounds with a retinoic acid receptor mediated mode of action were present the revealed widespread production of retinoids by cyanobacterial blooms dominated by diverse species across various aquatic ecosystems and their common presence in both biomass and surrounding water raises concern namely because some retinoids belong to the most potent teratogens these compounds need to be taken into consideration in the assessment of risks associated with massive cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria retinoids water bloom retinoid like activity 1 introduction over the past decades freshwater cyanobacterial blooms have become a very concerning issue due to their mass development in many water bodies associated with adverse effects on other organisms including human and in some cases ecosystem functioning hallegraeff 2010 it has been well documented that cyanobacteria are able to produce diverse groups of toxins that can have an impact on various processes in exposed organisms these compounds can enter the food webs and adversely affect biota at different trophic levels kudela et al 2015 very important is the fact that various species of cyanobacteria are capable of both extracellular and intracellular production of toxic compounds and thus they can not only adversely affect organisms that graze on them but all organisms linked to the surrounding water harmful effects of cyanobacterial metabolites were described in various aquatic e g fish or amphibians as well as terrestrial organisms e g birds or mammals including humans jonas et al 2014 paskerová et al 2012 skocovska et al 2007 wiegand and pflugmacher 2005 both production and effects of known cyanobacterial toxins such as microcystins cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and others have been well reviewed in ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 ibelings and chorus 2007 singh et al 2005 or wiegand and pflugmacher 2005 but recent reports show evidence of new toxic products of cyanobacterial metabolism endocrine disrupting compounds have been discussed as potential novel toxic products of cyanobacteria in the last decade essa and fathy 2014 falconer 2006 one group of cyanobacterial products that act as endocrine disruptors are compounds generally referred to as retinoids retinoids are very similar to steroids in mechanisms of action via nuclear receptors and activation of target genes expression evans and mangelsdorf 2014 retinoids are generally thought of as vertebrate specific dietary hormones which are necessary for many physiological functions duong and rochette egly 2011 particularly they have a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation processes during embryogenesis reproduction or neoplasia de luca 1991 studies focused on the effects of retinoids on living organisms have also demonstrated that this group of compounds contains some of the most potent animal teratogens teratogens are chemicals that can interfere with normal embryonic development and have adverse effects on growth and functions xing et al 2015 exposure of embryos to excess of exogenous retinoids causes a number of defects such as disruption of the central nervous system or urogenital system including reproduction bryant and gardiner 1992 herrmann 1995 moreover retinoids are also discussed in connection to human nervous system disorders such as autism london 2000 or schizophrenia palha and goodman 2006 however the original function of retinoids in cyanobacteria is unclear in plants phototaxis initiated by conversion of all trans retinoic acid atra to 13cis retinoic acid 13cis ra was described this reaction is also very important for flagellated organisms for example green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii because it is a propulsive step to movement of flagellates blomhoff and blomhoff 2006 furthermore retinoids presumably play a facilitating role in photosynthesis ke et al 2005 showed that retinoic acid binds with high affinity to a specific type of cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp120a1 in the thylakoid membrane this indicates the connection between retinoids and cytochrome enzymes involved in primary processes of photosynthesis sources of retinoids in aquatic environment can be both anthropogenic and natural anthropogenic retinoids originate from pharmaceuticals nutrition supplements feed additives food industry and cosmetics while natural retinoids in the environment come from precursor carotenoids maiani et al 2009 photosynthetic organisms are endowed with carotenoids for optimal processing of light energy thus the fact that cyanobacteria have been newly identified as a source of retinoids is not surprising however potential production of retinoids by cyanobacteria and their release into water bodies in connection with mass development of cyanobacterial blooms is a very relevant environmental problem because imbalance in retinoid metabolism in vertebrates including humans can lead to numerous adverse effects as is described above the occurrence of retinoids in environmental cyanobacterial biomass and surrounding water has been investigated in just two studies javůrek et al 2015 wu et al 2013 2012 the first study on retinoids produced by cyanobacteria in the environment was published by wu et al 2012 2013 this pioneering study that focused on cyanobacterial water blooms with microcystis dominancy and their surrounding water in taihu lake china has been the first to show the potential of these blooms to produce retinoids the subsequent study of javůrek et al 2015 was focused on cyanobacterial water blooms with dominance of microcystis in independent water bodies in the czech republic and this research confirmed the capability of these blooms to produce retinoids however both publications show the production of retinoids only by cyanobacterial blooms with dominant species from the genus microcystis javůrek et al 2015 documented not only the occurrence of two individual retinoic acids but also the total retinoid like activity mediated by the retinoic acid receptor determined by an in vitro bioassay of the compound mixtures present in water bloom biomasses as well as in surrounding water the study indicated a high proportional contribution of unknown compounds to the detected retinoid like activity in both biomass and water a few studies reported retinoid like activity and or presence of some retinoids in biomass and exudates from laboratory cultures of several widespread cyanobacterial species including both coccal and filamentous cyanobacteria e g from genera microcystis aphanizomenon cylindrospermopsis or limnothrix priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2013 2012 nevertheless the environmental relevance of the production of retinoids has so far been documented only for freshwater cyanobacterial blooms dominated by microcystis species while there is no information on retinoid like activity or production of retinoids related to any water blooms dominated by other species moreover there is very limited information regarding the role of the detected retinoids in the observed total retinoid like activity this paper is focused on the characterization of retinoid like activity in the aquatic environment in connection to cyanobacterial blooms with various dominant species in independent water bodies retinoid like activity of the compound mixtures in both water bloom biomass and surrounding water was investigated and the blooms were thoroughly explored from the taxonomic point of view the study also examined the presence of several retinoids potentially associated with cyanobacterial blooms in both biomass and water and their contribution to total retinoid like activity detected in freshwater aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and locality description biomasses of cyanobacterial blooms and samples of surrounding water were collected from water bodies with bloom occurrence to study intracellular and extracellular concentration of retinoid like compounds the biomass and its surrounding water were sampled from 17 independent stagnant water bodies across south bohemia and south moravia in the czech republic sampling localities are shown in fig 1 and physicochemical properties of sampled water bodies are included in supplementary materials table s1 sampling was carried out during four sampling days between august 12 and september 16 2015 for sampling of both surrounding water and cyanobacterial biomass a plankton net 20 μm mesh was used while the biomass samples were concentrated using the plankton net the surrounding water samples were collected from the water that passed through the walls of the net and further filtered after transport to the laboratory at all sampling localities water was collected in 2 5 l dark glass bottles transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c in the dark for the purposes of taxonomic classification 40 ml of both biomass concentrated by the plankton net and non concentrated phytoplankton were collected into 50 ml falcon tubes 10 ml of 10 aqueous formaldehyde solution was added final concentration 2 to fixate the samples immediately after sampling collected samples were processed as described below within 24 h after transportation to the laboratory 2 2 taxonomic determination taxonomic characterization of collected samples of both the biomass concentrated by plankton net and the non concentrated phytoplankton representing its taxonomic composition at each locality was carried out using light microscope olympus x51 olympus japan and a bürker chamber cell numbers per millilitre were also converted into biovolume biomass skacelova and lepš 2014 phytoplankton cell densities at sampled locations as well as percentual species composition based on cell densities per ml are presented in table 1 and the recalculation per biovolume is shown in table s2 2 3 processing of biomass samples after sampling and transport to the laboratory the biomass samples were stored in the freezer at 20 c after that the samples were dried in vacuum freeze dryer freeze dryer gamma 1 16 lscplus martin christ freeze dryers germany and the freeze dried biomass was extracted according to javůrek et al 2015 briefly 200 mg of freeze dried environmental biomass was extracted by sonication for 2 2 min 100 power cycle 0 9 in 5 ml of methanol meoh on ice the test tubes were then centrifuged 3050 g for 5 min the extracts were transferred to glass vials and the biomass was re extracted with 1 ml of meoh 30 s sonication centrifugation 3050 g for 5 min the re extract was added to the first part of the extract another 5 ml of meoh were added to the biomass and all steps were repeated the extracts were evaporated to near dryness by nitrogen stream and diluted in 500 μl methanol to reach biomass concentration of 400 g dry mass dm l 2 4 spe procedure the efficiency of various spe procedures to recover compounds contributing to the retinoid like activity from complex environmental samples was tested on an extract of environmental cyanobacterial biomass sampled from a locality where high retinoid like activity was reported previously the biomass was collected at locality l9 in summer 2013 the biomass sample was collected and processed as described in section 2 3 from a taxonomy point of view this sample was dominated by the species aphanizomenon klebahnii 92 4 the extract of this biomass sample represented suitable material for the spe procedure test due to its considerable retinoid like activity the final extracts were concentrated to 100 g dry mass dm l prior to loading onto the spe column oasis hlb the biomass extract was diluted 100 in deionized water table 2 shows the setup of procedures used for the testing of spe recovery the tested setups were based on our previous experience pre experiments and information from available sources wu et al 2013 2012 2 5 processing of water samples after sampling and transport to the laboratory the water samples were vacuum filtered through 0 6 μm paper filters macherey nagel dueren germany this filtered sample contained compounds present in the water phase at the sampled localities then all field water samples were processed using two procedures 1w and 10w see table 2 according to the following methodology before applying the filtered samples the spe columns 1 g oasis hlb column waters milford usa were conditioned according to the employed procedure the volumes of the applied samples were 2 l the samples were dosed to the cartridges through ptfe tubes with a flow rate of approximately 4 6 ml min after the samples passed through the spe columns the cartridges were dried for 5 min under nitrogen stream and eluted with specific solvents according to table 2 the samples were then evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and re dissolved in methanol to achieve a 4000 fold concentration factor compared to the original environmental water sample 2 6 detection of retinoid like activity by in vitro bioassay the retinoic acid receptor mediated response was tested on the cell line p19 a15 derived from murine embryonic carcinoma cells p19 european collection of cell culture wiltshire uk with endogenous expression of retinoid receptors by stable transfection with reporter luciferase gene under the control of a retinoic acid responsive element prareβ2 tk luc plasmid all tests were conducted in at least two independent replicate experiments the method is described in detail by javůrek et al 2015 the cytotoxicity of processed samples was measured using the calcein am cell viability assay sigma aldrich czech republic at all tested concentrations 2 7 lc ms ms analyses of retinoids a set of 10 retinoids atra 9cis retinoic acid 9cis ra 13cis ra 13cis ra methyl ester 5 6epoxy atra 4keto atra 4keto retinal 4hydroxy atra retinal and retinol was analyzed using the method previously described in priebojova et al 2018 briefly target retinoids were analyzed using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry xevo tq s waters manchester u k with electrospray ionization esi the quantification of analytes was based on the internal standard of atra d5 retinal d5 and 4keto atra d3 ions were detected in the positive mode a scheduled mrm mode was used for monitoring of the respective m z transitions table s3 both limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq for the lc ms ms analysis were derived from the lowest calibration point having the signal to noise ratio higher than 3 1 lod and 10 1 loq supplementary table s5 and s6 2 8 data analyses the total retinoid like activity was determined using the equi effective approach and the results were expressed as atra equivalents req with respect to the atra standard villeneuve et al 2000 relative luminescence units obtained from the in vitro cellular reporter assay were converted to percentages of maximum response of the standard curves with atra ecx values were calculated from the non linear logarithmic regression of dose response curves of calibration standards graphpad prism graphpad software usa to determine significant induction p 0 05 compared to solvent control in vitro data was tested by one way anova followed by dunnett s multiple comparisons test the req of samples was derived as a point estimate from the effect of the maximum tested concentration according to the ecx atra ecx sample where x represents the percentage of induction caused by this effective concentration javůrek et al 2015 for samples where cytotoxicity was detected the req value as well as loq value in case of no significant retinoid like activity were calculated at the level of the greatest non cytotoxic concentration limits of quantification loq were derived on the level of 10 times the average standard deviation sd of blank relative potencies rp of individual compounds were taken from the study of priebojova et al 2018 reqchem was calculated as the sum of contributions from individual compounds obtained by multiplying their rp values by detected concentrations 3 results 3 1 taxonomic characterization the samples were collected from 17 individual stagnant water bodies of different types and size ranging from small village water tanks to large reservoirs fig 1 table s1 diverse taxonomic composition of cyanobacterial water bloom biomass was observed the dominant species over 50 in both biovolume and cells ml at different localities included microcystis aeruginosa microcystis ichtyoblabe dolichospermum flos aquae and planktothrix agardhii a detailed taxonomic composition of the samples from all localities is shown in table 1 based on cells ml and table s2 based on biovolume it is important to stress that the dominance can differ between the values based on the cells ml and biovolume based values in case of presence of species with markedly different cell sizes such as on locality 13 where woronichinia naegeliana dominated in cells ml but played only a minor role in the of biovolume due to its small cell size regarding the potential production of retinoid compounds dry weight biomass the biovolume based relative composition shown in table s2 is more relevant further species that contributed a greater relative proportion to the concentrated biomass biovolume over 25 included cylindrospermopsis raciborskii anabaenopsis elenkii dolichospermum circinale dolichospermum viguieri sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides aphanizomenon flos aquae and woronichinia naegeliana differences between the species composition of the biomass collected by plankton net 20 μm mesh and the phytoplankton samples collected directly from water were observed at a few localities this phenomenon is caused by the size of the mesh in the plankton net species with small cells or narrow filaments can pass through the net mesh planktothrix agardhii can serve as a typical example of such species as is evident from the comparison of taxonomic composition of biomass and phytoplankton from locality 9 3 2 recovery of spe procedure the recovery of various spe procedures was assessed to maximize the detectability of retinoid like activity from field samples the most effective procedure with the greatest recovery of retinoid like activity was variant 10 fig 2 where the retinoid like activity after spe did not differ significantly from the activity of the extract before spe processing this documents very high recovery of this spe procedure for the mixture of compounds causing the detected retinoid like activity for this reason this spe variant has been selected for the processing of the field samples the second method selected for spe processing of field water samples was variant 1 due to its use in earlier studies focused on the analysis of retinoid like activity in the environment javůrek et al 2015 and lab cultivations priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2014 to enable comparability of the obtained results with previous studies 3 3 retinoid like activity of water samples all field samples of surrounding water of cyanobacterial blooms processed by the two selected spe procedures see section 3 2 were tested in vitro to determine their retinoid like activity both procedures 1w and 10w have proven to be suitable for recovering compounds causing retinoid like activity from environmental water samples the samples were measured at a concentration factor of 2 5 20 times compared to the original surface water the results show that retinoid like activity was detectable in the water from 8 out of the total 17 localities with procedure 1w leading to more frequent detection than 10w fig 3 detected retinoid like activities varied between 15 and 263 ng req l in active samples table 3 and supplementary table s4 the highest retinoid like activity was detected in the water from locality 9 processed by the spe procedure 10w cytotoxic effects were observed in a few surrounding water samples at the greatest tested concentrations which affected the detectability of the retinoid like activity and the derived loq values as is obvious from table 3 and s4 3 4 retinoid like activity of cyanobacterial biomass in the samples of cyanobacterial biomass retinoid like activity could be quantified at 11 of the total 17 localities table 3 fig 4 retinoid like activities have been re calculated to reqs and their values varied between loq and 867 ng g dm the highest retinoid like activity was detected in the biomass from locality 9 similarly as in the case of surrounding water samples the activity was not detectable below loq of 273 595 ng g dm at localities 1 4 5 7 8 and 12 nevertheless the extracts of biomass from these localities caused significant cytotoxicity which led to high loq values in more than half of the biomass samples cytotoxicity was detected at tested concentration 1 and or 2 g dm l cytotoxicity was observed in samples from localities 1 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 despite this retinoid like activity was detectable at non cytotoxic concentrations and thus higher than the loq for some of these biomasses the level of cytotoxicity was taken into consideration in the determination of both req and loq the cytotoxicity led to greater loqs for some samples table 3 and supplementary table s4 3 5 lc ms ms analyses of retinoids three of the 10 analyzed retinoids 13cis ra methyl ester retinol and 4hydroxy atra were not detected at concentrations greater than their loq neither in the water samples nor the biomass supplementary tables s5 and s6 the concentrations of individual retinoids in samples of surrounding water ranged from below loq to 79 9 ng l 4keto atra water samples from every locality contained at least trace but detectable levels of some of the analyzed retinoids fig 5 and supplementary table s5 the most frequently detected retinoids in field samples of surrounding water were 5 6epoxy atra and 4keto atra these forms were detected in 13 and 16 of all collected samples of surrounding water respectively some of the studied retinoids were also detected in biomasses from all sampling localities except for locality 5 concentrations of different retinoids in biomasses ranged from values below loq to 1088 ng g dm the most common types of retinoids present in the field biomass samples were retinal and 4keto atra fig 6 and supplementary table s6 these forms were detected in 16 and 14 collected biomass samples respectively total retinoid equivalents of detected retinoids ʃreqchem table 4 were calculated from their relative potencies and concentrations in samples supplementary tables s5 and s6 values of ʃreqchem in surrounding water samples across localities ranged from 0 22 ng req l locality 14 to 65 9 ng req l locality 9 comparison of reqin vitro with ʃreqchem of target compounds allows the assessment of the contribution of detected compounds to observed in vitro effects table 4 in samples of surrounding water the highest degree of explanation was found in the sample from locality 2 processed by the spe procedure 10w where 71 9 of the reqin vitro could be explained by ʃreqchem in contrast the degree of explanation was only 0 2 for the water from locality 14 processed by the spe procedure 1w which means that other not analyzed compounds were likely responsible for the effects values of ʃreqchem in biomass samples ranged from 1 5 ng req g dm l4 to 863 ng req g dm l9 the percentual contribution ʃreqchem of target compounds to detected in vitro effects by is shown in table 4 the highest degree of retinoid like effect explicability was observed for the biomass samples from localities 9 and 10 where the detected compounds almost completely explained the activity detected by the in vitro assay in contrast the lowest degree of explanation was found in the case of the biomass sample from locality 16 where the percentage contribution of detected retinoids to the total in vitro effect is only 0 9 again pointing to major role of unidentified compounds 4 discussion cyanobacterial blooms represent a global problem in freshwater and marine ecosystems they can produce various bioactive and toxic compounds with potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and humans this study demonstrates that freshwater blooms with diverse taxonomic compositions can produce a spectrum of retinoids and retinoid like activity is a common mode of action of mixtures of cyanobacterial metabolites both intra and extracellular the impact of retinoids on the development of vertebrates has been studied in detail since the 1970s bunt milam and saari 1983 eichele 1989 mccormick et al 1978 however the production of retinoids by cyanobacteria has not been known until recently and the relevance of these compounds in the environment needs to be elucidated so far only a few studies dealing with retinoids and their relation to the cyanobacterial blooms and living organisms have been published these pioneering studies provide the first insights into the potentially wide distribution and teratogenic effects of cyanobacteria associated retinoids javůrek et al 2015 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2012 our study brings new information regarding retinoid like activity and presence of individual retinoids in the aquatic ecosystems and their contribution to the total retinoid like activity notably it proves that the occurrence of retinoids in water bodies is associated with cyanobacterial blooms dominated by diverse genera not only by microcystis species moreover our study documents the presence of retinoids in every examined body of water and for the first time it reports the occurrence of 5 6epoxy atra and 4keto retinal in aquatic ecosystems as described in recent papers el shehawy et al 2012 halstvedt et al 2008 javůrek et al 2015 the production of biologically active compounds including retinoids by cyanobacteria is strongly dependent on environmental conditions and the physiological state of the cyanobacteria this also means that the levels of retinoids in the environment can vary in response to biotic and abiotic factors in our work significant differences in retinoid like activity and retinoids concentrations were observed namely among the surrounding water samples from studied localities several factors could contribute to this phenomenon the observed differences can be related to various species compositions of cyanobacterial blooms as well as to the growth phase of the bloom and the condition of the cells in the bloom also environmental factors such as nutrient level especially nitrogen and phosphorus temperature light conditions or ph can significantly influence metabolites production as has been reported for other cyanotoxin groups neilan et al 2013 oh et al 2017 moreover cyanobacteria can benefit from specific allelopathic interactions in microbial communities song et al 2017 which can also affect the production of metabolites the levels of retinoid like compounds in water associated with cyanobacterial blooms have been studied in just two regions in the world the czech republic and china javůrek et al 2015 wu et al 2012 these studies showed that mass development of cyanobacterial blooms with dominance of the microcystis species is linked to the production of retinoids in our study the highest observed retinoid like activity among the water samples was 263 ng req l which is 10 times higher than the activities detected by javůrek et al 2015 in addition the highest total concentration of an individual retinoid was 128 ng l which is more than 6 times higher than the amount of retinoids in water observed by wu et al 2012 primarily the results indicate that the frequency of occurrence and levels of retinoid substances in water is much greater than was earlier assumed the retinoid like activity in water reached levels which are closer to reqs causing in vivo effects in zebrafish embryos jonas et al 2014 moreover retinoid like activity was detectable and quantifiable in surrounding water and biomass at 8 and 11 out of 17 sampled localities using in vitro tests the rest of the biomass samples where activity was not quantifiable caused significant cytotoxicity in the bioassay leading to high loq values as is obvious from table 3 these loqs are higher than reqs quantified at some other localities therefore these samples might contain compounds with retinoid like activity but their quantification by the in vitro bioassay was not possible due to the high cytotoxicity this assumption is supported by the results of the chemical analysis which detected retinoids in 16 out of 17 biomass samples in the case of the chemical analysis of water samples retinoids were even detected in all 17 samples despite their low concentration these results document that the production of retinoids by freshwater cyanobacterial blooms is a common phenomenon spread out across various water bodies with a significant potential impact on organisms in aquatic ecosystems as was mentioned above the presence of retinoid like compounds in cyanobacterial blooms and their surrounding waters has so far been detected only in blooms dominated by microcystis species javůrek et al 2015 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2012 however the production of retinoid like substances by cyanobacteria under laboratory conditions has already been observed for several cyanobacterial species including anabaena aphanizomenon cylindrospermopsis and others priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2014 wu et al 2013 cyanobacterial blooms associated with retinoids in our study were dominated by species such as microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum flos aque planktothrix agardhii and woronichinia naegeliana table 1 and s2 this is a clear indication of the fact that retinoids can be produced by cyanobacterial blooms formed by various species however for a detailed understanding of the species specific production of retinoids in cyanobacteria it is necessary to reveal the genetic and molecular background of retinoid synthesis in the cyanobacterial genome in the last two decades the presence of retinoids was confirmed in both the animal and plant kingdom and newly also in cyanobacteria several forms of retinoids were observed both in field studies and in studies focused on laboratory cultured cyanobacteria these substances can have significant effects on organisms in the environment but the relative contribution of individual retinoid analogues to total retinoid like effects varies significantly in animal cells the metabolic pathway of retinoids starts with carotenoids however in cyanobacteria the process of retinoid biosynthesis is based on apocarotenoids this is the fundamental difference in retinoid biosynthesis between both groups of organisms further the first observed apocarotenoid cleavage enzyme was lignostilbene dioxygenase diox1 in the cyanobacteria synechocystis sp pcc 6803 ruch et al 2005 this enzyme catalyses the cleavage of apocarotenoids to retinal this step of the biosynthesis process suggests a reason why retinal is one of the most common forms of retinoids detected in our work in both the biomass and surrounding water moreover diox1 was present in all sequenced cyanobacteria both unicellular and filamentous species in the work of ruch et al 2005 which suggests a versatile distribution of diox1 moreover retinal is the basic building block for other retinoids in various organisms for instance one of the metabolites of retinal is 4keto retinal which has identical properties to the bacterial membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin weetall et al 1997 our work suggests that this retinal metabolite is also produced by cyanobacteria as this is the first report of 4keto retinal from aquatic ecosystems in animals retinal is described as substrate for the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase which performs irreversible conversion of retinal to atra our results indicate that atra is one of the most common and abundant retinoids in water bodies with cyanobacterial blooms therefore one can assume the presence of a similar enzyme in cyanobacteria this presumption is also supported by a study by hong et al 2016 where retinal dehydrogenase was identified in bacterium bacillus cereus atra shows the highest teratogenic potency among currently described retinoids priebojova et al 2018 and so it represents a possible hazard for vertebrates in water bodies however atra is not the only metabolite of retinal retinol has also been described as a direct metabolite of retinal it has been observed that the reversible interconversion of retinol and retinal in animals is catalyzed by members of the alcohol dehydrogenase and short chain dehydrogenase reductase enzyme families duester 1996 however the presence or absence of these compounds in cyanobacteria is very controversial and we did not detect retinol neither in the water nor in the biomass samples the possible explanations might be that either retinol is not produced by cyanobacteria at all or it is very quickly converted to retinal during sample processing its greater detection limits may also play a role this phenomenon should be studied in the future 4keto atra was the most abundant retinoid in both the biomass and the surrounding water this compound is probably a metabolite of 4hydroxy atra which is a direct metabolite of atra however this has not been described in cyanobacteria while 4hydroxy atra has not been detected in water nor biomass yet probably due to its greater loq table s5 s6 4keto atra has been found in 16 and 13 out of 17 localities in water and biomass respectively despite the rather low relative potency of 4keto atra the presence of this compound is important due to its relatively high concentrations in comparison to other retinoids analyzed in this study and its wide distribution in surrounding water as well as biomass interestingly 4keto atra was detected at concentrations up to μg g dm table s6 which is comparable to other cyanobacterial metabolites such as cylindrospermopsin or microcystin bittencourt oliveira et al 2014 pekar et al 2016 the second atra derivate which was detected in a considerable number of water samples at 13 out of 17 localities is 5 6epoxy atra the high relative potency of this compound 0 7 can lead to its strong impact on total req however it was detected only in two samples of biomass this is probably affected by high matrix effects which influenced the detection limit nevertheless this is the first report of 5 6epoxy atra as a product of the cyanobacterial bloom from the environment while this compound is known to be involved in retinoid metabolism in the animal kingdom marill et al 2000 nothing is known about its biosynthesis and function in cyanobacteria two other retinoids which were detected in several water and biomass samples but were impossible to separate during our lc ms ms analysis are 9cis ra and 13cis ra their presence has been observed at 9 and 3 out of 17 localities in water and biomass respectively however their concentrations were rather low and thus they had no significant impact on total req 5 conclusions this study provides novel important information about the levels of retinoids and total retinoid like activity in stagnant water bodies affected by cyanobacterial blooms the results of this study highlight the fact that retinoids are produced by cyanobacterial blooms with various different dominant species this demonstrates that the production of retinoids by cyanobacteria in the environment is much more common than was previously thought the detected retinoid like activity in water reached values 10 times higher than in earlier studies the relevance of individual retinoids to the detected bioactivity can be understood from the presented concentrations and from the information about their contribution to the total effect our results document that retinoids need to be taken into consideration in the assessment of risks associated with massive cyanobacterial blooms however the results also suggested that still other compounds with retinoic acid receptor mediated modes of action are present and thus the total retinoid like activity determined in bioassays can be a better indicator of the potential toxic effects of the mixture than the concentrations of individual compounds that should be a subject of further study including research which will focus on cyanobacterial production of retinoids on a genomic level the knowledge of their presence possible interactions with organisms as well as better characterization of their biosynthetic pathways in cyanobacteria are necessary for a more

18897,cyanobacterial blooms represent a worldwide problem in freshwater as well as marine ecosystems as producers of various toxic compounds this study provides environmentally important information about the common presence of mixtures of retinoids in various water bodies associated with the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms dominated by many different species the study documents for the first time that retinoids are produced by environmental cyanobacterial blooms dominated by species belonging to different genera such as microcystis dolichospermum planktothrix woronichinia pseudanabaena and others samples of biomass of cyanobacterial blooms and their surrounding water were collected from seventeen independent freshwater bodies across the czech republic during summer 2015 retinoid like activity was detected by an in vitro reporter gene bioassay in water samples from 8 out of 17 localities with a maximal activity of 263 ng all trans retinoic acid equivalent req l in comparison in vitro assessment of biomass extracts documented retinoid like activity at 11 out of 17 localities with a maximal retinoid like activity of 867 ng req g dry mass dm individual retinoids were detected by chemical analyses in all water samples and in 16 out of 17 biomass samples with 4keto retinal and all trans 5 6epoxy retinoic acid being detected in aquatic ecosystems for the first time further all trans 4keto retinoic acid and retinal were the most commonly detected compounds in both types of samples with respect to retinoid like activity a large proportion was explained in some samples by contributions of individual detected retinoids calculated from their concentrations and relative potencies however results also indicate that other unknown compounds with a retinoic acid receptor mediated mode of action were present the revealed widespread production of retinoids by cyanobacterial blooms dominated by diverse species across various aquatic ecosystems and their common presence in both biomass and surrounding water raises concern namely because some retinoids belong to the most potent teratogens these compounds need to be taken into consideration in the assessment of risks associated with massive cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria retinoids water bloom retinoid like activity 1 introduction over the past decades freshwater cyanobacterial blooms have become a very concerning issue due to their mass development in many water bodies associated with adverse effects on other organisms including human and in some cases ecosystem functioning hallegraeff 2010 it has been well documented that cyanobacteria are able to produce diverse groups of toxins that can have an impact on various processes in exposed organisms these compounds can enter the food webs and adversely affect biota at different trophic levels kudela et al 2015 very important is the fact that various species of cyanobacteria are capable of both extracellular and intracellular production of toxic compounds and thus they can not only adversely affect organisms that graze on them but all organisms linked to the surrounding water harmful effects of cyanobacterial metabolites were described in various aquatic e g fish or amphibians as well as terrestrial organisms e g birds or mammals including humans jonas et al 2014 paskerová et al 2012 skocovska et al 2007 wiegand and pflugmacher 2005 both production and effects of known cyanobacterial toxins such as microcystins cylindrospermopsin anatoxin a and others have been well reviewed in ferrão filho and kozlowsky suzuki 2011 ibelings and chorus 2007 singh et al 2005 or wiegand and pflugmacher 2005 but recent reports show evidence of new toxic products of cyanobacterial metabolism endocrine disrupting compounds have been discussed as potential novel toxic products of cyanobacteria in the last decade essa and fathy 2014 falconer 2006 one group of cyanobacterial products that act as endocrine disruptors are compounds generally referred to as retinoids retinoids are very similar to steroids in mechanisms of action via nuclear receptors and activation of target genes expression evans and mangelsdorf 2014 retinoids are generally thought of as vertebrate specific dietary hormones which are necessary for many physiological functions duong and rochette egly 2011 particularly they have a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation processes during embryogenesis reproduction or neoplasia de luca 1991 studies focused on the effects of retinoids on living organisms have also demonstrated that this group of compounds contains some of the most potent animal teratogens teratogens are chemicals that can interfere with normal embryonic development and have adverse effects on growth and functions xing et al 2015 exposure of embryos to excess of exogenous retinoids causes a number of defects such as disruption of the central nervous system or urogenital system including reproduction bryant and gardiner 1992 herrmann 1995 moreover retinoids are also discussed in connection to human nervous system disorders such as autism london 2000 or schizophrenia palha and goodman 2006 however the original function of retinoids in cyanobacteria is unclear in plants phototaxis initiated by conversion of all trans retinoic acid atra to 13cis retinoic acid 13cis ra was described this reaction is also very important for flagellated organisms for example green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii because it is a propulsive step to movement of flagellates blomhoff and blomhoff 2006 furthermore retinoids presumably play a facilitating role in photosynthesis ke et al 2005 showed that retinoic acid binds with high affinity to a specific type of cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp120a1 in the thylakoid membrane this indicates the connection between retinoids and cytochrome enzymes involved in primary processes of photosynthesis sources of retinoids in aquatic environment can be both anthropogenic and natural anthropogenic retinoids originate from pharmaceuticals nutrition supplements feed additives food industry and cosmetics while natural retinoids in the environment come from precursor carotenoids maiani et al 2009 photosynthetic organisms are endowed with carotenoids for optimal processing of light energy thus the fact that cyanobacteria have been newly identified as a source of retinoids is not surprising however potential production of retinoids by cyanobacteria and their release into water bodies in connection with mass development of cyanobacterial blooms is a very relevant environmental problem because imbalance in retinoid metabolism in vertebrates including humans can lead to numerous adverse effects as is described above the occurrence of retinoids in environmental cyanobacterial biomass and surrounding water has been investigated in just two studies javůrek et al 2015 wu et al 2013 2012 the first study on retinoids produced by cyanobacteria in the environment was published by wu et al 2012 2013 this pioneering study that focused on cyanobacterial water blooms with microcystis dominancy and their surrounding water in taihu lake china has been the first to show the potential of these blooms to produce retinoids the subsequent study of javůrek et al 2015 was focused on cyanobacterial water blooms with dominance of microcystis in independent water bodies in the czech republic and this research confirmed the capability of these blooms to produce retinoids however both publications show the production of retinoids only by cyanobacterial blooms with dominant species from the genus microcystis javůrek et al 2015 documented not only the occurrence of two individual retinoic acids but also the total retinoid like activity mediated by the retinoic acid receptor determined by an in vitro bioassay of the compound mixtures present in water bloom biomasses as well as in surrounding water the study indicated a high proportional contribution of unknown compounds to the detected retinoid like activity in both biomass and water a few studies reported retinoid like activity and or presence of some retinoids in biomass and exudates from laboratory cultures of several widespread cyanobacterial species including both coccal and filamentous cyanobacteria e g from genera microcystis aphanizomenon cylindrospermopsis or limnothrix priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2013 2012 nevertheless the environmental relevance of the production of retinoids has so far been documented only for freshwater cyanobacterial blooms dominated by microcystis species while there is no information on retinoid like activity or production of retinoids related to any water blooms dominated by other species moreover there is very limited information regarding the role of the detected retinoids in the observed total retinoid like activity this paper is focused on the characterization of retinoid like activity in the aquatic environment in connection to cyanobacterial blooms with various dominant species in independent water bodies retinoid like activity of the compound mixtures in both water bloom biomass and surrounding water was investigated and the blooms were thoroughly explored from the taxonomic point of view the study also examined the presence of several retinoids potentially associated with cyanobacterial blooms in both biomass and water and their contribution to total retinoid like activity detected in freshwater aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and locality description biomasses of cyanobacterial blooms and samples of surrounding water were collected from water bodies with bloom occurrence to study intracellular and extracellular concentration of retinoid like compounds the biomass and its surrounding water were sampled from 17 independent stagnant water bodies across south bohemia and south moravia in the czech republic sampling localities are shown in fig 1 and physicochemical properties of sampled water bodies are included in supplementary materials table s1 sampling was carried out during four sampling days between august 12 and september 16 2015 for sampling of both surrounding water and cyanobacterial biomass a plankton net 20 μm mesh was used while the biomass samples were concentrated using the plankton net the surrounding water samples were collected from the water that passed through the walls of the net and further filtered after transport to the laboratory at all sampling localities water was collected in 2 5 l dark glass bottles transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c in the dark for the purposes of taxonomic classification 40 ml of both biomass concentrated by the plankton net and non concentrated phytoplankton were collected into 50 ml falcon tubes 10 ml of 10 aqueous formaldehyde solution was added final concentration 2 to fixate the samples immediately after sampling collected samples were processed as described below within 24 h after transportation to the laboratory 2 2 taxonomic determination taxonomic characterization of collected samples of both the biomass concentrated by plankton net and the non concentrated phytoplankton representing its taxonomic composition at each locality was carried out using light microscope olympus x51 olympus japan and a bürker chamber cell numbers per millilitre were also converted into biovolume biomass skacelova and lepš 2014 phytoplankton cell densities at sampled locations as well as percentual species composition based on cell densities per ml are presented in table 1 and the recalculation per biovolume is shown in table s2 2 3 processing of biomass samples after sampling and transport to the laboratory the biomass samples were stored in the freezer at 20 c after that the samples were dried in vacuum freeze dryer freeze dryer gamma 1 16 lscplus martin christ freeze dryers germany and the freeze dried biomass was extracted according to javůrek et al 2015 briefly 200 mg of freeze dried environmental biomass was extracted by sonication for 2 2 min 100 power cycle 0 9 in 5 ml of methanol meoh on ice the test tubes were then centrifuged 3050 g for 5 min the extracts were transferred to glass vials and the biomass was re extracted with 1 ml of meoh 30 s sonication centrifugation 3050 g for 5 min the re extract was added to the first part of the extract another 5 ml of meoh were added to the biomass and all steps were repeated the extracts were evaporated to near dryness by nitrogen stream and diluted in 500 μl methanol to reach biomass concentration of 400 g dry mass dm l 2 4 spe procedure the efficiency of various spe procedures to recover compounds contributing to the retinoid like activity from complex environmental samples was tested on an extract of environmental cyanobacterial biomass sampled from a locality where high retinoid like activity was reported previously the biomass was collected at locality l9 in summer 2013 the biomass sample was collected and processed as described in section 2 3 from a taxonomy point of view this sample was dominated by the species aphanizomenon klebahnii 92 4 the extract of this biomass sample represented suitable material for the spe procedure test due to its considerable retinoid like activity the final extracts were concentrated to 100 g dry mass dm l prior to loading onto the spe column oasis hlb the biomass extract was diluted 100 in deionized water table 2 shows the setup of procedures used for the testing of spe recovery the tested setups were based on our previous experience pre experiments and information from available sources wu et al 2013 2012 2 5 processing of water samples after sampling and transport to the laboratory the water samples were vacuum filtered through 0 6 μm paper filters macherey nagel dueren germany this filtered sample contained compounds present in the water phase at the sampled localities then all field water samples were processed using two procedures 1w and 10w see table 2 according to the following methodology before applying the filtered samples the spe columns 1 g oasis hlb column waters milford usa were conditioned according to the employed procedure the volumes of the applied samples were 2 l the samples were dosed to the cartridges through ptfe tubes with a flow rate of approximately 4 6 ml min after the samples passed through the spe columns the cartridges were dried for 5 min under nitrogen stream and eluted with specific solvents according to table 2 the samples were then evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and re dissolved in methanol to achieve a 4000 fold concentration factor compared to the original environmental water sample 2 6 detection of retinoid like activity by in vitro bioassay the retinoic acid receptor mediated response was tested on the cell line p19 a15 derived from murine embryonic carcinoma cells p19 european collection of cell culture wiltshire uk with endogenous expression of retinoid receptors by stable transfection with reporter luciferase gene under the control of a retinoic acid responsive element prareβ2 tk luc plasmid all tests were conducted in at least two independent replicate experiments the method is described in detail by javůrek et al 2015 the cytotoxicity of processed samples was measured using the calcein am cell viability assay sigma aldrich czech republic at all tested concentrations 2 7 lc ms ms analyses of retinoids a set of 10 retinoids atra 9cis retinoic acid 9cis ra 13cis ra 13cis ra methyl ester 5 6epoxy atra 4keto atra 4keto retinal 4hydroxy atra retinal and retinol was analyzed using the method previously described in priebojova et al 2018 briefly target retinoids were analyzed using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry xevo tq s waters manchester u k with electrospray ionization esi the quantification of analytes was based on the internal standard of atra d5 retinal d5 and 4keto atra d3 ions were detected in the positive mode a scheduled mrm mode was used for monitoring of the respective m z transitions table s3 both limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq for the lc ms ms analysis were derived from the lowest calibration point having the signal to noise ratio higher than 3 1 lod and 10 1 loq supplementary table s5 and s6 2 8 data analyses the total retinoid like activity was determined using the equi effective approach and the results were expressed as atra equivalents req with respect to the atra standard villeneuve et al 2000 relative luminescence units obtained from the in vitro cellular reporter assay were converted to percentages of maximum response of the standard curves with atra ecx values were calculated from the non linear logarithmic regression of dose response curves of calibration standards graphpad prism graphpad software usa to determine significant induction p 0 05 compared to solvent control in vitro data was tested by one way anova followed by dunnett s multiple comparisons test the req of samples was derived as a point estimate from the effect of the maximum tested concentration according to the ecx atra ecx sample where x represents the percentage of induction caused by this effective concentration javůrek et al 2015 for samples where cytotoxicity was detected the req value as well as loq value in case of no significant retinoid like activity were calculated at the level of the greatest non cytotoxic concentration limits of quantification loq were derived on the level of 10 times the average standard deviation sd of blank relative potencies rp of individual compounds were taken from the study of priebojova et al 2018 reqchem was calculated as the sum of contributions from individual compounds obtained by multiplying their rp values by detected concentrations 3 results 3 1 taxonomic characterization the samples were collected from 17 individual stagnant water bodies of different types and size ranging from small village water tanks to large reservoirs fig 1 table s1 diverse taxonomic composition of cyanobacterial water bloom biomass was observed the dominant species over 50 in both biovolume and cells ml at different localities included microcystis aeruginosa microcystis ichtyoblabe dolichospermum flos aquae and planktothrix agardhii a detailed taxonomic composition of the samples from all localities is shown in table 1 based on cells ml and table s2 based on biovolume it is important to stress that the dominance can differ between the values based on the cells ml and biovolume based values in case of presence of species with markedly different cell sizes such as on locality 13 where woronichinia naegeliana dominated in cells ml but played only a minor role in the of biovolume due to its small cell size regarding the potential production of retinoid compounds dry weight biomass the biovolume based relative composition shown in table s2 is more relevant further species that contributed a greater relative proportion to the concentrated biomass biovolume over 25 included cylindrospermopsis raciborskii anabaenopsis elenkii dolichospermum circinale dolichospermum viguieri sphaerospermopsis aphanizomenoides aphanizomenon flos aquae and woronichinia naegeliana differences between the species composition of the biomass collected by plankton net 20 μm mesh and the phytoplankton samples collected directly from water were observed at a few localities this phenomenon is caused by the size of the mesh in the plankton net species with small cells or narrow filaments can pass through the net mesh planktothrix agardhii can serve as a typical example of such species as is evident from the comparison of taxonomic composition of biomass and phytoplankton from locality 9 3 2 recovery of spe procedure the recovery of various spe procedures was assessed to maximize the detectability of retinoid like activity from field samples the most effective procedure with the greatest recovery of retinoid like activity was variant 10 fig 2 where the retinoid like activity after spe did not differ significantly from the activity of the extract before spe processing this documents very high recovery of this spe procedure for the mixture of compounds causing the detected retinoid like activity for this reason this spe variant has been selected for the processing of the field samples the second method selected for spe processing of field water samples was variant 1 due to its use in earlier studies focused on the analysis of retinoid like activity in the environment javůrek et al 2015 and lab cultivations priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2014 to enable comparability of the obtained results with previous studies 3 3 retinoid like activity of water samples all field samples of surrounding water of cyanobacterial blooms processed by the two selected spe procedures see section 3 2 were tested in vitro to determine their retinoid like activity both procedures 1w and 10w have proven to be suitable for recovering compounds causing retinoid like activity from environmental water samples the samples were measured at a concentration factor of 2 5 20 times compared to the original surface water the results show that retinoid like activity was detectable in the water from 8 out of the total 17 localities with procedure 1w leading to more frequent detection than 10w fig 3 detected retinoid like activities varied between 15 and 263 ng req l in active samples table 3 and supplementary table s4 the highest retinoid like activity was detected in the water from locality 9 processed by the spe procedure 10w cytotoxic effects were observed in a few surrounding water samples at the greatest tested concentrations which affected the detectability of the retinoid like activity and the derived loq values as is obvious from table 3 and s4 3 4 retinoid like activity of cyanobacterial biomass in the samples of cyanobacterial biomass retinoid like activity could be quantified at 11 of the total 17 localities table 3 fig 4 retinoid like activities have been re calculated to reqs and their values varied between loq and 867 ng g dm the highest retinoid like activity was detected in the biomass from locality 9 similarly as in the case of surrounding water samples the activity was not detectable below loq of 273 595 ng g dm at localities 1 4 5 7 8 and 12 nevertheless the extracts of biomass from these localities caused significant cytotoxicity which led to high loq values in more than half of the biomass samples cytotoxicity was detected at tested concentration 1 and or 2 g dm l cytotoxicity was observed in samples from localities 1 4 5 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 despite this retinoid like activity was detectable at non cytotoxic concentrations and thus higher than the loq for some of these biomasses the level of cytotoxicity was taken into consideration in the determination of both req and loq the cytotoxicity led to greater loqs for some samples table 3 and supplementary table s4 3 5 lc ms ms analyses of retinoids three of the 10 analyzed retinoids 13cis ra methyl ester retinol and 4hydroxy atra were not detected at concentrations greater than their loq neither in the water samples nor the biomass supplementary tables s5 and s6 the concentrations of individual retinoids in samples of surrounding water ranged from below loq to 79 9 ng l 4keto atra water samples from every locality contained at least trace but detectable levels of some of the analyzed retinoids fig 5 and supplementary table s5 the most frequently detected retinoids in field samples of surrounding water were 5 6epoxy atra and 4keto atra these forms were detected in 13 and 16 of all collected samples of surrounding water respectively some of the studied retinoids were also detected in biomasses from all sampling localities except for locality 5 concentrations of different retinoids in biomasses ranged from values below loq to 1088 ng g dm the most common types of retinoids present in the field biomass samples were retinal and 4keto atra fig 6 and supplementary table s6 these forms were detected in 16 and 14 collected biomass samples respectively total retinoid equivalents of detected retinoids ʃreqchem table 4 were calculated from their relative potencies and concentrations in samples supplementary tables s5 and s6 values of ʃreqchem in surrounding water samples across localities ranged from 0 22 ng req l locality 14 to 65 9 ng req l locality 9 comparison of reqin vitro with ʃreqchem of target compounds allows the assessment of the contribution of detected compounds to observed in vitro effects table 4 in samples of surrounding water the highest degree of explanation was found in the sample from locality 2 processed by the spe procedure 10w where 71 9 of the reqin vitro could be explained by ʃreqchem in contrast the degree of explanation was only 0 2 for the water from locality 14 processed by the spe procedure 1w which means that other not analyzed compounds were likely responsible for the effects values of ʃreqchem in biomass samples ranged from 1 5 ng req g dm l4 to 863 ng req g dm l9 the percentual contribution ʃreqchem of target compounds to detected in vitro effects by is shown in table 4 the highest degree of retinoid like effect explicability was observed for the biomass samples from localities 9 and 10 where the detected compounds almost completely explained the activity detected by the in vitro assay in contrast the lowest degree of explanation was found in the case of the biomass sample from locality 16 where the percentage contribution of detected retinoids to the total in vitro effect is only 0 9 again pointing to major role of unidentified compounds 4 discussion cyanobacterial blooms represent a global problem in freshwater and marine ecosystems they can produce various bioactive and toxic compounds with potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms and humans this study demonstrates that freshwater blooms with diverse taxonomic compositions can produce a spectrum of retinoids and retinoid like activity is a common mode of action of mixtures of cyanobacterial metabolites both intra and extracellular the impact of retinoids on the development of vertebrates has been studied in detail since the 1970s bunt milam and saari 1983 eichele 1989 mccormick et al 1978 however the production of retinoids by cyanobacteria has not been known until recently and the relevance of these compounds in the environment needs to be elucidated so far only a few studies dealing with retinoids and their relation to the cyanobacterial blooms and living organisms have been published these pioneering studies provide the first insights into the potentially wide distribution and teratogenic effects of cyanobacteria associated retinoids javůrek et al 2015 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2012 our study brings new information regarding retinoid like activity and presence of individual retinoids in the aquatic ecosystems and their contribution to the total retinoid like activity notably it proves that the occurrence of retinoids in water bodies is associated with cyanobacterial blooms dominated by diverse genera not only by microcystis species moreover our study documents the presence of retinoids in every examined body of water and for the first time it reports the occurrence of 5 6epoxy atra and 4keto retinal in aquatic ecosystems as described in recent papers el shehawy et al 2012 halstvedt et al 2008 javůrek et al 2015 the production of biologically active compounds including retinoids by cyanobacteria is strongly dependent on environmental conditions and the physiological state of the cyanobacteria this also means that the levels of retinoids in the environment can vary in response to biotic and abiotic factors in our work significant differences in retinoid like activity and retinoids concentrations were observed namely among the surrounding water samples from studied localities several factors could contribute to this phenomenon the observed differences can be related to various species compositions of cyanobacterial blooms as well as to the growth phase of the bloom and the condition of the cells in the bloom also environmental factors such as nutrient level especially nitrogen and phosphorus temperature light conditions or ph can significantly influence metabolites production as has been reported for other cyanotoxin groups neilan et al 2013 oh et al 2017 moreover cyanobacteria can benefit from specific allelopathic interactions in microbial communities song et al 2017 which can also affect the production of metabolites the levels of retinoid like compounds in water associated with cyanobacterial blooms have been studied in just two regions in the world the czech republic and china javůrek et al 2015 wu et al 2012 these studies showed that mass development of cyanobacterial blooms with dominance of the microcystis species is linked to the production of retinoids in our study the highest observed retinoid like activity among the water samples was 263 ng req l which is 10 times higher than the activities detected by javůrek et al 2015 in addition the highest total concentration of an individual retinoid was 128 ng l which is more than 6 times higher than the amount of retinoids in water observed by wu et al 2012 primarily the results indicate that the frequency of occurrence and levels of retinoid substances in water is much greater than was earlier assumed the retinoid like activity in water reached levels which are closer to reqs causing in vivo effects in zebrafish embryos jonas et al 2014 moreover retinoid like activity was detectable and quantifiable in surrounding water and biomass at 8 and 11 out of 17 sampled localities using in vitro tests the rest of the biomass samples where activity was not quantifiable caused significant cytotoxicity in the bioassay leading to high loq values as is obvious from table 3 these loqs are higher than reqs quantified at some other localities therefore these samples might contain compounds with retinoid like activity but their quantification by the in vitro bioassay was not possible due to the high cytotoxicity this assumption is supported by the results of the chemical analysis which detected retinoids in 16 out of 17 biomass samples in the case of the chemical analysis of water samples retinoids were even detected in all 17 samples despite their low concentration these results document that the production of retinoids by freshwater cyanobacterial blooms is a common phenomenon spread out across various water bodies with a significant potential impact on organisms in aquatic ecosystems as was mentioned above the presence of retinoid like compounds in cyanobacterial blooms and their surrounding waters has so far been detected only in blooms dominated by microcystis species javůrek et al 2015 jonas et al 2015 2014 wu et al 2012 however the production of retinoid like substances by cyanobacteria under laboratory conditions has already been observed for several cyanobacterial species including anabaena aphanizomenon cylindrospermopsis and others priebojova et al 2018 jonas et al 2014 wu et al 2013 cyanobacterial blooms associated with retinoids in our study were dominated by species such as microcystis aeruginosa dolichospermum flos aque planktothrix agardhii and woronichinia naegeliana table 1 and s2 this is a clear indication of the fact that retinoids can be produced by cyanobacterial blooms formed by various species however for a detailed understanding of the species specific production of retinoids in cyanobacteria it is necessary to reveal the genetic and molecular background of retinoid synthesis in the cyanobacterial genome in the last two decades the presence of retinoids was confirmed in both the animal and plant kingdom and newly also in cyanobacteria several forms of retinoids were observed both in field studies and in studies focused on laboratory cultured cyanobacteria these substances can have significant effects on organisms in the environment but the relative contribution of individual retinoid analogues to total retinoid like effects varies significantly in animal cells the metabolic pathway of retinoids starts with carotenoids however in cyanobacteria the process of retinoid biosynthesis is based on apocarotenoids this is the fundamental difference in retinoid biosynthesis between both groups of organisms further the first observed apocarotenoid cleavage enzyme was lignostilbene dioxygenase diox1 in the cyanobacteria synechocystis sp pcc 6803 ruch et al 2005 this enzyme catalyses the cleavage of apocarotenoids to retinal this step of the biosynthesis process suggests a reason why retinal is one of the most common forms of retinoids detected in our work in both the biomass and surrounding water moreover diox1 was present in all sequenced cyanobacteria both unicellular and filamentous species in the work of ruch et al 2005 which suggests a versatile distribution of diox1 moreover retinal is the basic building block for other retinoids in various organisms for instance one of the metabolites of retinal is 4keto retinal which has identical properties to the bacterial membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin weetall et al 1997 our work suggests that this retinal metabolite is also produced by cyanobacteria as this is the first report of 4keto retinal from aquatic ecosystems in animals retinal is described as substrate for the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase which performs irreversible conversion of retinal to atra our results indicate that atra is one of the most common and abundant retinoids in water bodies with cyanobacterial blooms therefore one can assume the presence of a similar enzyme in cyanobacteria this presumption is also supported by a study by hong et al 2016 where retinal dehydrogenase was identified in bacterium bacillus cereus atra shows the highest teratogenic potency among currently described retinoids priebojova et al 2018 and so it represents a possible hazard for vertebrates in water bodies however atra is not the only metabolite of retinal retinol has also been described as a direct metabolite of retinal it has been observed that the reversible interconversion of retinol and retinal in animals is catalyzed by members of the alcohol dehydrogenase and short chain dehydrogenase reductase enzyme families duester 1996 however the presence or absence of these compounds in cyanobacteria is very controversial and we did not detect retinol neither in the water nor in the biomass samples the possible explanations might be that either retinol is not produced by cyanobacteria at all or it is very quickly converted to retinal during sample processing its greater detection limits may also play a role this phenomenon should be studied in the future 4keto atra was the most abundant retinoid in both the biomass and the surrounding water this compound is probably a metabolite of 4hydroxy atra which is a direct metabolite of atra however this has not been described in cyanobacteria while 4hydroxy atra has not been detected in water nor biomass yet probably due to its greater loq table s5 s6 4keto atra has been found in 16 and 13 out of 17 localities in water and biomass respectively despite the rather low relative potency of 4keto atra the presence of this compound is important due to its relatively high concentrations in comparison to other retinoids analyzed in this study and its wide distribution in surrounding water as well as biomass interestingly 4keto atra was detected at concentrations up to μg g dm table s6 which is comparable to other cyanobacterial metabolites such as cylindrospermopsin or microcystin bittencourt oliveira et al 2014 pekar et al 2016 the second atra derivate which was detected in a considerable number of water samples at 13 out of 17 localities is 5 6epoxy atra the high relative potency of this compound 0 7 can lead to its strong impact on total req however it was detected only in two samples of biomass this is probably affected by high matrix effects which influenced the detection limit nevertheless this is the first report of 5 6epoxy atra as a product of the cyanobacterial bloom from the environment while this compound is known to be involved in retinoid metabolism in the animal kingdom marill et al 2000 nothing is known about its biosynthesis and function in cyanobacteria two other retinoids which were detected in several water and biomass samples but were impossible to separate during our lc ms ms analysis are 9cis ra and 13cis ra their presence has been observed at 9 and 3 out of 17 localities in water and biomass respectively however their concentrations were rather low and thus they had no significant impact on total req 5 conclusions this study provides novel important information about the levels of retinoids and total retinoid like activity in stagnant water bodies affected by cyanobacterial blooms the results of this study highlight the fact that retinoids are produced by cyanobacterial blooms with various different dominant species this demonstrates that the production of retinoids by cyanobacteria in the environment is much more common than was previously thought the detected retinoid like activity in water reached values 10 times higher than in earlier studies the relevance of individual retinoids to the detected bioactivity can be understood from the presented concentrations and from the information about their contribution to the total effect our results document that retinoids need to be taken into consideration in the assessment of risks associated with massive cyanobacterial blooms however the results also suggested that still other compounds with retinoic acid receptor mediated modes of action are present and thus the total retinoid like activity determined in bioassays can be a better indicator of the potential toxic effects of the mixture than the concentrations of individual compounds that should be a subject of further study including research which will focus on cyanobacterial production of retinoids on a genomic level the knowledge of their presence possible interactions with organisms as well as better characterization of their biosynthetic pathways in cyanobacteria are necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of retinoid production by cyanobacteria and the associated risks for water bodies acknowledgements this research was supported by the czech science foundation grant no 18

18898,nearly half of all cases of foodborne illness are associated with plant based foods such as leafy greens and raw flour an important potential source of pathogen contamination along the food production continuum is irrigation water which has led to the implementation of increasingly stringent agricultural irrigation water quality requirements to better understand factors impacting irrigation water quality we investigated sources of generic escherichia coli and how they varied temporally among different sampling sites precipitation campylobacter species distribution and physicochemical water quality parameters were also investigated to substantiate microbial source tracking findings biweekly sampling was conducted at a reservoir outlet and two downstream canals in southern alberta canada throughout two irrigation seasons the latter of which was notable for drought conditions overall 50 of canal samples exceeded alberta s irrigation guideline for e coli 100 e coli per 100 ml whereas all reservoir samples were below guideline limits collectively e coli source apportionment campylobacter species distribution and physicochemical water quality data suggest runoff from surrounding agricultural land was a contributing factor to e coli guideline exceedances in year 1 only in year 2 the majority of exceedances occurred later in the season when there was little precipitation and were largely attributed to cosmopolitan e coli from wild birds and cattle similarities in e coli host source and campylobacter species distributions between the reservoir and canals when the guideline was exceeded suggest the reservoir could be a primary source of e coli during drought increased bacterial concentrations in canals were likely due to environmental conditions that promoted bacterial survival and in situ proliferation our findings support previous accounts that many e coli isolates possess enhanced survival capabilities which has implications to bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation particularly under drought conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords irrigation water water quality fecal indicator microbial source tracking phylogroup campylobacter 1 introduction recognizing irrigation water is a risk factor for microbial contamination of produce has resulted in increasingly stringent food safety requirements for crop producers wiseman 2015 while many countries have guidelines for the microbial quality of irrigation water and food safety programs that promote good agricultural practices concerning primary production of fresh produce allende and monaghan 2015 uyttendaele et al 2015 the u s food safety modernization act s fsma produce safety rule psr stipulates microbial water quality thresholds standards for fresh produce water not meeting these standards should not be used until the grower implements corrective measures and demonstrates water is of acceptable quality havelaar et al 2017 the psr was instituted in part to combat domestically acquired foodborne illness however countries besides the u s are recognizing potential benefits to global public health through international harmonization of food safety standards keener et al 2014 indeed fsma has impacted food safety standards in both canada and europe evidenced by the safe food for canadians act and quality assurance schemes in the u k respectively allende and monaghan 2015 keener et al 2014 escherichia coli is a fecal indicator bacterium fib used as a proxy for the presence of feces hence the potential occurrence of pathogens irrigation water quality guidelines range from 1 e coli per 100 ml in australia new zealand to 1000 fecal coliforms per 100 ml geometric mean throughout irrigation according to the world health organization while most canadian provinces recommend an irrigation water guideline of 100 e coli per 100 ml uyttendaele et al 2015 detection and enumeration of e coli according to canadian water quality standards hc 2012 are described by apha 2005 which subsequently refers to usepa method 1603 usepa 2014 based on this method the fsma s psr stipulates the geometric mean of e coli should not exceed 126 colony forming units cfu per 100 ml or 410 cfu per 100 ml statistical threshold value havelaar et al 2017 for produce that may be consumed raw values beyond these guidelines typically suggest an increased risk of foodborne illness caused by pathogens it is not surprising there are discrepancies among guidelines for irrigation water between countries since information on the association between irrigation water pathogen concentrations in produce and human health is scarce furthermore irrigation water standards were derived from recreational guidelines assuming human health risk posed by full body contact during swimming and equal risk among all sources of e coli pachepsky et al 2011 in spite of this and evidence that e coli do not correlate well with pathogen presence partyka et al 2018 wu et al 2011 international food safety initiatives continue to base guidelines and regulations on this bacterial species international harmonization has potential benefits to human health across the globe however it is imperative that indicator specific standards are equally relevant so that crop producers are not faced with undue regulation associated burdens over the past decade irrigation water quality research has concentrated on pathogen presence and or outbreaks linked to contaminated produce holistic studies relating biological physical and chemical water quality data to e coli concentration sources are scarce hence factors influencing fib concentration variability in irrigation canals downstream of reservoirs where water is generally drawn for irrigation purposes remains poorly understood such information would better inform policy on the use of fib for irrigation water quality assessments and allow more effective risk mitigation with respect to food safety in this context the purpose of the study was to investigate sources of e coli contributing to irrigation water quality degradation determine how these sources vary temporally within different types of irrigation water i e reservoirs versus canals and relate differences in precipitation campylobacter species distributions and a suite of physical and chemical parameters to sources of e coli when irrigation water quality guidelines were exceeded based on previous observations that e coli concentrations are higher in canals compared to reservoir source water and understanding precipitation is a driver of increased fib concentrations won et al 2013 we hypothesized e coli concentrations would be higher in downstream irrigation canals with guideline exceedances occurring primarily in association with rain events and attributable to agricultural runoff 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a small region of taber irrigation district alberta canada comprising about 10 of the district s total area 330 km2 water sampling sites included an irrigation reservoir outlet taber lake site t s5 and two independent earthen canals lateral m site t lu6a and taber lake lateral site t lu6b fig 1 farms for fecal sampling were selected based on rancher participation and presence of animals on land immediately adjacent to the study reservoir and canals taber lake reservoir covers 3 9 km2 and has a storage capacity of 6 4e 6 m3 it receives water from three canals to the south plus drainage from the town of taber during runoff events the reservoir provides important habitat for a variety of waterfowl and songbirds qualitative land use observations identified approximately 0 5 km2 of land grazed by cattle located east southeast of the reservoir water from the reservoir flows into an underground pipe which exits at the outlet t s5 where samples were collected these samples represent the quality of water entering taber lake lateral and lateral m canals but are not necessarily representative of overall water quality throughout this large irregular shaped reservoir lateral m and taber lake lateral canals receive water directly from the reservoir outlet t s5 fig 1 sampling site t lu6a is located on lateral m canal approximately 7 km downstream of t s5 the canal has a discharge capacity of 0 65 m3 s and the water depth at t lu6a ranges from about 45 cm to 60 cm lateral m is immediately surrounded by pasture occupied by horses and cattle as well as a variety of crops e g alfalfa barley canola corn hay and potatoes at least three drain inlets on the canal capture runoff from adjacent land and road ditches and several sloped areas exist where overland flow potentially enters lateral m sampling site t lu6b is located on taber lake lateral canal approximately 5 km downstream of t s5 the canal has a discharge capacity of 0 25 m3 s and the water depth at t lu6b ranges from about 30 cm to 80 cm fig 1 the first kilometer of canal runs through a pasture occupied by cattle with direct access to the channel the canal is otherwise surrounded by cropland e g alfalfa barley canola potatoes wheat and winter wheat and a few industrial and agricultural processing facilities the south side of the canal is adjacent to the railway and provincial highway no 3 at least 24 drain inlets and a couple of sloped areas capture overland flow from adjacent land and road ditches emptying into the canal 2 2 sample collection sampling occurred biweekly from june to september of 2014 year 1 and 2015 year 2 to encompass the entire period of irrigation water use typically late may to mid august depending on crop type and climate water was collected at the reservoir outlet and immediately upstream of the canal tail outs one liter of flowing water mid channel mid depth was collected from each site 8 samples per year using a polyethylene bottle attached to a telescopic pole water and fecal samples were collected concurrently to capture genetic diversity of e coli which may vary with site and time and ensure an accurate representation of the dominant isolates present throughout the study lyautey et al 2010b fecal samples deposited on the ground by various animal species were collected roughly in proportion to the abundance of host species present on land adjacent to irrigation water sampling sites livestock samples were collected from 3 to 10 different fecal pats at 14 different farms wildlife scat was collected from the ground immediately adjacent to reservoirs and wetlands dugouts at farm sites when present wildlife samples were assigned to one of three groups goose duck wild bird species not verified but uric acid present in scat or other wildlife coyote gopher and unverified wildlife species a total of 543 fecal samples were collected from cattle n 252 wildlife n 178 horses n 43 sheep n 36 and swine n 33 in 2015 composite samples of human sewage influent post screening were obtained from taber wastewater treatment plant to account for environmental sources of e coli potentially representing isolates with enhanced survival abilities jang et al 2017 sediment samples were collected in year 2 n 13 using sterile spoons sediment was collected four times at three different wetlands by scraping an area of 2 5 cm2 to a depth of 1 cm at the water s edge collection was repeated for any e coli negative samples sediment samples were treated as a source of environmental e coli independent of water samples 2 3 generic e coli isolation and quantification following

positive for tuf with an unresolved phylogroup were designated unclassified 2 5 escherichia coli accessory gene fingerprinting agf agf was used to apportion host sources to e coli for a more accurate representation of relative contributions tymensen et al 2015 this method consisting of three multiplex pcrs generates a fingerprint for each e coli isolate based on the presence absence of ten different accessory genes this allows for comparison of fingerprints from irrigation water with a reference library of isolates from different host species assays were performed and products resolved

physical salinity and nutrient measurements of irrigation water water temperature and stage were measured during collection stage was measured by inserting a portable staff gauge into the water on the most upstream edge of the canal check structure crest and converted to discharge using the contracted rectangular weir formula grant and dawson 1997 water samples were shipped to exova calgary alberta via express courier and analyzed upon receipt for physical salinity and nutrient parameters using standard methods table s4 apha 2005 iso 1997 lesch and suarez 2009 current and historical precipitation data corresponding to fincastle station located within the study area was provided by alberta agriculture and forestry via https agriculture alberta ca acis alberta weather data viewer jsp aaf 2018a 2 9 statistical analyses all statistical tests used a significance threshold of 0 05 water samples with more than 100 e coli per 100 ml were considered to exceed the irrigation guideline for alberta bacterial water quality analyses were applied to number of exceedances instead of concentration since assessments are based on samples meeting or exceeding the guideline fisher s exact test was used to determine differences in numbers of e coli exceedances between sites and years and among distributions of e coli phylogroups e coli agf fingerprints and campylobacter species between sites hosts and years spearman rank order correlation was used to measure the relationship between e coli guideline exceedances and precipitation difference in total precipitation between years was calculated using mann whitney rank sum test as determined by shapiro wilk normality test the t test normal data distribution and equal variance or mann whitney rank sum test data not normally distributed and or unequal variance was conducted on physical nutrient and salinity water quality data and variables that appeared to be related to differences in water quality between seasons canal sites and times when e coli concentrations met and exceeded the guideline were chosen for principle component analysis pca in order to better visualize these differences nutrient and salinity data table s5 and table s6 were normalized using x mean stdev in past hammer et al 2001 multiple parameters represented by a single value were excluded from pca e g dissolved sodium calcium and magnesium are represented by sodium adsorption ration sar up to three principle components should account for at least 80 of the variance a criterion that was met for pca in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 generic e coli guideline exceedances in irrigation canals relative to taber lake reservoir the irrigation guideline of 100 e coli per 100 ml was never exceeded at taber lake reservoir t s5 where concentrations ranged from 2 to 39 cfu 100 ml fig s1 table s5 in contrast e coli concentrations ranged from 7 to 340 cfu 100 ml in canal water samples at t lu6a and tlu6b resulting in guideline exceedances for 50 of the samples from both years there was no difference in the number of e coli exceedances between the two canals p 0 1 the greater number of exceedances observed in water collected from canals compared to the upstream reservoir p 0 001 is consistent with a previous study in the u s partyka et al 2018 3 2 association between precipitation and e coli guideline exceedances total precipitation for year 1 and year 2 fig 2 was compared to historical data during the same approximate time frame over nine years immediately preceding the current study i e early june to late september total precipitation ranged from 62 mm to 268 mm with an average of 168 4 mm aaf 2018b throughout these nine years total precipitation was below the average in only three years total precipitation for the irrigation period during year 1 of the current study i e 236 4 mm was greater than the nine year average and significantly greater than what accumulated in the same period of year 2 p 0 05 when total precipitation was below the nine year average i e 132 9 mm fig 2 and fig s1 escherichia coli exceedances in canals correlated with volume of precipitation in the 48 h period prior to sampling in year 1 r 0 627 p 0 01 but not year 2 r 0 009 p 0 95 as illustrated by pca fig 3 a and b in fact at t lu6a in year 2 guideline exceedances tended to be more associated with drier conditions 48 h prior to sampling relative to when the guideline was met fig 3a contrary to our hypothesis overall there were more guideline exceedances in year 2 the year with fewer and less intense precipitation events than year 1 however this difference was not significant i e 37 5 and 62 5 of samples exceeded the irrigation guideline in year 1 and 2 respectively p 0 1 escherichia coli concentrations at t s5 were always low irrespective of precipitation and or year similar to our findings won et al 2013 observed significantly higher concentrations of e coli in canals when precipitation exceeded 20 mm in the preceding 24 h compared to when precipitation was less than 20 mm outside of rain events e coli concentrations were relatively stable in the study conducted by won et al 2013 which is in contrast to our findings due to the substantially larger volume of water contained within taber lake reservoir it is intuitive that runoff generated by precipitation would have a smaller impact on e coli concentrations at this site than in the canals although there are a few additional upstream sources of water that drain into taber lake section 2 1 the multitude of drain inlets upstream of t lu6b and t lu6a can deliver vast amounts of runoff and potentially fecal bacteria during high precipitation events additionally high soil moisture associated with retrospective precipitation e g snow rain or irrigation can cause runoff that may not otherwise occur due to rainfall alone and under the right conditions it is possible for runoff to occur in the absence of a high precipitation event srinivasan et al 2007 in the study area both soil moisture conditions aaf 2018b and accumulated precipitation fig 2 were higher during year 1 than year 2 soil moisture conditions in year 1 were fair to good and precipitation was near to above average whereas soil moisture conditions were poor to good and precipitation was much below average in year 2 fig 4 illustrates runoff entering taber lake lateral canal during a rain event qualitative land use observations and soil moisture data plus the association between precipitation and e coli guideline exceedances indicate runoff may have contributed to bacterial inputs during year 1 conversely lack of correlation between e coli exceedances and precipitation in year 2 suggests other factors contributed to declining bacterial water quality during dry periods 3 3 escherichia coli phylogroup distributions among irrigation water and animals a total of 1839 e coli from irrigation water n 538 sediment n 67 and animal feces n 1222 were characterized resultant phylogroup distributions among irrigation water and various potential contributing hosts were compared for broad determination of major e coli sources in irrigation water carlos et al 2010 de castro stoppe et al 2014 phylogroup b1 was predominant in reservoir water and canals during both study years fig s2 proportions ranged from 57 to 67 of all e coli isolated this is in agreement with results obtained from other surface water studies in rural areas suggesting potential influence from ruminants de castro stoppe et al 2014 higgins et al 2007 ratajczak et al 2010 predominance of phylogroup b1 in surface water can also be indicative of environmentally adapted isolates that persist and proliferate in aquatic environments berthe et al 2013 ratajczak et al 2010 walk et al 2007 or soil dusek et al 2018 it is possible some of the b1 e coli characterized in the current study are environmentally adapted especially those observed only in irrigation water and sediment additional characterization of these isolates would be required to substantiate this swine and human sewage were ruled out as major e coli contributors based on findings that phylogroup a was significantly less abundant in irrigation water than in sewage and swine feces p 0 0001 and phylogroup b2 was significantly less abundant in irrigation water than human sewage p 0 0001 distributions of these phylogroups among swine and municipal wastewater were consistent with previous reports carlos et al 2010 smati et al 2015 de castro stoppe et al 2014 likewise horses and sheep were ruled out as principle e coli contributors based on the presence of phylogroups b2 c d and f in irrigation water and absence from or presence in lower proportions feces of these two livestock species given the predominance of phylogroup b1 e coli in irrigation water cattle appear to be one of the primary e coli contributors yet these hosts are unlikely to be the source of phylogroup f isolated from irrigation water table s1 in addition to cattle the isolation of phylogroups b2 c d and f from both irrigation water and wildlife scat suggests wildlife are another major contributor of e coli specifically phylogroups a b1 b2 and d are reportedly abundant in the feces of canada geese higgins et al 2007 and several other aquatic bird species kuczkowski et al 2016 although phylogroup distribution trends in the current study do not preclude contributions from secondary sources we can generally deduce that a substantial proportion of e coli in irrigation water were of cattle wildlife and possibly environmental origin 3 4 escherichia coli accessory gene fingerprinting agf agf was used to apportion relative host contributions to e coli guideline exceedances analyses were directed at sources deemed most significant according to phylogroup distributions escherichia coli isolated from irrigation water were sorted into five source groups based on fingerprint identity including cattle specific wildlife specific cosmopolitan i e fingerprints obtained from both cattle and wildlife but isolated occasionally from other hosts other fingerprints associated with humans sheep horses and or swine and environment specific fingerprints not associated with a known host isolated from sediment and or irrigation water overall cosmopolitans comprised the largest proportion of fingerprints in all irrigation water samples collected over both years 60 while cattle and wildlife specific fingerprints accounted for the smallest fraction 6 and 7 respectively fig 5 lack of host specificity for fingerprints is one of the known challenges of source apportionment lyautey et al 2010a among hosts cosmopolitan e coli were particularly abundant in cattle and wildlife feces accounting for 57 of all e coli isolated from these sources compared to 39 of all e coli isolated from other host sources i e sewage swine sheep and horses indicating a greater probability cosmopolitan fingerprints in irrigation water originated from cattle or wildlife sources one can speculate fingerprints associated with both livestock and wildlife especially cattle and wild birds is a result of access to a common water source which could facilitate environmental transmission between these hosts successful transmission from water to host also implies cosmopolitans are adapted for survival in multiple environments including water this would need to be demonstrated through ancillary experimentation 3 4 1 sources of e coli in irrigation water in year 1 average seasonal precipitation in year 1 a small fraction 3 7 of cattle specific fingerprints were observed in canals but not in the reservoir fig 5a proportions of cattle specific e coli fingerprints were similar between both canals and times when water met and exceeded the irrigation guideline we can conclude this source was unlikely a key driver of e coli guideline exceedances as cattle specific inputs appeared to be overshadowed by other sources conversely smaller proportions of wildlife specific e coli were consistently observed in the canals compared to the reservoir this was not surprising since many wild bird species depend on reservoirs for habitat the primary difference observed during e coli guideline exceedances in the canals compared to both the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was met was the proportional increase in environment specific fingerprints i e fingerprints with no known host and a concomitant decrease in cosmopolitan fingerprints fig 5a proportions of environment specific fingerprints increased by 12 and 13 at t lu6a and t lu6b respectively when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded the majority of e coli guideline exceedances in year 1 occurred prior to july 21 fig s1 during this timeframe 12 times more precipitation was recorded than in the following 43 days fig 2 given the positive association between exceedances and precipitation it is reasonable to posit the major source of environment specific e coli was associated with runoff from adjacent agricultural land consistent with our hypothesis more specifically these e coli may be attributable to soil the only substrate not sampled in this study transported with runoff brennan et al 2010 identified a variety of soil e coli that displayed phenotypic characteristics associated with superior environmental fitness relative to laboratory strains and suggested populations of adapted bacterial strains may be maintained when conditions are favorable in soil environments in our study many 32 environment specific fingerprints were common to both irrigation seasons data not shown supporting survival from year to year given this it is possible a portion of these e coli descended from feces transported into the study area e g manure spreading washing of livestock trailers or were introduced by host sources and survived in soil adjacent to canals previous to this study these bacteria would likely be genetically distinct from e coli obtained from water and animal feces during the current study period given the temporal and spatial variability of this species lyautey et al 2010b 3 4 2 sources of e coli in irrigation water in year 2 below average seasonal precipitation in year 2 cattle specific e coli fingerprints were observed in the canals and reservoir fig 5b curiously there were proportionally fewer cattle specific fingerprints in the canals when the irrigation guideline was exceeded relative to when it was met proportions of cattle specific fingerprints in canals when the irrigation guideline was exceeded were similar to those observed in the reservoir conversely smaller proportions of wildlife specific e coli were generally observed in the canals compared to the reservoir like year 1 in contrast to year 1 the primary difference observed during e coli guideline exceedances in the canals relative to the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was met in year 2 was the proportional increase in cosmopolitan fingerprints cosmopolitans could not be attributed to runoff due to lower than normal precipitation in year 2 cosmopolitans also appeared not to originate from recent fecal deposits within the canals as an increase in respective host specific fingerprints would also have been expected which was not the case rather it appears the reservoir was a main source of cosmopolitan fingerprints and environmental conditions within the canals may have promoted survival and in situ proliferation of environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli the notion that taber lake reservoir supplied the environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli contributing to guideline exceedances in the canals is supported by previous research where greater proportions of e coli largely belonging to phylogroup b1 and exhibiting superior environmental fitness were associated with surface water with low levels of e coli contamination during a dry period compared with water recently contaminated by fecal bacteria berthe et al 2013 taber lake reservoir contained low levels of e coli contamination and the majority of these bacteria were cosmopolitans belonging to phylogroup b1 the continual flow of water in the canals might allow e coli to remain suspended in the water column rather than settle out as they would in a reservoir helping to explain why an increase in e coli concentration was observed in the canals relative to the reservoir partyka et al 2017 observed median e coli concentrations to be twice as high in water entering reservoirs than water exiting which suggests reservoirs have a buffering effect on downstream bacterial water quality however if sediments containing environmentally adapted e coli were to be disturbed for example by waterfowl reservoirs could also be a source of e coli further study of water quality at reservoir inlets and outlets compared with downstream channels is recommended to identify other factors that could impact e coli guideline exceedances in irrigation water we examined water temperature and discharge and physicochemical data the latter is discussed under section 3 6 average discharge was similar between times when the irrigation guideline was met and exceeded at the canals in year 1 p 0 1 and 2 p 0 1 table s5 however average discharge in june july of year 2 was double 0 4 m3 s that of august september of years 1 0 2 m3 s p 0 05 and 2 0 2 m3 s p 0 05 discharge is regulated by the irrigation district and directly related to irrigation demands in drought years like year 2 discharge is increased to deliver higher volumes of water in contrast less water is required during periods of average precipitation hence discharge is held relatively constant interestingly in year 2 there were twice as many e coli guideline exceedances during the months following high discharge i e 88 of samples in august september versus 38 in june july fig s1 greater velocities associated with high discharge have the potential to disrupt bacteria containing sediments carrying them from reservoir to canal however it is also possible for larger water volumes associated with increased discharge to dilute bacteria and therefore mask exceedances until water volumes return to normal demand for water typically decreases by august as crops near maturity in year 2 this is when exceedances were observed repeatedly in the canals until the end of irrigation assuming e coli was introduced to canals during periods of high discharge lower discharge may not only amplify concentrations due to decreased water volume but time required to flush accumulated bacteria through the system would also increase furthermore the short doubling time of e coli might allow even small concentrations of environmentally adapted bacteria e g 10 cfu 100 ml to increase beyond the irrigation guideline in less than four doubling times it therefore seems reasonable that a cumulative downstream effect with respect to concentrations of cosmopolitan e coli might be observed under drought and lower discharge conditions providing further support e coli guideline exceedances in year 2 at t lu6a were associated with lower discharge according to spearman rank order correlation r 0 732 p 0 05 and pca fig 3a exceedances at this site in year 2 were also negatively associated with water temperature r 0 850 p 0 01 this was not surprising since lower discharge is associated with decreased water needs in the late irrigation season which occurs simultaneously with decreasing ambient air and water temperatures fig 2 3 5 campylobacter spp distributions among irrigation water and animals overall prevalence of campylobacters in irrigation water was greater than 50 although this did not yield a large number of isolates i e 58 in year 1 and 51 in year 2 to facilitate trend evaluation canal speciation data was combined campylobacter lari was the most common species in canals fig 6 a but was significantly less common p 0 0001 among other potential sources sampled in this study including animal feces and sediment fig 6b unidentified campylobacter spp were also rarely isolated from fecal samples nonetheless c lari and campylobacter spp were more commonly isolated from wildlife scat than livestock manure and human sewage p 0 0001 which implies a significant portion of campylobacters detected in irrigation water may have originated from wildlife the disproportionately large number of c lari isolated from irrigation water relative to wildlife could be attributable to the enhanced ability of this particular species to survive in surface waters obiri danso et al 2001 campylobacter spp prevalence did not correspond with e coli concentration data not shown which is consistent with previous studies hellein et al 2011 differences in species distributions were however observed between different years irrigation water source i e reservoir versus canal and instances when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded relative to when it was met fig 6a in year 1 the most notable differences in campylobacter spp distributions were the presence of c jejuni and absence of c coli when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded in canals relative to when it was met in the reservoir and canals results are consistent with the notion that c jejuni a ubiquitous species may have been present in runoff to which the canals are susceptible during times of high precipitation in year 1 in contrast when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded in year 2 campylobacter spp distributions were similar between the reservoir and canals specifically all three species of campylobacter isolated in the study were observed in the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was exceeded but not when it was met although the small number of campylobacter isolates precluded correlation analyses differences in species distributions between the reservoir and canals in year 1 e g presence of c jejuni only in canals when e coli exceeded the irrigation guideline support the finding that runoff from surrounding agricultural land was the primary contributor to exceedances of the irrigation guideline for e coli likewise in year 2 similar campylobacter spp distributions between the reservoir and canals when e coli exceeded the irrigation guideline supports our finding that the reservoir may have contributed to these exceedances 3 6 association between irrigation water chemistry and e coli guideline exceedances distinct patterns in water chemistry were revealed by pca at site t lu6a fig 3a in both years of the study separation was observed along the x pc1 and y axis pc2 according to nutrients i e total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and salinity i e sodium adsorption ratio sar total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec year 1 salinity values were generally higher among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline whereas nutrient concentrations were generally lower among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline relative to those that met the guideline table s6 interestingly the reverse was true in year 2 samples that exceeded the e coli guideline tended to have lower salinity and higher nutrient values than samples that met the guideline in year 1 at site t lu6b the majority of separation was observed along the y axis pc2 according to nutrients where tp tn and tss tended to be higher among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline than those that met the guideline fig 3b table s5 in year 2 chemistry profiles of water samples collected at t lu6b grouped together regardless of e coli concentration separation between year 1 and year 2 samples was evident along the x axis pc 1 and appeared to be largely explained by differences in salinity parameters i e tds ec sar that is overall values associated with salinity were greater in year 1 than year 2 at this site in year 1 higher salinity t lu6a and nutrient t lu6b values associated with samples that exceeded the e coli guideline compared to when it was met further support the notion canal water was impacted by runoff from adjacent agricultural land that contributed to guideline exceedances in year 2 lower salinity values associated with samples that exceeded the e coli guideline at t lu6a occurred during times of lower water discharge fig 3b and section 3 4 2 consequently we suspect decreased contact between irrigation water and precipitated salts along canal banks may have contributed to lower salinity during times of exceedances conversely it makes sense salinity values increased with discharge despite the absence of runoff and e coli guideline exceedances since an increase in water volume would lead to increased dissolving of precipitated salts unlike t lu6a discharge was similar at t lu6b for all samples regardless of e coli concentration and while guideline exceedances were likely attributed to in situ growth of environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli the driving factor of this growth and transport remains undetermined while salinity concentrations and nutrient availability are known to impact e coli survival wanjugi et al 2016 the relatively low concentrations of these parameters obtained in the current study i e below that of typical bacterial growth media suggest that neither had a significant impact on e coli persistence in the water column wanjugi et al 2016 reported that higher nutrient levels increased e coli survival in river water thus it is conceivable nutrients facilitated e coli persistence in the current study in contrast however this fib has also been shown to maintain cell viability in nutrient poor environments takano et al 2017 and there were instances in both years of the current study when exceedances were observed among samples with some of the lowest nutrient concentrations fig 4 table s5 analysis of water chemistry substantiates the finding that irrigation guideline exceedances were likely driven by sources unique to each year of the study while variability in chemical parameters between t lu6a and t lu6b can likely be attributed to site associated differences such as land use and number of drain inlets along the canals partyka et al 2017 also concluded variability in relationships between indicator bacteria and antecedent environmental conditions in an estuary was driven by unmeasured site specific conditions and each system may be better understood if modeled independently 4 conclusions a combination of biological physical and chemical water quality data aided in identifying the most significant non point sources of e coli and factors contributing to water quality degradation in irrigation canals which is compulsory for determining the best strategies to mitigate bacterial contamination impacts of fecal pollution in terms of e coli concentration appeared to be greater in irrigation canals relative to reservoir outlets this is likely a consequence of numerous drain inlets and small volumes of water associated with canals compared to reservoirs nonetheless reservoirs may contribute to guideline exceedances of e coli downstream especially during extended periods of low precipitation thus mitigation strategies may need to address cumulative impacts on water quality at such sites a significant proportion of environment specific e coli fingerprints were detected repeatedly in reservoir water and canals but not representative animal hosts this finding supports previous claims of environmentally adapted bacteria and may have important implications for bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation strategies to mitigate environmental growth of e coli in canals could include prevention of nutrient sediment loading and sediment disruption infiltration weirs or infiltration check structures slow water flow and could be used to encourage bacteria to settle out of suspension similar to what occurs naturally in reservoirs excess sediment could be removed with canal dredging equipment or reduced by incorporating an appropriate liner to replace

18898,nearly half of all cases of foodborne illness are associated with plant based foods such as leafy greens and raw flour an important potential source of pathogen contamination along the food production continuum is irrigation water which has led to the implementation of increasingly stringent agricultural irrigation water quality requirements to better understand factors impacting irrigation water quality we investigated sources of generic escherichia coli and how they varied temporally among different sampling sites precipitation campylobacter species distribution and physicochemical water quality parameters were also investigated to substantiate microbial source tracking findings biweekly sampling was conducted at a reservoir outlet and two downstream canals in southern alberta canada throughout two irrigation seasons the latter of which was notable for drought conditions overall 50 of canal samples exceeded alberta s irrigation guideline for e coli 100 e coli per 100 ml whereas all reservoir samples were below guideline limits collectively e coli source apportionment campylobacter species distribution and physicochemical water quality data suggest runoff from surrounding agricultural land was a contributing factor to e coli guideline exceedances in year 1 only in year 2 the majority of exceedances occurred later in the season when there was little precipitation and were largely attributed to cosmopolitan e coli from wild birds and cattle similarities in e coli host source and campylobacter species distributions between the reservoir and canals when the guideline was exceeded suggest the reservoir could be a primary source of e coli during drought increased bacterial concentrations in canals were likely due to environmental conditions that promoted bacterial survival and in situ proliferation our findings support previous accounts that many e coli isolates possess enhanced survival capabilities which has implications to bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation particularly under drought conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords irrigation water water quality fecal indicator microbial source tracking phylogroup campylobacter 1 introduction recognizing irrigation water is a risk factor for microbial contamination of produce has resulted in increasingly stringent food safety requirements for crop producers wiseman 2015 while many countries have guidelines for the microbial quality of irrigation water and food safety programs that promote good agricultural practices concerning primary production of fresh produce allende and monaghan 2015 uyttendaele et al 2015 the u s food safety modernization act s fsma produce safety rule psr stipulates microbial water quality thresholds standards for fresh produce water not meeting these standards should not be used until the grower implements corrective measures and demonstrates water is of acceptable quality havelaar et al 2017 the psr was instituted in part to combat domestically acquired foodborne illness however countries besides the u s are recognizing potential benefits to global public health through international harmonization of food safety standards keener et al 2014 indeed fsma has impacted food safety standards in both canada and europe evidenced by the safe food for canadians act and quality assurance schemes in the u k respectively allende and monaghan 2015 keener et al 2014 escherichia coli is a fecal indicator bacterium fib used as a proxy for the presence of feces hence the potential occurrence of pathogens irrigation water quality guidelines range from 1 e coli per 100 ml in australia new zealand to 1000 fecal coliforms per 100 ml geometric mean throughout irrigation according to the world health organization while most canadian provinces recommend an irrigation water guideline of 100 e coli per 100 ml uyttendaele et al 2015 detection and enumeration of e coli according to canadian water quality standards hc 2012 are described by apha 2005 which subsequently refers to usepa method 1603 usepa 2014 based on this method the fsma s psr stipulates the geometric mean of e coli should

suggest an increased risk of foodborne illness caused by pathogens it is not surprising there are discrepancies among guidelines for irrigation water between countries since information on the association between irrigation water pathogen concentrations in produce and human health is scarce furthermore irrigation water standards were derived from recreational guidelines assuming human health risk posed by full body contact during swimming and equal risk among all sources of e coli pachepsky et al 2011 in spite of this and evidence that e coli do not correlate well with pathogen presence partyka et al 2018 wu et al 2011 international food safety initiatives continue to base guidelines and regulations on this bacterial species international harmonization has potential benefits to human health across the globe however it is imperative that indicator specific standards are equally relevant so that crop producers are not faced with undue regulation associated burdens over the past decade irrigation water quality research has concentrated on pathogen presence and or outbreaks linked to contaminated produce holistic studies relating biological physical and chemical water quality data to e coli concentration sources are scarce hence factors influencing fib concentration variability in irrigation canals downstream of reservoirs where water is generally drawn for irrigation purposes remains poorly understood such information would better inform policy on the use of fib for irrigation water quality assessments and allow more effective risk mitigation with respect to food safety in this context the purpose of the study was to investigate sources of e coli contributing to irrigation water quality degradation determine how these sources vary temporally within different types of irrigation water i e reservoirs versus canals and relate differences in precipitation campylobacter species distributions and a suite of physical and chemical parameters to sources of e coli when irrigation water quality guidelines were exceeded based on previous observations that e coli concentrations are higher in canals compared to reservoir source water and understanding precipitation is a driver of increased fib concentrations won et al 2013 we hypothesized e coli concentrations would be higher in downstream irrigation canals with guideline exceedances occurring primarily in association with rain events and attributable to agricultural runoff 2 methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a small region of taber irrigation district alberta canada comprising about 10 of the district s total area 330 km2 water sampling sites included an irrigation reservoir outlet taber lake site t s5 and two independent earthen canals lateral m site t lu6a and taber lake lateral site t lu6b fig 1 farms for fecal sampling were selected based on rancher participation and presence of animals on land immediately adjacent to the study reservoir and canals taber lake reservoir covers 3 9 km2 and has a storage capacity of 6 4e 6 m3 it receives water from three canals to the south plus drainage from the town of taber during runoff events the reservoir provides important habitat for a variety of waterfowl and songbirds qualitative land use observations identified approximately 0 5 km2 of land grazed by cattle located east southeast of the reservoir water from the reservoir flows into an underground pipe which exits at the outlet t s5 where samples were collected these samples represent the quality of water entering taber lake lateral and lateral m canals but are not necessarily representative of overall water quality throughout this large irregular shaped reservoir lateral m and taber lake lateral canals receive water directly from the reservoir outlet t s5 fig 1 sampling site t lu6a is located on lateral m canal approximately 7 km downstream of t s5 the canal has a discharge capacity of 0 65 m3 s and the water depth at t lu6a ranges from about 45 cm to 60 cm lateral m is immediately surrounded by pasture occupied by horses and cattle as well as a variety of crops e g alfalfa barley canola corn hay and potatoes at least three drain inlets on the canal capture runoff from adjacent land and road ditches and several sloped areas exist where overland flow potentially enters lateral m sampling site t lu6b is located on taber lake lateral canal approximately 5 km downstream of t s5 the canal has a discharge capacity of 0 25 m3 s and the water depth at t lu6b ranges from about 30 cm to 80 cm fig 1 the first kilometer of canal runs through a pasture occupied by cattle with direct access to the channel the canal is otherwise surrounded by cropland e g alfalfa barley canola potatoes wheat and winter wheat and a few industrial and agricultural processing facilities the south side of the canal is adjacent to the railway and provincial highway no 3 at least 24 drain inlets and a couple of sloped areas capture overland flow from adjacent land and road ditches emptying into the canal 2 2 sample collection sampling occurred biweekly from june to september of 2014 year 1 and 2015 year 2 to encompass the entire period of irrigation water use typically late may to mid august depending on crop type and climate water was collected at the reservoir outlet and immediately upstream of the canal tail outs one liter of flowing water mid channel mid depth was collected from each site 8 samples per year using a polyethylene bottle attached to a telescopic pole water and fecal samples were collected concurrently to capture genetic diversity of e coli which may vary with site and time and ensure an accurate representation of the dominant isolates present throughout the study lyautey et al 2010b fecal samples deposited on the ground by various animal species were collected roughly in proportion to the abundance of host species present on land adjacent to irrigation water sampling sites livestock samples were collected from 3 to 10 different fecal pats at 14 different farms wildlife scat was collected from the ground immediately adjacent to reservoirs and wetlands dugouts at farm sites when present wildlife samples were assigned to one of three groups goose duck wild bird species not verified but uric acid present in scat or other wildlife coyote gopher and unverified wildlife species a total of 543 fecal samples were collected from cattle n 252 wildlife n 178 horses n 43 sheep n 36 and swine n 33 in 2015 composite samples of human sewage influent post screening were obtained from taber wastewater treatment plant to account for environmental sources of e coli potentially representing isolates with enhanced survival abilities jang et al 2017 sediment samples were collected in year 2 n 13 using sterile spoons sediment was collected four times at three different wetlands by scraping an area of 2 5 cm2 to a depth of 1 cm at the water s edge collection was repeated for any e coli negative samples sediment samples were treated as a source of environmental e coli independent of water samples 2 3 generic e coli isolation and quantification following

positive for tuf with an unresolved phylogroup were designated unclassified 2 5 escherichia coli accessory gene fingerprinting agf agf was used to apportion host sources to e coli for a more accurate representation of relative contributions tymensen et al 2015 this method consisting of three multiplex pcrs generates a fingerprint for each e coli isolate based on the presence absence of ten different accessory genes this allows for comparison of fingerprints from irrigation water with a reference library of isolates from different host species assays were performed and products resolved

database using blastn and a species assigned according to the closest matching sequence in the database isolates with identification scores less than 94 were identified as campylobacter spp 2 8 physical salinity and nutrient measurements of irrigation water water temperature and stage were measured during collection stage was measured by inserting a portable staff gauge into the water on the most upstream edge of the canal check structure crest and converted to discharge using the contracted rectangular weir formula grant and dawson 1997 water samples were shipped to exova calgary alberta via express courier and analyzed upon receipt for physical salinity and nutrient parameters using standard methods table s4 apha 2005 iso 1997 lesch and suarez 2009 current and historical precipitation data corresponding to fincastle station located within the study area was provided by alberta agriculture and forestry via https agriculture alberta ca acis alberta weather data viewer jsp aaf 2018a 2 9 statistical analyses all statistical tests used a significance threshold of 0 05 water samples with more than 100 e coli per 100 ml were considered to exceed the irrigation guideline for alberta bacterial water quality analyses were applied to number of exceedances instead of concentration since assessments are based on samples meeting or exceeding the guideline fisher s exact test was used to determine differences in numbers of e coli exceedances between sites and years and among distributions of e coli phylogroups e coli agf fingerprints and campylobacter species between sites hosts and years spearman rank order correlation was used to measure the relationship between e coli guideline exceedances and precipitation difference in total precipitation between years was calculated using mann whitney rank sum test as determined by shapiro wilk normality test the t test normal data distribution and equal variance or mann whitney rank sum test data not normally distributed and or unequal variance was conducted on physical nutrient and salinity water quality data and variables that appeared to be related to differences in water quality between seasons canal sites and times when e coli concentrations met and exceeded the guideline were chosen for principle component analysis pca in order to better visualize these differences nutrient and salinity data table s5 and table s6 were normalized using x mean stdev in past hammer et al 2001 multiple parameters represented by a single value were excluded from pca e g dissolved sodium calcium and magnesium are represented by sodium adsorption ration sar up to three principle components should account for at least 80 of the variance a criterion that was met for pca in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 generic e coli guideline exceedances in irrigation canals relative to taber lake reservoir the irrigation guideline of 100 e coli per 100 ml was never exceeded at taber lake reservoir t s5 where concentrations ranged from 2 to 39 cfu 100 ml fig s1 table s5 in contrast e coli concentrations ranged from 7 to 340 cfu 100 ml in canal water samples at t lu6a and tlu6b resulting in guideline exceedances for 50 of the samples from both years there was no difference in the number of e coli exceedances between the two canals p 0 1 the greater number of exceedances observed in water collected from canals compared to the upstream reservoir p 0 001 is consistent with a previous study in the u s partyka et al 2018 3 2 association between precipitation and e coli guideline exceedances total precipitation for year 1 and year 2 fig 2 was compared to historical data during the same approximate time frame over nine years immediately preceding the current study i e early june to late september total precipitation ranged from 62 mm to 268 mm with an average of 168 4 mm aaf 2018b throughout these nine years total precipitation was below the average in only three years total precipitation for the irrigation period during year 1 of the current study i e 236 4 mm was greater than the nine year average and significantly greater than what accumulated in the same period of year 2 p 0 05 when total precipitation was below the nine year average i e 132 9 mm fig 2 and fig s1 escherichia coli exceedances in canals correlated with volume of precipitation in the 48 h period prior to sampling in year 1 r 0 627 p 0 01 but not year 2 r 0 009 p 0 95 as illustrated by pca fig 3 a and b in fact at t lu6a in year 2 guideline exceedances tended to be more associated with drier conditions 48 h prior to sampling relative to when the guideline was met fig 3a contrary to our hypothesis overall there were more guideline exceedances in year 2 the year with fewer and less intense precipitation events than year 1 however this difference was not significant i e 37 5 and 62 5 of samples exceeded the irrigation guideline in year 1 and 2 respectively p 0 1 escherichia coli concentrations at t s5 were always low irrespective of precipitation and or year similar to our findings won et al 2013 observed significantly higher concentrations of e coli in canals when precipitation exceeded 20 mm in the preceding 24 h compared to when precipitation was less than 20 mm outside of rain events e coli concentrations were relatively stable in the study conducted by won et al 2013 which is in contrast to our findings due to the substantially larger volume of water contained within taber lake reservoir it is intuitive that runoff generated by precipitation would have a smaller impact on e coli concentrations at this site than in the canals although there are a few additional upstream sources of water that drain into taber lake section 2 1 the multitude of drain inlets upstream of t lu6b and t lu6a can deliver vast amounts of runoff and potentially fecal bacteria during high precipitation events additionally high soil moisture associated with retrospective precipitation e g snow rain or irrigation can cause runoff that may not otherwise occur due to rainfall alone and under the right conditions it is possible for runoff to occur in the absence of a high precipitation event srinivasan et al 2007 in the study area both soil moisture conditions aaf 2018b and accumulated precipitation fig 2 were higher during year 1 than year 2 soil moisture conditions in year 1 were fair to good and precipitation was near to above average whereas soil moisture conditions were poor to good and precipitation was much below average in year 2 fig 4 illustrates runoff entering taber lake lateral canal during a rain event qualitative land use observations and soil moisture data plus the association between precipitation and e coli guideline exceedances indicate runoff may have contributed to bacterial inputs during year 1 conversely lack of correlation between e coli exceedances and precipitation in year 2 suggests other factors contributed to declining bacterial water quality during dry periods 3 3 escherichia coli phylogroup distributions among irrigation water and animals a total of 1839 e coli from irrigation water n 538 sediment n 67 and animal feces n 1222 were characterized resultant phylogroup distributions among irrigation water and various potential contributing hosts were compared for broad determination of major e coli sources in irrigation water carlos et al 2010 de castro stoppe et al 2014 phylogroup b1 was predominant in reservoir water and canals during both study years fig s2 proportions ranged from 57 to 67 of all e coli isolated this is in agreement with results obtained from other surface water studies in rural areas suggesting potential influence from ruminants de castro stoppe et al 2014 higgins et al 2007 ratajczak et al 2010 predominance of phylogroup b1 in surface water can also be indicative of environmentally adapted isolates that persist and proliferate in aquatic environments berthe et al 2013 ratajczak et al 2010 walk et al 2007 or soil dusek et al 2018 it is possible some of the b1 e coli characterized in the current study are environmentally adapted especially those observed only in irrigation water and sediment additional characterization of these isolates would be required to substantiate this swine and human sewage were ruled out as major e coli contributors based on findings that phylogroup a was significantly less abundant in irrigation water than in sewage and swine feces p 0 0001 and phylogroup b2 was significantly less abundant in irrigation water than human sewage p 0 0001 distributions of these phylogroups among swine and municipal wastewater were consistent with previous reports carlos et al 2010 smati et al 2015 de castro stoppe et al 2014 likewise horses and sheep were ruled out as principle e coli contributors based on the presence of phylogroups b2 c d and f in irrigation water and absence from or presence in lower proportions feces of these two livestock species given the predominance of phylogroup b1 e coli in irrigation water cattle appear to be one of the primary e coli contributors yet these hosts are unlikely to be the source of phylogroup f isolated from irrigation water table s1 in addition to cattle the isolation of phylogroups b2 c d and f from both irrigation water and wildlife scat suggests wildlife are another major contributor of e coli specifically phylogroups a b1 b2 and d are reportedly abundant in the feces of canada geese higgins et al 2007 and several other aquatic bird species kuczkowski et al 2016 although phylogroup distribution trends in the current study do not preclude contributions from secondary sources we can generally deduce that a substantial proportion of e coli in irrigation water were of cattle wildlife and possibly environmental origin 3 4 escherichia coli accessory gene fingerprinting agf agf was used to apportion relative host contributions to e coli guideline exceedances analyses were directed at sources deemed most significant according to phylogroup distributions escherichia coli isolated from irrigation water were sorted into five source groups based on fingerprint identity including cattle specific wildlife specific cosmopolitan i e fingerprints obtained from both cattle and wildlife but isolated occasionally from other hosts other fingerprints associated with humans sheep horses and or swine and environment specific fingerprints not associated with a known host isolated from sediment and or irrigation water overall cosmopolitans comprised the largest proportion of fingerprints in all irrigation water samples collected over both years 60 while cattle and wildlife specific fingerprints accounted for the smallest fraction 6 and 7 respectively fig 5 lack of host specificity for fingerprints is one of the known challenges of source apportionment lyautey et al 2010a among hosts cosmopolitan e coli were particularly abundant in cattle and wildlife feces accounting for 57 of all e coli isolated from these sources compared to 39 of all e coli isolated from other host sources i e sewage swine sheep and horses indicating a greater probability cosmopolitan fingerprints in irrigation water originated from cattle or wildlife sources one can speculate fingerprints associated with both livestock and wildlife especially cattle and wild birds is a result of access to a common water source which could facilitate environmental transmission between these hosts successful transmission from water to host also implies cosmopolitans are adapted for survival in multiple environments including water this would need to be demonstrated through ancillary experimentation 3 4 1 sources of e coli in irrigation water in year 1 average seasonal precipitation in year 1 a small fraction 3 7 of cattle specific fingerprints were observed in canals but not in the reservoir fig 5a proportions of cattle specific e coli fingerprints were similar between both canals and times when water met and exceeded the irrigation guideline we can conclude this source was unlikely a key driver of e coli guideline exceedances as cattle specific inputs appeared to be overshadowed by other sources conversely smaller proportions of wildlife specific e coli were consistently observed in the canals compared to the reservoir this was not surprising since many wild bird species depend on reservoirs for habitat the primary difference observed during e coli guideline exceedances in the canals compared to both the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was met was the proportional increase in environment specific fingerprints i e fingerprints with no known host and a concomitant decrease in cosmopolitan fingerprints fig 5a proportions of environment specific fingerprints increased by 12 and 13 at t lu6a and t lu6b respectively when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded the majority of e coli guideline exceedances in year 1 occurred prior to july 21 fig s1 during this timeframe 12 times more precipitation was recorded than in the following 43 days fig 2 given the positive association between exceedances and precipitation it is reasonable to posit the major source of environment specific e coli was associated with runoff from adjacent agricultural land consistent with our hypothesis more specifically these e coli may be attributable to soil the only substrate not sampled in this study transported with runoff brennan et al 2010 identified a variety of soil e coli that displayed phenotypic characteristics associated with superior environmental fitness relative to laboratory strains and suggested populations of adapted bacterial strains may be maintained when conditions are favorable in soil environments in our study many 32 environment specific fingerprints were common to both irrigation seasons data not shown supporting survival from year to year given this it is possible a portion of these e coli descended from feces transported into the study area e g manure spreading washing of livestock trailers or were introduced by host sources and survived in soil adjacent to canals previous to this study these bacteria would likely be genetically distinct from e coli obtained from water and animal feces during the current study period given the temporal and spatial variability of this species lyautey et al 2010b 3 4 2 sources of e coli in irrigation water in year 2 below average seasonal precipitation in year 2 cattle specific e coli fingerprints were observed in the canals and reservoir fig 5b curiously there were proportionally fewer cattle specific fingerprints in the canals when the irrigation guideline was exceeded relative to when it was met proportions of cattle specific fingerprints in canals when the irrigation guideline was exceeded were similar to those observed in the reservoir conversely smaller proportions of wildlife specific e coli were generally observed in the canals compared to the reservoir like year 1 in contrast to year 1 the primary difference observed during e coli guideline exceedances in the canals relative to the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was met in year 2 was the proportional increase in cosmopolitan fingerprints cosmopolitans could not be attributed to runoff due to lower than normal precipitation in year 2 cosmopolitans also appeared not to originate from recent fecal deposits within the canals as an increase in respective host specific fingerprints would also have been expected which was not the case rather it appears the reservoir was a main source of cosmopolitan fingerprints and environmental conditions within the canals may have promoted survival and in situ proliferation of environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli the notion that taber lake reservoir supplied the environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli contributing to guideline exceedances in the canals is supported by previous research where greater proportions of e coli largely belonging to phylogroup b1 and exhibiting superior environmental fitness were associated with surface water with low levels of e coli contamination during a dry period compared with water recently contaminated by fecal bacteria berthe et al 2013 taber lake reservoir contained low levels of e coli contamination and the majority of these bacteria were cosmopolitans belonging to phylogroup b1 the continual flow of water in the canals might allow e coli to remain suspended in the water column rather than settle out as they would in a reservoir helping to explain why an increase in e coli concentration was observed in the canals relative to the reservoir partyka et al 2017 observed median e coli concentrations to be twice as high in water entering reservoirs than water exiting which suggests reservoirs have a buffering effect on downstream bacterial water quality however if sediments containing environmentally adapted e coli were to be disturbed for example by waterfowl reservoirs could also be a source of e coli further study of water quality at reservoir inlets and outlets compared with downstream channels is recommended to identify other factors that could impact e coli guideline exceedances in irrigation water we examined water temperature and discharge and physicochemical data the latter is discussed under section 3 6 average discharge was similar between times when the irrigation guideline was met and exceeded at the canals in year 1 p 0 1 and 2 p 0 1 table s5 however average discharge in june july of year 2 was double 0 4 m3 s that of august september of years 1 0 2 m3 s p 0 05 and 2 0 2 m3 s p 0 05 discharge is regulated by the irrigation district and directly related to irrigation demands in drought years like year 2 discharge is increased to deliver higher volumes of water in contrast less water is required during periods of average precipitation hence discharge is held relatively constant interestingly in year 2 there were twice as many e coli guideline exceedances during the months following high discharge i e 88 of samples in august september versus 38 in june july fig s1 greater velocities associated with high discharge have the potential to disrupt bacteria containing sediments carrying them from reservoir to canal however it is also possible for larger water volumes associated with increased discharge to dilute bacteria and therefore mask exceedances until water volumes return to normal demand for water typically decreases by august as crops near maturity in year 2 this is when exceedances were observed repeatedly in the canals until the end of irrigation assuming e coli was introduced to canals during periods of high discharge lower discharge may not only amplify concentrations due to decreased water volume but time required to flush accumulated bacteria through the system would also increase furthermore the short doubling time of e coli might allow even small concentrations of environmentally adapted bacteria e g 10 cfu 100 ml to increase beyond the irrigation guideline in less than four doubling times it therefore seems reasonable that a cumulative downstream effect with respect to concentrations of cosmopolitan e coli might be observed under drought and lower discharge conditions providing further support e coli guideline exceedances in year 2 at t lu6a were associated with lower discharge according to spearman rank order correlation r 0 732 p 0 05 and pca fig 3a exceedances at this site in year 2 were also negatively associated with water temperature r 0 850 p 0 01 this was not surprising since lower discharge is associated with decreased water needs in the late irrigation season which occurs simultaneously with decreasing ambient air and water temperatures fig 2 3 5 campylobacter spp distributions among irrigation water and animals overall prevalence of campylobacters in irrigation water was greater than 50 although this did not yield a large number of isolates i e 58 in year 1 and 51 in year 2 to facilitate trend evaluation canal speciation data was combined campylobacter lari was the most common species in canals fig 6 a but was significantly less common p 0 0001 among other potential sources sampled in this study including animal feces and sediment fig 6b unidentified campylobacter spp were also rarely isolated from fecal samples nonetheless c lari and campylobacter spp were more commonly isolated from wildlife scat than livestock manure and human sewage p 0 0001 which implies a significant portion of campylobacters detected in irrigation water may have originated from wildlife the disproportionately large number of c lari isolated from irrigation water relative to wildlife could be attributable to the enhanced ability of this particular species to survive in surface waters obiri danso et al 2001 campylobacter spp prevalence did not correspond with e coli concentration data not shown which is consistent with previous studies hellein et al 2011 differences in species distributions were however observed between different years irrigation water source i e reservoir versus canal and instances when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded relative to when it was met fig 6a in year 1 the most notable differences in campylobacter spp distributions were the presence of c jejuni and absence of c coli when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded in canals relative to when it was met in the reservoir and canals results are consistent with the notion that c jejuni a ubiquitous species may have been present in runoff to which the canals are susceptible during times of high precipitation in year 1 in contrast when the irrigation guideline for e coli was exceeded in year 2 campylobacter spp distributions were similar between the reservoir and canals specifically all three species of campylobacter isolated in the study were observed in the reservoir and canals when the e coli guideline was exceeded but not when it was met although the small number of campylobacter isolates precluded correlation analyses differences in species distributions between the reservoir and canals in year 1 e g presence of c jejuni only in canals when e coli exceeded the irrigation guideline support the finding that runoff from surrounding agricultural land was the primary contributor to exceedances of the irrigation guideline for e coli likewise in year 2 similar campylobacter spp distributions between the reservoir and canals when e coli exceeded the irrigation guideline supports our finding that the reservoir may have contributed to these exceedances 3 6 association between irrigation water chemistry and e coli guideline exceedances distinct patterns in water chemistry were revealed by pca at site t lu6a fig 3a in both years of the study separation was observed along the x pc1 and y axis pc2 according to nutrients i e total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn total suspended solids tss and salinity i e sodium adsorption ratio sar total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec year 1 salinity values were generally higher among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline whereas nutrient concentrations were generally lower among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline relative to those that met the guideline table s6 interestingly the reverse was true in year 2 samples that exceeded the e coli guideline tended to have lower salinity and higher nutrient values than samples that met the guideline in year 1 at site t lu6b the majority of separation was observed along the y axis pc2 according to nutrients where tp tn and tss tended to be higher among samples that exceeded the irrigation guideline than those that met the guideline fig 3b table s5 in year 2 chemistry profiles of water samples collected at t lu6b grouped together regardless of e coli concentration separation between year 1 and year 2 samples was evident along the x axis pc 1 and appeared to be largely explained by differences in salinity parameters i e tds ec sar that is overall values associated with salinity were greater in year 1 than year 2 at this site in year 1 higher salinity t lu6a and nutrient t lu6b values associated with samples that exceeded the e coli guideline compared to when it was met further support the notion canal water was impacted by runoff from adjacent agricultural land that contributed to guideline exceedances in year 2 lower salinity values associated with samples that exceeded the e coli guideline at t lu6a occurred during times of lower water discharge fig 3b and section 3 4 2 consequently we suspect decreased contact between irrigation water and precipitated salts along canal banks may have contributed to lower salinity during times of exceedances conversely it makes sense salinity values increased with discharge despite the absence of runoff and e coli guideline exceedances since an increase in water volume would lead to increased dissolving of precipitated salts unlike t lu6a discharge was similar at t lu6b for all samples regardless of e coli concentration and while guideline exceedances were likely attributed to in situ growth of environmentally adapted cosmopolitan e coli the driving factor of this growth and transport remains undetermined while salinity concentrations and nutrient availability are known to impact e coli survival wanjugi et al 2016 the relatively low concentrations of these parameters obtained in the current study i e below that of typical bacterial growth media suggest that neither had a significant impact on e coli persistence in the water column wanjugi et al 2016 reported that higher nutrient levels increased e coli survival in river water thus it is conceivable nutrients facilitated e coli persistence in the current study in contrast however this fib has also been shown to maintain cell viability in nutrient poor environments takano et al 2017 and there were instances in both years of the current study when exceedances were observed among samples with some of the lowest nutrient concentrations fig 4 table s5 analysis of water chemistry substantiates the finding that irrigation guideline exceedances were likely driven by sources unique to each year of the study while variability in chemical parameters between t lu6a and t lu6b can likely be attributed to site associated differences such as land use and number of drain inlets along the canals partyka et al 2017 also concluded variability in relationships between indicator bacteria and antecedent environmental conditions in an estuary was driven by unmeasured site specific conditions and each system may be better understood if modeled independently 4 conclusions a combination of biological physical and chemical water quality data aided in identifying the most significant non point sources of e coli and factors contributing to water quality degradation in irrigation canals which is compulsory for determining the best strategies to mitigate bacterial contamination impacts of fecal pollution in terms of e coli concentration appeared to be greater in irrigation canals relative to reservoir outlets this is likely a consequence of numerous drain inlets and small volumes of water associated with canals compared to reservoirs nonetheless reservoirs may contribute to guideline exceedances of e coli downstream especially during extended periods of low precipitation thus mitigation strategies may need to address cumulative impacts on water quality at such sites a significant proportion of environment specific e coli fingerprints were detected repeatedly in reservoir water and canals but not representative animal hosts this finding supports previous claims of environmentally adapted bacteria and may have important implications for bacterial water quality assessments and risk mitigation strategies to mitigate environmental growth of e coli in canals could include prevention of nutrient sediment loading and sediment disruption infiltration weirs or infiltration check structures slow water flow and could be used to encourage bacteria to settle out of suspension similar to what occurs naturally in reservoirs excess sediment could be removed with canal dredging equipment or reduced by incorporating an appropriate liner to replace

18899,the removal of bromide br and iodide i from source waters mitigates the formation of brominated and iodinated disinfection by products dbps which are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues in this study we report on our recently developed environmental friendly method for the preparation of novel silver chloride superfine activated carbon composite agcl spac to rapidly and selectively remove br and i from surface waters the material characteristics were tracked before and after treatment using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectra xps spectroscopies the results showed very fast removal kinetics of br and i by agcl spac with equilibrium times at 150 s and 10 s respectively i e 2 3 orders of magnitudes faster than previously tested ag based composites in addition agcl spac was evaluated under eight different cl concentrations up to 400 mg l and exhibited high removal efficiencies for i i e 90 at all tested conditions and br i e 80 at cl 0 5 200 mg l and 60 75 at extreme cl conditions 300 400 mg l unlike previous ag based composites agcl spac performance was not affected by elevated concentrations of two types of natural organic matter 2 16 mg nom l the superior performance was further confirmed in four different surface waters and one groundwater after the removal of br and i from all waters by agcl spac the subsequent dbps formation trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles total organic halogens tox bromine substitution factor bsf and calculated cytotoxicity under the uniform formation conditions ufc decreased significantly overall this novel composite represents a promising alternative approach to be integrated continuously or seasonally for controlling the formation of brominated and or iodinated dbps at water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords superfine activated carbon silver chloride bromide iodide disinfection by products water toxicity 1 introduction bromide br is ubiquitous in natural waters e g rivers groundwaters with a concentration range of 100 3000 μg l amy et al 1993 weinberg et al 2002 with elevated concentrations in waters affected by wastewater discharges and or waters from hydraulic fracturing operations although br itself is not toxic it reacts with natural organic matter and disinfectants during water treatment which forms regulated disinfection byproducts dbps such as bromate and brominated trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa richardson 2014 iodide i may also be present along with br with a reported average br i mass ratio of approximately 10 1 in natural waters jones et al 2012 during chloramination i can result in the formation of highly toxic iodinated dbps jones et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the cyto and genotoxicity results showed that the toxicity index of iodinated and brominated dbps are 105 and 104 times their chlorinated analogues i e regulated dbps respectively plewa et al 2017 thus because they serve as the precursors of toxic dbps the removal of br and i is essential for public health and regulatory compliance benefits meanwhile the conventional water treatment technologies coagulation flocculation activated carbon etc are not effective in the removal of ambient br and i richardson et al 2007 some advanced techniques such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration electrolysis and capacitive deionization showed a high removal of br and i watson et al 2012 however membranes are expensive and may not be easily integrated into existing water treatment plants and electrochemical removal of bromide involves oxidizing bromide to bromine that forms different toxic brominated dbps dorji et al 2018 kimbrough and suffet 2002 previous studies have discussed the use of silver ag based techniques to remove br and i from water by forming and precipitating the insoluble silver halogenides i e silver bromide agbr and silver iodide agi three main application methods of silver for halide removal have been described in the literature first silver cathodes were used in electrolysis cells for the removal of br bo 2008 second silver impregnated adsorbents were synthesized and tested for halide removal such as ag impregnated carbon aerogels sanchez polo et al 2007 activated carbons chen et al 2017 ho and kraus 1981 hoskins et al 2002 graphene oxides kidd et al 2018 calcium alginate zhang et al 2011 and polymers gong et al 2013 polo et al 2016 third recent studies have demonstrated the direct use of silver salts i e silver nitrate agno3 gan et al 2018 or silver nanoparticles polo et al 2017 for the removal of halides from surface waters however several critical limitations have also been observed including 1 the removal efficiency decreased when these materials were tested under typical water treatment conditions because of the competition with coexisting chloride ions cl and natural organic matter nom 2 the removal efficiency depended on the dispersion and the availability of silver solids on the sorbent surface 3 all reported impregnation methods involved the oxidation of carbon surfaces which is not an environmentally friendly approach and results in hazardous concentrated acid wastes 4 the impregnation methods utilized high silver nitrate concentration 50 000 75 000 mg l however the silver content after the impregnation was still very limited and 5 the direct use of silver salts or particles possess a high risk of silver release in the treated water therefore new effective methods for halide removal are needed to address and overcome those limitations herein we report on our recently developed silver chloride on superfine activated carbon composite agcl spac for rapid and selective removal of br and i from surface waters we hypothesized that using agcl will overcome the competition of cl which normally coexist in natural waters with cl br ratio of 100 200 besides spac provides an extra advantage of fast removal kinetics and protects agcl from photo oxidation to maintain its high performance the specific objectives were i synthesis and characterization of agcl spac composite ii test the composite performance under challenging conditions by elevating the concentration of cl and different nom and iii test the removal of br and i from different surface waters and evaluate the subsequent change in the formation of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated carbons chemicals and reagents three different granular activated carbons gac filtrasorb 400 bituminous coal calgon hydrodarco 3000 lignite coal norit and aquacarb 1230c coconut shell siemens were used to prepare spac with a bead mill minicer netzsch premier technologies exton pa usa as described in our previous study partlan et al 2016 the selected physicochemical properties of the spac are summarized in table 1 the br i and cl stock solutions 1000 mg l were prepared by dissolving reagent grade 99 0 sodium bromide nabr sodium iodide nai and sodium chloride nacl salts sigma aldrich in distilled deionized water ddw and the desired concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solutions with ddw 2 2 preparation and characterization of agcl spac composite agcl spac composites were prepared by dissolving 1 g of agno3 in 100 ml of ethanol sigma aldrich before adding 1 g spac all spac are stored in slurry form and the mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer for 2 h then 800 μl of 5m hcl solution was spiked to the mixture to maintain ag cl molar ratio of 1 0 the agcl spac composite was kept mixing for one more hour the mixture was left to settle and the supernatant ethanol was decanted and replaced by ddw a rotary evaporator was used to remove any residual ethanol excess amounts of nacl were added to the decanted ethanol and no white precipitate agcl was formed that indicated the total transformation of agno3 in the composite it should be noted that agcl is sensitive to light and heat therefore centrifugation was avoided because it requires resuspension via sonication that would heat and convert agcl particles to metallic silver finally the concentration of the agcl spac composite in the final slurry was determined by drying a known volume of the solution at 105 c overnight and measuring the weight of the solid mass silver concentrations in the solutions were measured using plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes nitrogen gas adsorption was performed at 77 k with an asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument corp u s then brunauer emmett teller bet equation and density functional theory dft were used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distributions respectively the particle size distribution was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer sald 2300 shimadzu corporation japan scanning electron microscopy sem imaging and elemental compositions of all samples was carried out in the se mode using energy dispersive x ray edx measurement with a hitachi hd 2000 stem at an operating voltage of 150 kv x ray diffraction xrd diffractograms were acquired with cu kα1 2 1 5406 å ni filtered radiation using a bruker d8 advance instrument equipped with a lynxeye psd detector diffractograms were collected from 15 to 70 2θ with 0 03 2θ step size and 8 s time step while the sample was spun at 15 rpm the divergence slit was set at 0 3 antiscatter slit to 3 primary and secondary soller slits were 2 5 and a detector window opening was 2 71 x ray photoelectron spectra xps were collected using a kratos axis ultradld instrument we used an alkα monochromatic flux with exciting radiation at 1486 6 ev and 150 w the lens system of the photoelectron analyzer was set in the electrostatic mode to avoid rearranging and or changing of the orientation of the magnetic particles during acquisition survey spectra were collected with the pass energy of 160 ev and high resolution spectra at 20 ev with a resolution of 0 1 ev 2 3 adsorption studies 2 3 1 kinetics experiments each data point of the kinetic experiments was determined by an individual batch experiment with an initial br or i concentration of 1 mg l and agcl spac dose of 10 mg l at ph value of 6 5 0 2 kinetics experiments were also run with mixtures of br 1 mg l and i 1 mg l at cl concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l all mixtures were shaken at a room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm after certain time intervals samples were collected filtered pre washed 0 45 μm pes filter and kept refrigerated until further measurements 2 3 2 effect of chloride and nom on br and i removal the effects of cl and nom were evaluated in batch mode with an initial br or i concentration of 1 mg l and agcl spac concentration of 25 mg l at ph value of 6 5 0 2 the tested cl concentrations were 0 5 10 50 100 150 200 300 and 400 mg l to cover challenging range of water quality conditions two nom isolates collected from the influent of different drinking water treatment plants in south carolina using reverse osmosis and followed by resin fractionation during a previous study were used song et al 2009 the tested nom solutions had different specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 of 4 9 and 1 7 l mg m and they were used to evaluate the performance of agcl spac under varying nom concentration with doc at 1 2 4 and 8 mg l the composite performance was also tested in four different surface waters and one groundwater with spiked br and i concentrations of 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively it should be highlighted the groundwater was not spiked with br because it was collected from a site with high br level the cl concentrations were adjusted to 50 mg l in all waters to compare the effect of the water source the characteristics of all waters were summarized in table 2 2 4 chlorination and chloramination experiments chlorine and chloramine demand tests were performed under uniform formation conditions ufc to determine the initial chlorine and chloramine concentrations that results in chlorine and chloramine residuals after 24 h of 1 0 mg l and 2 0 mg l as cl2 respectively for chlorination samples were buffered at ph 7 5 and spiked with target pre determined concentrations using sodium hypochlorite stock solution 5 available free chlorine 1 g l chloramination was performed using preformed chloramine at ph 7 5 preformed chloramine stock solution 1 g l as cl2 was prepared by titrating ammonium sulfate stock solution samples were analyzed for residual chlorine and chloramine according to the dpd colorimetric method sm 4500 cl g residual chlorine and chloramine was quenched with a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid 99 obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo and acs grade na2so3 purchased from emd milllipore co billerica ma respectively after quenching samples were extracted and analyzed for thms i thms haas halogenated acetonitrile han and total organic halogen tox i e tocl tobr and toi a detailed description of extraction and analysis of dbps and tox can be found in the supporting information section as well as in our previous publications text s1 in si ersan et al 2019 liu et al 2018 cytotoxicity of the chlorinated and chloraminated water samples was calculated using cytotoxicity index values obtained from the previous literature table s2 in brief the calculations were performed by dividing the molar concentration of each species by the cytotoxicity index values c1 2 given as m obtained from the literature the analytical methods used in this study and their minimum detection limits mdl are listed in the supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microscopic and spectroscopic characterization of agcl spac micrographs of the spac and agcl spac1 samples are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively that confirm the presence and the attachment of agcl particles on the carbon surface edx analysis indicated that the composite contains c ag and cl fig 1c as shown in fig 2 spac showed xrd diffraction peaks at 26 and 54 2θ that are attributed to the diffractions from the graphite like structure oh et al 2015 however agcl spac showed four diffraction peaks located at 27 8 32 2 46 2 and 57 5 that were assigned to cubic agcl jcpds no 31 1238 and indexed to the 111 200 220 and 222 crystal planes respectively liang et al 2018 these observations were further confirmed using xps fig 2b s2 and table s3 from the xps survey spectrum it was possible to detect the presence of ag 0 4 and cl 0 6 some residuals of si al s zr and n were also detected in the starting spac material and in all samples in the ag 3d spectrum is possible to identify only one doublet ag 3d5 2 at 366 8 ev ag 3d 3 2 at 372 8 ev that is assigned to ag in agcl while formation of a stable silver carbide ag c bond was excluded boukhvalov et al 2018 the c 1s spectra are similar for all the 4 samples and were fitted with 6 different components the peak at 284 6 ev stems from sp 2 sp 3 non functionalized carbon c c c c c h the peak at 286 7 ev originates from c o bond the peak at 288 3 ev from c o bond while the peak at 289 5 ev is attributed to o c o bond peaks at 291 0 ev and 293 4 ev are typical of shake up satellite papirer et al 1994 the cl 2p spectrum shows at least two components the first one is attributed to cl and is characterized by a doublet with a cl 2p3 2 peak located at 197 05 ev while the second doublet at 199 85 ev originates from cl2 strydom et al 1990 the same analysis were also performed on the spent composites after treatment as described in the following sections 3 2 removal efficiency of br and i by adsorption on agcl spac preliminary experiments were run to evaluate the removal of br and i using the three composites i e agcl spac1 agcl spac2 and agcl spac3 as shown in fig s1 all composites exhibited similar removal efficiencies for br and i in the presence and in the absence of spiked cl concentrations at 100 mg l these results indicated that the spac types and characteristics had minimal effect on the composites performance thus all experiments in the subsequent sections were run with only agcl spac1 all samples were measured after treatment using icp aes and no silver leaching was observed 3 2 1 br and i removal kinetics fig 3 depicts the fast removal kinetics of br and i by agcl spac1 with equilibrium times at 150 s and 10 s respectively the applied agcl spac1 dose was only 10 mg l which reflects the superior performance of our composite compared to other previously tested ag based materials for instance rajaeian et al 2018 have recently reported on the kinetics of br removal using silver impregnated activated carbon siac norit ag cabot norit at initial br concentration of 1 6 mg l and siac dose of 800 mg l although they have used adsorbent dose 30 times higher than our tested concentration the equilibrium time using siac was in the range of 120 180 min i e 50 60 times longer than agcl spac in addition sanchez polo et al 2007 developed ag doped carbon aerogels and tested the removal kinetics of br and i 100 μg l at composite dose of 1000 mg l despite the high dose in their study the removal did not reach an equilibrium within their tested experiment time i e 60 70 min similarly the equilibrium time for br removal using silver loaded porous carbon spheres was in the range of 240 720 min gong et al 2013 at the end of the kinetics experiments the composites were collected dried and tested using xrd and xps fig 2 confirms the formation of agbr diffraction peaks at 31and 44 2θ and agi diffraction peaks at 25 33 43 48 and 59 2θ lee et al 2000 zang and farnood 2008 these observations are in line with the xps analysis as summarized in table s3 fig 2b and s2 for agbr spac ag surface concentration is 0 6 and br 0 8 while for agi ag is 1 5 and i is 16 for agbr spac the peak position of ag 3d5 2 is 367 5 ev and br 3d5 2 is 67 7 ev confirming the formation of agbr the presence of agi for agi spac is supported by the ag 3d5 2 peak at 368 0 ev and i 3d5 2 peak at 619 1 ev strydom et al 1991 in this study we also report on the effect of coexisting anions on the halides removal kinetics by agcl spac1 as shown in fig 3 only a slight change in the kinetics of the simultaneous removal of br and i was observed further the effect of two cl concentrations 10 and 100 mg l on the removal kinetics was evaluated the br removal was slower only when cl concentration was elevated to 100 mg l with an observed equilibrium time of 10 15 min meanwhile elevating cl concentration did not affect the removal speed of i using agcl spac1 to the best of our knowledge no similar kinetics data i e under challenging conditions has been reported in the literature for other ag based sorbents 3 2 2 effect of chloride and nom on br and i removal previous studies have indicated high cl concentrations as a limiting factor for br removal chen et al 2017 gan et al 2018 kidd et al 2018 in our study the removal of br and i by agcl spac1 was evaluated under 8 different cl concentrations up to 400 mg l which corresponded to molar ratios of cl br and cl i up to 900 and 1450 respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a agcl spac1 maintained very high i removal efficiency 90 at all tested conditions concurrently the br removal efficiencies were 85 97 at cl concentrations up to 200 mg l when cl concentration was raised to 300 400 mg l the br removal efficiencies decreased to 65 75 recently kidd et al 2018 tested ag impregnated graphene oxide and showed br removal efficiency of 90 under cl br mass ratio up to only 100 the maximum tested cl concentration was 20 mg l besides their material in comparison to agcl spac needed extensive oxidation steps that would reflect on their applicability and environmental impact the higher removal of i than br using agcl spac was attributed to their differences in solubility as the solubility product constants ksp for agbr and agi are 5 35 10 13 and 8 52 10 17 respectively it should be noted that some previous studies suggested that higher levels of cl ions causes the formation of bioavailable agcl2 ions silver 2003 however no silver was detected in our samples at high cl concentration conditions nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewaters with orders of magnitudes higher concentrations than br and i ateia et al 2017a shimizu et al 2018 the effects of nom concentration 2 16 mg nom l and type i e high suva254 and low suva254 on br and i removal by agcl spac1 are shown in fig 4b the removal efficiencies of i were 95 5 at all tested conditions using both nom solutions i e doc 1 8 mg l the br removal was not affected by the elevated concentrations of low suva254 nom however the removal efficiency decreased by 2 4 and 7 when the concentration of high suva254 nom increased to 2 4 and 8 mg doc l the previously tested ag based materials were severely impacted with the presence of nom by two main hypothesized mechanisms 1 high suva254 nom have high molecular size that can cause blockage of the pores and 2 nom is negatively charged and can interact with ag ateia et al 2017b gabelich et al 2002 sanchez polo et al 2007 the main removal mechanism of br and i by agcl spac1 is by ion exchange which is reflected on its selectivity and superior effectiveness compared to previous materials we have further examined the performance of agcl spac1 in four different spiked surface waters and one groundwater table 2 the initial br i mass ratio was 10 in all surface waters and was 20 in the groundwater due to the high br concentration in the source the removal efficiencies of br and i from the groundwater were 94 3 and 91 respectively besides except for lake water impacted with a treated wastewater effluent organic matter efom the removal of br and i from all tested surface waters in this study were in the range of 84 86 and 95 97 respectively fig 5 the efom impacted lake water reduced the br and i removal by 12 and 7 respectively this reduction might be attributed to the presence of other constituents in the treated wastewater the impact of br and i removal from all tested waters on the subsequent dbps formation was further discussed in the following section 3 2 3 the impact of agcl spac on thms haas and han formation and speciation for the tested five water sources the impact of agcl spac1 treatment on the dbp formation and speciation was evaluated under both chlorination and chloramination conditions fig 6 shows the formation and speciation of dbps i e thms haas and hans in the studied waters before and after agcl spac treatment thms formation in lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 46 0 57 2 193 1 137 5 174 6 μg l respectively fig 6a among the studied waters higher total formation of thms were observed in tsw efom and aom sources as compared to lw and gw sources the observed differences in total formations can be explained by the differences in organic matter concentration doc and type suva254 which can alter the formation and speciation of both cl thms and br thms for example whereas both tsw and aom had similar doc concentrations their total thm formations were slightly different tsw had higher suva254 value than aom table 2 which can explain thm formation difference while the gw s doc concentration and suva254 value were less than lw the total thms formations were similar the reason for high formation in gw is the higher initial br concentration table 2 although the tested waters had varying suva254 no difference was observed among bsfthm values table s4 this might be attributed to the relatively high initial bromide concentration br 0 12 5 μm when compared to previous studies liu et al 2018 the speciation of thms in all studied water sources were in the order of tbm dbcm dcbm tcm in raw water samples tbm was the dominant specie among the all thm species which can be attributed to high initial concentration of br in these waters after agcl spac1 treatment tbm concentrations significantly decreased by 82 94 96 79 and 94 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively while the concentration of tbm significantly decreased in the studied waters the formation of tcm and dcbm increased due to shift in speciation from br thm to cl br thms gan et al 2018 the decrease in bsfthm further shows the effectiveness of agcl spac1 treatment on the removal of br thms where 44 47 60 32 49 decrease in bsfthm were observed in lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 6b illustrates haa formation and speciation of raw and treated waters by agcl spac1 total haa formation for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 106 3 15 73 44 3 70 6 88 6 μg l respectively although the initial doc concentrations were similar 2 mg l in tsw and aom the haa formation was 2 times higher in aom than tsw br haas dbaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa were the dominant species among the all detected haa species while 60 of haas species in all studied waters were br haas they decreased significantly after agcl spac1 treatment for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters by 74 5 73 4 50 6 57 9 and 55 0 respectively bsfhaa values were also calculated and the results showed that bsfhaa values decreased 41 8 64 6 59 3 30 0 and 46 2 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 6c shows the formation speciation and removal of hans by agcl spac total han formation ranged from 1 3 to 10 9 μg l while total han formation of lw and gw were below 2 0 μg l tsw efom and aom had similar han formations 4 9 5 2 5 2 μg l respectively the speciation of hans in all studied water sources were in the order of dban bcan dcan can tcan and ban were not detected the observed higher concentration of dban among the all han species attributed to high initial concentration of br in these waters total han removals in tsw efom and aom were 42 5 41 6 45 4 respectively after agcl spac1 treatment speciation of hans shifted from br han dban to cl br hans dcan and bcan which can be linked to reduced concentration of br in the background waters because of very low or no formation of chlorinated hans bsfhan values were higher than 0 9 for all waters removal percentages of dban for lw gw tsw efom and aom were 55 5 99 77 7 55 2 75 1 respectively which also confirms the br selectivity of this spac bsfhan decrease calculated as 26 2 99 53 2 12 7 52 3 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 7 shows the total formation and removal of organic halides tocl utocl tobr and utobr from the studied water sources after agcl spac treatment total tox formation for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 258 159 439 372 and 430 μg l respectively in fig 7 the known tox consist of measured thms haas and hans and the unknown tox calculated by subtracting known tox from total tox overall in percent wise 49 36 50 49 and 55 of the total tox comprises of known tox in lw gw tsw efom and aom respectively the application of agcl spac treatment was effective in reducing both known and unknown tobr by 58 1 68 4 71 3 54 1 and 63 6 from lw gw tsw efom and aom respectively experiments were also conducted under chloramination conditions to evaluate the impact of agcl spac treatment on i thms removal and results were given in fig 8 total i thm formations for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 17 0 32 1 14 0 28 3 and 8 8 μg l respectively among the detected species tim iodoform was the most dominant species fig 8 due to the high initial i concentration of 100 μg l in all source waters the treatment results showed that agcl spac was also very effective to remove i thms from water where total i thm removals in lw gw tsw efom and aom were 96 9 92 5 96 6 91 5 and 99 respectively fig 8 the results indicate that agcl spac1 was effective in removing both brominated and iodinated dbps simultaneously which brings extra benefit when the formation of br i dbps is of concern during water treatment in addition the impact of agcl spac1 treatment on the calculated cytotoxicity of raw and treated samples was investigated based on the measured dbps the total calculated cytotoxicity values for the studied raw waters were in the order of aom tsw efom lw gw fig s3a the results also indicated that hans i e dbps with the highest cytotoxicity index values within the detected dbp classes in this study controlled the calculated cytotoxicity of the samples regardless of their lower formations after agcl spac treatment calculated cytotoxicity values decreased by 23 3 47 1 59 3 27 4 and 59 2 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively similarly under chloramination oxidation the total calculated cytotoxicity values for the studied waters were in the order of efom gw tsw lw aom fig s3b after agcl spac1 treatment calculated cytotoxicity values decreased by 99 8 93 8 99 8 94 1 and 99 from lw gw tsw efom and aom waters respectively 4 conclusions this study explored for the first time the use of agcl spac composite for the removal of br and i from four different surface waters and one groundwater to control the formation of the br dbps and i dbps the proposed synthesis method unlike previously reported studies is simple and environmental friendly as it does not require any acid oxidation steps in addition the resulting composite showed rapid and selective removal for br and i under typical challenging background water conditions i e cl 0 5 400 mg l and nom 1 8 mg doc l a significant decreased in the formation of the subsequent dbps thms haas and hans and the total organic halogens tox was observed after the application of agcl spac1 to all tested waters under ufc conditions in addition similar reduction was shown in the calculated bsf and calculated cytotoxicity of all waters in full scale water treatment plants agcl spac can be used in the same way as regular spac i e the addition to a mixed tank preceding a filter such as an ultrafiltration takaesu et al 2019 thus the continuous and or seasonal integration of such novel composites in water treatment plants can represent an alternative strategy to control the formation of brominated and or iodinated dbps author agreement this is to certify that all authors have

18899,the removal of bromide br and iodide i from source waters mitigates the formation of brominated and iodinated disinfection by products dbps which are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues in this study we report on our recently developed environmental friendly method for the preparation of novel silver chloride superfine activated carbon composite agcl spac to rapidly and selectively remove br and i from surface waters the material characteristics were tracked before and after treatment using scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectra xps spectroscopies the results showed very fast removal kinetics of br and i by agcl spac with equilibrium times at 150 s and 10 s respectively i e 2 3 orders of magnitudes faster than previously tested ag based composites in addition agcl spac was evaluated under eight different cl concentrations up to 400 mg l and exhibited high removal efficiencies for i i e 90 at all tested conditions and br i e 80 at cl 0 5 200 mg l and 60 75 at extreme cl conditions 300 400 mg l unlike previous ag based composites agcl spac performance was not affected by elevated concentrations of two types of natural organic matter 2 16 mg nom l the superior performance was further confirmed in four different surface waters and one groundwater after the removal of br and i from all waters by agcl spac the subsequent dbps formation trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles total organic halogens tox bromine substitution factor bsf and calculated cytotoxicity under the uniform formation conditions ufc decreased significantly overall this novel composite represents a promising alternative approach to be integrated continuously or seasonally for controlling the formation of brominated and or iodinated dbps at water treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords superfine activated carbon silver chloride bromide iodide disinfection by products water toxicity 1 introduction bromide br is ubiquitous in natural waters e g rivers groundwaters with a concentration range of 100 3000 μg l amy et al 1993 weinberg et al 2002 with elevated concentrations in waters affected by wastewater discharges and or waters from hydraulic fracturing operations although br itself is not toxic it reacts with natural organic matter and disinfectants during water treatment which forms regulated disinfection byproducts dbps such as bromate and brominated trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa richardson 2014 iodide i may also be present along with br with a reported average br i mass ratio of approximately 10 1 in natural waters jones et al 2012 during chloramination i can result in the formation of highly toxic iodinated dbps jones et al 2011 liu et al 2018 the cyto and genotoxicity results showed that the toxicity index of iodinated and brominated dbps are 105 and 104 times their chlorinated analogues i e regulated dbps respectively plewa et al 2017 thus because they serve as the precursors of toxic dbps the removal of br and i is essential for public health and regulatory compliance benefits meanwhile the conventional water treatment technologies coagulation flocculation activated carbon etc are not effective in the removal of ambient br and i richardson et al 2007 some advanced techniques such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration electrolysis and capacitive deionization showed a high removal of br and i watson et al 2012 however membranes are expensive and may not be easily integrated into existing water treatment plants and electrochemical removal of bromide involves oxidizing bromide to bromine that forms different toxic brominated dbps dorji et al 2018 kimbrough and suffet 2002 previous studies have discussed the use of silver ag based techniques to remove br and i from water by forming and precipitating the insoluble silver halogenides i e silver bromide agbr and silver iodide agi three main application methods of silver for halide removal have been described in the literature first silver cathodes were used in electrolysis cells for the removal of br bo 2008 second silver impregnated adsorbents were synthesized and tested for halide removal such as ag impregnated carbon aerogels sanchez polo et al 2007 activated carbons chen et al 2017 ho and kraus 1981 hoskins et al 2002 graphene oxides kidd et al 2018 calcium alginate zhang et al 2011 and polymers gong et al 2013 polo et al 2016 third recent studies have demonstrated the direct use of silver salts i e silver nitrate agno3 gan et al 2018 or silver nanoparticles polo et al 2017 for the removal of halides from surface waters however several critical limitations have also been observed including 1 the removal efficiency decreased when these materials were tested under typical water treatment conditions because of the competition with coexisting chloride ions cl and natural organic matter nom 2 the removal efficiency depended on the dispersion and the availability of silver solids on the sorbent surface 3 all reported impregnation methods involved the oxidation of carbon surfaces which is not an environmentally friendly approach and results in hazardous concentrated acid wastes 4 the impregnation methods utilized high silver nitrate concentration 50 000 75 000 mg l however the silver content after the impregnation was still very limited and 5 the direct use of silver salts or particles possess a high risk of silver release in the treated water therefore new effective methods for halide removal are needed to address and overcome those limitations herein we report on our recently developed silver chloride on superfine activated carbon composite agcl spac for rapid and selective removal of br and i from surface waters we hypothesized that using agcl will overcome the competition of cl which normally coexist in natural waters with cl br ratio of 100 200 besides spac provides an extra advantage of fast removal kinetics and protects agcl from photo oxidation to maintain its high performance the specific objectives were i synthesis and characterization of agcl spac composite ii test the composite performance under challenging conditions by elevating the concentration of cl and different nom and iii test the removal of br and i from different surface waters and evaluate the subsequent change in the formation of dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated carbons chemicals and reagents three different granular activated carbons gac filtrasorb 400 bituminous coal calgon hydrodarco 3000 lignite coal norit and aquacarb 1230c coconut shell siemens were used to prepare spac with a bead mill minicer netzsch premier technologies exton pa usa as described in our previous study partlan et al 2016 the selected physicochemical properties of the spac are summarized in table 1 the br i and cl stock solutions 1000 mg l were prepared by dissolving reagent grade 99 0 sodium bromide nabr sodium iodide nai and sodium chloride nacl salts sigma aldrich in distilled deionized water ddw and the desired concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solutions with ddw 2 2 preparation and characterization of agcl spac composite agcl spac composites were prepared by dissolving 1 g of agno3 in 100 ml of ethanol sigma aldrich before adding 1 g spac all spac are stored in slurry form and the mixture was placed on a magnetic stirrer for 2 h then 800 μl of 5m hcl solution was spiked to the mixture to maintain ag cl molar ratio of 1 0 the agcl spac composite was kept mixing for one more hour the mixture was left to settle and the supernatant ethanol was decanted and replaced by ddw a rotary evaporator was used to remove any residual ethanol excess amounts of nacl were added to the decanted ethanol and no white precipitate agcl was formed that indicated the total transformation of agno3 in the composite it should be noted that agcl is sensitive to light and heat therefore centrifugation was avoided because it requires resuspension via sonication that would heat and convert agcl particles to metallic silver finally the concentration of the agcl spac composite in the final slurry was determined by drying a known volume of the solution at 105 c overnight and measuring the weight of the solid mass silver concentrations in the solutions were measured using plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes nitrogen gas adsorption was performed at 77 k with an asap 2020 analyzer micromeritics instrument corp u s then brunauer emmett teller bet equation and density functional theory dft were used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distributions respectively the particle size distribution was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer sald 2300 shimadzu corporation japan scanning electron microscopy sem imaging and elemental compositions of all samples was carried out in the se mode using energy dispersive x ray edx measurement with a hitachi hd 2000 stem at an operating voltage of 150 kv x ray diffraction xrd diffractograms were acquired with cu kα1 2 1 5406 å ni filtered radiation using a bruker d8 advance instrument equipped with a lynxeye psd detector diffractograms were collected from 15 to 70 2θ with 0 03 2θ step size and 8 s time step while the sample was spun at 15 rpm the divergence slit was set at 0 3 antiscatter slit to 3 primary and secondary soller slits were 2 5 and a detector window opening was 2 71 x ray photoelectron spectra xps were collected using a kratos axis ultradld instrument we used an alkα monochromatic flux with exciting radiation at 1486 6 ev and 150 w the lens system of the photoelectron analyzer was set in the electrostatic mode to avoid rearranging and or changing of the orientation of the magnetic particles during acquisition survey spectra were collected with the pass energy of 160 ev and high resolution spectra at 20 ev with a resolution of 0 1 ev 2 3 adsorption studies 2 3 1 kinetics experiments each data point of the kinetic experiments was determined by an individual batch experiment with an initial br or i concentration of 1 mg l and agcl spac dose of 10 mg l at ph value of 6 5 0 2 kinetics experiments were also run with mixtures of br 1 mg l and i 1 mg l at cl concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l all mixtures were shaken at a room temperature 25 1 c on an orbit shaker at 150 rpm after certain time intervals samples were collected filtered pre washed 0 45 μm pes filter and kept refrigerated until further measurements 2 3 2 effect of chloride and nom on br and i removal the effects of cl and nom were evaluated in batch mode with an initial br or i concentration of 1 mg l and agcl spac concentration of 25 mg l at ph value of 6 5 0 2 the tested cl concentrations were 0 5 10 50 100 150 200 300 and 400 mg l to cover challenging range of water quality conditions two nom isolates collected from the influent of different drinking water treatment plants in south carolina using reverse osmosis and followed by resin fractionation during a previous study were used song et al 2009 the tested nom solutions had different specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 of 4 9 and 1 7 l mg m and they were used to evaluate the performance of agcl spac under varying nom concentration with doc at 1 2 4 and 8 mg l the composite performance was also tested in four different surface waters and one groundwater with spiked br and i concentrations of 1 and 0 1 mg l respectively it should be highlighted the groundwater was not spiked with br because it was collected from a site with high br level the cl concentrations were adjusted to 50 mg l in all waters to compare the effect of the water source the characteristics of all waters were summarized in table 2 2 4 chlorination and chloramination experiments chlorine and chloramine demand tests were performed under uniform formation conditions ufc to determine the initial chlorine and chloramine concentrations that results in chlorine and chloramine residuals after 24 h of 1 0 mg l and 2 0 mg l as cl2 respectively for chlorination samples were buffered at ph 7 5 and spiked with target pre determined concentrations using sodium hypochlorite stock solution 5 available free chlorine 1 g l chloramination was performed using preformed chloramine at ph 7 5 preformed chloramine stock solution 1 g l as cl2 was prepared by titrating ammonium sulfate stock solution samples were analyzed for residual chlorine and chloramine according to the dpd colorimetric method sm 4500 cl g residual chlorine and chloramine was quenched with a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid 99 obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo and acs grade na2so3 purchased from emd milllipore co billerica ma respectively after quenching samples were extracted and analyzed for thms i thms haas halogenated acetonitrile han and total organic halogen tox i e tocl tobr and toi a detailed description of extraction and analysis of dbps and tox can be found in the supporting information section as well as in our previous publications text s1 in si ersan et al 2019 liu et al 2018 cytotoxicity of the chlorinated and chloraminated water samples was calculated using cytotoxicity index values obtained from the previous literature table s2 in brief the calculations were performed by dividing the molar concentration of each species by the cytotoxicity index values c1 2 given as m obtained from the literature the analytical methods used in this study and their minimum detection limits mdl are listed in the supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 microscopic and spectroscopic characterization of agcl spac micrographs of the spac and agcl spac1 samples are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively that confirm the presence and the attachment of agcl particles on the carbon surface edx analysis indicated that the composite contains c ag and cl fig 1c as shown in fig 2 spac showed xrd diffraction peaks at 26 and 54 2θ that are attributed to the diffractions from the graphite like structure oh et al 2015 however agcl spac showed four diffraction peaks located at 27 8 32 2 46 2 and 57 5 that were assigned to cubic agcl jcpds no 31 1238 and indexed to the 111 200 220 and 222 crystal planes respectively liang et al 2018 these observations were further confirmed using xps fig 2b s2 and table s3 from the xps survey spectrum it was possible to detect the presence of ag 0 4 and cl 0 6 some residuals of si al s zr and n were also detected in the starting spac material and in all samples in the ag 3d spectrum is possible to identify only one doublet ag 3d5 2 at 366 8 ev ag 3d 3 2 at 372 8 ev that is assigned to ag in agcl while formation of a stable silver carbide ag c bond was excluded boukhvalov et al 2018 the c 1s spectra are similar for all the 4 samples and were fitted with 6 different components the peak at 284 6 ev stems from sp 2 sp 3 non functionalized carbon c c c c c h the peak at 286 7 ev originates from c o bond the peak at 288 3 ev from c o bond while the peak at 289 5 ev is attributed to o c o bond peaks at 291 0 ev and 293 4 ev are typical of shake up satellite papirer et al 1994 the cl 2p spectrum shows at least two components the first one is attributed to cl and is characterized by a doublet with a cl 2p3 2 peak located at 197 05 ev while the second doublet at 199 85 ev originates from cl2 strydom et al 1990 the same analysis were also performed on the spent composites after treatment as described in the following sections 3 2 removal efficiency of br and i by adsorption on agcl spac preliminary experiments were run to evaluate the removal of br and i using the three composites i e agcl spac1 agcl spac2 and agcl spac3 as shown in fig s1 all composites exhibited similar removal efficiencies for br and i in the presence and in the absence of spiked cl concentrations at 100 mg l these results indicated that the spac types and characteristics had minimal effect on the composites performance thus all experiments in the subsequent sections were run with only agcl spac1 all samples were measured after treatment using icp aes and no silver leaching was observed 3 2 1 br and i removal kinetics fig 3 depicts the fast removal kinetics of br and i by agcl spac1 with equilibrium times at 150 s and 10 s respectively the applied agcl spac1 dose was only 10 mg l which reflects the superior performance of our composite compared to other previously tested ag based materials for instance rajaeian et al 2018 have recently reported on the kinetics of br removal using silver impregnated activated carbon siac norit ag cabot norit at initial br concentration of 1 6 mg l and siac dose of 800 mg l although they have used adsorbent dose 30 times higher than our tested concentration the equilibrium time using siac was in the range of 120 180 min i e 50 60 times longer than agcl spac in addition sanchez polo et al 2007 developed ag doped carbon aerogels and tested the removal kinetics of br and i 100 μg l at composite dose of 1000 mg l despite the high dose in their study the removal did not reach an equilibrium within their tested experiment time i e 60 70 min similarly the equilibrium time for br removal using silver loaded porous carbon spheres was in the range of 240 720 min gong et al 2013 at the end of the kinetics experiments the composites were collected dried and tested using xrd and xps fig 2 confirms the formation of agbr diffraction peaks at 31and 44 2θ and agi diffraction peaks at 25 33 43 48 and 59 2θ lee et al 2000 zang and farnood 2008 these observations are in line with the xps analysis as summarized in table s3 fig 2b and s2 for agbr spac ag surface concentration is 0 6 and br 0 8 while for agi ag is 1 5 and i is 16 for agbr spac the peak position of ag 3d5 2 is 367 5 ev and br 3d5 2 is 67 7 ev confirming the formation of agbr the presence of agi for agi spac is supported by the ag 3d5 2 peak at 368 0 ev and i 3d5 2 peak at 619 1 ev strydom et al 1991 in this study we also report on the effect of coexisting anions on the halides removal kinetics by agcl spac1 as shown in fig 3 only a slight change in the kinetics of the simultaneous removal of br and i was observed further the effect of two cl concentrations 10 and 100 mg l on the removal kinetics was evaluated the br removal was slower only when cl concentration was elevated to 100 mg l with an observed equilibrium time of 10 15 min meanwhile elevating cl concentration did not affect the removal speed of i using agcl spac1 to the best of our knowledge no similar kinetics data i e under challenging conditions has been reported in the literature for other ag based sorbents 3 2 2 effect of chloride and nom on br and i removal previous studies have indicated high cl concentrations as a limiting factor for br removal chen et al 2017 gan et al 2018 kidd et al 2018 in our study the removal of br and i by agcl spac1 was evaluated under 8 different cl concentrations up to 400 mg l which corresponded to molar ratios of cl br and cl i up to 900 and 1450 respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a agcl spac1 maintained very high i removal efficiency 90 at all tested conditions concurrently the br removal efficiencies were 85 97 at cl concentrations up to 200 mg l when cl concentration was raised to 300 400 mg l the br removal efficiencies decreased to 65 75 recently kidd et al 2018 tested ag impregnated graphene oxide and showed br removal efficiency of 90 under cl br mass ratio up to only 100 the maximum tested cl concentration was 20 mg l besides their material in comparison to agcl spac needed extensive oxidation steps that would reflect on their applicability and environmental impact the higher removal of i than br using agcl spac was attributed to their differences in solubility as the solubility product constants ksp for agbr and agi are 5 35 10 13 and 8 52 10 17 respectively it should be noted that some previous studies suggested that higher levels of cl ions causes the formation of bioavailable agcl2 ions silver 2003 however no silver was detected in our samples at high cl concentration conditions nom is ubiquitous in natural waters and wastewaters with orders of magnitudes higher concentrations than br and i ateia et al 2017a shimizu et al 2018 the effects of nom concentration 2 16 mg nom l and type i e high suva254 and low suva254 on br and i removal by agcl spac1 are shown in fig 4b the removal efficiencies of i were 95 5 at all tested conditions using both nom solutions i e doc 1 8 mg l the br removal was not affected by the elevated concentrations of low suva254 nom however the removal efficiency decreased by 2 4 and 7 when the concentration of high suva254 nom increased to 2 4 and 8 mg doc l the previously tested ag based materials were severely impacted with the presence of nom by two main hypothesized mechanisms 1 high suva254 nom have high molecular size that can cause blockage of the pores and 2 nom is negatively charged and can interact with ag ateia et al 2017b gabelich et al 2002 sanchez polo et al 2007 the main removal mechanism of br and i by agcl spac1 is by ion exchange which is reflected on its selectivity and superior effectiveness compared to previous materials we have further examined the performance of agcl spac1 in four different spiked surface waters and one groundwater table 2 the initial br i mass ratio was 10 in all surface waters and was 20 in the groundwater due to the high br concentration in the source the removal efficiencies of br and i from the groundwater were 94 3 and 91 respectively besides except for lake water impacted with a treated wastewater effluent organic matter efom the removal of br and i from all tested surface waters in this study were in the range of 84 86 and 95 97 respectively fig 5 the efom impacted lake water reduced the br and i removal by 12 and 7 respectively this reduction might be attributed to the presence of other constituents in the treated wastewater the impact of br and i removal from all tested waters on the subsequent dbps formation was further discussed in the following section 3 2 3 the impact of agcl spac on thms haas and han formation and speciation for the tested five water sources the impact of agcl spac1 treatment on the dbp formation and speciation was evaluated under both chlorination and chloramination conditions fig 6 shows the formation and speciation of dbps i e thms haas and hans in the studied waters before and after agcl spac treatment thms formation in lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 46 0 57 2 193 1 137 5 174 6 μg l respectively fig 6a among the studied waters higher total formation of thms were observed in tsw efom and aom sources as compared to lw and gw sources the observed differences in total formations can be explained by the differences in organic matter concentration doc and type suva254 which can alter the formation and speciation of both cl thms and br thms for example whereas both tsw and aom had similar doc concentrations their total thm formations were slightly different tsw had higher suva254 value than aom table 2 which can explain thm formation difference while the gw s doc concentration and suva254 value were less than lw the total thms formations were similar the reason for high formation in gw is the higher initial br concentration table 2 although the tested waters had varying suva254 no difference was observed among bsfthm values table s4 this might be attributed to the relatively high initial bromide concentration br 0 12 5 μm when compared to previous studies liu et al 2018 the speciation of thms in all studied water sources were in the order of tbm dbcm dcbm tcm in raw water samples tbm was the dominant specie among the all thm species which can be attributed to high initial concentration of br in these waters after agcl spac1 treatment tbm concentrations significantly decreased by 82 94 96 79 and 94 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively while the concentration of tbm significantly decreased in the studied waters the formation of tcm and dcbm increased due to shift in speciation from br thm to cl br thms gan et al 2018 the decrease in bsfthm further shows the effectiveness of agcl spac1 treatment on the removal of br thms where 44 47 60 32 49 decrease in bsfthm were observed in lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 6b illustrates haa formation and speciation of raw and treated waters by agcl spac1 total haa formation for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 106 3 15 73 44 3 70 6 88 6 μg l respectively although the initial doc concentrations were similar 2 mg l in tsw and aom the haa formation was 2 times higher in aom than tsw br haas dbaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa were the dominant species among the all detected haa species while 60 of haas species in all studied waters were br haas they decreased significantly after agcl spac1 treatment for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters by 74 5 73 4 50 6 57 9 and 55 0 respectively bsfhaa values were also calculated and the results showed that bsfhaa values decreased 41 8 64 6 59 3 30 0 and 46 2 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 6c shows the formation speciation and removal of hans by agcl spac total han formation ranged from 1 3 to 10 9 μg l while total han formation of lw and gw were below 2 0 μg l tsw efom and aom had similar han formations 4 9 5 2 5 2 μg l respectively the speciation of hans in all studied water sources were in the order of dban bcan dcan can tcan and ban were not detected the observed higher concentration of dban among the all han species attributed to high initial concentration of br in these waters total han removals in tsw efom and aom were 42 5 41 6 45 4 respectively after agcl spac1 treatment speciation of hans shifted from br han dban to cl br hans dcan and bcan which can be linked to reduced concentration of br in the background waters because of very low or no formation of chlorinated hans bsfhan values were higher than 0 9 for all waters removal percentages of dban for lw gw tsw efom and aom were 55 5 99 77 7 55 2 75 1 respectively which also confirms the br selectivity of this spac bsfhan decrease calculated as 26 2 99 53 2 12 7 52 3 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively table s4 fig 7 shows the total formation and removal of organic halides tocl utocl tobr and utobr from the studied water sources after agcl spac treatment total tox formation for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 258 159 439 372 and 430 μg l respectively in fig 7 the known tox consist of measured thms haas and hans and the unknown tox calculated by subtracting known tox from total tox overall in percent wise 49 36 50 49 and 55 of the total tox comprises of known tox in lw gw tsw efom and aom respectively the application of agcl spac treatment was effective in reducing both known and unknown tobr by 58 1 68 4 71 3 54 1 and 63 6 from lw gw tsw efom and aom respectively experiments were also conducted under chloramination conditions to evaluate the impact of agcl spac treatment on i thms removal and results were given in fig 8 total i thm formations for lw gw tsw efom and aom waters were 17 0 32 1 14 0 28 3 and 8 8 μg l respectively among the detected species tim iodoform was the most dominant species fig 8 due to the high initial i concentration of 100 μg l in all source waters the treatment results showed that agcl spac was also very effective to remove i thms from water where total i thm removals in lw gw tsw efom and aom were 96 9 92 5 96 6 91 5 and 99 respectively fig 8 the results indicate that agcl spac1 was effective in removing both brominated and iodinated dbps simultaneously which brings extra benefit when the formation of br i dbps is of concern during water treatment in addition the impact of agcl spac1 treatment on the calculated cytotoxicity of raw and treated samples was investigated based on the measured dbps the total calculated cytotoxicity values for the studied raw waters were in the order of aom tsw efom lw gw fig s3a the results also indicated that hans i e dbps with the highest cytotoxicity index values within the detected dbp classes in this study controlled the calculated cytotoxicity of the samples regardless of their lower formations after agcl spac treatment calculated cytotoxicity values decreased by 23 3 47 1 59 3 27 4 and 59 2 from lw gw tsw efom and aom background respectively similarly under chloramination oxidation the total calculated cytotoxicity values for the studied waters were in the order of efom gw tsw lw aom fig s3b after agcl spac1 treatment calculated cytotoxicity values decreased by 99 8 93 8 99 8 94 1 and 99 from lw gw tsw efom and aom waters respectively 4 conclusions this study explored for the first time the use of agcl spac composite for the removal of br and i from four different surface waters and one groundwater to control the formation of the br dbps and i dbps the proposed synthesis method unlike previously reported studies is simple and environmental friendly as it does not require any acid oxidation steps in addition the resulting composite showed rapid and selective removal for br and i under typical challenging background water conditions i e cl 0 5 400 mg l and nom 1 8 mg doc l a significant decreased in the formation of the subsequent dbps thms haas and hans and the total organic halogens tox was observed after the application of agcl spac1 to all tested waters under ufc conditions in addition similar reduction was shown in the calculated bsf and calculated cytotoxicity of all waters in full scale water treatment plants agcl spac can be used in the same way as regular spac i e the addition to a mixed tank preceding a filter such as an ultrafiltration takaesu et al 2019 thus the continuous and or seasonal integration of such novel composites in water treatment plants can represent an alternative strategy to control the formation of brominated and or iodinated dbps author agreement this is to certify that all authors have
