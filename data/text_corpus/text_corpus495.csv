2475,tracer aided hydrological models tahms are one of the most powerful tools to identify new event and old pre event water fractions contributing to stormflow because they account both for streamflow and tracer mixing dynamics in model calibration nevertheless their representativeness of hydrograph dynamics is often limited due to the unavailability of high resolution conservative tracer data e g water stable isotopes or chloride hence there is a need to identify alternative tracers yielding similar flow partitioning results than ideal ones while requiring fewer financial resources for high frequency monitoring e g sub hourly here we compare flow partitioning results of a tahm calibrated using high frequency electrical conductivity ec and water stable isotope 18o data collected during 37 rainfall runoff events monitored during variable hydrometeorological conditions in the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory a tropical alpine catchment located in southern ecuador when the model was calibrated using the sampling resolution of stables isotopes 6 hours to 1 hour no statistically significant differences of pre event water fractions pewfs using both tracers for model calibration were found pewf differences between both tracers for 89 of the events were 20 regardless of the events antecedent moisture and rainfall conditions model transfer functions were also similar suggesting that catchment internal processes inferred using both tracers are comparable events presenting larger differences n 4 up to 27 pewf difference had no samples collected during peak flow calibration of the model using ec data collected at sub hourly intervals every 5 minutes showed a significant increase in model performance as compared to the frequency of collection of isotopic data similarity in flow partitioning results can be attributed to a quasi conservative nature of ec due to the presence of organic rich riparian soils peat type overlying compact bedrock across the catchment findings also highlight the importance of capturing rapidly occurring catchment mixing processes though high temporal frequency monitoring of tracer data our study encourages the value of assessing the use of alternative tracers such as ec to identify fast occurring rainfall runoff processes while lowering the costs needed to implement and sustain tracer data collection for long time

partitioning can be defined as the separation of precipitation into different water storage components and resulting fluxes in a catchment shope 2016 event hydrograph separation is one of the most common flow partitioning approaches such separations assume that stormflow can be divided in two or more flow components event water entering a hydrological system during a rainstorm event

to be ideal tracers because of their conservative nature when not influenced by evaporative processes klaus and mcdonnell 2013 however high resolution isotopic data remains challenging to obtain and

hydrograph separation studies cano paoli et al 2019 saraiva okello et al 2018 in this paper we used water stable isotope ratios and ec data monitored at high temporal frequency sub daily to sub hourly during 37 rainfall runoff events at the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory a tropical mountain catchment located in southern ecuador to i assess whether the calibration of a tracer aided hydrological model using ec and stable isotopes for events monitored under variable hydrometeorological conditions yield similar hydrograph separation results and ii evaluate how model calibration using ec data collected at sub hourly intervals every 5 minutes influences model performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is a tropical alpine páramo catchment located within the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo on the west slope of the atlantic pacific continental divide in the andes of southern ecuador 3 04 s 79 14 w fig 1 the catchment is 3 28 km2 and varies in elevation between 3 676 and 3 900 m a s l climate is influenced by air masses stemming from the amazon rainforest esquivel hernández et al 2019 presenting a mean annual precipitation of 1 345 mm at 3 780 m a s l rainfall occurs almost daily as drizzle with rain intensities rarely exceeding 5 mm h padrón et al 2015 despite the high elevation of the study site its geographical location at a tropical latitude near the equator precludes the occurrence of snow the catchment presents flashy discharge response to precipitation mosquera et al 2016a mosquera et al 2015 which has been linked to frequent water occurrence of saturated conditions at the thin soils usually 1 m depth as a result of their high water retention capacity and the constant input of low intensity precipitation lazo et al 2019 hydrology in the system is dominated by shallow subsurface flow mosquera et al 2016b monitoring at 3 780 m a s l indicate mean annual temperature of 6 c 90 relative humidity and reference evapotranspiration of 2 mm day córdova et al 2015 two geological formations dominate the study site the quimsacocha and turi formations the quimsacocha presents basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclastics the turi is composed of tuffaceos andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands soils in the zeo are rich in organic matter black humic and acid with high water storage capacity quichimbo et al 2012 they formed from the accumulation of volcanic ash over low gradient slopes and valley bottoms they are identified as andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 covering 74 and 26 of the study area respectively mosquera et al 2015 the depth of the soil ranges between 0 9 m and 2 0 m for the histosols and between 0 2 m and 0 7 m for the andosols with a slightly weathered underlying shallow bedrock above compact bedrock the zeo is mainly composed of two types of vegetation 1 tussock grasses calamagrostis sp covering the andosols and 2 cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile azorella spp overlying the histosols the latter vegetation soil combination was defined as andean wetlands by mosquera et al 2016a the study area is mostly undisturbed with light grazing mainly in the lower part of the catchment mosquera et al 2015 2 2 hydrometric data collection water level and precipitation data were collected during the period october 2017 to june 2019 water level data at the catchment outlet fig 1 were recorded using a v notch weir equipped with an inw aquistar ct2x kirkland wa usa pressure transducer accuracy of 1 75 mm the constant rate salt dilution method moore 2004 was used to calibrate the kindsvater shen equations u s bureau of reclamation 2001 to convert water level data into discharge guallpa et al 2022 precipitation was measured using 4 hobo rg3 m onset computer corporation bourne ma usa rain gauge tipping buckets 0 2 mm resolution distributed across the catchment fig 1 2 3 tracer data collection water samples for oxygen 18 analysis were collected during the same period as hydrometric data i e october 2017 to june 2019 discharge samples were collected at the catchment outlet fig 1 using a pvs4120d autosampler campbell scientific logan ut usa sampling interval varied depending on available logistical resources three sampling intervals were applied as follows from october 2017 to january 2018 sampling interval was every 6 h from january 2018 to march 2019 samples were collected every 4 h and from march 2019 to june 2019 the sampling interval was hourly precipitation samples were collected using a volumetric sequential rainfall sampler fig s1 located near the meteorological station in the upper part of the catchment fig 1 the collector was free from evaporative fractionation as indicated by the oxygen 18 and deuterium relation fig s2 both discharge and precipitation water samples were collected and stored in 2 ml amber glass bottles discharge water samples were filtered in situ using 0 45 µm polypropylene single use syringe membrane filters puradisc 25 pp whatman inc clifton nj usa the bottles were sealed with parafilm and stored away from sunlight to avoid evaporative fractionation effects oxygen 18 isotopic composition was measured using a cavity ring down spectrometer picarro 2130 i precipitation and discharge samples were analyzed in separate runs in order to diminish memory effect in the analysis penna et al 2012 six sample injections were applied and the first three were discarded to further reduce memory effects in order to control the quality of the analysis a set of three isotopic standards were analyzed every 12 samples obtaining strong linear correlations r2 0 99 in addition the standards error 0 1 and the error of the analysis 0 1 both reported by the manufacturer were added 0 2 and if the average error of the three measurements resulting from the standards injections was larger than such value the samples were reanalyzed this procedure was undertaken for each set of standards analyzed the samples were checked for organic contamination using chemcorrect picarro inc santa clara ca usa we used the δ notation for reporting the isotopic composition in per mill using the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 as reference electrical conductivity ec was measured in precipitation and stream water discharge ec values were recorded at the catchment outlet through the same probe used for water level monitoring i e inw ct2x accuracy of 0 5 of the measured ec value ec data were recorded at the same sampling resolution as water level data i e every 5 min and are expressed in μs cm the probe was calibrated prior to installation and every 6 months afterwards to secure high quality of the data water samples to determine precipitation ec were collected using the aforementioned volumetric sequential rainfall sampler ec water samples were collected at the same time water samples for isotope analysis were taken but stored in 50 ml plastic bottles subsequently ec was measured in each water sample using a wtw universal multi parameter handheld profiline multi 3320 xylem analytics germany gmbh weilheim germany equipped with a conductivity measuring cell tetracon 325 xylem analytics germany gmbh weilheim germany with an accuracy of 0 5 of the measured value the calibration of the equipment was performed before every sampling campaign 2 4 rainfall runoff events selection and characterization rainfall runoff events were selected using hydrometric data to analyze event and pre event flow partitioning under variable flow conditions events were defined using the peak over threshold pot method in which the sample is all peak values above a baseline discharge threshold lang et al 1999 the threshold selected was the zeo low flow value corresponding to the q35 non exceedance flow rate mosquera et al 2015 thus runoff response to rainfall starting below q35 with peak values over this threshold were considered as rainfall runoff events additionally a minimum inter event criteria dunkerley 2008 was also used to select events accounting for precipitation dynamic the minimum inter event time to define independent events was 6 h due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall at the zeo padrón et al 2015 analyses were conducted using r version 3 5 1 with the pot package ribatet and dutang 2004 the following variables were estimated to characterize the selected rainfall runoff events peak flow cumulative discharge cumulative precipitation and runoff coefficient these variables allowed evaluation of the flow conditions under which flow partitioning was carried out at the zeo additionally we assessed the streamflow sampling resolution as the ratio of the number of samples collected during each of the events to the event duration in hours this allowed us to evaluate the influence of sampling resolution on flow partitioning results 2 5 tracer aided flow partitioning modelling we used the tracer based streamflow partitioning analysis model traspan mosquera et al 2018 to estimate event and pre event water fractions for each rainfall runoff event traspan is an event based model that uses a combination of the unit hydrograph approach to simulate discharge response to rainfall events and flow response transit time distributions ttds to account for internal catchment mixing processes through tracer mass balance in the following we describe the main features of traspan and the reader is referred to mosquera et al 2018 for a detailed description of the modelling framework traspan is composed of three modules table s1 and fig s3 the first module computes effective rainfall peff as the product of antecedent rainfall index s jakeman and hornberger 1993 and precipitation p equations 1 and 2 in table s1 the second module calculates the fraction of peff routed as event or pre event water module 3 estimates the event qe and pre event qp water fractions through convolution of the ttds convolution results are used in combination with a mass balance approach to estimate the tracer concentration equation 8 in table s1 the sum of qe and qp represents total discharge q modules 2 and 3 allow for the configuration of different structures representing different catchment hydrological behavior module 2 permits setting up the fraction f of peff that is routed as event water to be constant or time variant equation 3 in table s1 module 3 gives the possibility to select between two ttds commonly used to assess the representation of tracer mixing in hydrological models the exponential model em maloszewski and zuber 1996 which represents a single linear reservoir equations 6 and 7 in table s1 and the two parallel linear reservoir model tplr weiler et al 2003 which consists of two connected linear reservoirs equations 9 and 10 in table s1 the combination of the different options of modules 2 and 3 results in four possible model structures structure 1 uses f as constant and the em ttd to estimate event and pre event fractions 7 calibration parameters structure 2 also considers f as constant but uses the tplr ttd for flow partitioning 11 calibration parameters structure 3 assumes f as a time variant function with the em ttd for event and pre event water estimation 8 calibration parameters structure 4 assumes f as a time variant function in combination with the tplr model 12 calibration parameters the equations and calibration parameters for each model structure are presented in table s1 and fig s3 as they are described in detail in mosquera et al 2018 the pre event end member concentration was estimated as the average of the three streamflow samples collected prior to the beginning of the events bonell et al 1990 the event end member concentration was assumed equal to the incremental weighted mean of precipitation samples collected during the events mcdonnell et al 1990 2 6 model evaluation and selection of best model structure we ran the four model structures for each rainfall runoff event using either δ18o and ec for calibration each model structure was run a million times a monte carlo sampling approach was used to produce a set of randomly generated parameter values for each model run beven and freer 2001 the range of values from which the parameter sets were defined was selected according to values commonly found in the published literature e g mosquera et al 2018 segura et al 2012 weiler et al 2003 the same time steps for hydrometric and tracer data were used to allow for a direct comparison of the model calibration results using δ18o and ec hydrometric data precipitation and discharge at 5 min intervals were used considering the different sampling resolution of isotopic 6 h 4 h and hourly section 2 3 and ec every 5 min data only ec data collected at the same time than δ18o data were used for comparing flow partitioning results ec and δ18o data in precipitation were volume weighted to aggregate them to the same frequency tracer data in streamflow where available the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 metric was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulations to the hydrometric and tracer observations for comparison among the four model structures we used the average of the discharge and tracer kge values mosquera et al 2018 the akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 metric was calculated to evaluate the parsimoniousness of each of the model structures to account for their different number of calibration parameters the discharge and tracer aic values were added into a single one to compare the different model structures mosquera et al 2018 the model structure presenting the highest kge and lowest aic values was considered as the best representation best model structure of the hydrological behavior of the catchment for each rainfall runoff event uncertainty of the results was obtained using a threshold of behavioral solutions this threshold included sets of parameters yielding kges above 0 5 except when the best kge for the event was 0 5 for which the threshold was set in kges above 0 3 we obtained 5000 behavioral sets for all analyzed events the kge and aic metrics were used to compare whether the best model structures calibrated using δ18o and ec yielded similar flow partitioning results to this end we assessed the difference between the pre event water fractions estimated for the best model structure using δ18o and ec separately for calibration if such difference was lower than 20 the results were considered as similar laudon and slaymaker 1997 uncertainty in the modelling results was considered in the comparison by calculating the difference of pre event water fractions of the 5 and 95 confidence limits from the parameter sets within the range of behavioral solutions furthermore statistical significance of the differences between the pre event water fractions estimated using δ18o and ec was evaluated using the sign sprent 2011 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 to a significance level of 0 05 α 0 05 and the statistical power of these tests representing the probability that they correctly rejected the null hypothesis was also assessed the effect size for the statistical power analysis was obtained using the formula r z n following the guidelines proposed by tomczak and tomczak 2014 where z equals the z value n is the number of paired samples and r refers to the effect size we visually inspected the ttds produced by the best model structure calibrated for each tracer during each rainfall runoff event to evaluate if the modelling results yielded a similar representation of the catchments transport and mixing processes for different flow conditions 2 7 influence of temporal data collection frequency on flow partitioning taking advantage of the high temporal frequency at which ec data were collected we tested the influence of sampling frequency on flow partitioning results to this end the simulations were carried out using the original temporal resolution at which ec and discharge data were collected during each rainfall runoff event i e every 5 min precipitation data were also aggregated to the same time frequency we compared the results obtained with high frequency data 5 min against those resulting when the model was run using ec data at the same frequency δ18o data were available 6 h to hourly the kge metric was used to evaluate whether the use of high frequency data influences the goodness of fit of the model results 3 results 3 1 rainstorm events characterization thirty seven rainfall runoff events were monitored during the study period over a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions peak flow varied from 0 02 to 2 1 mm h table 1 fig 2 events were ordered and labeled in ascending order according to their position over this curve events lasted between 10 and 104 h table 1 events lasting 70 h mainly produced low peak flows events 1 4 except for event 21 70 h that yielded a moderate peak flow 0 3 mm h the duration of the rest of the events was 52 h 2 17 days cumulative precipitation during the events ranged between 2 9 and 26 2 mm with cumulative discharge values varying between 0 6 and 22 7 mm table 1 the variation of the runoff coefficient of the events was large and ranged between 0 05 event 1 and 0 92 event 20 most likely as a result of the varying rainfall runoff response and antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment 3 2 selection of best model structure the four evaluated model structures for all events calibrated using δ18o yielded kge values varying between 0 23 and 0 94 structure 1 0 07 and 0 86 structure 2 0 20 and 0 89 structure 3 and 0 28 and 0 90 structure 4 fig 3 a this except for event 18 using model structure 3 for which no set of parameters produced kge values 0 although we found no specific event features e g peak flow cumulative discharge and rainfall antecedent precipitation explaining this observation event 23 presented the highest kge for all model structures whereas event 5 had the lowest kge for structures 1 3 and 4 and event 33 produced the lowest kge for structure 2 about 80 of the events n 29 had kges 0 5 and model structures 1 and 4 had the largest number of events with kge 0 5 fig 3a most kge differences between model structures 1 and 4 were smaller than 0 06 the lowest aic values corresponded to structures 2 and 4 fig 3b overall the combined evaluation of the kge and aic metrics showed that model structure 4 consistently yielded the highest kge values i e 0 6 and lowest aic values for most events we also obtained good results i e kge 0 5 for most events when using ec for calibration similar to δ18o calibration only event 18 could not be calibrated using model structure 3 kge 0 kge values varied between 0 19 and 0 82 structure 1 0 3 and 0 81 structure 2 0 36 and 0 81 structure 3 and 0 45 and 0 85 structure 4 fig 3c all structures presented kge values higher than 0 5 except for events 6 0 47 12 0 42 and 16 0 19 with structure 1 events 3 5 6 12 14 15 and 16 for structure 2 with kge 0 16 0 48 events 12 0 36 and 16 0 42 with structure 3 and event 6 0 45 12 0 45 and 16 0 46 for structure 4 model structure 4 had the highest kge values for 22 of the 37 events and was very close to the highest kge values for the rest of the events with differences usually smaller than 0 05 compared with the structures producing the highest kges fig 3c as with δ18o aic values indicated that structures 2 and 4 presented the lowest aic values fig 3d these results indicate that model structure 4 is the one that best represents the rainfall runoff dynamics of the catchment using ec for model calibration 3 3 flow partitioning modelling results pre event water fractions pewfs estimated using the model structure best representing the hydrological system with each tracers δ18o or ec for model calibration i e model structure 4 are presented in fig 4 the figure shows the pewfs that yielded the highest kge values and their associated uncertainties in general a dominance of pewf 50 of total stormflow was observed for the simulations producing the highest kges regardless of the tracer used for model calibration for δ18o calibration pewfs ranged from 40 9 to 98 8 and only two events presented pewfs 50 events 2 and 34 when the model was calibrated using ec pewfs varied between 22 4 and 96 7 and only one event had a pewf lower than 50 event 2 the median of the simulation uncertainties i e 5 95 confidence intervals obtained using δ18o for calibration of structure 4 was 18 5 and ranged from 6 2 to 31 5 the median of the uncertainties for the same model structure calibrated using ec was 23 2 and varied between 9 2 and 45 2 it is worth highlighting that model structure 4 yielded the lowest pewf uncertainties for all events using δ18o and ec fig s4 these results further support the selection of structure 4 as the one best representing the studied hydrological system a dominance of pewf in 70 of the event hydrographs was observed fig 4 3 4 comparison of flow partitioning modelling using δ18o and ec differences in pewfs estimated using δ18o and ec i e δ18o pewf ec pewf ranged from 17 45 to 27 26 for model structure 4 fig 5 thirty three out of the 37 monitored events presented differences smaller than 20 and 18 had differences lower than 10 all events producing low peak flows yielded similar pewf estimates regardless of the number of samples available during peak flow production i e above 85 of the events peak flow value and their sampling resolution value fig 5 the events showing differences 20 had the commonality that no samples were collected during peak flow production and they had sampling resolution values lower than 0 25 pewfs calculated using δ18o and ec were similar as depicted by the overlap of their associated uncertainties for most of the events except for events 22 and 36 the sign and wilcoxon statistical tests showed no significant differences between the results obtained using δ18o and ec for structure 4 p value 0 05 0 19 for sign and 0 07 for the wilcoxon table 2 with a 96 probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis represented by the statistical power table 2 although differences between pewf estimations using structure 4 were the smallest among all evaluated models fig s5 results showed that ec gave similar pewf estimations than δ18o regardless of the evaluated model structure a remarkable similarity between the ttds of event and pre event water fractions using δ18o and ec for model calibration was also observed fig 6 3 5 effect of high frequency data in flow partitioning modelling in order to assess how increasing the tracer temporal sampling resolution influences the goodness of fit of the model simulation results we used the original ec sampling resolution i e every 5 minutes to estimate pewfs for the 37 rainfall runoff events using the best model structure of the system i e structure 4 all of the events presented a considerable increase in their kge values which varied between 0 54 event 9 and 0 92 event 16 fig 7 this represented an average kge increase of 14 among all events in relation to the kges yielded when the simulations were carried out using the original δ18o sampling resolution used to compare the pewfs estimated using δ18o and ec i e 1 to 6 h uncertainty in the results showed an average decrease of 5 for all the events with event 33 having the highest decrease 8 and event 16 presenting the lowest reduction 2 4 discussion 4 1 selection of the best model structure and process based conceptualization using two tracers for model calibration δ18o and ec traspan allowed evaluation of four model structures representing different catchment hydrological behavior competing hypothesis pfister and kirchner 2017 for 37 rainfall runoff events monitored for a wide range of climatological and flow conditions to obtain the best representation of the investigated hydrological system goodness of fit kge analysis indicated that model structure 4 provided the best representation of the studied páramo catchment for 64 of all events regardless of the tracer used for model calibration fig 3 these results were confirmed by the parsimony analysis which showed that model structure 4 presented the lowest aic values despite it had the largest number of calibration parameters of all the evaluated structures this finding reassures that the selection of this model structure was not affected by overparameterization issues forster 2000 the selection of this model structure is supported by the conceptualization of rainfall runoff processes at the study catchment model structure 4 involves a variable fraction of effective precipitation routed as event water and 2 reservoirs with different travel times fast and slow where water mixes and is further released as streamflow the time variable fraction of event water likely accounts for two processes first interception losses from tussock grasses covering 74 of the catchment tussock grass water storage capacity 2 mm ochoa sánchez et al 2018 as precipitation intensity during the monitored events rarely exceeded 0 5 mm hr table 1 second the recharge of the available water storage in the riparian wetlands histosol soils at the beginning of the events lazo et al 2019 the water reservoir with fast transfer time reflects a combination of direct channel precipitation e g penna et al 2015 and water that flows in the first few centimeters of the paramo soils in the riparian wetlands which remain near saturation conditions year round mosquera et al 2015 that is with little to no contact time with the subsurface delsman et al 2013 these water flow paths on average account for 15 using δ18o and 22 using ec of storm runoff according to our tracer based hydrograph separation estimations they constitute the new water end member of the system during stormflow generation correa et al 2019 the reservoir with slow travel time represents the mobilization of water from deeper horizons of hillslope and wetland soils and small contribution from shallow groundwater in the rather compact bedrock correa et al 2017 crespo et al 2011 lazo et al 2019 it represents the old water end member dominating the stormflow hydrograph on average 85 with δ18o and 78 with ec the dominance of the pewfs during rainfall events fig 4 is in line with that reported based on weekly to biweekly data collected in the period 2011 2014 in the study area pewfs 75 correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a the prevalence of pre event water is also in agreement with the concept that runoff generation is mainly controlled by water stored in catchments prior to rainfall events klaus and mcdonnell 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 overall the selection of model structure 4 as the best representation of the catchment s hydrological behavior during rainfall runoff events is supported by the statistical analysis and the mechanistic understanding of runoff generation at the study site 4 2 comparison of flow partitioning modelling using stable isotopic and ec data under variable flow conditions the comparison of pewfs estimated using model structure 4 showed that δ18o and ec yielded similar flow partitioning results for most of the events fig 5 such similarity of flow partitioning results between both tracers has also been reported in a variety of catchments worldwide vidon and cuadra 2010 found differences between 5 and 15 at a tile drained field site in the usa laudon and slaymaker 1997 obtained differences of about 20 in alpine catchments in british columbia cano paoli et al 2019 analyzed hydrograph separation at a headwater alpine catchment in italy where the differences between estimations yielded by the two tracers were about 10 camacho suarez et al 2015 reported no major differences 9 in a sub tropical semi arid environment meriano et al 2011 also found small differences 8 at an urban glaciated catchment in canada it is worth noting that the aforementioned investigations were conducted using a rather limited number of monitored events normally 10 this limitation reduced the capacity to statistically evaluate the significance of the reported similarities as well as potential differences in results over a wide range of climatological and flow conditions the unique dataset presented in this study permitted to statistically support our findings table 2 which in general did not depend on such hydroclimatological variability it is well known that ec can behave as a non conservative tracer under certain conditions hayashi et al 2012 laudon and slaymaker 1997 pellerin et al 2008 in other tropical catchments in panama this non conservative behavior has been attributed to large intensity precipitation events as a result of pre event water contributions becoming more dilute across the course of rainstorms litt et al 2015 another reason for discrepancies among flow components estimated using stable isotopes and ec could arise from spatial variability in the activation of different water flow paths contributing to discharge hoeg et al 2000 our findings indicate that these sources of discrepancy are overcome at our study site as a result of the presence of riparian wetlands presenting high porosity and available water storage capacity for tracer mixing lazo et al 2019 in combination with low contributions of water from deeper groundwater flow paths correa et al 2019 2017 mosquera et al 2016a these conditions likely reduce the spatial variability of ec across the catchment before reaching the stream mosquera et al 2016b these findings are further supported by the remarkably similar process based understanding yielded by the model simulations regardless of the tracer used for calibration and flow conditions from low to high as evidenced by the strong similarity between the system s ttds fig 6 altogether these findings point to a quasi conservative behavior of ec at the study area making it suitable for monitoring rainfall runoff processes at high temporal frequency 4 3 increase in model performance using high resolution ec data the lack of samples collected during peak flow in combination with a low sampling resolution ratio of samples collected during an event to its duration in hours caused discrepancies for the four events which presented pewf differences 20 between δ18o and ec fig 5 particularly for long duration events 90 h our findings indicate that sampling resolution and the number of samples collected during high flows should increase to avoid missing critical information during peak flow production von freyberg et al 2017 highlighting the importance of and need for high resolution monitoring during rainfall runoff events one of the main advantages of finding a tracer that can be monitored at high temporal frequency while satisfying the assumptions of the two component hydrograph separation is that it provides the opportunity to identify the variability of fast occurring rainfall runoff processes ec is an ideal alternative tracer considering its ease of in stream measurement at fine temporal resolution sub hourly and lower operational monitoring cost compared to δ18o cano paoli et al 2019 in this context our results clearly showed that when 5 minute ec data were used for model calibration the goodness of fit of the hydrograph and tracer data increased significantly for all monitored events that is kge values increased an average of 0 16 in relation those obtained when using data collected at 1 to 6 h intervals fig 7 these findings highlight the value of monitoring tracer data at high temporal frequency floury et al 2017 pesántez et al 2021 von freyberg et al 2017 so that the temporal variability of water transport and mixing processes can be better identified mosquera et al 2018 stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 addressing this issue is especially important in environments with fast hydrological response where peak flows often occur in time periods less than an hour e g sahraei et al 2020 so that the lack of high frequency data can result in a significant loss of information kirchner et al 2004 according to our findings high frequency ec data can help overcome this issue in catchments with similar characteristics to ours while providing robust flow partitioning results as evidenced by the comparative analysis between ec and stable isotopes presented above 5 conclusions our study showed that ec yielded similar results than δ18o at event and pre event hydrograph separation with a tracer aided hydrological model covering a wide range of flow conditions low to high peak flows not only in amount of water but also at catchment internal processes representation as shown by the similarity of the ttds when calibrating the model structures these similarities could be attributed to some specific catchment characteristics such as high water storage capacity due to the high water retention capacity of the porous soils which allows for an efficient mixing of the water in the system combined with low groundwater contributions that reduce the spatial variability of ec resulting in a quasi conservative behavior from this tracer this behavior opens the possibility to use ec as an alternative tracer instead of stable isotopes δ18o in hydrograph separation studies increasing the sampling resolution which will make it possible to have a quasi continuous measurement of tracer data this will help to increase the number of samples available for hydrograph separation analyses increasing the performance of models resulting in an accurate representation of catchment hydrological behavior even at peak flow where information is often missing this in turn could help to reveal fast occurring rainfall runoff processes in addition ec could lower the resources needed to maintain high frequency monitoring networks as it is easier to measure allowing a sustained acquisition of data in the long term which is often unachievable with other tracers i e stable isotopes especially in remote places were logistics are very difficult and financial support is scarce credit authorship contribution

2475,tracer aided hydrological models tahms are one of the most powerful tools to identify new event and old pre event water fractions contributing to stormflow because they account both for streamflow and tracer mixing dynamics in model calibration nevertheless their representativeness of hydrograph dynamics is often limited due to the unavailability of high resolution conservative tracer data e g water stable isotopes or chloride hence there is a need to identify alternative tracers yielding similar flow partitioning results than ideal ones while requiring fewer financial resources for high frequency monitoring e g sub hourly here we compare flow partitioning results of a tahm calibrated using high frequency electrical conductivity ec and water stable isotope 18o data collected during 37 rainfall runoff events monitored during variable hydrometeorological conditions in the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory a tropical alpine catchment located in southern ecuador when the model was calibrated using the sampling resolution of stables isotopes 6 hours to 1 hour no statistically significant differences of pre event water fractions pewfs using both tracers for model calibration were found pewf differences between both tracers for 89 of the events were 20 regardless of the events antecedent moisture and rainfall conditions model transfer functions were also similar suggesting that catchment internal processes inferred using both tracers are comparable events presenting larger differences n 4 up to 27 pewf difference had no samples collected during peak flow calibration of the model using ec data collected at sub hourly intervals every 5 minutes showed a significant increase in model performance as compared to the frequency of collection of isotopic data similarity in flow partitioning results can be attributed to a quasi conservative nature of ec due to the presence of organic rich riparian soils peat type overlying compact bedrock across the catchment findings also highlight the importance of capturing rapidly occurring catchment mixing processes though high temporal frequency monitoring of tracer data our study encourages the value of assessing the use of alternative tracers such as ec to identify fast occurring rainfall runoff processes while lowering the costs needed to implement and sustain tracer data collection for long time

hydrograph separation studies cano paoli et al 2019 saraiva okello et al 2018 in this paper we used water stable isotope ratios and ec data monitored at high temporal frequency sub daily to sub hourly during 37 rainfall runoff events at the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory a tropical mountain catchment located in southern ecuador to i assess whether the calibration of a tracer aided hydrological model using ec and stable isotopes for events monitored under variable hydrometeorological conditions yield similar hydrograph separation results and ii evaluate how model calibration using ec data collected at sub hourly intervals every 5 minutes influences model performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is a tropical alpine páramo catchment located within the zhurucay ecohydrological observatory zeo on the west slope of the atlantic pacific continental divide in the andes of southern ecuador 3 04 s 79 14 w fig 1 the catchment is 3 28 km2 and varies in elevation between 3 676 and 3 900 m a s l climate is influenced by air masses stemming from the amazon rainforest esquivel hernández et al 2019 presenting a mean annual precipitation of 1 345 mm at 3 780 m a s l rainfall occurs almost daily as drizzle with rain intensities rarely exceeding 5 mm h padrón et al 2015 despite the high elevation of the study site its geographical location at a tropical latitude near the equator precludes the occurrence of snow the catchment presents flashy discharge response to precipitation mosquera et al 2016a mosquera et al 2015 which has been linked to frequent water occurrence of saturated conditions at the thin soils usually 1 m depth as a result of their high water retention capacity and the constant input of low intensity precipitation lazo et al 2019 hydrology in the system is dominated by shallow subsurface flow mosquera et al 2016b monitoring at 3 780 m a s l indicate mean annual temperature of 6 c 90 relative humidity and reference evapotranspiration of 2 mm day córdova et al 2015 two geological formations dominate the study site the quimsacocha and turi formations the quimsacocha presents basaltic flows with plagioclases feldspars and andesitic pyroclastics the turi is composed of tuffaceos andesitic breccias conglomerates and horizontal stratified sands soils in the zeo are rich in organic matter black humic and acid with high water storage capacity quichimbo et al 2012 they formed from the accumulation of volcanic ash over low gradient slopes and valley bottoms they are identified as andosols and histosols iuss working group wrb 2015 covering 74 and 26 of the study area respectively mosquera et al 2015 the depth of the soil ranges between 0 9 m and 2 0 m for the histosols and between 0 2 m and 0 7 m for the andosols with a slightly weathered underlying shallow bedrock above compact bedrock the zeo is mainly composed of two types of vegetation 1 tussock grasses calamagrostis sp covering the andosols and 2 cushion plants plantago rigida xenophyllum humile azorella spp overlying the histosols the latter vegetation soil combination was defined as andean wetlands by mosquera et al 2016a the study area is mostly undisturbed with light grazing mainly in the lower part of the catchment mosquera et al 2015 2 2 hydrometric data collection water level and precipitation data were collected during the period october 2017 to june 2019 water level data at the catchment outlet fig 1 were recorded using a v notch weir equipped with an inw aquistar ct2x kirkland wa usa pressure transducer accuracy of 1 75 mm the constant rate salt dilution method moore 2004 was used to calibrate the kindsvater shen equations u s bureau of reclamation 2001 to convert water level data into discharge guallpa et al 2022 precipitation was measured using 4 hobo rg3 m onset computer corporation bourne ma usa rain gauge tipping buckets 0 2 mm resolution distributed across the catchment fig 1 2 3 tracer data collection water samples for oxygen 18 analysis were collected during the same period as hydrometric data i e october 2017 to june 2019 discharge samples were collected at the catchment outlet fig 1 using a pvs4120d autosampler campbell scientific logan ut usa sampling interval varied depending on available logistical resources three sampling intervals were applied as follows from october 2017 to january 2018 sampling interval was every 6 h from january 2018 to march 2019 samples were collected every 4 h and from march 2019 to june 2019 the sampling interval was hourly precipitation samples were collected using a volumetric sequential rainfall sampler fig s1 located near the meteorological station in the upper part of the catchment fig 1 the collector was free from evaporative fractionation as indicated by the oxygen 18 and deuterium relation fig s2 both discharge and precipitation water samples were collected and stored in 2 ml amber glass bottles discharge water samples were filtered in situ using 0 45 µm polypropylene single use syringe membrane filters puradisc 25 pp whatman inc clifton nj usa the bottles were sealed with parafilm and stored away from sunlight to avoid evaporative fractionation effects oxygen 18 isotopic composition was measured using a cavity ring down spectrometer picarro 2130 i precipitation and discharge samples were analyzed in separate runs in order to diminish memory effect in the analysis penna et al 2012 six sample injections were applied and the first three were discarded to further reduce memory effects in order to control the quality of the analysis a set of three isotopic standards were analyzed every 12 samples obtaining strong linear correlations r2 0 99 in addition the standards error 0 1 and the error of the analysis 0 1 both reported by the manufacturer were added 0 2 and if the average error of the three measurements resulting from the standards injections was larger than such value the samples were reanalyzed this procedure was undertaken for each set of standards analyzed the samples were checked for organic contamination using chemcorrect picarro inc santa clara ca usa we used the δ notation for reporting the isotopic composition in per mill using the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow craig 1961 as reference electrical conductivity ec was measured in precipitation and stream water discharge ec values were recorded at the catchment outlet through the same probe used for water level monitoring i e inw ct2x accuracy of 0 5 of the measured ec value ec data were recorded at the same sampling resolution as water level data i e every 5 min and are expressed in μs cm the probe was calibrated prior to installation and every 6 months afterwards to secure high quality of the data water samples to determine precipitation ec were collected using the aforementioned volumetric sequential rainfall sampler ec water samples were collected at the same time water samples for isotope analysis were taken but stored in 50 ml plastic bottles subsequently ec was measured in each water sample using a wtw universal multi parameter handheld profiline multi 3320 xylem analytics germany gmbh weilheim germany equipped with a conductivity measuring cell tetracon 325 xylem analytics germany gmbh weilheim germany with an accuracy of 0 5 of the measured value the calibration of the equipment was performed before every sampling campaign 2 4 rainfall runoff events selection and characterization rainfall runoff events were selected using hydrometric data to analyze event and pre event flow partitioning under variable flow conditions events were defined using the peak over threshold pot method in which the sample is all peak values above a baseline discharge threshold lang et al 1999 the threshold selected was the zeo low flow value corresponding to the q35 non exceedance flow rate mosquera et al 2015 thus runoff response to rainfall starting below q35 with peak values over this threshold were considered as rainfall runoff events additionally a minimum inter event criteria dunkerley 2008 was also used to select events accounting for precipitation dynamic the minimum inter event time to define independent events was 6 h due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall at the zeo padrón et al 2015 analyses were conducted using r version 3 5 1 with the pot package ribatet and dutang 2004 the following variables were estimated to characterize the selected rainfall runoff events peak flow cumulative discharge cumulative precipitation and runoff coefficient these variables allowed evaluation of the flow conditions under which flow partitioning was carried out at the zeo additionally we assessed the streamflow sampling resolution as the ratio of the number of samples collected during each of the events to the event duration in hours this allowed us to evaluate the influence of sampling resolution on flow partitioning results 2 5 tracer aided flow partitioning modelling we used the tracer based streamflow partitioning analysis model traspan mosquera et al 2018 to estimate event and pre event water fractions for each rainfall runoff event traspan is an event based model that uses a combination of the unit hydrograph approach to simulate discharge response to rainfall events and flow response transit time distributions ttds to account for internal catchment mixing processes through tracer mass balance in the following we describe the main features of traspan and the reader is referred to mosquera et al 2018 for a detailed description of the modelling framework traspan is composed of three modules table s1 and fig s3 the first module computes effective rainfall peff as the product of antecedent rainfall index s jakeman and hornberger 1993 and precipitation p equations 1 and 2 in table s1 the second module calculates the fraction of peff routed as event or pre event water module 3 estimates the event qe and pre event qp water fractions through convolution of the ttds convolution results are used in combination with a mass balance approach to estimate the tracer concentration equation 8 in table s1 the sum of qe and qp represents total discharge q modules 2 and 3 allow for the configuration of different structures representing different catchment hydrological behavior module 2 permits setting up the fraction f of peff that is routed as event water to be constant or time variant equation 3 in table s1 module 3 gives the possibility to select between two ttds commonly used to assess the representation of tracer mixing in hydrological models the exponential model em maloszewski and zuber 1996 which represents a single linear reservoir equations 6 and 7 in table s1 and the two parallel linear reservoir model tplr weiler et al 2003 which consists of two connected linear reservoirs equations 9 and 10 in table s1 the combination of the different options of modules 2 and 3 results in four possible model structures structure 1 uses f as constant and the em ttd to estimate event and pre event fractions 7 calibration parameters structure 2 also considers f as constant but uses the tplr ttd for flow partitioning 11 calibration parameters structure 3 assumes f as a time variant function with the em ttd for event and pre event water estimation 8 calibration parameters structure 4 assumes f as a time variant function in combination with the tplr model 12 calibration parameters the equations and calibration parameters for each model structure are presented in table s1 and fig s3 as they are described in detail in mosquera et al 2018 the pre event end member concentration was estimated as the average of the three streamflow samples collected prior to the beginning of the events bonell et al 1990 the event end member concentration was assumed equal to the incremental weighted mean of precipitation samples collected during the events mcdonnell et al 1990 2 6 model evaluation and selection of best model structure we ran the four model structures for each rainfall runoff event using either δ18o and ec for calibration each model structure was run a million times a monte carlo sampling approach was used to produce a set of randomly generated parameter values for each model run beven and freer 2001 the range of values from which the parameter sets were defined was selected according to values commonly found in the published literature e g mosquera et al 2018 segura et al 2012 weiler et al 2003 the same time steps for hydrometric and tracer data were used to allow for a direct comparison of the model calibration results using δ18o and ec hydrometric data precipitation and discharge at 5 min intervals were used considering the different sampling resolution of isotopic 6 h 4 h and hourly section 2 3 and ec every 5 min data only ec data collected at the same time than δ18o data were used for comparing flow partitioning results ec and δ18o data in precipitation were volume weighted to aggregate them to the same frequency tracer data in streamflow where available the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 metric was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulations to the hydrometric and tracer observations for comparison among the four model structures we used the average of the discharge and tracer kge values mosquera et al 2018 the akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 metric was calculated to evaluate the parsimoniousness of each of the model structures to account for their different number of calibration parameters the discharge and tracer aic values were added into a single one to compare the different model structures mosquera et al 2018 the model structure presenting the highest kge and lowest aic values was considered as the best representation best model structure of the hydrological behavior of the catchment for each rainfall runoff event uncertainty of the results was obtained using a threshold of behavioral solutions this threshold included sets of parameters yielding kges above 0 5 except when the best kge for the event was 0 5 for which the threshold was set in kges above 0 3 we obtained 5000 behavioral sets for all analyzed events the kge and aic metrics were used to compare whether the best model structures calibrated using δ18o and ec yielded similar flow partitioning results to this end we assessed the difference between the pre event water fractions estimated for the best model structure using δ18o and ec separately for calibration if such difference was lower than 20 the results were considered as similar laudon and slaymaker 1997 uncertainty in the modelling results was considered in the comparison by calculating the difference of pre event water fractions of the 5 and 95 confidence limits from the parameter sets within the range of behavioral solutions furthermore statistical significance of the differences between the pre event water fractions estimated using δ18o and ec was evaluated using the sign sprent 2011 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 to a significance level of 0 05 α 0 05 and the statistical power of these tests representing the probability that they correctly rejected the null hypothesis was also assessed the effect size for the statistical power analysis was obtained using the formula r z n following the guidelines proposed by tomczak and tomczak 2014 where z equals the z value n is the number of paired samples and r refers to the effect size we visually inspected the ttds produced by the best model structure calibrated for each tracer during each rainfall runoff event to evaluate if the modelling results yielded a similar representation of the catchments transport and mixing processes for different flow conditions 2 7 influence of temporal data collection frequency on flow partitioning taking advantage of the high temporal frequency at which ec data were collected we tested the influence of sampling frequency on flow partitioning results to this end the simulations were carried out using the original temporal resolution at which ec and discharge data were collected during each rainfall runoff event i e every 5 min precipitation data were also aggregated to the same time frequency we compared the results obtained with high frequency data 5 min against those resulting when the model was run using ec data at the same frequency δ18o data were available 6 h to hourly the kge metric was used to evaluate whether the use of high frequency data influences the goodness of fit of the model results 3 results 3 1 rainstorm events characterization thirty seven rainfall runoff events were monitored during the study period over a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions peak flow varied from 0 02 to 2 1 mm h table 1 fig 2 events were ordered and labeled in ascending order according to their position over this curve events lasted between 10 and 104 h table 1 events lasting 70 h mainly produced low peak flows events 1 4 except for event 21 70 h that yielded a moderate peak flow 0 3 mm h the duration of the rest of the events was 52 h 2 17 days cumulative precipitation during the events ranged between 2 9 and 26 2 mm with cumulative discharge values varying between 0 6 and 22 7 mm table 1 the variation of the runoff coefficient of the events was large and ranged between 0 05 event 1 and 0 92 event 20 most likely as a result of the varying rainfall runoff response and antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment 3 2 selection of best model structure the four evaluated model structures for all events calibrated using δ18o yielded kge values varying between 0 23 and 0 94 structure 1 0 07 and 0 86 structure 2 0 20 and 0 89 structure 3 and 0 28 and 0 90 structure 4 fig 3 a this except for event 18 using model structure 3 for which no set of parameters produced kge values 0 although we found no specific event features e g peak flow cumulative discharge and rainfall antecedent precipitation explaining this observation event 23 presented the highest kge for all model structures whereas event 5 had the lowest kge for structures 1 3 and 4 and event 33 produced the lowest kge for structure 2 about 80 of the events n 29 had kges 0 5 and model structures 1 and 4 had the largest number of events with kge 0 5 fig 3a most kge differences between model structures 1 and 4 were smaller than 0 06 the lowest aic values corresponded to structures 2 and 4 fig 3b overall the combined evaluation of the kge and aic metrics showed that model structure 4 consistently yielded the highest kge values i e 0 6 and lowest aic values for most events we also obtained good results i e kge 0 5 for most events when using ec for calibration similar to δ18o calibration only event 18 could not be calibrated using model structure 3 kge 0 kge values varied between 0 19 and 0 82 structure 1 0 3 and 0 81 structure 2 0 36 and 0 81 structure 3 and 0 45 and 0 85 structure 4 fig 3c all structures presented kge values higher than 0 5 except for events 6 0 47 12 0 42 and 16 0 19 with structure 1 events 3 5 6 12 14 15 and 16 for structure 2 with kge 0 16 0 48 events 12 0 36 and 16 0 42 with structure 3 and event 6 0 45 12 0 45 and 16 0 46 for structure 4 model structure 4 had the highest kge values for 22 of the 37 events and was very close to the highest kge values for the rest of the events with differences usually smaller than 0 05 compared with the structures producing the highest kges fig 3c as with δ18o aic values indicated that structures 2 and 4 presented the lowest aic values fig 3d these results indicate that model structure 4 is the one that best represents the rainfall runoff dynamics of the catchment using ec for model calibration 3 3 flow partitioning modelling results pre event water fractions pewfs estimated using the model structure best representing the hydrological system with each tracers δ18o or ec for model calibration i e model structure 4 are presented in fig 4 the figure shows the pewfs that yielded the highest kge values and their associated uncertainties in general a dominance of pewf 50 of total stormflow was observed for the simulations producing the highest kges regardless of the tracer used for model calibration for δ18o calibration pewfs ranged from 40 9 to 98 8 and only two events presented pewfs 50 events 2 and 34 when the model was calibrated using ec pewfs varied between 22 4 and 96 7 and only one event had a pewf lower than 50 event 2 the median of the simulation uncertainties i e 5 95 confidence intervals obtained using δ18o for calibration of structure 4 was 18 5 and ranged from 6 2 to 31 5 the median of the uncertainties for the same model structure calibrated using ec was 23 2 and varied between 9 2 and 45 2 it is worth highlighting that model structure 4 yielded the lowest pewf uncertainties for all events using δ18o and ec fig s4 these results further support the selection of structure 4 as the one best representing the studied hydrological system a dominance of pewf in 70 of the event hydrographs was observed fig 4 3 4 comparison of flow partitioning modelling using δ18o and ec differences in pewfs estimated using δ18o and ec i e δ18o pewf ec pewf ranged from 17 45 to 27 26 for model structure 4 fig 5 thirty three out of the 37 monitored events presented differences smaller than 20 and 18 had differences lower than 10 all events producing low peak flows yielded similar pewf estimates regardless of the number of samples available during peak flow production i e above 85 of the events peak flow value and their sampling resolution value fig 5 the events showing differences 20 had the commonality that no samples were collected during peak flow production and they had sampling resolution values lower than 0 25 pewfs calculated using δ18o and ec were similar as depicted by the overlap of their associated uncertainties for most of the events except for events 22 and 36 the sign and wilcoxon statistical tests showed no significant differences between the results obtained using δ18o and ec for structure 4 p value 0 05 0 19 for sign and 0 07 for the wilcoxon table 2 with a 96 probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis represented by the statistical power table 2 although differences between pewf estimations using structure 4 were the smallest among all evaluated models fig s5 results showed that ec gave similar pewf estimations than δ18o regardless of the evaluated model structure a remarkable similarity between the ttds of event and pre event water fractions using δ18o and ec for model calibration was also observed fig 6 3 5 effect of high frequency data in flow partitioning modelling in order to assess how increasing the tracer temporal sampling resolution influences the goodness of fit of the model simulation results we used the original ec sampling resolution i e every 5 minutes to estimate pewfs for the 37 rainfall runoff events using the best model structure of the system i e structure 4 all of the events presented a considerable increase in their kge values which varied between 0 54 event 9 and 0 92 event 16 fig 7 this represented an average kge increase of 14 among all events in relation to the kges yielded when the simulations were carried out using the original δ18o sampling resolution used to compare the pewfs estimated using δ18o and ec i e 1 to 6 h uncertainty in the results showed an average decrease of 5 for all the events with event 33 having the highest decrease 8 and event 16 presenting the lowest reduction 2 4 discussion 4 1 selection of the best model structure and process based conceptualization using two tracers for model calibration δ18o and ec traspan allowed evaluation of four model structures representing different catchment hydrological behavior competing hypothesis pfister and kirchner 2017 for 37 rainfall runoff events monitored for a wide range of climatological and flow conditions to obtain the best representation of the investigated hydrological system goodness of fit kge analysis indicated that model structure 4 provided the best representation of the studied páramo catchment for 64 of all events regardless of the tracer used for model calibration fig 3 these results were confirmed by the parsimony analysis which showed that model structure 4 presented the lowest aic values despite it had the largest number of calibration parameters of all the evaluated structures this finding reassures that the selection of this model structure was not affected by overparameterization issues forster 2000 the selection of this model structure is supported by the conceptualization of rainfall runoff processes at the study catchment model structure 4 involves a variable fraction of effective precipitation routed as event water and 2 reservoirs with different travel times fast and slow where water mixes and is further released as streamflow the time variable fraction of event water likely accounts for two processes first interception losses from tussock grasses covering 74 of the catchment tussock grass water storage capacity 2 mm ochoa sánchez et al 2018 as precipitation intensity during the monitored events rarely exceeded 0 5 mm hr table 1 second the recharge of the available water storage in the riparian wetlands histosol soils at the beginning of the events lazo et al 2019 the water reservoir with fast transfer time reflects a combination of direct channel precipitation e g penna et al 2015 and water that flows in the first few centimeters of the paramo soils in the riparian wetlands which remain near saturation conditions year round mosquera et al 2015 that is with little to no contact time with the subsurface delsman et al 2013 these water flow paths on average account for 15 using δ18o and 22 using ec of storm runoff according to our tracer based hydrograph separation estimations they constitute the new water end member of the system during stormflow generation correa et al 2019 the reservoir with slow travel time represents the mobilization of water from deeper horizons of hillslope and wetland soils and small contribution from shallow groundwater in the rather compact bedrock correa et al 2017 crespo et al 2011 lazo et al 2019 it represents the old water end member dominating the stormflow hydrograph on average 85 with δ18o and 78 with ec the dominance of the pewfs during rainfall events fig 4 is in line with that reported based on weekly to biweekly data collected in the period 2011 2014 in the study area pewfs 75 correa et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016a the prevalence of pre event water is also in agreement with the concept that runoff generation is mainly controlled by water stored in catchments prior to rainfall events klaus and mcdonnell 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 overall the selection of model structure 4 as the best representation of the catchment s hydrological behavior during rainfall runoff events is supported by the statistical analysis and the mechanistic understanding of runoff generation at the study site 4 2 comparison of flow partitioning modelling using stable isotopic and ec data under variable flow conditions the comparison of pewfs estimated using model structure 4 showed that δ18o and ec yielded similar flow partitioning results for most of the events fig 5 such similarity of flow partitioning results between both tracers has also been reported in a variety of catchments worldwide vidon and cuadra 2010 found differences between 5 and 15 at a tile drained field site in the usa laudon and slaymaker 1997 obtained differences of about 20 in alpine catchments in british columbia cano paoli et al 2019 analyzed hydrograph separation at a headwater alpine catchment in italy where the differences between estimations yielded by the two tracers were about 10 camacho suarez et al 2015 reported no major differences 9 in a sub tropical semi arid environment meriano et al 2011 also found small differences 8 at an urban glaciated catchment in canada it is worth noting that the aforementioned investigations were conducted using a rather limited number of monitored events normally 10 this limitation reduced the capacity to statistically evaluate the significance of the reported similarities as well as potential differences in results over a wide range of climatological and flow conditions the unique dataset presented in this study permitted to statistically support our findings table 2 which in general did not depend on such hydroclimatological variability it is well known that ec can behave as a non conservative tracer under certain conditions hayashi et al 2012 laudon and slaymaker 1997 pellerin et al 2008 in other tropical catchments in panama this non conservative behavior has been attributed to large intensity precipitation events as a result of pre event water contributions becoming more dilute across the course of rainstorms litt et al 2015 another reason for discrepancies among flow components estimated using stable isotopes and ec could arise from spatial variability in the activation of different water flow paths contributing to discharge hoeg et al 2000 our findings indicate that these sources of discrepancy are overcome at our study site as a result of the presence of riparian wetlands presenting high porosity and available water storage capacity for tracer mixing lazo et al 2019 in combination with low contributions of water from deeper groundwater flow paths correa et al 2019 2017 mosquera et al 2016a these conditions likely reduce the spatial variability of ec across the catchment before reaching the stream mosquera et al 2016b these findings are further supported by the remarkably similar process based understanding yielded by the model simulations regardless of the tracer used for calibration and flow conditions from low to high as evidenced by the strong similarity between the system s ttds fig 6 altogether these findings point to a quasi conservative behavior of ec at the study area making it suitable for monitoring rainfall runoff processes at high temporal frequency 4 3 increase in model performance using high resolution ec data the lack of samples collected during peak flow in combination with a low sampling resolution ratio of samples collected during an event to its duration in hours caused discrepancies for the four events which presented pewf differences 20 between δ18o and ec fig 5 particularly for long duration events 90 h our findings indicate that sampling resolution and the number of samples collected during high flows should increase to avoid missing critical information during peak flow production von freyberg et al 2017 highlighting the importance of and need for high resolution monitoring during rainfall runoff events one of the main advantages of finding a tracer that can be monitored at high temporal frequency while satisfying the assumptions of the two component hydrograph separation is that it provides the opportunity to identify the variability of fast occurring rainfall runoff processes ec is an ideal alternative tracer considering its ease of in stream measurement at fine temporal resolution sub hourly and lower operational monitoring cost compared to δ18o cano paoli et al 2019 in this context our results clearly showed that when 5 minute ec data were used for model calibration the goodness of fit of the hydrograph and tracer data increased significantly for all monitored events that is kge values increased an average of 0 16 in relation those obtained when using data collected at 1 to 6 h intervals fig 7 these findings highlight the value of monitoring tracer data at high temporal frequency floury et al 2017 pesántez et al 2021 von freyberg et al 2017 so that the temporal variability of water transport and mixing processes can be better identified mosquera et al 2018 stockinger et al 2016 timbe et al 2015 addressing this issue is especially important in environments with fast hydrological response where peak flows often occur in time periods less than an hour e g sahraei et al 2020 so that the lack of high frequency data can result in a significant loss of information kirchner et al 2004 according to our findings high frequency ec data can help overcome this issue in catchments with similar characteristics to ours while providing robust flow partitioning results as evidenced by the comparative analysis between ec and stable isotopes presented above 5 conclusions our study showed that ec yielded similar results than δ18o at event and pre event hydrograph separation with a tracer aided hydrological model covering a wide range of flow conditions low to high peak flows not only in amount of water but also at catchment internal processes representation as shown by the similarity of the ttds when calibrating the model structures these similarities could be attributed to some specific catchment characteristics such as high water storage capacity due to the high water retention capacity of the porous soils which allows for an efficient mixing of the water in the system combined with low groundwater contributions that reduce the spatial variability of ec resulting in a quasi conservative behavior from this tracer this behavior opens the possibility to use ec as an alternative tracer instead of stable isotopes δ18o in hydrograph separation studies increasing the sampling resolution which will make it possible to have a quasi continuous measurement of tracer data this will help to increase the number of samples available for hydrograph separation analyses increasing the performance of models resulting in an accurate representation of catchment hydrological behavior even at peak flow where information is often missing this in turn could help to reveal fast occurring rainfall runoff processes in addition ec could lower the resources needed to maintain high frequency monitoring networks as it is easier to measure allowing a sustained acquisition of data in the long term which is often unachievable with other tracers i e stable isotopes especially in remote places were logistics are very difficult and financial support is scarce credit authorship contribution

2476,baseflow is an important component of streamflow in alpine permafrost basins and plays a significant role in maintaining ecosystem security and rational planning of water resources meanwhile a holistic analysis of the runoff process and determination of low flow components helps to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions in this context an approach for determining low flow components is presented as a support daily flow data regarding the source regions of the yangtze river yarsr and yellow river yersr from 1965 to 2014 were divided into three groups wet normal and dry years to analyze baseflow recession curves and flow duration curves fdc the results showed that low flow components can be determined from the corresponding relationship between percentile flow qpi in fdc baseflow and recession processes sub permafrost groundwater is the main component of baseflow in the permafrost regions of the qinghai tibet plateau the multi year average proportion of sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr and yersr at q75 q85 and q94 ranged from 75 5 to 100 suggesting the dominance of sub permafrost groundwater in sustaining low flows in addition river discharge in dry years was more dependent on deep groundwater the sub permafrost groundwater proportion in low flows in dry years 76 95 was greater than that of wet years 64 86 we also found that sub permafrost groundwater flows increased significantly with permafrost degradation sub permafrost groundwater flows increased more rapidly than that of supra permafrost groundwater flows over the past decades future climate change may further affect runoff composition in permafrost rivers and our method has great potential to characterize it keywords baseflow permafrost recession process percentile flow low flow components data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction permafrost plays significant roles in the energy and hydrological cycles in alpine permafrost regions guo et al 2020 lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 qin et al 2016 with the intensification of global climate warming over the past decades the cryosphere of the qinghai tibet plateau has changed kuang and jiao 2016 yang et al 2014 permafrost degradation may make hydrological processes and runoff composition more complicated bring et al 2016 cuo et al 2014 ma et al 2019 pavelsky and smith 2006 rawlins et al 2006 wang et al 2017a b yang 2003 and lead to drastic changes in the groundwater system cheng and wu 2007 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b generally baseflow in permafrost rivers is sustained by groundwater gao et al 2016 smakhtin 2001 and baseflow is an important indicator of groundwater discharge eckhardt 2008 lei et al 2021 ma et al 2019 mohammed and scholz 2018 swanson et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 such groundwater is either a mixture of sources from supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers or a single source walvoord and kurylyk 2016 however the composition of groundwater or baseflow has not been properly deciphered among cold region river basins which limits our understanding of cryohydrological processes in such regions thus it is necessary to analyze runoff processes and groundwater composition in permafrost regions at present the baseflow separation methods mainly include the graphic method numerical simulation method water balance method isotope and hydrochemistry method li et al 2020a b ma et al 2020 tekleab et al 2014 xu et al 2016 these methods can separate baseflow from runoff but cannot further subdivide the compositional sources of baseflow although there are many theories about the definition of baseflow the view that baseflow is mainly recharged by groundwater is widely accepted partington et al 2012 smakhtin 2001 zhang et al 2017 in permafrost regions groundwater can be further divided into sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater an urgent problem that needs to be solved is the compositional structure of sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater in baseflow and its response characteristics to climate change which is difficult to be realized only by traditional baseflow separation methods it seriously hinders our understanding of hydrological processes in permafrost regions although the isotopic method is well applied to runoff components separation it is also difficult to divide the sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater in permafrost regions especially in medium or small watersheds kortatsi 2006 li et al 2020a b xu et al 2016 meanwhile it requires a lot of manpower and material resources especially in remote permafrost regions huang et al 2018 sanchez murillo et al 2015 tan et al 2021 xu et al 2016 therefore we need a concise and practical method to separate these runoff components recession process analysis is crucial for understanding hydrological processes in permafrost regions it can be used to pre determine runoff components in different periods wang et al 2017a b wang et al 2009 and the recession coefficient can also be employed to estimate groundwater storage yi et al 2021 however analysis of the recession process can only qualitatively determine runoff components in addition the runoff components of low and high flows are different therefore the runoff components at different flows must be considered separately gudmundsson et al 2011 smakhtin 2001 the flow duration curve fdc is the only effective tool that can reveal the full range from low to high flow which is particularly important in evaluation of runoff characteristics al faraj and scholz 2014 lyon and destouni 2010 however the potential of fdc in the division of runoff components in permafrost regions has not been fully exploited and its reasonable utilization has an important indicative significance for the division of runoff components which can help us to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions song et al 2021 the determination of groundwater or baseflow components in permafrost regions is a key issue that needs to be addressed in the development of permafrost hydrology therefore we sought to quantitatively determine the low flow components and the changing trend of sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater under climate change through the corresponding relationship between baseflow separation recession processes and percentile flow in fdc to break through the bottleneck problem faced by the development of permafrost hydrology the main objective of this paper is to provide a concise and practical method for determining low flow components to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions and offer a scientific basis for the evaluation and management of water resources daily flow data of the yangtze river yarsr and yellow river source basins yersr in alpine permafrost regions from 1965 to 2014 which were divided into three water year groups wet normal and dry years were used as a basic support a digital filtering method was used to separate the baseflow meanwhile we combined the analyzed results of the recession processes and percentile flow in fdc to determine the low flow components 2 methods and materials 2 1 determination method of low flow components based on the combination of baseflow separation recession processes and percentile flow in fdc a concise and practical method which can be used to determine low flow components in permafrost regions is proposed through their internal connection fig 1 it can be summarized in the following three steps 1 separation of baseflow using digital filtering method the digital filtering method is derived from signal analysis and its main function is to divide signals into high and low frequency signals runoff is taken as the superposition of direct runoff high frequency signals and baseflow low frequency signals q t a q t 1 1 a 2 q t q t 1 b t q t q t b f i b t q t where q t is the surface flow m3 s after filtering in time period t q t and q t 1 represent the total flow m3 s in periods t and t 1 respectively a is the filter coefficient generally 0 925 b t is baseflow baseflow index bfi refers to the ratio of baseflow to total flow ahiablame et al 2013 nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2020 2 pre determination of low flow components by recession processes analysis this study used the classic recession curve q t q 0 e β t in the formula q 0 m3 s is the streamflow at the beginning of the recession process q t m3 s is the streamflow during the period t β is the recession coefficient shamsi et al 2019 the recession process is not only one of the important characteristics of runoff but also reflects runoff composition wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a b 3 further determination of low flow components from percentile flow in fdc the fdc is a characteristic statistical curve that reflects the number of days in which the flow exceeds a certain value in a particular period the ordinate is the daily average flow and the abscissa represents the cumulative number of days exceeding a certain flow that is the duration if the abscissa is expressed by the percentile flow qpi it is the relative flow duration curve qpi indicates the streamflow at a given frequency pi song et al 2021 for example q75 and q85 represent the streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 75 and 85 respectively the percentile flow also indicates annual runoff composition fouad et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 the streamflow of q75 is higher than that of q85 and the runoff composition of small qpi may be more complex 2 2 study area and data we select the yarsr and yersr as the typical research area to testify to the low flow components determination method mentioned above the yarsr and yersr are located in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau 31 39 n 36 12 n 89 45 e 102 23 e which are the main rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau permafrost region fig 2 approximately 77 3 and 56 1 of the yarsr and yersr are underlain by permafrost zou et al 2017 yarsr and yersr are characterized by a plateau continental climate the ranges of annual average temperature evaporation and precipitation are from 5 38 to 4 14 c 700 to 730 mm and 262 2 to 772 8 mm respectively among them precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september accounting for 75 of annual precipitation fig 2 the areas of the yarsr and yersr are 137 700 km2 and 122 000 km2 respectively dai et al 2018 zhimenda station and tangnaihai station are the respective control hydrological stations of the yarsr and yersr respectively of the study area the daily runoff data for this study were provided by the qinghai hydrological bureau precipitation data were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research https climatedataguide ucar edu to ensure continuity and stability of the data and eliminate any influence of missing data for each station on the analysis results as much as possible daily streamflow observational data from 1965 to 2014 were selected for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of baseflow and recession processes the bfi obtained by baseflow separation is the basis for quantitatively determining low flow components fig 3 shows the results of multi year baseflow separation monthly average baseflow and bfi mean value extreme value and standard deviation for yarsr and yersr from december to march of the following year bfi was highest the monthly average bfis in yarsr and yersr were 0 77 0 86 and 0 78 0 90 respectively the highest bfi value was 1 fig 3e and 3f river discharge mainly depends on recharging of deep groundwater in this time and runoff components outside the baseflow account for a small proportion this may be related to the lower precipitation low temperature and high freezing degree of the active layer in the basin during this period as precipitation starts to increase around april and may the active layer and snow cover continue to thaw with increasing air temperature meanwhile the bfis begin to decline and were 0 55 and 0 65 for yarsr and yersr respectively fig 3e and 3f the proportion of groundwater in the total river discharge subsequently decreased moreover the bfi reached a minimum value for the year around june which was 0 45 and 0 57 in yarsr and yersr respectively fig 3e and 3f this may be related to increased surface runoff and interflow generated by precipitation and snowmelt during this period from july to september the active layer thaw depth continued to increase and bfi increased by approximately 0 1 the monthly average bfi in yarsr was 0 53 0 63 and in yersr 0 61 0 74 fig 3e and 3f from october to november precipitation in the basin decreased the active layer continued to freeze with a decrease in temperature the monthly average bfi started to rise again and the proportion of groundwater in the total river discharge increased fig 3e and f the recession processes analysis can be used to pre determine the low flow components the summer recession processes are shown in fig 4 a and b after the spring flood three recession gradients 1 june 2 july 3 august were analyzed the first recession process involving yarsr and yersr lasted approximately 3 4 days which was shorter than the other two stages the first recession process had a short duration with low peak flow which is likely related to rainfall and snowmelt water since the active layer is partially thawed during this period in addition both the second and third recession processes involving yarsr and yersr lasted approximately 6 8 days which may be related to interflow and supra permafrost groundwater caused by the shallower active layer thaw in addition the peak flow and recession coefficient of the third recession process were smaller than those of the second recession process which may be related to increased active layer thaw depth decreased interflow proportion and increased groundwater proportion supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater thus the summer recession process is mainly driven by precipitation including some snowmelt water interflow supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in addition as shown in fig 4c and 4d the autumn recession process is generally slow and the first recession process in september 1a lasts approximately 8 9 days and the second recession process in october 2a lasts for 10 days the recession process during this period reveals the potential major components of summer flow the slow recession processes may be related to slow interflow and groundwater discharges from the deep active layer therefore the autumn recession process is mainly composed of slow interflow supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater and groundwater accounts for a relatively larger proportion than in summer the recession process in winter from november to april of the following year is extremely slow the baseflow is close to the total streamflow and this low flow process can last for approximately four months so sub permafrost groundwater may be the main component of streamflow at this time wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a b 3 2 low flow components in different hydrological years the low flow components can be further determined by combining the analysis results of the percentile flow in fdc baseflow and recession processes in normal years when bfi 1 in the yarsr the percentile flow in fdc was q91 5 q96 5 and the average percentile flow was q94 2 fig 5 a which appears from january to march when bfi 1 in yersr the percentile flow in fdc was q91 5 q96 5 and the average percentile flow was q94 3 fig 5a which occurs in january february meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study areas was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at approximately q94 in normal years may be completely sub permafrost groundwater in addition the respective bfis for yarsr and yersr at q85 were 0 83 0 91 and 0 82 0 91 fig 5b most of which appears in january and february meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study area was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at q85 in normal years might be 82 91 sub permafrost groundwater and 9 18 supra permafrost groundwater in addition the respective bfis for yarsr and yersr at q75 were 0 70 0 79 and 0 69 0 80 fig 5b most of which appear in march and december meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study area was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at q75 in normal years might be 69 80 sub permafrost groundwater and 20 31 supra permafrost groundwater the analysis processes for wet and dry years are the same as normal years and the results of low flow components are presented in figs 6 and 7 and table 1 in wet years the low flow component at q96 may consist entirely of sub permafrost groundwater and in dry years it was approximately q92 when bfi 1 the percentile flow of fdc in wet years was approximately 2 higher than that in normal years while the opposite was the case in wet years fig 6a fig 7a and table 1 at q85 in dry and wet years the low flow was formed by 86 95 sub permafrost groundwater and 5 14 supra permafrost groundwater and 76 86 sub permafrost groundwater and 14 24 supra permafrost groundwater respectively fig 6b fig 7b and table 1 at q75 in dry and wet years the low flow was composed of 76 88 sub permafrost groundwater and 12 24 supra permafrost groundwater and 64 73 sub permafrost groundwater and 27 36 supra permafrost groundwater respectively fig 6b fig 7b and table 1 compared with the normal years at q85 and q75 the proportion of sub permafrost groundwater was relatively high in dry years and relatively low in wet years this may be related to the fact that river discharge in dry years is more dependent on deep groundwater in summary the low flow components can be precisely determined by the method mentioned above our study showed that fdc combining the baseflow and recession processes have great potential for determining low flow components in permafrost regions the results fulfill the prospect of it is necessary to separate the runoff components and gain a better understanding of the details and mechanisms of the runoff changes in cold region rivers in song et al 2021 in dry normal and wet years q92 q94 and q96 can show that the low flow component is completely sub permafrost groundwater respectively the average percentile flow for all years 1965 2014 with bfi 1 was q94 so q94 can be used to fully represent sub permafrost groundwater because of active layer freezing in winter most of the river discharge is controlled by sub permafrost groundwater and consequently this stable river discharge has a high percentile in fdc in addition different flows have different responses to various impact factors song et al 2021 and the proportion of different runoff components in different flows is also various therefore we can further separate low flow components through the approach proposed in our study and make a more suitable management policy according to the change in different runoff components furthermore the high flow has more influencing factors and more complex runoff components and needs to be further determined in future research 3 3 long term changes to sub permafrost groundwater at low flow in recent 50 years after determining the low flow components by our method we can intuitively show the variation trends of different components fig 8 illustrates the long term changes in low flow at q85 and q75 over the last 50 years the total amount of groundwater in yersr was higher than that in yarsr at q85 and q75 the total groundwater supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr exhibited an increasing trend the total groundwater flow increased more rapidly than that of supra permafrost and sub permafrost groundwater flows in addition the total groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in yersr also showed an increasing trend whereas total groundwater increased more slowly than that of the sub permafrost groundwater flow in addition the variation trend of the supra permafrost groundwater in yersr was decreasing but has increased in recent years climate change has a huge impact on runoff especially in permafrost regions yarsr and yersr are located upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers small water resources fluctuations can make a great influence on the downstream basin increased water resources of different runoff components in different flows can be evaluated and allocated rationally according to the change trends especially as global warming intensifies meanwhile a recent study has shown that low flow is more sensitive to temperature while high flow is more sensitive to precipitation song et al 2021 to analyze the possible reasons for the long term variation trends of these low flow components under climate change the correlation between sub permafrost or supra permafrost groundwater at low flow q85 q75 and temperature or precipitation were analyzed the results showed that the correlation coefficient between supra permafrost groundwater at low flow and temperature was 0 39 0 40 p 0 01 in addition it was 0 65 0 74 between supra permafrost groundwater at low flow and precipitation p 0 01 the correlation coefficient between sub permafrost groundwater at low flow and temperature was 0 30 0 34 p 0 05 in addition it was 0 2 between sub permafrost groundwater at low flow and precipitation p 0 05 therefore precipitation may be an important factor affecting long term changes in supra permafrost groundwater at low flow although the correlation coefficient between temperature and sub permafrost and supra permafrost groundwater was low their p values were all 0 05 temperature may also be another important factor affecting its change temperature rise causes permafrost thawing and deepening of the active layer leading to dynamic changes in low flow in alpine permafrost regions song et al 2021 the reason for the low correlation coefficient may be due to the increase in evapotranspiration caused by increased temperature which offset some water recharge from permafrost degradation there may be a dynamic equilibrium point between permafrost degradation and evapotranspiration enhancement under climate change which needs further study in the future furthermore the increase in low flow is conducive to the alleviation of water resources supply in the watershed during the dry season at the same time it is necessary to rationally regulate and manage the increased water resources to prevent the increase of upstream flow from affecting the steady state of downstream runoff in addition due to the increase in low flow the amount of river ice will increase in the cold season it is necessary to pay attention to the freezing disaster brought to the coast we need to prevent the occurrence of ice jam hazards and flood events caused by meltwater in spring to a certain extent the increase of sub permafrost and supra permafrost groundwater in low flow reflects the degradation of permafrost and the deepening of the active layer under climate change we need to consider the stability of existing structures in permafrost areas 4 conclusions in this study we show that low flow components can be determined from the corresponding relationships involving percentile flows in fdc baseflow and recession processes in permafrost regions the yarsr and yersr with daily flow data were used as effective application of the method we found that sub permafrost groundwater was the main component of baseflow and its recharge to the river is more than supra permafrost groundwater during low flow periods the multi year average proportions of sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr and yersr at q75 q85 and q94 ranged from 75 5 to 100 meanwhile we found that river discharge in dry years was more dependent on deep groundwater thereby the proportion of sub permafrost groundwater in low flows of dry years was greater than that in normal years while in wet years the opposite prevails in addition sub permafrost groundwater increased significantly with

2476,baseflow is an important component of streamflow in alpine permafrost basins and plays a significant role in maintaining ecosystem security and rational planning of water resources meanwhile a holistic analysis of the runoff process and determination of low flow components helps to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions in this context an approach for determining low flow components is presented as a support daily flow data regarding the source regions of the yangtze river yarsr and yellow river yersr from 1965 to 2014 were divided into three groups wet normal and dry years to analyze baseflow recession curves and flow duration curves fdc the results showed that low flow components can be determined from the corresponding relationship between percentile flow qpi in fdc baseflow and recession processes sub permafrost groundwater is the main component of baseflow in the permafrost regions of the qinghai tibet plateau the multi year average proportion of sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr and yersr at q75 q85 and q94 ranged from 75 5 to 100 suggesting the dominance of sub permafrost groundwater in sustaining low flows in addition river discharge in dry years was more dependent on deep groundwater the sub permafrost groundwater proportion in low flows in dry years 76 95 was greater than that of wet years 64 86 we also found that sub permafrost groundwater flows increased significantly with permafrost degradation sub permafrost groundwater flows increased more rapidly than that of supra permafrost groundwater flows over the past decades future climate change may further affect runoff composition in permafrost rivers and our method has great potential to characterize it keywords baseflow permafrost recession process percentile flow low flow components data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction permafrost plays significant roles in the energy and hydrological cycles in alpine permafrost regions guo et al 2020 lafrenière and lamoureux 2019 lamontagne hallé et al 2018 qin et al 2016 with the intensification of global climate warming over the past decades the cryosphere of the qinghai tibet plateau has changed kuang and jiao 2016 yang et al 2014 permafrost degradation may make hydrological processes and runoff composition more complicated bring et al 2016 cuo et al 2014 ma et al 2019 pavelsky and smith 2006 rawlins et al 2006 wang et al 2017a b yang 2003 and lead to drastic changes in the groundwater system cheng and wu 2007 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b generally baseflow in permafrost rivers is sustained by groundwater gao et al 2016 smakhtin 2001 and baseflow is an important indicator of groundwater discharge eckhardt 2008 lei et al 2021 ma et al 2019 mohammed and scholz 2018 swanson et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 such groundwater is either a mixture of sources from supra permafrost and sub permafrost aquifers or a single source walvoord and kurylyk 2016 however the composition of groundwater or baseflow has not been properly deciphered among cold region river basins which limits our understanding of cryohydrological processes in such regions thus it is necessary to analyze runoff processes and groundwater composition in permafrost regions at present the baseflow separation methods mainly include the graphic method numerical simulation method water balance method isotope and hydrochemistry method li et al 2020a b ma et al 2020 tekleab et al 2014 xu et al 2016 these methods can separate baseflow from runoff but cannot further subdivide the compositional sources of baseflow although there are many theories about the definition of baseflow the view that baseflow is mainly recharged by groundwater is widely accepted partington et al 2012 smakhtin 2001 zhang et al 2017 in permafrost regions groundwater can be further divided into sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater an urgent problem that needs to be solved is the compositional structure of sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater in baseflow and its response characteristics to climate change which is difficult to be realized only by traditional baseflow separation methods it seriously hinders our understanding of hydrological processes in permafrost regions although the isotopic method is well applied to runoff components separation it is also difficult to divide the sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater in permafrost regions especially in medium or small watersheds kortatsi 2006 li et al 2020a b xu et al 2016 meanwhile it requires a lot of manpower and material resources especially in remote permafrost regions huang et al 2018 sanchez murillo et al 2015 tan et al 2021 xu et al 2016 therefore we need a concise and practical method to separate these runoff components recession process analysis is crucial for understanding hydrological processes in permafrost regions it can be used to pre determine runoff components in different periods wang et al 2017a b wang et al 2009 and the recession coefficient can also be employed to estimate groundwater storage yi et al 2021 however analysis of the recession process can only qualitatively determine runoff components in addition the runoff components of low and high flows are different therefore the runoff components at different flows must be considered separately gudmundsson et al 2011 smakhtin 2001 the flow duration curve fdc is the only effective tool that can reveal the full range from low to high flow which is particularly important in evaluation of runoff characteristics al faraj and scholz 2014 lyon and destouni 2010 however the potential of fdc in the division of runoff components in permafrost regions has not been fully exploited and its reasonable utilization has an important indicative significance for the division of runoff components which can help us to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions song et al 2021 the determination of groundwater or baseflow components in permafrost regions is a key issue that needs to be addressed in the development of permafrost hydrology therefore we sought to quantitatively determine the low flow components and the changing trend of sub permafrost groundwater and supra permafrost groundwater under climate change through the corresponding relationship between baseflow separation recession processes and percentile flow in fdc to break through the bottleneck problem faced by the development of permafrost hydrology the main objective of this paper is to provide a concise and practical method for determining low flow components to better understand hydrological processes in permafrost regions and offer a scientific basis for the evaluation and management of water resources daily flow data of the yangtze river yarsr and yellow river source basins yersr in alpine permafrost regions from 1965 to 2014 which were divided into three water year groups wet normal and dry years were used as a basic support a digital filtering method was used to separate the baseflow meanwhile we combined the analyzed results of the recession processes and percentile flow in fdc to determine the low flow components 2 methods and materials 2 1 determination method of low flow components based on the combination of baseflow separation recession processes and percentile flow in fdc a concise and practical method which can be used to determine low flow components in permafrost regions is proposed through their internal connection fig 1 it can be summarized in the following three steps 1 separation of baseflow using digital filtering method the digital filtering method is derived from signal analysis and its main function is to divide signals into high and low frequency signals runoff is taken as the superposition of direct runoff high frequency signals and baseflow low frequency signals q t a q t 1 1 a 2 q t q t 1 b t q t q t b f i b t q t where q t is the surface flow m3 s after filtering in time period t q t and q t 1 represent the total flow m3 s in periods t and t 1 respectively a is the filter coefficient generally 0 925 b t is baseflow baseflow index bfi refers to the ratio of baseflow to total flow ahiablame et al 2013 nathan and mcmahon 1990 zhang et al 2020 2 pre determination of low flow components by recession processes analysis this study used the classic recession curve q t q 0 e β t in the formula q 0 m3 s is the streamflow at the beginning of the recession process q t m3 s is the streamflow during the period t β is the recession coefficient shamsi et al 2019 the recession process is not only one of the important characteristics of runoff but also reflects runoff composition wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a b 3 further determination of low flow components from percentile flow in fdc the fdc is a characteristic statistical curve that reflects the number of days in which the flow exceeds a certain value in a particular period the ordinate is the daily average flow and the abscissa represents the cumulative number of days exceeding a certain flow that is the duration if the abscissa is expressed by the percentile flow qpi it is the relative flow duration curve qpi indicates the streamflow at a given frequency pi song et al 2021 for example q75 and q85 represent the streamflow at exceedance probabilities of 75 and 85 respectively the percentile flow also indicates annual runoff composition fouad et al 2018 ghotbi et al 2020 the streamflow of q75 is higher than that of q85 and the runoff composition of small qpi may be more complex 2 2 study area and data we select the yarsr and yersr as the typical research area to testify to the low flow components determination method mentioned above the yarsr and yersr are located in the hinterland of the qinghai tibet plateau 31 39 n 36 12 n 89 45 e 102 23 e which are the main rivers in the qinghai tibet plateau permafrost region fig 2 approximately 77 3 and 56 1 of the yarsr and yersr are underlain by permafrost zou et al 2017 yarsr and yersr are characterized by a plateau continental climate the ranges of annual average temperature evaporation and precipitation are from 5 38 to 4 14 c 700 to 730 mm and 262 2 to 772 8 mm respectively among them precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september accounting for 75 of annual precipitation fig 2 the areas of the yarsr and yersr are 137 700 km2 and 122 000 km2 respectively dai et al 2018 zhimenda station and tangnaihai station are the respective control hydrological stations of the yarsr and yersr respectively of the study area the daily runoff data for this study were provided by the qinghai hydrological bureau precipitation data were obtained from the national center for atmospheric research https climatedataguide ucar edu to ensure continuity and stability of the data and eliminate any influence of missing data for each station on the analysis results as much as possible daily streamflow observational data from 1965 to 2014 were selected for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of baseflow and recession processes the bfi obtained by baseflow separation is the basis for quantitatively determining low flow components fig 3 shows the results of multi year baseflow separation monthly average baseflow and bfi mean value extreme value and standard deviation for yarsr and yersr from december to march of the following year bfi was highest the monthly average bfis in yarsr and yersr were 0 77 0 86 and 0 78 0 90 respectively the highest bfi value was 1 fig 3e and 3f river discharge mainly depends on recharging of deep groundwater in this time and runoff components outside the baseflow account for a small proportion this may be related to the lower precipitation low temperature and high freezing degree of the active layer in the basin during this period as precipitation starts to increase around april and may the active layer and snow cover continue to thaw with increasing air temperature meanwhile the bfis begin to decline and were 0 55 and 0 65 for yarsr and yersr respectively fig 3e and 3f the proportion of groundwater in the total river discharge subsequently decreased moreover the bfi reached a minimum value for the year around june which was 0 45 and 0 57 in yarsr and yersr respectively fig 3e and 3f this may be related to increased surface runoff and interflow generated by precipitation and snowmelt during this period from july to september the active layer thaw depth continued to increase and bfi increased by approximately 0 1 the monthly average bfi in yarsr was 0 53 0 63 and in yersr 0 61 0 74 fig 3e and 3f from october to november precipitation in the basin decreased the active layer continued to freeze with a decrease in temperature the monthly average bfi started to rise again and the proportion of groundwater in the total river discharge increased fig 3e and f the recession processes analysis can be used to pre determine the low flow components the summer recession processes are shown in fig 4 a and b after the spring flood three recession gradients 1 june 2 july 3 august were analyzed the first recession process involving yarsr and yersr lasted approximately 3 4 days which was shorter than the other two stages the first recession process had a short duration with low peak flow which is likely related to rainfall and snowmelt water since the active layer is partially thawed during this period in addition both the second and third recession processes involving yarsr and yersr lasted approximately 6 8 days which may be related to interflow and supra permafrost groundwater caused by the shallower active layer thaw in addition the peak flow and recession coefficient of the third recession process were smaller than those of the second recession process which may be related to increased active layer thaw depth decreased interflow proportion and increased groundwater proportion supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater thus the summer recession process is mainly driven by precipitation including some snowmelt water interflow supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in addition as shown in fig 4c and 4d the autumn recession process is generally slow and the first recession process in september 1a lasts approximately 8 9 days and the second recession process in october 2a lasts for 10 days the recession process during this period reveals the potential major components of summer flow the slow recession processes may be related to slow interflow and groundwater discharges from the deep active layer therefore the autumn recession process is mainly composed of slow interflow supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater and groundwater accounts for a relatively larger proportion than in summer the recession process in winter from november to april of the following year is extremely slow the baseflow is close to the total streamflow and this low flow process can last for approximately four months so sub permafrost groundwater may be the main component of streamflow at this time wang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a b 3 2 low flow components in different hydrological years the low flow components can be further determined by combining the analysis results of the percentile flow in fdc baseflow and recession processes in normal years when bfi 1 in the yarsr the percentile flow in fdc was q91 5 q96 5 and the average percentile flow was q94 2 fig 5 a which appears from january to march when bfi 1 in yersr the percentile flow in fdc was q91 5 q96 5 and the average percentile flow was q94 3 fig 5a which occurs in january february meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study areas was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at approximately q94 in normal years may be completely sub permafrost groundwater in addition the respective bfis for yarsr and yersr at q85 were 0 83 0 91 and 0 82 0 91 fig 5b most of which appears in january and february meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study area was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at q85 in normal years might be 82 91 sub permafrost groundwater and 9 18 supra permafrost groundwater in addition the respective bfis for yarsr and yersr at q75 were 0 70 0 79 and 0 69 0 80 fig 5b most of which appear in march and december meanwhile the analysis result of the recession processes pre determined that the main component of winter streamflow in the study area was sub permafrost groundwater so the low flow components at q75 in normal years might be 69 80 sub permafrost groundwater and 20 31 supra permafrost groundwater the analysis processes for wet and dry years are the same as normal years and the results of low flow components are presented in figs 6 and 7 and table 1 in wet years the low flow component at q96 may consist entirely of sub permafrost groundwater and in dry years it was approximately q92 when bfi 1 the percentile flow of fdc in wet years was approximately 2 higher than that in normal years while the opposite was the case in wet years fig 6a fig 7a and table 1 at q85 in dry and wet years the low flow was formed by 86 95 sub permafrost groundwater and 5 14 supra permafrost groundwater and 76 86 sub permafrost groundwater and 14 24 supra permafrost groundwater respectively fig 6b fig 7b and table 1 at q75 in dry and wet years the low flow was composed of 76 88 sub permafrost groundwater and 12 24 supra permafrost groundwater and 64 73 sub permafrost groundwater and 27 36 supra permafrost groundwater respectively fig 6b fig 7b and table 1 compared with the normal years at q85 and q75 the proportion of sub permafrost groundwater was relatively high in dry years and relatively low in wet years this may be related to the fact that river discharge in dry years is more dependent on deep groundwater in summary the low flow components can be precisely determined by the method mentioned above our study showed that fdc combining the baseflow and recession processes have great potential for determining low flow components in permafrost regions the results fulfill the prospect of it is necessary to separate the runoff components and gain a better understanding of the details and mechanisms of the runoff changes in cold region rivers in song et al 2021 in dry normal and wet years q92 q94 and q96 can show that the low flow component is completely sub permafrost groundwater respectively the average percentile flow for all years 1965 2014 with bfi 1 was q94 so q94 can be used to fully represent sub permafrost groundwater because of active layer freezing in winter most of the river discharge is controlled by sub permafrost groundwater and consequently this stable river discharge has a high percentile in fdc in addition different flows have different responses to various impact factors song et al 2021 and the proportion of different runoff components in different flows is also various therefore we can further separate low flow components through the approach proposed in our study and make a more suitable management policy according to the change in different runoff components furthermore the high flow has more influencing factors and more complex runoff components and needs to be further determined in future research 3 3 long term changes to sub permafrost groundwater at low flow in recent 50 years after determining the low flow components by our method we can intuitively show the variation trends of different components fig 8 illustrates the long term changes in low flow at q85 and q75 over the last 50 years the total amount of groundwater in yersr was higher than that in yarsr at q85 and q75 the total groundwater supra permafrost groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr exhibited an increasing trend the total groundwater flow increased more rapidly than that of supra permafrost and sub permafrost groundwater flows in addition the total groundwater and sub permafrost groundwater in yersr also showed an increasing trend whereas total groundwater increased more slowly than that of the sub permafrost groundwater flow in addition the variation trend of the supra permafrost groundwater in yersr was decreasing but has increased in recent years climate change has a huge impact on runoff especially in permafrost regions yarsr and yersr are located upstream of the yangtze and yellow rivers small water resources fluctuations can make a great influence on the downstream basin increased water resources of different runoff components in different flows can be evaluated and allocated rationally according to the change trends especially as global warming intensifies meanwhile a recent study has shown that low flow is more sensitive to temperature while high flow is more sensitive to precipitation song et al 2021 to analyze the possible reasons for the long term variation trends of these low flow components under climate change the correlation between sub permafrost or supra permafrost groundwater at low flow q85 q75 and temperature or precipitation were analyzed the results showed that the correlation coefficient between supra permafrost groundwater at low flow and temperature was 0 39 0 40 p 0 01 in addition it was 0 65 0 74 between supra permafrost groundwater at low flow and precipitation p 0 01 the correlation coefficient between sub permafrost groundwater at low flow and temperature was 0 30 0 34 p 0 05 in addition it was 0 2 between sub permafrost groundwater at low flow and precipitation p 0 05 therefore precipitation may be an important factor affecting long term changes in supra permafrost groundwater at low flow although the correlation coefficient between temperature and sub permafrost and supra permafrost groundwater was low their p values were all 0 05 temperature may also be another important factor affecting its change temperature rise causes permafrost thawing and deepening of the active layer leading to dynamic changes in low flow in alpine permafrost regions song et al 2021 the reason for the low correlation coefficient may be due to the increase in evapotranspiration caused by increased temperature which offset some water recharge from permafrost degradation there may be a dynamic equilibrium point between permafrost degradation and evapotranspiration enhancement under climate change which needs further study in the future furthermore the increase in low flow is conducive to the alleviation of water resources supply in the watershed during the dry season at the same time it is necessary to rationally regulate and manage the increased water resources to prevent the increase of upstream flow from affecting the steady state of downstream runoff in addition due to the increase in low flow the amount of river ice will increase in the cold season it is necessary to pay attention to the freezing disaster brought to the coast we need to prevent the occurrence of ice jam hazards and flood events caused by meltwater in spring to a certain extent the increase of sub permafrost and supra permafrost groundwater in low flow reflects the degradation of permafrost and the deepening of the active layer under climate change we need to consider the stability of existing structures in permafrost areas 4 conclusions in this study we show that low flow components can be determined from the corresponding relationships involving percentile flows in fdc baseflow and recession processes in permafrost regions the yarsr and yersr with daily flow data were used as effective application of the method we found that sub permafrost groundwater was the main component of baseflow and its recharge to the river is more than supra permafrost groundwater during low flow periods the multi year average proportions of sub permafrost groundwater in yarsr and yersr at q75 q85 and q94 ranged from 75 5 to 100 meanwhile we found that river discharge in dry years was more dependent on deep groundwater thereby the proportion of sub permafrost groundwater in low flows of dry years was greater than that in normal years while in wet years the opposite prevails in addition sub permafrost groundwater increased significantly with permafrost degradation and sub permafrost groundwater flows increased faster than that of supra permafrost groundwater flows although we achieved the determination of low flow components through our method the determination of high flow components is required to be further evaluated in future research additionally the potential of fdc for separating runoff components needs to be further exploited finally in the future practice of water resources management in permafrost regions we need to adjust scheduling and management policies in a timely manner according to the dynamic process of water resources under climate change meanwhile it is necessary to consider the possible linkage effects of changing factors to prevent the occurrence of related disasters credit authorship contribution

2477,fluvial system deposits often form suitable reservoirs for co2 geological storage cgs these potential storage sites usually present heterogeneous fluvial architectures at multiple scales this heterogeneity can exert varied effects on different aspects of cgs resulting in significant storage efficiency variability here we investigate the effects of variable fluvial lithofacies associations on co2 storage using the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain as a reservoir analog to test this we employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sedimentology reservoir modeling and numerical simulation of co2 injection to produce models akin to different fluvial lithofacies associations the storage volume and injectivity of co2 are found to decrease in reservoirs with decreasing fractions and sizes of high permeable facies from the proximal to the medial distal lithofacies associations the flow barriers created by low permeable facies can hinder the vertical migration of the co2 plume and prevent it from reaching the reservoir top hence reducing the direct contact between the co2 plume and the overlying caprock furthermore an optimal amount of low permeable layers around 30 in this study can increase the swept area of co2 and reduce the proportions of free co2 phase these aspects can collectively increase the amount of permanently trapped co2 and reduce the leakage risks of the injected co2 based on the characteristics of the resulting models i e storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 a multi criteria decision making method has been used to quantitatively rank the different lithofacies associations according to their suitability for co2 storage in this analysis the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations are assessed to be the most suitable ones because they feature low proportions of the injected co2 reaching the reservoir top and in free phase while maintaining the high storage volume and injectivity this study reveals that heterogeneous reservoir architectures have mixed effects on co2 storage and that reservoirs featuring moderately heterogeneous architectures i e fractions of low permeable facies ranging from 30 to 40 are beneficial to keeping the balance among different aspects of co2 storage this provides new insights for the screening and selection of potential geological sites for co2 storage keywords co2 geological storage trapping mechanism reservoir heterogeneity fluvial lithofacies association data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to date 194 parties have submitted their nationally determined contributions ndc to the paris agreement to describe their strategies for climate change mitigation unfccc 2022 among these more than

for greenhouse gas reduction alcalde et al 2018 bui et al 2018 ipcc 2018 particularly to decarbonize industrial emissions there is a huge gap between the current global ccs deployment and that which will be ultimately required to achieve the global mitigation targets global ccs institute 2018 sun et al 2020 ccs deployment has stalled in most countries due to various barriers scott et al 2013 such as a high development cost perception lack of market mechanisms and incentives potential safety and environmental issues leung et al 2014 budinis et al 2018 alcalde et al 2019 tcvetkov et al 2019 and low public acceptance seigo et al 2014 witte 2021 ensuring the safety and efficiency of the co2 geological storage cgs operations is essential to make ccs commercially and environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable once the captured co2 is injected into a geological reservoir different trapping mechanisms i e structural residual dissolution and mineralization trapping act on it at different rates to keep the co2 trapped in the subsurface bachu et al 2007 shukla et al 2010 de silva and ranjith 2012 structural trapping dominates the early storage stage first decades and depends on the caprock integrity to resist the injection pressure during the injection stage and the buoyancy pressure in the early post injection period shukla et al 2010 espinoza and santamarina 2017 iglauer 2018 the other trapping mechanisms do not rely on caprock efficiency but on the physical chemical interactions between fluids and or rocks these mechanisms are controlled by various factors including temperature pressure fluid and rock compositions wettability and pore structure among others riaz and cinar 2014 raza et al 2015 romanov et al 2015 mineralization trapping is considered the safest mechanism but its action is limited in most candidate reservoirs even after thousands of years except in reservoirs with sufficient divalent cation bearing minerals and rapid dissolution rates of these minerals zhang et al 2013 zhang and depaolo 2017 under these circumstances capillary trapping and dissolution trapping mechanisms play a critical role in ensuring storage security in the short medium term tens to hundreds of years apart from engineering factors such as the combination of injected fluids injection rate and well configuration raza et al 2015 al khdheeawi et al 2017a 2018 ren and jeong 2018 the geological characteristics of the reservoir determine co2 trapping efficiency for instance heterogeneous fluvial architectures lithofacies and their associations not only control the co2 storage capacity and injectivity ambrose et al 2008 issautier et al 2014 2016 but also the spatial distribution and fractions of different co2 phases gershenzon et al 2015 ershadnia et al 2021 2022 previous studies suggest that most regions have sufficient geological storage capacity for co2 kearns et al 2017 ringrose and meckel 2019 sun et al 2020 indicating that this does not seem to be a limiting factor for cgs deployment however having a high storage capacity is still a primary requirement in the selection of suitable sites sufficient storage capacity helps to guarantee that the selected storage site is economically viable by reducing the unit cost while increasing stored co2 shares similar capital costs i e the economy of scale alcalde et al 2019 2021 the presence of low porosity and permeability deposits within the target reservoir e g in the form of overbank deposits in fluvial systems can reduce the storage capacity and thus the trapping efficiency furthermore with the increasing fraction of these flow barriers the overall reservoir mainly channel deposits quality and connectivity deteriorate this results in decreasing reservoir injectivity such as a lower injection rate at a given injection pressure or a higher injection pressure to maintain a certain injection rate excessive injection pressure can potentially damage well bores bai et al 2016 gholami et al 2021 and rock integrity rutqvist et al 2008 li et al 2022 thus resulting in leakage risk heterogeneous deposits can also create asymmetric distributions of the injected co2 xu et al 2020 kou et al 2021 the different lithofacies forming a heterogeneous reservoir may present varying capillary pressure values which can locally produce areas of enhanced capillary trapping these areas may develop larger gas saturation than the residual gas saturation saadatpoor et al 2010 krevor et al 2011 and can prevent co2 migration towards the caprock the larger this contrast in capillary pressure is the larger the proportion of local capillary trapping can be produced gershenzon et al 2017c however local capillary trapping can partially fail to retain the co2 in the reservoir due to the accumulated buoyancy forces acting on the co2 plume or completely fail due to rock fracturing the influence of fluvial stratigraphic architectures on residual and dissolution trapping mechanisms has been extensively investigated gershenzon et al 2015 for example due to the heterogeneous relative permeability in different lithofacies a small amount of residual trapping occurs during the injection stage in addition to the large proportion existing in the post injection period gershenzon et al 2017b compared to relatively homogeneous reservoirs dominated by the vertical migration of the co2 plume with limited lateral migration the co2 plume in heterogeneous reservoirs can propagate farther in the horizontal direction due to the existence of low permeable layers in the vertical direction this can result in a larger contact area between the co2 plume and the pore filling brine leading to a larger ratio of dissolution trapping gershenzon et al 2015 2016 larger contrast in permeability between different rock types can increase the volume of the co2 plume increasing the efficiency of dissolution and residual trapping mechanisms gershenzon et al 2017c this prevents the co2 plume migration to caprocks or surfaces and thus reduces the risk of co2 leakage however reservoir heterogeneity can also produce other effects on the storage performance such as a reduction in sweeping efficiency of the co2 plume produced by low permeable units yang et al 2020 although the reservoir heterogeneity can enhance the lateral flow of the co2 plume it also may inhibit the vertical migration of co2 thus the effects of reservoir heterogeneity on co2 plume migration and co2 phases depend on the specific reservoir structure an overall decrease in sweeping efficiency of the co2 plume caused by the presence of a high fraction of flow barriers can also reduce the efficiency of residual trapping han et al 2010 and dissolution trapping al khdheeawi et al 2017b in summary heterogeneous reservoir architectures exert significant but varied effects on different aspects of co2 storage compared to relatively homogeneous reservoirs heterogeneous reservoir architectures generally feature lower storage capacity and injectivity for co2 however under certain circumstances the presence of low permeable layers can hinder the vertical migration of the co2 plume and reduce the fraction of free co2 in the pores which can reduce the risk of co2 leakage it is still controversial whether heterogeneous reservoir architectures can enhance the overall efficiency of co2 storage in this study we use the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain as a heterogeneous fluvial reservoir analog based on the previous field studies on outcrop sedimentology and reservoir characteristics cruset et al 2016 sun et al 2021b c 2022 we summarize the sedimentary and reservoir characteristics of typical lithofacies associations through systematic reservoir modeling and numerical simulating this study aims to determine the overall effects of different fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage based on a comprehensive consideration of storage capacity injectivity distribution and phases of co2 2 sedimentology background the puig reig anticline is located in the se pyrenean fold and thrust belt spain fig 1 a and developed along the footwall of the frontal vallfogona thrust emplaced over the ebro foreland basin fig 1b vergés 1993 this anticline is a km scale gentle anticline with a flat hinge its upper part is characterized by the berga group and the solsona formation deposited from alluvial fluvial systems during the late eocene and the oligocene williams et al 1998 barrier et al 2010 this study focuses on the well exposed and well preserved outcrops of the middle berga group and the solsona formation along several roads in the puig reig anticline fig 1c d these sequences were interpreted as the result of sedimentation in a proximal to medial fluvial system and present gradual changes of lithofacies associations from the foreland basin margin inwards sun et al 2021b the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations lap represent sedimentary environments of unconfined flash floods and wide shallow channel streams and are characterized by major conglomerates and minor coarse medium sandstones with limited fine deposits fig 2 a b the medial fluvial deposits represent sedimentary environments of channel streams and overbank areas and include the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations lapm and the medial distal fluvial lithofacies associations lamd the lapm is characterized by interbedded conglomerates coarse medium sandstones and fine deposits fig 2c d the lamd consists of coarse medium sandstones and more fine deposits fig 2e f the distal fluvial deposits lad are located southward of our study area and are composed of terminal lobes or fluvial dominated deltas and interdistributary bays sáez et al 2007 3 methodology 3 1 reservoir modeling reservoir models have been built using the petrel e p software platform by schlumberger the three dimensional model size is 5000 m 5000 m 50 m with 125 000 cells with a size of 100 m 100 m 1 m each for each lithofacies association lithofacies have been grouped in the lower high permeable facies of fluvial channel deposits and the upper low permeable facies of overbank deposits high permeable facies consist of conglomerates and coarse medium sandstones and low permeable facies consist of mudstones siltstones and fine sandstones the fractions and thicknesses of high permeable facies were measured from the studied outcrops the lap is generally characterized by a high fraction 80 and large thickness 8 m of high permeable facies compared to the lap the lapm features a lower fraction and smaller thickness of high permeable facies the lamd is generally characterized by a relatively low fraction 40 and small thickness 4 m of high permeable facies to represent the gradual changes of geometric characteristics from proximal to distal fluvial lithofacies associations ideal model scenarios were designed with regularly decreasing fractions and thickness of high permeable facies table 1 the width thickness ratio of high permeable facies was assigned as a constant value of 100 to represent general fluvial channels gibling 2006 the channel tortuosity defined as the ratio of the channel length to the direct axial length was assigned gradually increasing values from 1 08 to 1 40 to represent the generally increasing channel tortuosity from proximal to distal fluvial systems friend and sinha 1993 in total 11 model scenarios were designed with model scenarios 1 to 3 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 representing the lap lapm and lamd of the puig reig anticline respectively and scenarios 10 and 11 representing the lad outside this anticline for each model scenario a facies model was created using the object modeling algorithm based on the geometric characteristics of different facies this method can create a stochastic facies model and present the representative geometric characteristics of reservoirs especially fluvial channels the fluvial channel object was used as the high permeable facies using the aforementioned geometric parameters because all sediments have been grouped into two categories of facies the low permeable facies was set as the background object to fill the remaining model space between the fluvial channel objects abundant fractures developed in these fluvial deposits in the puig reig anticline sun et al 2021c were not included in the subsequent petrophysical modeling because it is out of the scope of this study focusing on the effects of different fluvial lithofacies associations on co2 storage for each facies model a porosity model was created using the gaussian random function algorithm because this method can create a facies controlled porosity model constrained by the geometric characteristics of the high permeable and low permeable facies for all model scenarios theoretical porosity ranges were set as 0 2 to 0 3 for high permeable facies and 0 1 to 0 2 for low permeable facies these porosity ranges can represent relatively high quality reservoirs which are the prior targets for cgs at the present stage due to their larger storage capacity and higher injectivity than low porosity reservoirs permeability k and irreducible water saturation swi were calculated using the empirical formulas proposed by holtz 2002 which have been widely used and proved to be effective for co2 storage simulation in fluvial sequences by previous studies gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017c ershadnia et al 2021 horizontal permeability was calculated from porosity φ using the empirical formula holtz 2002 while vertical permeability was calculated based on a ratio of vertical k to horizontal k of 0 2 to represent the permeability anisotropy in sedimentary rocks 1 k 7 10 7 φ 9 61 based on the average porosity and permeability the average swi was calculated using the empirical formula holtz 2002 for high permeable and low permeable facies respectively table 2 2 s wi 5 159 log k φ 1 559 the ratio r of the theoretical storage volume vr to the total rock volume vt of each model scenario was calculated using a volumetric method 3 r v r v t φ 1 s wi 3 2 numerical simulation of co2 storage reservoir simulations of 11 model scenarios were carried out using the eclipse 300 numerical simulator by schlumberger with the co2store option eclipse 300 is fully compatible with petrel and it is a multi dimensional compositional simulator with a cubic equation of state pressure dependent permeability or black oil fluid treatment class et al 2009 schlumberger 2018 its co2store option can simulate different cgs processes and consider free residual and dissolved co2 phases which have been widely used in co2 injection simulation in previous studies gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017b abbaszadeh et al 2020 these co2 phases represent the main co2 trapping mechanisms acting in the relatively short medium period injection stage to a few hundred years and determine whether the injected co2 will remain within the reservoir for subsequent mineralization trapping in the longer term based on different model scenarios reservoir simulations in this study aim to determine the overall effects of different lithofacies associations on the injectivity distribution and co2 phases the key parameters for reservoir simulations are summarized in table 2 considering the distinct physical properties of the high and low permeable facies different relative permeability curves and capillary pressure curves were used fig 3 the facies based curves were used instead of totally scaled cell based curves because the latter would significantly increase simulation time making it impractical for their use in large 3d models based on the average porosity of each facies the maximum residual gas saturation sgr max was calculated using the empirical formula proposed by holtz 2002 which has been widely used in previous studies on co2 storage gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017c ershadnia et al 2021 4 s gr max 0 969 φ 0 5473 for relative permeability the brooks corey relation in the form proposed by dullien 1992 was used to calculate the relative permeability curves 5 k rw s s wi 1 s wi n w 6 k rg k rg s wi 1 s s wi 1 s gr s wi 2 1 s s wi 1 s gr s wi n g where s is the water saturation nw and ng are the pore size distribution index for water and co2 and were assigned values of 5 and 4 respectively following krevor et al 2012 krg swi is the maximum gas relative permeability when s is equal to swi and was assigned values of 0 95 and 0 65 for high permeable and low permeable facies respectively following gershenzon et al 2015 sgr is the residual gas saturation which was assigned as 0 for the drainage curve and as sgr max for the boundary imbibition curve fig 3a in eclipse 300 simulation killough s hysteresis model was selected to calculate the history dependent imbibition curve for non wetting phase i e the relative permeability hysteresis for capillary pressure the brooks corey relation was used to calculate the drainage curves brooks and corey 1966 7 p c p e s s wi 1 s wi 1 λ where pe is the capillary entry pressure and λ is the pore size distribution index for the brooks corey model for high permeable facies pe and λ were assigned values of 0 046 bar and 0 55 respectively following krevor et al 2012 for low permeable pe was scaled based on the leverett j function as proposed by saadatpoor et al 2010 8 p e nr p e r k nr φ r k r φ nr 0 5 where the superscripts of r and nr represent high permeable and low permeable facies respectively for imbibition process an analog curve to drainage has been used as the boundary imbibition curve following gershenzon et al 2015 for each facies the imbibition curve and the drainage curve cross the saturation axis at s 1 s gr max and s 1 respectively while their other segments are same fig 3b in the eclipse 300 simulations the water compressibility was assigned a value of 4 35 10 5 bar following gershenzon et al 2017c three components are included in the simulations i e h2o co2 and nacl with the initial mole fractions of 0 95 0 and 0 05 respectively the mutual solubility of h2o and co2 was obtained based on fugacity equilibration between water and co2 following the method proposed by spycher and pruess 2005 the water diffusion coefficients for all components are 0 0001 and the gas diffusion coefficients for water and co2 are 0 001 following gershenzon et al 2017c the initial reservoir temperature and the equilibrium pressure at a datum depth of 2 000 m are 80 and 250 bar respectively for co2 injection a vertical injection well is located in the model center model cells 25 25 0 to 25 25 50 and is open in the lower half model cells 25 25 26 to 25 25 50 the maximum injection rate of co2 is 5 48 105 kg day and the default value of the maximum bottom hole pressure is 600 bar in the co2store option the injection stage is ten years with the maximum total mass of injected co2 of two million tons mt followed by the one hundred year post injection period for boundary conditions the top and bottom boundaries and the peripheral sides were set as no flow boundaries to represent a close system however the injected co2 has not crossed or even approached the peripheral boundaries this indicates that the model domain is large enough that the peripheral boundary conditions do not significantly affect co2 migration 3 3 selection of optimal lithofacies associations for co2 storage multi criteria decision making mcdm deals with finding results in complex scenarios including conflicting objectives and criteria kumar et al 2017 which has been applied to different aspects of the ccs chain such as barrier analysis sara et al 2015 and site selection for co2 storage llamas and cienfuegos 2012 alcalde et al 2021 sun et al 2021a in this study the mcdm method called the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to quantify the overall suitability of different lithofacies associations for co2 storage four aspects six criteria of co2 storage were included in this assessment including ratio of theoretical storage volume injectivity average bottom hole pressure total mass of injected co2 distribution proportion of cells percolated by injected co2 proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer and phases proportion of free co2 of co2 an ideal lithofacies association should have a large storage volume a low bottom hole pressure a large mass of injected co2 a large proportion of percolated cells a low proportion of co2 in the top model layer and a low proportion of free co2 all parameters were normalized and weighted based on the following method 9 y ij x ij w j i 1 n x ij 2 where y is the normalized and weighted value x is the actual value w is the weighting of each criterion and i and j are the number of model scenarios and criteria respectively in this study an equal weighting scenario was applied when assessing the suitability of different lithofacies associations i e 0 25 of weighting for storage capacity injectivity distribution and co2 phases respectively certainly the criteria can be unequally considered using different weightings based on practical conditions in different projects and studies a pair of positive and negative ideal solutions were hypothesized based on the best and worst values for each criterion finally the distances between each model scenario to the positive d and negative d ideal solutions were calculated which were used to calculate the topsis score ts fig 4 from sun et al 2021a 10 t s d d d the model scenario with the minimum topsis score will be selected as the optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage 4 results 4 1 reservoir models and storage volume from model scenarios 1 to 11 facies models present a decreasing fraction thickness and width and increasing tortuosity of high permeable facies fluvial channel deposits and an increasing fraction and size of low permeable facies overbank deposits as shown in fig 5 a model scenario 3 can represent the lap in fig 2b and is dominated by thick wide and well connected high permeable facies 80 resulting in an overall high reservoir quality in contrast low permeable facies present a low fraction 20 small size and isolated distribution in this model fig 5a as shown in fig 5c model scenario 7 can represent the lamd in fig 2e and consists of major low permeable facies 60 and minor high permeable facies 40 causing an overall low reservoir quality high permeable facies appear with relatively small size and are compartmentalized by large low permeable facies to a great extent fig 5c model scenario 5 in fig 5b can represent the lapm in fig 2d and shows a moderate fraction size and connectivity of high permeable facies between that of the lap and the lamd with a decreasing fraction of high permeable facies from model scenarios 1 to 11 the ratio of the theoretical storage volume to the total rock volume calculated by the volumetric method gradually reduces from 21 5 to 9 6 fig 6 a 4 2 co2 injectivity in this study co2 injectivity is analyzed using two proxies i e the bottom hole pressure bhp and the total mass of injected co2 fig 6b c co2 injectivity reduces with decreasing permeability thickness and connectivity of reservoirs bhp increases with decreasing injectivity and determines the total mass of injected co2 when bph reaches the upper limit during the injection stage a default value of 600 bar in eclipse from model scenarios 1 to 11 the average bhp presents a gradual increment from 289 to 600 bar due to the declining reservoir quality and connectivity fig 6b for model scenarios 1 to 7 bhp remains lower than 350 bar and the average bhp shows a slight increment for model scenarios 8 and 9 bhp remains lower than 500 bar but the average bhp increases significantly in scenarios 1 to 9 co2 is injected at the maximum injection rate possible 5 48 105 kg of co2 day resulting in the storage of the maximum co2 mass available 2 mt fig 6c for model scenarios 10 and 11 bhp remains at the upper limit throughout the injection stage fig 6b due to the very low reservoir quality causing a significant reduction of the total injected co2 to 0 7 mt and 0 6 mt respectively fig 6c these results indicate that co2 injectivity gradually decreases from scenarios 1 to 11 but at a distinct rate 4 3 co2 distribution co2 distribution is analyzed here by studying two aspects of the simulation results the proportion of cells percolated by the injected co2 and the proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer fig 6d e the proportion of swept cells presents an increase from 2 8 to 3 9 in model scenarios 1 to 4 an overall slight reduction in scenarios 4 to 9 and a sharp reduction to 2 2 and 2 0 in scenarios 10 and 11 fig 6d due to lower mass of injected co2 input into the system fig 6c the proportion of co2 reaching the top model layer shows a significant decrease from 20 1 to 0 9 from model scenarios 1 to 4 and remains at low values in scenarios 4 to 9 fig 6e this proportion increases to 3 0 from scenarios 9 to 11 as shown in the vertical cross sections and the top horizontal cross sections of co2 saturation at the end of the post injection period different lithofacies associations present distinct distribution patterns of the injected co2 fig 7 for the lap fig 7a the co2 plume is dominated by vertical migration with limited lateral migration due to the well connected reservoirs in the vertical direction most co2 accumulates in the upper half of the model with much co2 reaching the top model layer for the lapm fig 7b co2 migration in the horizontal direction is larger than that of the lap due to the vertical seepage barriers of low permeable layers resulting in a larger co2 plume most co2 maintains in the lower half model with a very small proportion of co2 migrating to the top model layer compared to the lapm the lamd features smaller co2 migration in the horizontal direction due to its smaller reservoir size and a weaker lateral connectivity the lamd features a smaller co2 plume than that of the lapm but larger than that of the lap fig 7c furthermore most co2 maintains in the lower half model and very limited co2 migrates to the top model layer 4 4 co2 phases co2 phase states free residual and dissolved phases vary with time in different model scenarios initially all injected co2 is in free phase during the injection stage first ten years free and dissolved co2 phases increase significantly over time while a very small amount of co2 occurs as residual phase fig 8 in the early post injection stage ten years to around 10 000 days residually trapped co2 increases rapidly while dissolved co2 increases slowly with free co2 being reduced dramatically subsequently the three co2 phases show similar trends as in the early post injection stage but at much lower rates for free and residual co2 phases although most residual trapping occurs during the post injection stage a small amount still occurs during the injection stage fig 8 this is mainly because of imbibition occurring in heterogeneous reservoirs even during the injection period because of the different relative permeability characteristics of the different facies gershenzon et al 2017b the proportions of co2 in different phases at the end of the post injection stage vary in the different model scenarios fig 9 the proportions of free co2 decrease to the minimum value of 22 8 from model scenarios 1 to 4 and then increase to the maximum value of 32 2 from scenarios 4 to 8 and finally reduce again in scenarios 9 to 11 from model scenarios 1 to 11 the proportions of residual co2 maintain at relatively high values of around 56 in first four scenarios then present a continuous reduction to the minimum value of 48 0 and finally an overall increment the proportions of dissolved co2 increase from 14 9 to 21 6 from scenarios 1 to 4 subsequently the proportions decrease and remain at around 19 6 which increase significantly in scenarios 10 and 11 the lap features relatively high proportions of residual co2 low but increasing dissolved co2 and thus decreasing free co2 with increasing fractions of low permeable facies fig 9 the lapm presents relatively high proportions of dissolved co2 decreasing residual co2 and thus increasing free co2 with increasing low permeable facies in turn the lamd shows moderate proportions of dissolved co2 low residual co2 and thus overall high free co2 4 5 optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage the optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage can be selected based on the consideration of the aforementioned four aspects six criteria i e storage volume the ratio of theoretical storage volume co2 injectivity the average bhp the total mass of injected co2 co2 distribution the proportion of cells percolated by injected co2 the proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer and co2 phases the proportion of free co2 because none of the model scenarios ranks high in all six criteria the topsis method can be an effective way to quantitatively evaluate the overall suitability of each lithofacies association for co2 storage as shown in table 3 the topsis scores present first a reduction and then an increment from model scenarios 1 to 11 model scenarios 4 to 6 with the relatively low topsis scores are the potential lithofacies associations for co2 storage this indicates that the suitability of the lapm for co2 storage is higher than that of the lap lamd and lad lithofacies associations 5 discussion based on the systematic analysis of the storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 as well as the multi criteria decision making assessment results this section discusses the overall effects of fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage and compares our study of the reservoir analog in the puig reig anticline with other real projects of co2 storage worldwide the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations lap model scenarios 1 to 3 present an overall high reservoir quality and connectivity in both the vertical and horizontal directions fig 5a the advantages of these lithofacies associations for co2 storage are the high storage volumes and injectivity fig 6a c however the co2 plume is dominated by vertical migration with limited lateral displacement due to the lack of effective seepage barriers in the vertical direction fig 7a a large proportion of co2 14 6 20 1 migrates to the top model layer and is in direct contact with the upper caprocks which could increase the leakage risk with the accumulating buoyancy force of co2 plume thus the storage security in these lithofacies associations depends on the caprock integrity espinoza and santamarina 2017 iglauer 2018 in the lap the high vertical reservoir connectivity promotes vertical migration of the co2 plume once the co2 injection ceases a large amount of brine imbibes and replaces co2 at the plume tail resulting in relatively high proportions of residual co2 in pore spaces than other lithofacies associations fig 9 moreover with increasing fractions of low permeable facies in the lap from 0 to 20 in model scenarios 1 to 3 the co2 plume is characterized by a wider lateral migration while maintaining the vertical migration resulting in increasing proportions of model cells percolated by the injected co2 fig 6d and thus higher proportions of dissolved co2 fig 9 therefore the high proportions of residual co2 and increasing proportions of dissolved co2 result in the overall decreasing proportions of free co2 from scenarios 1 to 3 29 4 to 24 6 fig 9 as indicated by the topsis ranking results table 3 the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations show higher potential for co2 storage with increasing portions of low permeable facies the proximal medial lithofacies associations lapm model scenarios 4 to 6 show relatively lower reservoir quality and connectivity than those of the lap fig 5b although these lithofacies associations have lower theoretical storage volumes fig 6a the co2 injectivity to them only shows a very slight reduction fig 6b c due to the seepage barriers in the vertical direction most of the injected co2 stays in the lower half model with limited co2 migrating to the uppermost model layer 0 1 to 0 9 this indicates that there is a lower leakage risk of co2 through caprocks compared to the lap the lapm features a wider lateral migration while maintaining the vertical migration resulting in a larger co2 plume as shown in fig 6d and fig 7b thus the lapm is characterized by relatively high proportions of dissolved co2 than other lithofacies associations fig 9 due to a larger swept area by co2 fig 6d in the lapm with increasing fractions of low permeable facies from 30 to 50 in model scenarios 4 to 6 dissolved co2 decreases due to a slightly reducing swept area besides brine imbibition is restricted at the co2 plume tail due to the vertical obstruction of co2 migration by the vertical flow barriers resulting in decreasing residual co2 therefore the decreasing proportions of dissolved and residual co2 together lead to increasing proportions of free co2 22 8 to 31 1 fig 9 in terms of co2 distribution and phases scenario 4 is the most suitable lithofacies association for co2 storage as indicated by the topsis ranking results table 3 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies show lower potential for co2 storage with increasing low permeable portions compared to the lap and lapm the medial distal lithofacies associations lamd model scenarios 7 to 9 present lower reservoir quality and connectivity fig 5c resulting in lower theoretical storage volume and injectivity although very limited co2 migrates to the top model layer 0 4 0 5 the relatively high injection pressure could potentially damage the well integrity bai et al 2016 gholami et al 2021 and the rock integrity rutqvist et al 2008 li et al 2022 which would result in a leakage risk increase the lamd features high fractions of low permeable facies and thus low vertical and lateral reservoir connectivity in the lamd the vertical obstruction of co2 migration caused by the flow barriers leads to relatively weak brine imbibition and thus low proportions of residual co2 besides the slightly smaller swept area of co2 results in the overall lower dissolved co2 than that of the lapm these together lead to relatively high proportions of free co2 29 5 32 2 fig 9 as indicated by the topsis ranking table 3 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies show lower potential for co2 storage with increasing non reservoir portions based on the above analyses the lapm especially with an appropriate fraction of low permeable facies ranging from 30 to 40 would be the more promising targets for co2 storage compared to the lap and lamd lithofacies associations in fluvial systems although simulation results can slightly vary using different simulation scenarios such as different co2 injection scenarios or seepage parameters the take home message is that the effects of heterogeneous fluvial reservoir architectures on the efficiency of co2 geological storage are not monotonic but variable and that reservoirs with moderate heterogeneous architectures can be beneficial for co2 storage as one of the main deposit systems of clastic sediments especially at the margins of non marine foreland basins fluvial fans are widely developed worldwide horton and decelles 2001 ventra and clarke 2018 many candidate reservoirs for co2 geological storage are located in reservoir systems characterized by fluvial sediments several real projects have been deployed in these fluvial sequences such as the frio project the frio formation hovorka et al 2006 the cranfield project the tuscaloosa formation soltanian et al 2019 and the decatur project the mount simon sandstone in the united states finley 2014 as well as the co2crc otway project the waarre formation in australia dance 2013 these fluvial deposits tend to present heterogeneous reservoir architectures at multiple scales which exert significant effects on co2 storage in terms of small scale fluvial stratigraphic architectures such as cross bedding previous studies demonstrated that this reservoir architecture affects the distribution and phases of the injected co2 especially residual and dissolved phases gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017a b c ershadnia et al 2020 2021 for large scale fluvial stratigraphic architectures several works documented that reservoir architectures control the storage capacity of co2 issautier et al 2014 2016 vo thanh et al 2020 focusing on varied fluvial lithofacies associations this study demonstrates that varied lithofacies associations not only control the storage capacity of co2 but also the distribution and phases of the injected co2 thus the safety of co2 storage although the increasing fractions of non reservoir layers can result in decreasing storage volumes and injectivity of co2 they can prevent the direct contact between the co2 plume and caprocks and reduce the proportions of free co2 phase under certain circumstances thus reducing the leakage risks of the injected co2 previous studies and our works imply that static and dynamic modeling approaches integrating multiscale architectures of fluvial reservoirs are required for future assessments of such systems heterogeneous reservoir architectures are not only present in fluvial deposition systems but also in other clastic rocks and carbonate rocks and thus affect the efficiency of co2 storage in these reservoir systems for example in the sleipner project operating since 1996 the first commercial co2 storage project more than 20 mt of co2 has been injected into the utsira sand global ccs institute 2020 these deposits were deposited in marine environments i e turbidite fans or shallow shelfs chadwick et al 2004 the utsira sand is dominated by high quality sandstone reservoirs with limited thin mudstone layers generally around one meter except for a single 5 m thick layer close to the reservoir top chadwick et al 2004 due to the existence of thin mudstone layers the co plume generally presents laterally extensive accumulations under seepage barriers which are clearly shown by time lapse 4d seismic profiles chadwick et al 2005 ghosh et al 2015 however the erosion or faulting causes the local absence of the seepage barriers and result in the remigration of the accumulated co2 to the thick mudstone layer and even the reservoir top zweigel et al 2004 thus the small number of mudstone layers can improve the lateral migration of the co2 plume and delay the time for the injected co2 to reach the reservoir top to a small extent which is similar to the situation of proximal fluvial lithofacies associations in this study in summary the effect of the mudstone seepage barriers on the efficiency of co2 storage depends on the fraction and distribution of the mudstone layers this study provides a methodology and process for selecting the optimal lithofacies associations for co2 storage 6 conclusions reservoirs of fluvial origins are characterized by heterogeneous stratigraphic architectures at different scales the fluvial sedimentary heterogeneities not only control the co2 storage capacity but also provide clues about the safety of co2 storage based on a multidisciplinary approach that integrates a field based sedimentology study static reservoir modeling and numerical simulation of co2 injection the overall effects of variable fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage of a fluvial reservoir analog at the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain has been evaluated the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations are dominated by large channel filling reservoirs with limited overbank non reservoir deposits these associations are characterized by a large theoretical storage volume good reservoir injectivity and an overall low fraction of free co2 however a high fraction of co2 would quickly migrate toward the reservoir tops in direct contact with the top seal increasing the leakage risk the medial distal fluvial lithofacies associations consist of interbedded reservoir bodies and non reservoir barriers with much lower reservoir fractions these associations can significantly hinder the upward migration of co2 preventing it from reaching the reservoir tops however they feature a low theoretical storage volume low reservoir injectivity and a relatively high fraction of free co2 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations with moderately heterogeneous architecture are better suited for co2 storage when considering the storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 comprehensively the heterogeneous architectures of fluvial reservoirs can exert significant but variable effects on the efficiency of co2 storage although the specific values of static and dynamic modeling results could potentially change according to different geological settings or simulation scenarios it is concluded that reservoirs with moderate heterogeneous architectures appear to be better targets for co2 geological storage compared with homogenous reservoirs when selecting co2 storage sites it is recommended that reservoir quality caprock integrity and heterogeneous reservoir architectures should all be considered credit authorship contribution statement xiaolong sun

2477,fluvial system deposits often form suitable reservoirs for co2 geological storage cgs these potential storage sites usually present heterogeneous fluvial architectures at multiple scales this heterogeneity can exert varied effects on different aspects of cgs resulting in significant storage efficiency variability here we investigate the effects of variable fluvial lithofacies associations on co2 storage using the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain as a reservoir analog to test this we employ a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field sedimentology reservoir modeling and numerical simulation of co2 injection to produce models akin to different fluvial lithofacies associations the storage volume and injectivity of co2 are found to decrease in reservoirs with decreasing fractions and sizes of high permeable facies from the proximal to the medial distal lithofacies associations the flow barriers created by low permeable facies can hinder the vertical migration of the co2 plume and prevent it from reaching the reservoir top hence reducing the direct contact between the co2 plume and the overlying caprock furthermore an optimal amount of low permeable layers around 30 in this study can increase the swept area of co2 and reduce the proportions of free co2 phase these aspects can collectively increase the amount of permanently trapped co2 and reduce the leakage risks of the injected co2 based on the characteristics of the resulting models i e storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 a multi criteria decision making method has been used to quantitatively rank the different lithofacies associations according to their suitability for co2 storage in this analysis the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations are assessed to be the most suitable ones because they feature low proportions of the injected co2 reaching the reservoir top and in free phase while maintaining the high storage volume and injectivity this study reveals that heterogeneous reservoir architectures have mixed effects on co2 storage and that reservoirs featuring moderately heterogeneous architectures i e fractions of low permeable facies ranging from 30 to 40 are beneficial to keeping the balance among different aspects of co2 storage this provides new insights for the screening and selection of potential geological sites for co2 storage keywords co2 geological storage trapping mechanism reservoir heterogeneity fluvial lithofacies association data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to date 194 parties have submitted their nationally determined contributions ndc to the paris agreement to describe their strategies for climate change mitigation unfccc 2022 among these more than forty countries mention carbon capture and storage ccs explicitly in their national climate change mitigation pathways sun et al 2021a although ccs has been widely considered an important technology for greenhouse gas reduction alcalde et al 2018 bui et al 2018 ipcc 2018 particularly to decarbonize industrial emissions there is a huge gap between the current global ccs deployment and that which will be ultimately required to achieve the global mitigation targets global ccs institute 2018 sun et al 2020 ccs deployment has stalled in most countries due to various barriers scott et al 2013 such as a high development cost perception lack of market mechanisms and incentives potential safety and environmental issues leung et al 2014 budinis et al 2018 alcalde et al 2019 tcvetkov et al 2019 and low public acceptance seigo et al 2014 witte 2021 ensuring the safety and efficiency of the co2 geological storage cgs operations is essential to make ccs commercially and environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable once the captured co2 is injected into a geological reservoir different trapping mechanisms i e structural residual dissolution and mineralization trapping act on it at different rates to keep the co2 trapped in the subsurface bachu et al 2007 shukla et al 2010 de silva and ranjith 2012 structural trapping dominates the early storage stage first decades and depends on the caprock integrity to resist the injection pressure during the injection stage and the buoyancy pressure in the early post injection period shukla et al 2010 espinoza and santamarina 2017 iglauer 2018 the other trapping mechanisms do not rely on caprock efficiency but on the physical chemical interactions between fluids and or rocks these mechanisms are controlled by various factors including temperature pressure fluid and rock compositions wettability and pore structure among others riaz and cinar 2014 raza et al 2015 romanov et al 2015 mineralization trapping is considered the safest mechanism but its action is limited in most candidate reservoirs even after thousands of years except in reservoirs with sufficient divalent cation bearing minerals and rapid dissolution rates of these minerals zhang et al 2013 zhang and depaolo 2017 under these circumstances capillary trapping and dissolution trapping mechanisms play a critical role in ensuring storage security in the short medium term tens to hundreds of years apart from engineering factors such as the combination of injected fluids injection rate and well configuration raza et al 2015 al khdheeawi et al 2017a 2018 ren and jeong 2018 the geological characteristics of the reservoir determine co2 trapping efficiency for instance heterogeneous fluvial architectures lithofacies and their associations not only control the co2 storage capacity and injectivity ambrose et al 2008 issautier et al 2014 2016 but also the spatial distribution and fractions of different co2 phases gershenzon et al 2015 ershadnia et al 2021 2022 previous studies suggest that most regions have sufficient geological storage capacity for co2 kearns et al 2017 ringrose and meckel 2019 sun et al 2020 indicating that this does not seem to be a limiting factor for cgs deployment however having a high storage capacity is still a primary requirement in the selection of suitable sites sufficient storage capacity helps to guarantee that the selected storage site is economically viable by reducing the unit cost while increasing stored co2 shares similar capital costs i e the economy of scale alcalde et al 2019 2021 the presence of low porosity and permeability deposits within the target reservoir e g in the form of overbank deposits in fluvial systems can reduce the storage capacity and thus the trapping efficiency furthermore with the increasing fraction of these flow barriers the overall reservoir mainly channel deposits quality and connectivity deteriorate this results in decreasing reservoir injectivity such as a lower injection rate at a given injection pressure or a higher injection pressure to maintain a certain injection rate excessive injection pressure can potentially damage well bores bai et al 2016 gholami et al 2021 and rock integrity rutqvist et al 2008 li et al 2022 thus resulting in leakage risk heterogeneous deposits can also create asymmetric distributions of the injected co2 xu et al 2020 kou et al 2021 the different lithofacies forming a heterogeneous reservoir may present varying capillary pressure values which can locally produce areas of enhanced capillary trapping these areas may develop larger gas saturation than the residual gas saturation saadatpoor et al 2010 krevor et al 2011 and can prevent co2 migration towards the caprock the larger this contrast in capillary pressure is the larger the proportion of local capillary trapping can be produced gershenzon et al 2017c however local capillary trapping can partially fail to retain the co2 in the reservoir due to the accumulated buoyancy forces acting on the co2 plume or completely fail due to rock fracturing the influence of fluvial stratigraphic architectures on residual and dissolution trapping mechanisms has been extensively investigated gershenzon et al 2015 for example due to the heterogeneous relative permeability in different lithofacies a small amount of residual trapping occurs during the injection stage in addition to the large proportion existing in the post injection period gershenzon et al 2017b compared to relatively homogeneous reservoirs dominated by the vertical migration of the co2 plume with limited lateral migration the co2 plume in heterogeneous reservoirs can propagate farther in the horizontal direction due to the existence of low permeable layers in the vertical direction this can result in a larger contact area between the co2 plume and the pore filling brine leading to a larger ratio of dissolution trapping gershenzon et al 2015 2016 larger contrast in permeability between different rock types can increase the volume of the co2 plume increasing the efficiency of dissolution and residual trapping mechanisms gershenzon et al 2017c this prevents the co2 plume migration to caprocks or surfaces and thus reduces the risk of co2 leakage however reservoir heterogeneity can also produce other effects on the storage performance such as a reduction in sweeping efficiency of the co2 plume produced by low permeable units yang et al 2020 although the reservoir heterogeneity can enhance the lateral flow of the co2 plume it also may inhibit the vertical migration of co2 thus the effects of reservoir heterogeneity on co2 plume migration and co2 phases depend on the specific reservoir structure an overall decrease in sweeping efficiency of the co2 plume caused by the presence of a high fraction of flow barriers can also reduce the efficiency of residual trapping han et al 2010 and dissolution trapping al khdheeawi et al 2017b in summary heterogeneous reservoir architectures exert significant but varied effects on different aspects of co2 storage compared to relatively homogeneous reservoirs heterogeneous reservoir architectures generally feature lower storage capacity and injectivity for co2 however under certain circumstances the presence of low permeable layers can hinder the vertical migration of the co2 plume and reduce the fraction of free co2 in the pores which can reduce the risk of co2 leakage it is still controversial whether heterogeneous reservoir architectures can enhance the overall efficiency of co2 storage in this study we use the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain as a heterogeneous fluvial reservoir analog based on the previous field studies on outcrop sedimentology and reservoir characteristics cruset et al 2016 sun et al 2021b c 2022 we summarize the sedimentary and reservoir characteristics of typical lithofacies associations through systematic reservoir modeling and numerical simulating this study aims to determine the overall effects of different fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage based on a comprehensive consideration of storage capacity injectivity distribution and phases of co2 2 sedimentology background the puig reig anticline is located in the se pyrenean fold and thrust belt spain fig 1 a and developed along the footwall of the frontal vallfogona thrust emplaced over the ebro foreland basin fig 1b vergés 1993 this anticline is a km scale gentle anticline with a flat hinge its upper part is characterized by the berga group and the solsona formation deposited from alluvial fluvial systems during the late eocene and the oligocene williams et al 1998 barrier et al 2010 this study focuses on the well exposed and well preserved outcrops of the middle berga group and the solsona formation along several roads in the puig reig anticline fig 1c d these sequences were interpreted as the result of sedimentation in a proximal to medial fluvial system and present gradual changes of lithofacies associations from the foreland basin margin inwards sun et al 2021b the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations lap represent sedimentary environments of unconfined flash floods and wide shallow channel streams and are characterized by major conglomerates and minor coarse medium sandstones with limited fine deposits fig 2 a b the medial fluvial deposits represent sedimentary environments of channel streams and overbank areas and include the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations lapm and the medial distal fluvial lithofacies associations lamd the lapm is characterized by interbedded conglomerates coarse medium sandstones and fine deposits fig 2c d the lamd consists of coarse medium sandstones and more fine deposits fig 2e f the distal fluvial deposits lad are located southward of our study area and are composed of terminal lobes or fluvial dominated deltas and interdistributary bays sáez et al 2007 3 methodology 3 1 reservoir modeling reservoir models have been built using the petrel e p software platform by schlumberger the three dimensional model size is 5000 m 5000 m 50 m with 125 000 cells with a size of 100 m 100 m 1 m each for each lithofacies association lithofacies have been grouped in the lower high permeable facies of fluvial channel deposits and the upper low permeable facies of overbank deposits high permeable facies consist of conglomerates and coarse medium sandstones and low permeable facies consist of mudstones siltstones and fine sandstones the fractions and thicknesses of high permeable facies were measured from the studied outcrops the lap is generally characterized by a high fraction 80 and large thickness 8 m of high permeable facies compared to the lap the lapm features a lower fraction and smaller thickness of high permeable facies the lamd is generally characterized by a relatively low fraction 40 and small thickness 4 m of high permeable facies to represent the gradual changes of geometric characteristics from proximal to distal fluvial lithofacies associations ideal model scenarios were designed with regularly decreasing fractions and thickness of high permeable facies table 1 the width thickness ratio of high permeable facies was assigned as a constant value of 100 to represent general fluvial channels gibling 2006 the channel tortuosity defined as the ratio of the channel length to the direct axial length was assigned gradually increasing values from 1 08 to 1 40 to represent the generally increasing channel tortuosity from proximal to distal fluvial systems friend and sinha 1993 in total 11 model scenarios were designed with model scenarios 1 to 3 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 representing the lap lapm and lamd of the puig reig anticline respectively and scenarios 10 and 11 representing the lad outside this anticline for each model scenario a facies model was created using the object modeling algorithm based on the geometric characteristics of different facies this method can create a stochastic facies model and present the representative geometric characteristics of reservoirs especially fluvial channels the fluvial channel object was used as the high permeable facies using the aforementioned geometric parameters because all sediments have been grouped into two categories of facies the low permeable facies was set as the background object to fill the remaining model space between the fluvial channel objects abundant fractures developed in these fluvial deposits in the puig reig anticline sun et al 2021c were not included in the subsequent petrophysical modeling because it is out of the scope of this study focusing on the effects of different fluvial lithofacies associations on co2 storage for each facies model a porosity model was created using the gaussian random function algorithm because this method can create a facies controlled porosity model constrained by the geometric characteristics of the high permeable and low permeable facies for all model scenarios theoretical porosity ranges were set as 0 2 to 0 3 for high permeable facies and 0 1 to 0 2 for low permeable facies these porosity ranges can represent relatively high quality reservoirs which are the prior targets for cgs at the present stage due to their larger storage capacity and higher injectivity than low porosity reservoirs permeability k and irreducible water saturation swi were calculated using the empirical formulas proposed by holtz 2002 which have been widely used and proved to be effective for co2 storage simulation in fluvial sequences by previous studies gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017c ershadnia et al 2021 horizontal permeability was calculated from porosity φ using the empirical formula holtz 2002 while vertical permeability was calculated based on a ratio of vertical k to horizontal k of 0 2 to represent the permeability anisotropy in sedimentary rocks 1 k 7 10 7 φ 9 61 based on the average porosity and permeability the average swi was calculated using the empirical formula holtz 2002 for high permeable and low permeable facies respectively table 2 2 s wi 5 159 log k φ 1 559 the ratio r of the theoretical storage volume vr to the total rock volume vt of each model scenario was calculated using a volumetric method 3 r v r v t φ 1 s wi 3 2 numerical simulation of co2 storage reservoir simulations of 11 model scenarios were carried out using the eclipse 300 numerical simulator by schlumberger with the co2store option eclipse 300 is fully compatible with petrel and it is a multi dimensional compositional simulator with a cubic equation of state pressure dependent permeability or black oil fluid treatment class et al 2009 schlumberger 2018 its co2store option can simulate different cgs processes and consider free residual and dissolved co2 phases which have been widely used in co2 injection simulation in previous studies gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017b abbaszadeh et al 2020 these co2 phases represent the main co2 trapping mechanisms acting in the relatively short medium period injection stage to a few hundred years and determine whether the injected co2 will remain within the reservoir for subsequent mineralization trapping in the longer term based on different model scenarios reservoir simulations in this study aim to determine the overall effects of different lithofacies associations on the injectivity distribution and co2 phases the key parameters for reservoir simulations are summarized in table 2 considering the distinct physical properties of the high and low permeable facies different relative permeability curves and capillary pressure curves were used fig 3 the facies based curves were used instead of totally scaled cell based curves because the latter would significantly increase simulation time making it impractical for their use in large 3d models based on the average porosity of each facies the maximum residual gas saturation sgr max was calculated using the empirical formula proposed by holtz 2002 which has been widely used in previous studies on co2 storage gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017c ershadnia et al 2021 4 s gr max 0 969 φ 0 5473 for relative permeability the brooks corey relation in the form proposed by dullien 1992 was used to calculate the relative permeability curves 5 k rw s s wi 1 s wi n w 6 k rg k rg s wi 1 s s wi 1 s gr s wi 2 1 s s wi 1 s gr s wi n g where s is the water saturation nw and ng are the pore size distribution index for water and co2 and were assigned values of 5 and 4 respectively following krevor et al 2012 krg swi is the maximum gas relative permeability when s is equal to swi and was assigned values of 0 95 and 0 65 for high permeable and low permeable facies respectively following gershenzon et al 2015 sgr is the residual gas saturation which was assigned as 0 for the drainage curve and as sgr max for the boundary imbibition curve fig 3a in eclipse 300 simulation killough s hysteresis model was selected to calculate the history dependent imbibition curve for non wetting phase i e the relative permeability hysteresis for capillary pressure the brooks corey relation was used to calculate the drainage curves brooks and corey 1966 7 p c p e s s wi 1 s wi 1 λ where pe is the capillary entry pressure and λ is the pore size distribution index for the brooks corey model for high permeable facies pe and λ were assigned values of 0 046 bar and 0 55 respectively following krevor et al 2012 for low permeable pe was scaled based on the leverett j function as proposed by saadatpoor et al 2010 8 p e nr p e r k nr φ r k r φ nr 0 5 where the superscripts of r and nr represent high permeable and low permeable facies respectively for imbibition process an analog curve to drainage has been used as the boundary imbibition curve following gershenzon et al 2015 for each facies the imbibition curve and the drainage curve cross the saturation axis at s 1 s gr max and s 1 respectively while their other segments are same fig 3b in the eclipse 300 simulations the water compressibility was assigned a value of 4 35 10 5 bar following gershenzon et al 2017c three components are included in the simulations i e h2o co2 and nacl with the initial mole fractions of 0 95 0 and 0 05 respectively the mutual solubility of h2o and co2 was obtained based on fugacity equilibration between water and co2 following the method proposed by spycher and pruess 2005 the water diffusion coefficients for all components are 0 0001 and the gas diffusion coefficients for water and co2 are 0 001 following gershenzon et al 2017c the initial reservoir temperature and the equilibrium pressure at a datum depth of 2 000 m are 80 and 250 bar respectively for co2 injection a vertical injection well is located in the model center model cells 25 25 0 to 25 25 50 and is open in the lower half model cells 25 25 26 to 25 25 50 the maximum injection rate of co2 is 5 48 105 kg day and the default value of the maximum bottom hole pressure is 600 bar in the co2store option the injection stage is ten years with the maximum total mass of injected co2 of two million tons mt followed by the one hundred year post injection period for boundary conditions the top and bottom boundaries and the peripheral sides were set as no flow boundaries to represent a close system however the injected co2 has not crossed or even approached the peripheral boundaries this indicates that the model domain is large enough that the peripheral boundary conditions do not significantly affect co2 migration 3 3 selection of optimal lithofacies associations for co2 storage multi criteria decision making mcdm deals with finding results in complex scenarios including conflicting objectives and criteria kumar et al 2017 which has been applied to different aspects of the ccs chain such as barrier analysis sara et al 2015 and site selection for co2 storage llamas and cienfuegos 2012 alcalde et al 2021 sun et al 2021a in this study the mcdm method called the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis was used to quantify the overall suitability of different lithofacies associations for co2 storage four aspects six criteria of co2 storage were included in this assessment including ratio of theoretical storage volume injectivity average bottom hole pressure total mass of injected co2 distribution proportion of cells percolated by injected co2 proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer and phases proportion of free co2 of co2 an ideal lithofacies association should have a large storage volume a low bottom hole pressure a large mass of injected co2 a large proportion of percolated cells a low proportion of co2 in the top model layer and a low proportion of free co2 all parameters were normalized and weighted based on the following method 9 y ij x ij w j i 1 n x ij 2 where y is the normalized and weighted value x is the actual value w is the weighting of each criterion and i and j are the number of model scenarios and criteria respectively in this study an equal weighting scenario was applied when assessing the suitability of different lithofacies associations i e 0 25 of weighting for storage capacity injectivity distribution and co2 phases respectively certainly the criteria can be unequally considered using different weightings based on practical conditions in different projects and studies a pair of positive and negative ideal solutions were hypothesized based on the best and worst values for each criterion finally the distances between each model scenario to the positive d and negative d ideal solutions were calculated which were used to calculate the topsis score ts fig 4 from sun et al 2021a 10 t s d d d the model scenario with the minimum topsis score will be selected as the optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage 4 results 4 1 reservoir models and storage volume from model scenarios 1 to 11 facies models present a decreasing fraction thickness and width and increasing tortuosity of high permeable facies fluvial channel deposits and an increasing fraction and size of low permeable facies overbank deposits as shown in fig 5 a model scenario 3 can represent the lap in fig 2b and is dominated by thick wide and well connected high permeable facies 80 resulting in an overall high reservoir quality in contrast low permeable facies present a low fraction 20 small size and isolated distribution in this model fig 5a as shown in fig 5c model scenario 7 can represent the lamd in fig 2e and consists of major low permeable facies 60 and minor high permeable facies 40 causing an overall low reservoir quality high permeable facies appear with relatively small size and are compartmentalized by large low permeable facies to a great extent fig 5c model scenario 5 in fig 5b can represent the lapm in fig 2d and shows a moderate fraction size and connectivity of high permeable facies between that of the lap and the lamd with a decreasing fraction of high permeable facies from model scenarios 1 to 11 the ratio of the theoretical storage volume to the total rock volume calculated by the volumetric method gradually reduces from 21 5 to 9 6 fig 6 a 4 2 co2 injectivity in this study co2 injectivity is analyzed using two proxies i e the bottom hole pressure bhp and the total mass of injected co2 fig 6b c co2 injectivity reduces with decreasing permeability thickness and connectivity of reservoirs bhp increases with decreasing injectivity and determines the total mass of injected co2 when bph reaches the upper limit during the injection stage a default value of 600 bar in eclipse from model scenarios 1 to 11 the average bhp presents a gradual increment from 289 to 600 bar due to the declining reservoir quality and connectivity fig 6b for model scenarios 1 to 7 bhp remains lower than 350 bar and the average bhp shows a slight increment for model scenarios 8 and 9 bhp remains lower than 500 bar but the average bhp increases significantly in scenarios 1 to 9 co2 is injected at the maximum injection rate possible 5 48 105 kg of co2 day resulting in the storage of the maximum co2 mass available 2 mt fig 6c for model scenarios 10 and 11 bhp remains at the upper limit throughout the injection stage fig 6b due to the very low reservoir quality causing a significant reduction of the total injected co2 to 0 7 mt and 0 6 mt respectively fig 6c these results indicate that co2 injectivity gradually decreases from scenarios 1 to 11 but at a distinct rate 4 3 co2 distribution co2 distribution is analyzed here by studying two aspects of the simulation results the proportion of cells percolated by the injected co2 and the proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer fig 6d e the proportion of swept cells presents an increase from 2 8 to 3 9 in model scenarios 1 to 4 an overall slight reduction in scenarios 4 to 9 and a sharp reduction to 2 2 and 2 0 in scenarios 10 and 11 fig 6d due to lower mass of injected co2 input into the system fig 6c the proportion of co2 reaching the top model layer shows a significant decrease from 20 1 to 0 9 from model scenarios 1 to 4 and remains at low values in scenarios 4 to 9 fig 6e this proportion increases to 3 0 from scenarios 9 to 11 as shown in the vertical cross sections and the top horizontal cross sections of co2 saturation at the end of the post injection period different lithofacies associations present distinct distribution patterns of the injected co2 fig 7 for the lap fig 7a the co2 plume is dominated by vertical migration with limited lateral migration due to the well connected reservoirs in the vertical direction most co2 accumulates in the upper half of the model with much co2 reaching the top model layer for the lapm fig 7b co2 migration in the horizontal direction is larger than that of the lap due to the vertical seepage barriers of low permeable layers resulting in a larger co2 plume most co2 maintains in the lower half model with a very small proportion of co2 migrating to the top model layer compared to the lapm the lamd features smaller co2 migration in the horizontal direction due to its smaller reservoir size and a weaker lateral connectivity the lamd features a smaller co2 plume than that of the lapm but larger than that of the lap fig 7c furthermore most co2 maintains in the lower half model and very limited co2 migrates to the top model layer 4 4 co2 phases co2 phase states free residual and dissolved phases vary with time in different model scenarios initially all injected co2 is in free phase during the injection stage first ten years free and dissolved co2 phases increase significantly over time while a very small amount of co2 occurs as residual phase fig 8 in the early post injection stage ten years to around 10 000 days residually trapped co2 increases rapidly while dissolved co2 increases slowly with free co2 being reduced dramatically subsequently the three co2 phases show similar trends as in the early post injection stage but at much lower rates for free and residual co2 phases although most residual trapping occurs during the post injection stage a small amount still occurs during the injection stage fig 8 this is mainly because of imbibition occurring in heterogeneous reservoirs even during the injection period because of the different relative permeability characteristics of the different facies gershenzon et al 2017b the proportions of co2 in different phases at the end of the post injection stage vary in the different model scenarios fig 9 the proportions of free co2 decrease to the minimum value of 22 8 from model scenarios 1 to 4 and then increase to the maximum value of 32 2 from scenarios 4 to 8 and finally reduce again in scenarios 9 to 11 from model scenarios 1 to 11 the proportions of residual co2 maintain at relatively high values of around 56 in first four scenarios then present a continuous reduction to the minimum value of 48 0 and finally an overall increment the proportions of dissolved co2 increase from 14 9 to 21 6 from scenarios 1 to 4 subsequently the proportions decrease and remain at around 19 6 which increase significantly in scenarios 10 and 11 the lap features relatively high proportions of residual co2 low but increasing dissolved co2 and thus decreasing free co2 with increasing fractions of low permeable facies fig 9 the lapm presents relatively high proportions of dissolved co2 decreasing residual co2 and thus increasing free co2 with increasing low permeable facies in turn the lamd shows moderate proportions of dissolved co2 low residual co2 and thus overall high free co2 4 5 optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage the optimal lithofacies association for co2 storage can be selected based on the consideration of the aforementioned four aspects six criteria i e storage volume the ratio of theoretical storage volume co2 injectivity the average bhp the total mass of injected co2 co2 distribution the proportion of cells percolated by injected co2 the proportion of injected co2 reaching the top model layer and co2 phases the proportion of free co2 because none of the model scenarios ranks high in all six criteria the topsis method can be an effective way to quantitatively evaluate the overall suitability of each lithofacies association for co2 storage as shown in table 3 the topsis scores present first a reduction and then an increment from model scenarios 1 to 11 model scenarios 4 to 6 with the relatively low topsis scores are the potential lithofacies associations for co2 storage this indicates that the suitability of the lapm for co2 storage is higher than that of the lap lamd and lad lithofacies associations 5 discussion based on the systematic analysis of the storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 as well as the multi criteria decision making assessment results this section discusses the overall effects of fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage and compares our study of the reservoir analog in the puig reig anticline with other real projects of co2 storage worldwide the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations lap model scenarios 1 to 3 present an overall high reservoir quality and connectivity in both the vertical and horizontal directions fig 5a the advantages of these lithofacies associations for co2 storage are the high storage volumes and injectivity fig 6a c however the co2 plume is dominated by vertical migration with limited lateral displacement due to the lack of effective seepage barriers in the vertical direction fig 7a a large proportion of co2 14 6 20 1 migrates to the top model layer and is in direct contact with the upper caprocks which could increase the leakage risk with the accumulating buoyancy force of co2 plume thus the storage security in these lithofacies associations depends on the caprock integrity espinoza and santamarina 2017 iglauer 2018 in the lap the high vertical reservoir connectivity promotes vertical migration of the co2 plume once the co2 injection ceases a large amount of brine imbibes and replaces co2 at the plume tail resulting in relatively high proportions of residual co2 in pore spaces than other lithofacies associations fig 9 moreover with increasing fractions of low permeable facies in the lap from 0 to 20 in model scenarios 1 to 3 the co2 plume is characterized by a wider lateral migration while maintaining the vertical migration resulting in increasing proportions of model cells percolated by the injected co2 fig 6d and thus higher proportions of dissolved co2 fig 9 therefore the high proportions of residual co2 and increasing proportions of dissolved co2 result in the overall decreasing proportions of free co2 from scenarios 1 to 3 29 4 to 24 6 fig 9 as indicated by the topsis ranking results table 3 the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations show higher potential for co2 storage with increasing portions of low permeable facies the proximal medial lithofacies associations lapm model scenarios 4 to 6 show relatively lower reservoir quality and connectivity than those of the lap fig 5b although these lithofacies associations have lower theoretical storage volumes fig 6a the co2 injectivity to them only shows a very slight reduction fig 6b c due to the seepage barriers in the vertical direction most of the injected co2 stays in the lower half model with limited co2 migrating to the uppermost model layer 0 1 to 0 9 this indicates that there is a lower leakage risk of co2 through caprocks compared to the lap the lapm features a wider lateral migration while maintaining the vertical migration resulting in a larger co2 plume as shown in fig 6d and fig 7b thus the lapm is characterized by relatively high proportions of dissolved co2 than other lithofacies associations fig 9 due to a larger swept area by co2 fig 6d in the lapm with increasing fractions of low permeable facies from 30 to 50 in model scenarios 4 to 6 dissolved co2 decreases due to a slightly reducing swept area besides brine imbibition is restricted at the co2 plume tail due to the vertical obstruction of co2 migration by the vertical flow barriers resulting in decreasing residual co2 therefore the decreasing proportions of dissolved and residual co2 together lead to increasing proportions of free co2 22 8 to 31 1 fig 9 in terms of co2 distribution and phases scenario 4 is the most suitable lithofacies association for co2 storage as indicated by the topsis ranking results table 3 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies show lower potential for co2 storage with increasing low permeable portions compared to the lap and lapm the medial distal lithofacies associations lamd model scenarios 7 to 9 present lower reservoir quality and connectivity fig 5c resulting in lower theoretical storage volume and injectivity although very limited co2 migrates to the top model layer 0 4 0 5 the relatively high injection pressure could potentially damage the well integrity bai et al 2016 gholami et al 2021 and the rock integrity rutqvist et al 2008 li et al 2022 which would result in a leakage risk increase the lamd features high fractions of low permeable facies and thus low vertical and lateral reservoir connectivity in the lamd the vertical obstruction of co2 migration caused by the flow barriers leads to relatively weak brine imbibition and thus low proportions of residual co2 besides the slightly smaller swept area of co2 results in the overall lower dissolved co2 than that of the lapm these together lead to relatively high proportions of free co2 29 5 32 2 fig 9 as indicated by the topsis ranking table 3 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies show lower potential for co2 storage with increasing non reservoir portions based on the above analyses the lapm especially with an appropriate fraction of low permeable facies ranging from 30 to 40 would be the more promising targets for co2 storage compared to the lap and lamd lithofacies associations in fluvial systems although simulation results can slightly vary using different simulation scenarios such as different co2 injection scenarios or seepage parameters the take home message is that the effects of heterogeneous fluvial reservoir architectures on the efficiency of co2 geological storage are not monotonic but variable and that reservoirs with moderate heterogeneous architectures can be beneficial for co2 storage as one of the main deposit systems of clastic sediments especially at the margins of non marine foreland basins fluvial fans are widely developed worldwide horton and decelles 2001 ventra and clarke 2018 many candidate reservoirs for co2 geological storage are located in reservoir systems characterized by fluvial sediments several real projects have been deployed in these fluvial sequences such as the frio project the frio formation hovorka et al 2006 the cranfield project the tuscaloosa formation soltanian et al 2019 and the decatur project the mount simon sandstone in the united states finley 2014 as well as the co2crc otway project the waarre formation in australia dance 2013 these fluvial deposits tend to present heterogeneous reservoir architectures at multiple scales which exert significant effects on co2 storage in terms of small scale fluvial stratigraphic architectures such as cross bedding previous studies demonstrated that this reservoir architecture affects the distribution and phases of the injected co2 especially residual and dissolved phases gershenzon et al 2015 2016 2017a b c ershadnia et al 2020 2021 for large scale fluvial stratigraphic architectures several works documented that reservoir architectures control the storage capacity of co2 issautier et al 2014 2016 vo thanh et al 2020 focusing on varied fluvial lithofacies associations this study demonstrates that varied lithofacies associations not only control the storage capacity of co2 but also the distribution and phases of the injected co2 thus the safety of co2 storage although the increasing fractions of non reservoir layers can result in decreasing storage volumes and injectivity of co2 they can prevent the direct contact between the co2 plume and caprocks and reduce the proportions of free co2 phase under certain circumstances thus reducing the leakage risks of the injected co2 previous studies and our works imply that static and dynamic modeling approaches integrating multiscale architectures of fluvial reservoirs are required for future assessments of such systems heterogeneous reservoir architectures are not only present in fluvial deposition systems but also in other clastic rocks and carbonate rocks and thus affect the efficiency of co2 storage in these reservoir systems for example in the sleipner project operating since 1996 the first commercial co2 storage project more than 20 mt of co2 has been injected into the utsira sand global ccs institute 2020 these deposits were deposited in marine environments i e turbidite fans or shallow shelfs chadwick et al 2004 the utsira sand is dominated by high quality sandstone reservoirs with limited thin mudstone layers generally around one meter except for a single 5 m thick layer close to the reservoir top chadwick et al 2004 due to the existence of thin mudstone layers the co plume generally presents laterally extensive accumulations under seepage barriers which are clearly shown by time lapse 4d seismic profiles chadwick et al 2005 ghosh et al 2015 however the erosion or faulting causes the local absence of the seepage barriers and result in the remigration of the accumulated co2 to the thick mudstone layer and even the reservoir top zweigel et al 2004 thus the small number of mudstone layers can improve the lateral migration of the co2 plume and delay the time for the injected co2 to reach the reservoir top to a small extent which is similar to the situation of proximal fluvial lithofacies associations in this study in summary the effect of the mudstone seepage barriers on the efficiency of co2 storage depends on the fraction and distribution of the mudstone layers this study provides a methodology and process for selecting the optimal lithofacies associations for co2 storage 6 conclusions reservoirs of fluvial origins are characterized by heterogeneous stratigraphic architectures at different scales the fluvial sedimentary heterogeneities not only control the co2 storage capacity but also provide clues about the safety of co2 storage based on a multidisciplinary approach that integrates a field based sedimentology study static reservoir modeling and numerical simulation of co2 injection the overall effects of variable fluvial lithofacies associations on the efficiency of co2 storage of a fluvial reservoir analog at the puig reig anticline in the se pyrenees spain has been evaluated the proximal fluvial lithofacies associations are dominated by large channel filling reservoirs with limited overbank non reservoir deposits these associations are characterized by a large theoretical storage volume good reservoir injectivity and an overall low fraction of free co2 however a high fraction of co2 would quickly migrate toward the reservoir tops in direct contact with the top seal increasing the leakage risk the medial distal fluvial lithofacies associations consist of interbedded reservoir bodies and non reservoir barriers with much lower reservoir fractions these associations can significantly hinder the upward migration of co2 preventing it from reaching the reservoir tops however they feature a low theoretical storage volume low reservoir injectivity and a relatively high fraction of free co2 the proximal medial fluvial lithofacies associations with moderately heterogeneous architecture are better suited for co2 storage when considering the storage volume injectivity distribution and phases of co2 comprehensively the heterogeneous architectures of fluvial reservoirs can exert significant but variable effects on the efficiency of co2 storage although the specific values of static and dynamic modeling results could potentially change according to different geological settings or simulation scenarios it is concluded that reservoirs with moderate heterogeneous architectures appear to be better targets for co2 geological storage compared with homogenous reservoirs when selecting co2 storage sites it is recommended that reservoir quality caprock integrity and heterogeneous reservoir architectures should all be considered credit authorship contribution statement xiaolong sun

2478,plastic film mulching pfm in the cropland may alter biophysical conditions for crop growth which may not be accounted for in existing stomatal conductance models this can affect the accuracy of carbon nitrogen water cycle simulations for the soil crop systems and hamper our understanding of internal mechanisms that control plant leaf stomatal conductance gsw to evaluate the simulations of pfm effects on gsw the three models i e ball woodrow berry bwb ball berry leuning bbl and unified stomatal optimization uso models were used the two model modification factors were leaf air temperature difference δt and a water response function f θ a two year maize zea mays l field experiment was conducted under different pfm black transparent and no mulch the performance of the bwb model was poor under varying water status in the arid irrigation area as for the bbl and uso models the coefficient of determination and modified efficiency coefficient of the modified models increased 5 8 90 6 and 6 5 145 4 respectively compared with the initial models the root mean square error and relative error of the modified models decreased 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively the δt and f θ factors effectively improved the bbl and uso models but the f θ modified models performed better than δt modified models under pfm overall our results suggest that the maize land implemented with plastic film mulching has altered biophysical conditions leading to significant changes in crop photosynthesis leaf air temperature difference and top soil water conditions accurate estimates of stomatal conductance require the model to consider water response functions and leaf air temperature difference particularly in environmental conditions associated with different extents of water deficit or drought keywords plastic film mulching stomatal conductance model water response function leaf air temperature difference spring maize data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quantifying land surface exchange of carbon water and energy flux is essential for understanding how the land surface has interacted with the atmosphere for the present days and being used in the earth system model to make a future prediction in the agricultural land surface gas and energy exchanges are tightly associated with water use efficiency and crop productivity of agricultural ecosystems as plant stomata play an important role in regulating gas and energy exchange understanding and properly simulating stomatal behavior is critical to the study of land and atmosphere interactions and future climate change keisuke et al 2013 stomatal behavior is usually analyzed in two scales i e large scale and leaf scale for the large scale analyses stomatal responses to environmental perturbations can greatly affect plant performance agricultural production and global carbon and water cycles huang et al 2021 for leaf scale analyses stomata are transport channels for exchange of water and co2 fluxes between atmosphere and leaves in agricultural ecosystems and degrees of stomatal opening are often used to indicate how efficiently plants can assimilate co2 transpire water vapor and regulate both carbon and water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum stomatal controls of co2 uptake and water loss determine plant productivity and water use efficiency buckley and mott 2013 vialet chabrand et al 2017 accordingly stomatal conductance is often used as a physiological indicator of stomatal behavior regardless of spatial scales i e the regional or global level or the leaf level stomata continuously adjust aperture in response to external environmental factors and plant water status lin et al 2015 accurate simulation of the effects of environmental factors on stomatal conductance is an important prerequisite for the optimal regulation and management of the crop growth environment buckley and mott 2013 furthermore modeling the effect of environmental factor changes on stomatal conductance is crucial for understanding and predicting the consequences of global climate change on plant growth development and productivity zhou et al 2013 stomatal conductance models are not only been widely used for global climate models bonan et al 2014 kauwe et al 2015 but have been applied for specific ecosystems including rice fields keisuke et al 2013 maize lands wang et al 2018 forests medlyn et al 2011 and other ecosystems at present the commonly used stomatal conductance models mainly include the empirical jarvis model based on the relationship between leaf stomatal conductance gsw and environmental factors jarvis 1976 the semi empirical ball woodrow berry bwb model based on the relationship among gsw net photosynthesis rate a and environmental factors ball et al 1987 the unified stomatal optimization uso model based on an optimal stomatal behavior theory in which stomatal function seeks to maximize carbon gain and minimize water loss medlyn et al 2011 and the mechanistic model based on the physiological activity of mesophyll cells buckley et al 2012 in the jarvis model gsw is the product of multiple environmental factors and the comprehensive effect of multiple environmental factors on stomatal conductance can be obtained by superposition of stomatal conductance response to a single environmental factor jarvis 1976 the jarvis model ignores the interaction among environmental factors and considers that they act independently on plant stomata jarvis 1976 in addition the parameters in the jarvis model vary with species and regions and have no clear biological meanings wang et al 2018 the bwb model cannot be used at low co2 concentrations especially when co2 concentration at the leaf surface cs reaches the co2 compensation point γ leuning 1990 since the stomatal response to vpd is more direct than the stomatal response to air relative humidity on the leaf surface hs leuning 1995 further revised hs in the model as a function of vpd deriving the ball berry leuning bbl model uso model has complex mechanisms but may not correctly response to changes of atmospheric co2 concentration medlyn et al 2011 therefore a thorough evaluation of how well different stomatal conductance models perform under different environmental conditions is needed for improving land surface models or ecosystem models to simulate plant photosynthesis and transpiration the arid and semi arid regions occupying 40 of the global terrestrial surface are particularly vulnerable to impacts of water deficits and extreme climate on water resources ozdogan 2011 maize zea mays l is one of the most important economic and food crops in these areas which are important for food security plastic film mulching pfm has been widely used in maize production in arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 pfm could reduce soil water loss and increase crops productivity potential wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2011 pfm can increase ground surface reflectance thus changing the water and energy balance and crop growth processes fan et al 2017 qin et al 2018 furthermore pfm can increase leaf stomatal conductance li et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 and affect leaf photosynthesis ali et al 2018 hu et al 2020 and canopy microclimate hostetler et al 2007 therefore accurately simulating stomatal conductance under pfm will be conducive to optimizing the maize growth environment and for predicting the impact of future climatic change on sustainable agricultural development the mechanistic models are not often useful for simulating gsw as a function of environmental conditions besides their parameters are quite difficult to measure by experiment buckley and mott 2013 in this study in order to consider the mechanisms and influence of environmental factors comprehensively the bwb bbl and uso models were selected to simulate stomatal conductance under pfm in arid and semi arid areas many studies have carried out simulation and optimization of the stomatal conductance model peng et al 2009 xia et al 2022 owing to different climatic conditions crop types and cultivations the applicability of these model parameters may be different therefore it is necessary to build appropriate models for mulching crops in arid and semi arid areas pfm could alter biophysical conditions that affect soil moisture and leaf photosynthesis li et al 2021 li et al 2022 research has shown that soil water content is positively correlated with a and gsw lamptey et al 2020 leaf stomatal conductance is sensitive to soil water conditions egea et al 2011 gollan et al 1985 keenan et al 2010 and may be overestimated if water stress is not considered zhang et al 2017 empirical functions of soil moisture keenan et al 2010 and leaf water potential tuzet et al 2003 have generally been applied to characterize different water status conditions wang et al 2018 reported that stomatal conductance depend on the interaction of air dryness soil water supply capacity and plant biological characteristics a three stage linear soil water response function has been widely used to modify stomatal conductance under different water status conditions ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in addition in order to reflect the effect of soil and plant water deficits on stomatal opening and closing under water saving irrigation peng et al 2009 introduced an exponential function of leaf air temperature difference as a water factor to modify the stomatal conductance model therefore considering that pfm affects plant water research was needed to explore the simulation accuracy and applicability of the stomatal conductance models modified by introducing a water response function or the leaf air temperature difference as factors under pfm in arid and semi arid areas we hypothesized that the simulation accuracy of stomatal conductance models under plastic film mulching will be improved by introducing different water factors the specific objectives were to 1 study simulations by the bwb bbl and uso models of spring maize grown under pfm in arid and semi arid irrigation areas 2 evaluate the simulation performance and accuracy of these models after introducing the leaf air temperature difference and a water response function as model modifications 3 investigate the applicability of models under black and transparent pfm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the major grain production regions in china ren et al 2016 pfm has been widely used in this area liu et al 2017 qi et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the pfm experiments were carried out in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang experimental station linhe inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24e 1039 m asl with the mean annual rainfall of 105 mm wang et al 2014 the mean annual air temperature of 9 1 c and the annual evaporation of 2350 mm zhou et al 2018 2 2 experimental design we investigated three treatments i e flat plot without mulching ck with black plastic film mulching bm with transparent plastic film mulching tm for each treatment three replicates were implemented with a completely randomized block design each plot was 12 m long and 4 m wide under pfm treatments the soil surface was covered by 70 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick polyethylene plastic film and the wide space between the two films was 50 cm the maize cultivar jinping 628 was planted on april 26 2019 and april 30 2020 two rows of maize were planted by hand at a depth of 5 cm using a manual hole planting machine on each sheet of plastic film with 40 cm width and 30 cm plants space apart the total irrigation amount was 500 mm four times 125 mm for each time irrigation water was obtained from a groundwater well and applied at the six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 silking r1 and grain filling r3 growth stages which were defined in ritchie et al 1986 the nitrogen application rate was 300 kg n ha 1 and the p application rate was 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 for all treatments in both years 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water soil water content was measured by gravimetric analysis on june 23 july 12 july 26 august 9 and august 24 in 2019 and on june 23 july 10 july 26 august 2 and august 16 in 2020 soil samples were collected at intervals of 10 cm from the surface to the depth of 40 cm using an auger 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange measurements net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance co2 concentration at the leaf surface ambient co2 concentration and leaf temperature were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6800 li cor inc lincoln usa there were ten measurements in 2019 june 23 july 5 july 12 july 19 july 26 august 2 august 9 august 16 august 24 and august 31 and ten measurements in 2020 june 23 june 30 july 10 july 19 july 26 august 2 august 9 august 16 august 24 and august 31 four plants in each treatment were selected sampling randomly throughout the experimental area and the most recently fully expanded maize leaves were measured on sunny days from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m a total of 120 sets of data per growing season were obtained 2 4 model descriptions as plastic film mulching could alter biophysical conditions e g near surface temperature and moisture that further affect leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance li et al 2021 li et al 2022 we have modified three widely use mechanistic or semi mechanistic stomatal conductance models i e the ball woodrow berry model and the ball berry leuning model and the unified stomatal optimization model by adding the leaf air temperature difference or water response function respectively after calibrating the original and modified stomatal conductance models we investigated whether the modified model had improved the stomatal conductance estimates 2 4 1 ball woodrow berry model ball et al 1987 considered that stomata can maintain the stability of intercellular co2 concentration and stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate were linearly related when humidity and co2 are constant the ball woodrow berry bwb model is as follows g sw m a h s c s g 0 where gsw is leaf stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 a is net photosynthesis rate μmol m 2 s 1 cs is co2 concentration at the leaf surface μmol mol 1 hs is relative humidity of air at the leaf surface g0 is the value of stomatal conductance at the light compensation point and m is an empirical coefficient both g0 and m are the fitted parameters 2 4 2 ball berry leuning model the relationship between gsw and a changes under different water conditions damour et al 2010 leuning replaced cs with cs γ and also replaced hs with a function of vpd owing to the fact that stomata are more responsive to vpd than to hs leuning 1995 the ball berry leuning bbl model is as follows g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 g 0 where γ is the co2 compensation point μmol mol 1 vpd is water vapor pressure deficit kpa and m g0 and d0 are the fitted parameters following the study of yu et al 2001 we calculated the co2 compensation point of spring maize at each leaf temperature tl c as follows γc4 0 1 42 7 1 68 tl 25 0 012 tl 25 2 2 4 3 unified stomatal optimization model the optimal stomatal behavior theory considered that stomatal can maximize carbon gain and reduce water loss stomatal behavior was considered to be the limiting photosynthetic activity for optimizing the regeneration of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp it was assumed that the ambient co2 concentration was much higher than γ medlyn et al 2011 the unified stomatal optimization uso model is as follows g sw 1 6 1 g 1 vpd a c a g 0 the parameter g1 depends on the marginal water cost of plant carbon gain g 1 3 γ λ 1 6 where ca is ambient co2 concentration μmol mol 1 and λ is the marginal water cost of leaf carbon gain mol h2o mol 1 co2 g0 and g1 are fitted parameters 2 4 4 the modified models a water response function f θ was calculated as keenan et al 2010 f θ 0 θ θ w θ θ w θ f θ w θ w θ θ f 1 θ θ f where θ is the soil gravimetric water content θ w and θ f are the soil moisture at the wilting point and at the field capacity θ θ w θ f θ w is the soil relative water content the linear water response function has been widely used to modify the bwb and bbl models under different water status conditions ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 g sw m a h s f θ c s g 0 g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 f θ g 0 in the uso model λ represents the marginal water cost of leaf carbon gain under well watered conditions without considering water status ji et al 2017 studies have shown that λ is mainly related to plant functional type and soil moisture λ is proportional to soil moisture arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2012 therefore the modified uso model was obtained by multiplying gl by f θ on the basis of formula 3 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 f θ vpd a c a g 0 the exponential function of leaf air temperature difference δt can reflect the effect of soil water and plant water deficit on stomatal opening and closing peng et al 2019 thus the models were modified as follows g sw m a h s c s exp δ t g 0 g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 exp δ t g 0 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 vpd a c a exp δ t g 0 considering the interaction impacts of f θ and δt the bbl and uso models were modified as follows g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 f θ exp δ t g 0 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 f θ vpd a c a exp δ t g 0 2 5 evaluation of models and statistical analysis in the calibration nonlinear regressions were used to fit the experimental observation data n 120 based on the dynamic fit function provided by sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc after fitting model parameters coefficient of determination r2 and statistical significance were calculated measurements in 2019 were used to calibrate the models and measurements in 2020 were used to validate the models the root mean square error rmse relative error re modified efficiency coefficient e1 and model slope b0 were also used to evaluate the models performance these model fitness indices were calculated as follows r 2 1 n o i o i m i m i 2 1 n o i o i 2 1 n m i m i 2 rmse 1 n o i m i 2 n re 1 n o i m i o i n e 1 1 1 n o i m i

smaller values of rmse and re indicate better simulation performance of the models a higher e1 value means better simulation performance of the models model slope b0 reflects the overestimation or underestimation caused by the model values of b0 1 indicate overestimation and values of b0 1 indicate underestimation the closer b0 is to 1 the better the simulation performs analysis of variance

at 95 dap in 2020 gsw presented similar effects for pfm and it was higher in tm and bm than ck fig 3 gsw for tm was slightly higher than for bm with no significant difference in 2019 but with a significant difference on july 10 2020 72 dap gsw values under pfm were significantly higher than those under ck from 59 to 106 dap in 2019 and from 62 to 117 dap in 2020 compared with ck gsw was increased by 27 3 and 23 2 for tm and bm respectively during the maize growing season in 2019 and by 41 2 and 26 2 respectively in 2020 fig 3a and b 3 2 leaf air temperature difference and water

δt under ck was significantly less negative than under bm and tm leaf air temperature difference for bm was slightly less negative than for tm except for the measurements at 62 72 and 81 dap in 2020 when δt values were significantly less negative for bm than for tm compared with ck tm and bm resulted in δt being more negative by 47 5 and 40 0 respectively during the 2019 maize growing season and by 74 5 and 39 7 respectively in 2020 fig 3c and d the water response function f θ was positively related to the net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance pfm significantly increased soil relative water content srwc srwc under tm was slightly higher than under bm with a significant difference at 59 dap in 2019 and at 88 and 109 dap in 2020 because of the higher soil water content under tm li et al 2022 compared with ck srwc was increased by 37 7 and 29 4 for tm and bm respectively during the 2019 maize growing season and by 27 4 and 15 4 respectively in 2020 fig 3e and f 3 3 model calibration and validation the fitted parameters and the values of p for the bbl uso and bwb models and the modified models are shown in the table 1 table 2 and table s1 respectively regression fits for the bbl uso and bwb models as well as for the modified models were significant p 0 05 indicating that gsw was affected by the factors included in the models after the introduction of the modification factors the performance of the modified models was improved the simulated gsw by the f θ modified models bwb w bbl w and uso w model came closer to the observed gsw than the δt modified models bwb t bbl t and uso t model in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 a f the linear relationships between the simulated and observed gsw under transparent and black pfm are shown in fig 5 fig 6 fig s1 and fig s2 under pfm the simulated gsw values for the modified models came closer to the observed gsw values than for the initial bbl and uso models under tm the simulated gsw by the f θ modified models were closer to the observed gsw than the δt modified models fig 5 under bm the simulated gsw by the bbl w model was closer to the observed gsw than the bbl t model fig 6a and b the gsw values produced by the uso t model were closer to the observed gsw than the uso w model fig 6c and d the simulated gsw values produced by the bwb bwb t and bwb w models did not present consistent trends which indicated the instability of the bwb model fig s1 and fig s2 the linear relationships between the simulated and observed gsw values produced by the three initial models and the modified models generally presented the same trends under the different plastic film mulching treatments the introduced f θ and δt factors changed the models performance demonstrating interactive effects on gsw between the factors and soil moisture for spring maize the unmodified uso and bbl models had higher r2 values than the bwb model after the introduction of δt and f θ the r2 values for the modified uso and bbl models were still higher than for the modified bwb models the r2 values of the bbl and uso models increased by 5 8 90 6 and 16 2 50 8 after modification respectively for the two study years under pfm the f θ modified models bbltm w usotm w bblbm w usobm w had higher r2 values than the δt modified models bbltm t usotm t bblbm t usobm t our study also confirmed that the simulation accuracy of bwb model and its modified model was lower than the simulation accuracy of the bbl and uso models the rmse re e1 and b0 values indicated that the unmodified uso model performed better than the unmodified bbl model the performance of the bbl and uso models improved after the f θ and δt modifications were introduced the performance of the models under plastic film mulching was superior to the performance observed for the un mulched treatment compared with the initial bbl and uso models rmse for the modified models decreased by 3 5 67 9 in the two years after introducing δt and f θ the re of the bbl and uso models decreased by 8 4 65 6 and 4 8 51 9 respectively after introducing δt and f θ the e1 of the bbl and uso models increased by 6 5 145 4 and 6 5 68 9 respectively the b0 values indicated that the bbl w model performed best followed by the uso w uso t bbl t uso and bbl models especially under transparent or black plastic film mulching in summary the f θ modified models w performed better than the δt modified models t especially under plastic film mulching the performance of the two factors multiply modified models are shown in table s2 by comparing rmse re e1 and b0 the performance of bbltwo and usotwo models were inferior than one factor modified model and initial model 3 4 applicability of the gsw models we compared the fitting curve of the simulated gsw with the 95 confidence interval ci of the fitting curve of the observed gsw in order to determine the appropriate srwc and δt for each model the bbl model overestimated gsw when the srwc was lower than 59 8 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 73 1 in the 2019 growing season fig 7 a the uso model overestimated gsw when srwc was lower than 59 8 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 74 3 in the 2019 growing season fig 7b the bbl model overestimated gsw when the srwc was lower than 46 6 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 81 0 in the 2020 growing season fig 7c the simulated gsw produced by the uso model was basically within the 95 ci of the observed gsw in 2020 fig 7d owing to the more rainfall in 2020 fig 1 the models were more applicable under varying srwc especially for uso model for the bbl w and uso w models the simulated gsw curves were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw and were closer to the observed gsw in both years thus the applicability of models was improved by introducing f θ and the modified models were more applicable under the differing srwc conditions in 2019 and 2020 the bbl model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 41 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 84 c and lower than 0 05 c in 2019 fig 8 a in 2020 the bbl model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 50 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 87 c and lower than 0 08 c fig 8c the uso model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 38 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 74 c and lower than 0 02 c in 2019 fig 8b the uso model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 38 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 63 c in 2020 fig 8d for the bbl t and uso t models the simulated gsw values were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw thus the applicability of the bbl and uso models was improved by introducing δt and the modified models were applicable under the current varying δt conditions these results demonstrated that the bbl and uso models were relatively stable under the greater rainfall conditions encountered during the 2020 growing season and the modified models were stable under varying srwc and δt conditions 4 discussion soil water content is positively correlated with a and gsw i e the higher the soil water availability the greater the values of a and gsw lamptey et al 2020 pfm significantly increased the a gsw and water response function this was related to the improved soil hydrothermal conditions under pfm that has been reported in other studies baronti et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 leaf air temperature difference reflected the effect of soil water and plant water deficit on stomatal opening and closing peng et al 2009 therefore the un mulched treatment with lower water conditions obtained significantly higher δt than pfm fig 3c and d many mechanistic models do not often successfully simulate gsw as a function of environmental conditions partly because their parameters are quite difficult to quantify based on experiments buckley and mott 2013 thus the bwb bbl and uso models were selected to simulate stomatal conductance as they considered the mechanisms and influence of environmental factors comprehensively our results showed that all the three models could simulate stomatal conductance reasonably well the best performance is achieved by uso model followed by bbl model and bwb model performs the worst although bwb model coupled the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance it did not consider the influence of temperature on gsw and cannot be used to at low co2 concentrations ball et al 1987 leuning 1990 stomatal conductance could be regulated by soil and atmospheric water conditions zhang et al 2021 considering the effects of pfm on hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system li et al 2022 we introduced two factors f θ and δt to modify models leaf temperature determines the rates of photosynthesis transpiration and respiration blonder and michaletz 2018 high leaf temperature can increase respiration rate heskel et al 2016 and depress photosynthesis rate michaletz 2018 leaves regulate temperature by transpiration which in turn affects stomatal opening and closing blonder and michaletz 2018 in addition leaf temperature is strongly correlated with air temperature sanchez et al 2018 thus the leaf air temperature difference is related to environmental factors and also related to the leaf water and energy balances of plants and therefore can reflect plant water status the proper δt could ensure the normal operation of plant physiological functions a too high δt could decrease the thickness of leaves thus damaging the tissue inside the leaves whereas a too low δt could inhibit the content and activity of rubisco enzyme thus inhibiting the opening of stomata xia et al 2022 as peng et al 2009 reported that δt could reflect soil and plant water and enhance the model simulation accuracy of rice the δt modified models remarkably improved simulation accuracy in this study the model performance was better than what peng et al 2019 has reported the main reason can be the different water conditions for maize and rice ji et al 2017 showed that the accuracy of estimating gsw for maize and soybean was improved 7 35 after introducing a water response function wang et al 2018 showed that the normalized rmse of the modified model decreased by 3 9 15 7 after introducing f θ soil water and plant growth are remarkably altered under pfm indicating that gsw can be sensitive to soil water thus the f θ modified models performed better than others reports ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in this study the r2 values of the modified models increased by 5 8 90 6 rmse and re decreased by 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively table 4 the performance of the two factors multiply modified models are shown in table s2 that performance was poor than one factor modified models crop photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are linked with soil moisture karimi et al 2015 wang et al 2015a and soil moisture under pfm is relatively more stable and higher than under ck zhang et al 2019 our study found that the uso model performed better than the bbl model the main reason is that the uso model has only one parameter g1 in the optimization theory of stomatal regulation which can become more stable when predicting stomatal conductance ji et al 2017 the parameter g1 increased with crop growth temperature and the simulated values produced by the model were better when g1 declined as drought progressed medlyn et al 2011 black pfm can reduce soil temperature during the hot summer months owing to the absorbing more solar radiation moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 thus the uso model under black pfm performed better than others notably the f θ modified models w performed better than the δt modified models t especially under pfm these findings may be mainly related to the great influence of plastic film mulching on plant water status and growth in arid irrigation areas maize growth is more sensitive to soil water status the higher dry matter assimilation and accumulation under pfm was mainly related to the superior soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2021 li et al 2022 although the simulated gsw by the uso t model was closer to the observed gsw than the uso w model fig 6c and d the performance of uso w model was superior to uso t model table 4 if some outliers have been excluded after introducing f θ or δt the simulated gsw values were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw the modified models were more applicable under varying srwc and δt conditions that is the modified bbl and uso models could be applied to different degrees of water deficit or drought environment to apply the modified models to other arid areas and upscale estimates from the leave level to the canopy level can be a major focus in our future study 5 conclusions our study of spring maize in an arid irrigation district showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and srwc and exerted negative effects on the leaf air temperature difference we have evaluated three different stomatal conductance models and their derived versions accounting for leaf air temperature difference and water response as additional limiting factors the accuracy of the bwb model was poor under varying water status the uso model performed better than the bbl model and the performance of the modified models improved after incorporating the leaf air temperature difference or the water response function the r2 and e1 of the modified models increased by 5 8 90 6 and 6 5 145 4 respectively the rmse and re of the modified models decreased by 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively furthermore under plastic film mulching the models accounting for the water response function performed better than the models accounting for only the leaf air temperature difference overall our results suggest that the maize land implemented with plastic film mulching has altered biophysical conditions leading to significant changes in crop photosynthesis leaf air temperature difference and top soil water conditions accurate estimates of stomatal conductance require the model to consider water response functions and leaf air temperature difference particularly in environmental conditions associated with different extents of water

2478,plastic film mulching pfm in the cropland may alter biophysical conditions for crop growth which may not be accounted for in existing stomatal conductance models this can affect the accuracy of carbon nitrogen water cycle simulations for the soil crop systems and hamper our understanding of internal mechanisms that control plant leaf stomatal conductance gsw to evaluate the simulations of pfm effects on gsw the three models i e ball woodrow berry bwb ball berry leuning bbl and unified stomatal optimization uso models were used the two model modification factors were leaf air temperature difference δt and a water response function f θ a two year maize zea mays l field experiment was conducted under different pfm black transparent and no mulch the performance of the bwb model was poor under varying water status in the arid irrigation area as for the bbl and uso models the coefficient of determination and modified efficiency coefficient of the modified models increased 5 8 90 6 and 6 5 145 4 respectively compared with the initial models the root mean square error and relative error of the modified models decreased 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively the δt and f θ factors effectively improved the bbl and uso models but the f θ modified models performed better than δt modified models under pfm overall our results suggest that the maize land implemented with plastic film mulching has altered biophysical conditions leading to significant changes in crop photosynthesis leaf air temperature difference and top soil water conditions accurate estimates of stomatal conductance require the model to consider water response functions and leaf air temperature difference particularly in environmental conditions associated with different extents of water deficit or drought keywords plastic film mulching stomatal conductance model water response function leaf air temperature difference spring maize data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction quantifying land surface exchange of carbon water and energy flux is essential for understanding how the land surface has interacted with the atmosphere for the present days and being used in the earth system model to make a future prediction in the agricultural land surface gas and energy exchanges are tightly associated with water use efficiency and crop productivity of agricultural ecosystems as plant stomata play an important role in regulating gas and energy exchange understanding and properly simulating stomatal behavior is critical to the study of land and atmosphere interactions and future climate change keisuke et al 2013 stomatal behavior is usually analyzed in two scales i e large scale and leaf scale for the large scale analyses stomatal responses to environmental perturbations can greatly affect plant performance agricultural production and global carbon and water cycles huang et al 2021 for leaf scale analyses stomata are transport channels for exchange of water and co2 fluxes between atmosphere and leaves in agricultural ecosystems and degrees of stomatal opening are often used to indicate how efficiently plants can assimilate co2 transpire water vapor and regulate both carbon and water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum stomatal controls of co2 uptake and water loss determine plant productivity and water use efficiency buckley and mott 2013 vialet chabrand et al 2017 accordingly stomatal conductance is often used as a physiological indicator of stomatal behavior regardless of spatial scales i e the regional or global level or the leaf level stomata continuously adjust aperture in response to external environmental factors and plant water status lin et al 2015 accurate simulation of the effects of environmental factors on stomatal conductance is an important prerequisite for the optimal regulation and management of the crop growth environment buckley and mott 2013 furthermore modeling the effect of environmental factor changes on stomatal conductance is crucial for understanding and predicting the consequences of global climate change on plant growth development and productivity zhou et al 2013 stomatal conductance models are not only been widely used for global climate models bonan et al 2014 kauwe et al 2015 but have been applied for specific ecosystems including rice fields keisuke et al 2013 maize lands wang et al 2018 forests medlyn et al 2011 and other ecosystems at present the commonly used stomatal conductance models mainly include the empirical jarvis model based on the relationship between leaf stomatal conductance gsw and environmental factors jarvis 1976 the semi empirical ball woodrow berry bwb model based on the relationship among gsw net photosynthesis rate a and environmental factors ball et al 1987 the unified stomatal optimization uso model based on an optimal stomatal behavior theory in which stomatal function seeks to maximize carbon gain and minimize water loss medlyn et al 2011 and the mechanistic model based on the physiological activity of mesophyll cells buckley et al 2012 in the jarvis model gsw is the product of multiple environmental factors and the comprehensive effect of multiple environmental factors on stomatal conductance can be obtained by superposition of stomatal conductance response to a single environmental factor jarvis 1976 the jarvis model ignores the interaction among environmental factors and considers that they act independently on plant stomata jarvis 1976 in addition the parameters in the jarvis model vary with species and regions and have no clear biological meanings wang et al 2018 the bwb model cannot be used at low co2 concentrations especially when co2 concentration at the leaf surface cs reaches the co2 compensation point γ leuning 1990 since the stomatal response to vpd is more direct than the stomatal response to air relative humidity on the leaf surface hs leuning 1995 further revised hs in the model as a function of vpd deriving the ball berry leuning bbl model uso model has complex mechanisms but may not correctly response to changes of atmospheric co2 concentration medlyn et al 2011 therefore a thorough evaluation of how well different stomatal conductance models perform under different environmental conditions is needed for improving land surface models or ecosystem models to simulate plant photosynthesis and transpiration the arid and semi arid regions occupying 40 of the global terrestrial surface are particularly vulnerable to impacts of water deficits and extreme climate on water resources ozdogan 2011 maize zea mays l is one of the most important economic and food crops in these areas which are important for food security plastic film mulching pfm has been widely used in maize production in arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 pfm could reduce soil water loss and increase crops productivity potential wang et al 2015b zhang et al 2011 pfm can increase ground surface reflectance thus changing the water and energy balance and crop growth processes fan et al 2017 qin et al 2018 furthermore pfm can increase leaf stomatal conductance li et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 and affect leaf photosynthesis ali et al 2018 hu et al 2020 and canopy microclimate hostetler et al 2007 therefore accurately simulating stomatal conductance under pfm will be conducive to optimizing the maize growth environment and for predicting the impact of future climatic change on sustainable agricultural development the mechanistic models are not often useful for simulating gsw as a function of environmental conditions besides their parameters are quite difficult to measure by experiment buckley and mott 2013 in this study in order to consider the mechanisms and influence of environmental factors comprehensively the bwb bbl and uso models were selected to simulate stomatal conductance under pfm in arid and semi arid areas many studies have carried out simulation and optimization of the stomatal conductance model peng et al 2009 xia et al 2022 owing to different climatic conditions crop types and cultivations the applicability of these model parameters may be different therefore it is necessary to build appropriate models for mulching crops in arid and semi arid areas pfm could alter biophysical conditions that affect soil moisture and leaf photosynthesis li et al 2021 li et al 2022 research has shown that soil water content is positively correlated with a and gsw lamptey et al 2020 leaf stomatal conductance is sensitive to soil water conditions egea et al 2011 gollan et al 1985 keenan et al 2010 and may be overestimated if water stress is not considered zhang et al 2017 empirical functions of soil moisture keenan et al 2010 and leaf water potential tuzet et al 2003 have generally been applied to characterize different water status conditions wang et al 2018 reported that stomatal conductance depend on the interaction of air dryness soil water supply capacity and plant biological characteristics a three stage linear soil water response function has been widely used to modify stomatal conductance under different water status conditions ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in addition in order to reflect the effect of soil and plant water deficits on stomatal opening and closing under water saving irrigation peng et al 2009 introduced an exponential function of leaf air temperature difference as a water factor to modify the stomatal conductance model therefore considering that pfm affects plant water research was needed to explore the simulation accuracy and applicability of the stomatal conductance models modified by introducing a water response function or the leaf air temperature difference as factors under pfm in arid and semi arid areas we hypothesized that the simulation accuracy of stomatal conductance models under plastic film mulching will be improved by introducing different water factors the specific objectives were to 1 study simulations by the bwb bbl and uso models of spring maize grown under pfm in arid and semi arid irrigation areas 2 evaluate the simulation performance and accuracy of these models after introducing the leaf air temperature difference and a water response function as model modifications 3 investigate the applicability of models under black and transparent pfm 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the hetao irrigation district hid is one of the major grain production regions in china ren et al 2016 pfm has been widely used in this area liu et al 2017 qi et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 the pfm experiments were carried out in 2019 and 2020 at the shuguang experimental station linhe inner mongolia china 40 46 n 107 24e 1039 m asl with the mean annual rainfall of 105 mm wang et al 2014 the mean annual air temperature of 9 1 c and the annual evaporation of 2350 mm zhou et al 2018 2 2 experimental design we investigated three treatments i e flat plot without mulching ck with black plastic film mulching bm with transparent plastic film mulching tm for each treatment three replicates were implemented with a completely randomized block design each plot was 12 m long and 4 m wide under pfm treatments the soil surface was covered by 70 cm wide and 0 008 mm thick polyethylene plastic film and the wide space between the two films was 50 cm the maize cultivar jinping 628 was planted on april 26 2019 and april 30 2020 two rows of maize were planted by hand at a depth of 5 cm using a manual hole planting machine on each sheet of plastic film with 40 cm width and 30 cm plants space apart the total irrigation amount was 500 mm four times 125 mm for each time irrigation water was obtained from a groundwater well and applied at the six leaf v6 12 leaf v12 silking r1 and grain filling r3 growth stages which were defined in ritchie et al 1986 the nitrogen application rate was 300 kg n ha 1 and the p application rate was 200 kg p2o5 ha 1 for all treatments in both years 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water soil water content was measured by gravimetric analysis on june 23 july 12 july 26 august 9 and august 24 in 2019 and on june 23 july 10 july 26 august 2 and august 16 in 2020 soil samples were collected at intervals of 10 cm from the surface to the depth of 40 cm using an auger 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange measurements leaf gas exchange measurements net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance co2 concentration at the leaf surface ambient co2 concentration and leaf temperature were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6800 li cor inc lincoln usa there were ten measurements in 2019 june 23 july 5 july 12 july 19 july 26 august 2 august 9 august 16 august 24 and august 31 and ten measurements in 2020 june 23 june 30 july 10 july 19 july 26 august 2 august 9 august 16 august 24 and august 31 four plants in each treatment were selected sampling randomly throughout the experimental area and the most recently fully expanded maize leaves were measured on sunny days from 9 00 a m to 11 00 a m a total of 120 sets of data per growing season were obtained 2 4 model descriptions as plastic film mulching could alter biophysical conditions e g near surface temperature and moisture that further affect leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance li et al 2021 li et al 2022 we have modified three widely use mechanistic or semi mechanistic stomatal conductance models i e the ball woodrow berry model and the ball berry leuning model and the unified stomatal optimization model by adding the leaf air temperature difference or water response function respectively after calibrating the original and modified stomatal conductance models we investigated whether the modified model had improved the stomatal conductance estimates 2 4 1 ball woodrow berry model ball et al 1987 considered that stomata can maintain the stability of intercellular co2 concentration and stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate were linearly related when humidity and co2 are constant the ball woodrow berry bwb model is as follows g sw m a h s c s g 0 where gsw is leaf stomatal conductance mol m 2 s 1 a is net photosynthesis rate μmol m 2 s 1 cs is co2 concentration at the leaf surface μmol mol 1 hs is relative humidity of air at the leaf surface g0 is the value of stomatal conductance at the light compensation point and m is an empirical coefficient both g0 and m are the fitted parameters 2 4 2 ball berry leuning model the relationship between gsw and a changes under different water conditions damour et al 2010 leuning replaced cs with cs γ and also replaced hs with a function of vpd owing to the fact that stomata are more responsive to vpd than to hs leuning 1995 the ball berry leuning bbl model is as follows g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 g 0 where γ is the co2 compensation point μmol mol 1 vpd is water vapor pressure deficit kpa and m g0 and d0 are the fitted parameters following the study of yu et al 2001 we calculated the co2 compensation point of spring maize at each leaf temperature tl c as follows γc4 0 1 42 7 1 68 tl 25 0 012 tl 25 2 2 4 3 unified stomatal optimization model the optimal stomatal behavior theory considered that stomatal can maximize carbon gain and reduce water loss stomatal behavior was considered to be the limiting photosynthetic activity for optimizing the regeneration of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp it was assumed that the ambient co2 concentration was much higher than γ medlyn et al 2011 the unified stomatal optimization uso model is as follows g sw 1 6 1 g 1 vpd a c a g 0 the parameter g1 depends on the marginal water cost of plant carbon gain g 1 3 γ λ 1 6 where ca is ambient co2 concentration μmol mol 1 and λ is the marginal water cost of leaf carbon gain mol h2o mol 1 co2 g0 and g1 are fitted parameters 2 4 4 the modified models a water response function f θ was calculated as keenan et al 2010 f θ 0 θ θ w θ θ w θ f θ w θ w θ θ f 1 θ θ f where θ is the soil gravimetric water content θ w and θ f are the soil moisture at the wilting point and at the field capacity θ θ w θ f θ w is the soil relative water content the linear water response function has been widely used to modify the bwb and bbl models under different water status conditions ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 g sw m a h s f θ c s g 0 g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 f θ g 0 in the uso model λ represents the marginal water cost of leaf carbon gain under well watered conditions without considering water status ji et al 2017 studies have shown that λ is mainly related to plant functional type and soil moisture λ is proportional to soil moisture arneth et al 2002 katul et al 2012 therefore the modified uso model was obtained by multiplying gl by f θ on the basis of formula 3 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 f θ vpd a c a g 0 the exponential function of leaf air temperature difference δt can reflect the effect of soil water and plant water deficit on stomatal opening and closing peng et al 2019 thus the models were modified as follows g sw m a h s c s exp δ t g 0 g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 exp δ t g 0 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 vpd a c a exp δ t g 0 considering the interaction impacts of f θ and δt the bbl and uso models were modified as follows g sw m a c s γ 1 vpd d 0 f θ exp δ t g 0 g sw 1 6 1 g 1 f θ vpd a c a exp δ t g 0 2 5 evaluation of models and statistical analysis in the calibration nonlinear regressions were used to fit the experimental observation data n 120 based on the dynamic fit function provided by sigmaplot 12 5 systat software inc after fitting model parameters coefficient of determination r2 and statistical significance were calculated measurements in 2019 were used to calibrate the models and measurements in 2020 were used to validate the models the root mean square error rmse relative error re modified efficiency coefficient e1 and model slope b0 were also used to evaluate the models performance these model fitness indices were calculated as follows r 2 1 n o i o i m i m i 2 1 n o i o i 2 1 n m i m i 2 rmse 1 n o i m i 2 n re 1 n o i m i o i n e 1 1 1 n o i m i

smaller values of rmse and re indicate better simulation performance of the models a higher e1 value means better simulation performance of the models model slope b0 reflects the overestimation or underestimation caused by the model values of b0 1 indicate overestimation and values of b0 1 indicate underestimation the closer b0 is to 1 the better the simulation performs analysis of variance anova was conducted with the spss software ibm inc usa multiple comparisons of mean values were performed using the least significant differences lsd test at a significance level of 0 05 graphics were

δt under ck was significantly less negative than under bm and tm leaf air temperature difference for bm was slightly less negative than for tm except for the measurements at 62 72 and 81 dap in 2020 when δt values were significantly less negative for bm than for tm compared with ck tm and bm resulted in δt being more negative by 47 5 and 40 0 respectively during the 2019 maize growing season and by 74 5 and 39 7 respectively in 2020 fig 3c and d the water response function f θ was positively related to the net photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance pfm significantly increased soil relative water content srwc srwc under tm was slightly higher than under bm with a significant difference at 59 dap in 2019 and at 88 and 109 dap in 2020 because of the higher soil water content under tm li et al 2022 compared with ck srwc was increased by 37 7 and 29 4 for tm and bm respectively during the 2019 maize growing season and by 27 4 and 15 4 respectively in 2020 fig 3e and f 3 3 model calibration and validation the fitted parameters and the values of p for the bbl uso and bwb models and the modified models are shown in the table 1 table 2 and table s1 respectively regression fits for the bbl uso and bwb models as well as for the modified models were significant p 0 05 indicating that gsw was affected by the factors included in the models after the introduction of the modification factors the performance of the modified models was improved the simulated gsw by the f θ modified models bwb w bbl w and uso w model came closer to the observed gsw than the δt modified models bwb t bbl t and uso t model in 2019 and 2020 fig 4 a f the linear relationships between the simulated and observed gsw under transparent and black pfm are shown in fig 5 fig 6 fig s1 and fig s2 under pfm the simulated gsw values for the modified models came closer to the observed gsw values than for the initial bbl and uso models under tm the simulated gsw by the f θ modified models were closer to the observed gsw than the δt modified models fig 5 under bm the simulated gsw by the bbl w model was closer to the observed gsw than the bbl t model fig 6a and b the gsw values produced by the uso t model were closer to the observed gsw than the uso w model fig 6c and d the simulated gsw values produced by the bwb bwb t and bwb w models did not present consistent trends which indicated the instability of the bwb model fig s1 and fig s2 the linear relationships between the simulated and observed gsw values produced by the three initial models and the modified models generally presented the same trends under the different plastic film mulching treatments the introduced f θ and δt factors changed the models performance demonstrating interactive effects on gsw between the factors and soil moisture for spring maize the unmodified uso and bbl models had higher r2 values than the bwb model after the introduction of δt and f θ the r2 values for the modified uso and bbl models were still higher than for the modified bwb models the r2 values of the bbl and uso models increased by 5 8 90 6 and 16 2 50 8 after modification respectively for the two study years under pfm the f θ modified models bbltm w usotm w bblbm w usobm w had higher r2 values than the δt modified models bbltm t usotm t bblbm t usobm t our study also confirmed that the simulation accuracy of bwb model and its modified model was lower than the simulation accuracy of the bbl and uso models the rmse re e1 and b0 values indicated that the unmodified uso model performed better than the unmodified bbl model the performance of the bbl and uso models improved after the f θ and δt modifications were introduced the performance of the models under plastic film mulching was superior to the performance observed for the un mulched treatment compared with the initial bbl and uso models rmse for the modified models decreased by 3 5 67 9 in the two years after introducing δt and f θ the re of the bbl and uso models decreased by 8 4 65 6 and 4 8 51 9 respectively after introducing δt and f θ the e1 of the bbl and uso models increased by 6 5 145 4 and 6 5 68 9 respectively the b0 values indicated that the bbl w model performed best followed by the uso w uso t bbl t uso and bbl models especially under transparent or black plastic film mulching in summary the f θ modified models w performed better than the δt modified models t especially under plastic film mulching the performance of the two factors multiply modified models are shown in table s2 by comparing rmse re e1 and b0 the performance of bbltwo and usotwo models were inferior than one factor modified model and initial model 3 4 applicability of the gsw models we compared the fitting curve of the simulated gsw with the 95 confidence interval ci of the fitting curve of the observed gsw in order to determine the appropriate srwc and δt for each model the bbl model overestimated gsw when the srwc was lower than 59 8 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 73 1 in the 2019 growing season fig 7 a the uso model overestimated gsw when srwc was lower than 59 8 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 74 3 in the 2019 growing season fig 7b the bbl model overestimated gsw when the srwc was lower than 46 6 and underestimated gsw when srwc was higher than 81 0 in the 2020 growing season fig 7c the simulated gsw produced by the uso model was basically within the 95 ci of the observed gsw in 2020 fig 7d owing to the more rainfall in 2020 fig 1 the models were more applicable under varying srwc especially for uso model for the bbl w and uso w models the simulated gsw curves were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw and were closer to the observed gsw in both years thus the applicability of models was improved by introducing f θ and the modified models were more applicable under the differing srwc conditions in 2019 and 2020 the bbl model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 41 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 84 c and lower than 0 05 c in 2019 fig 8 a in 2020 the bbl model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 50 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 87 c and lower than 0 08 c fig 8c the uso model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 38 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 74 c and lower than 0 02 c in 2019 fig 8b the uso model underestimated gsw when δt was lower than 1 38 c and overestimated gsw when δt was higher than 0 63 c in 2020 fig 8d for the bbl t and uso t models the simulated gsw values were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw thus the applicability of the bbl and uso models was improved by introducing δt and the modified models were applicable under the current varying δt conditions these results demonstrated that the bbl and uso models were relatively stable under the greater rainfall conditions encountered during the 2020 growing season and the modified models were stable under varying srwc and δt conditions 4 discussion soil water content is positively correlated with a and gsw i e the higher the soil water availability the greater the values of a and gsw lamptey et al 2020 pfm significantly increased the a gsw and water response function this was related to the improved soil hydrothermal conditions under pfm that has been reported in other studies baronti et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 leaf air temperature difference reflected the effect of soil water and plant water deficit on stomatal opening and closing peng et al 2009 therefore the un mulched treatment with lower water conditions obtained significantly higher δt than pfm fig 3c and d many mechanistic models do not often successfully simulate gsw as a function of environmental conditions partly because their parameters are quite difficult to quantify based on experiments buckley and mott 2013 thus the bwb bbl and uso models were selected to simulate stomatal conductance as they considered the mechanisms and influence of environmental factors comprehensively our results showed that all the three models could simulate stomatal conductance reasonably well the best performance is achieved by uso model followed by bbl model and bwb model performs the worst although bwb model coupled the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance it did not consider the influence of temperature on gsw and cannot be used to at low co2 concentrations ball et al 1987 leuning 1990 stomatal conductance could be regulated by soil and atmospheric water conditions zhang et al 2021 considering the effects of pfm on hydrothermal conditions of the soil crop system li et al 2022 we introduced two factors f θ and δt to modify models leaf temperature determines the rates of photosynthesis transpiration and respiration blonder and michaletz 2018 high leaf temperature can increase respiration rate heskel et al 2016 and depress photosynthesis rate michaletz 2018 leaves regulate temperature by transpiration which in turn affects stomatal opening and closing blonder and michaletz 2018 in addition leaf temperature is strongly correlated with air temperature sanchez et al 2018 thus the leaf air temperature difference is related to environmental factors and also related to the leaf water and energy balances of plants and therefore can reflect plant water status the proper δt could ensure the normal operation of plant physiological functions a too high δt could decrease the thickness of leaves thus damaging the tissue inside the leaves whereas a too low δt could inhibit the content and activity of rubisco enzyme thus inhibiting the opening of stomata xia et al 2022 as peng et al 2009 reported that δt could reflect soil and plant water and enhance the model simulation accuracy of rice the δt modified models remarkably improved simulation accuracy in this study the model performance was better than what peng et al 2019 has reported the main reason can be the different water conditions for maize and rice ji et al 2017 showed that the accuracy of estimating gsw for maize and soybean was improved 7 35 after introducing a water response function wang et al 2018 showed that the normalized rmse of the modified model decreased by 3 9 15 7 after introducing f θ soil water and plant growth are remarkably altered under pfm indicating that gsw can be sensitive to soil water thus the f θ modified models performed better than others reports ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in this study the r2 values of the modified models increased by 5 8 90 6 rmse and re decreased by 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively table 4 the performance of the two factors multiply modified models are shown in table s2 that performance was poor than one factor modified models crop photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are linked with soil moisture karimi et al 2015 wang et al 2015a and soil moisture under pfm is relatively more stable and higher than under ck zhang et al 2019 our study found that the uso model performed better than the bbl model the main reason is that the uso model has only one parameter g1 in the optimization theory of stomatal regulation which can become more stable when predicting stomatal conductance ji et al 2017 the parameter g1 increased with crop growth temperature and the simulated values produced by the model were better when g1 declined as drought progressed medlyn et al 2011 black pfm can reduce soil temperature during the hot summer months owing to the absorbing more solar radiation moreno and moreno 2008 yaghi et al 2013 thus the uso model under black pfm performed better than others notably the f θ modified models w performed better than the δt modified models t especially under pfm these findings may be mainly related to the great influence of plastic film mulching on plant water status and growth in arid irrigation areas maize growth is more sensitive to soil water status the higher dry matter assimilation and accumulation under pfm was mainly related to the superior soil hydrothermal conditions li et al 2021 li et al 2022 although the simulated gsw by the uso t model was closer to the observed gsw than the uso w model fig 6c and d the performance of uso w model was superior to uso t model table 4 if some outliers have been excluded after introducing f θ or δt the simulated gsw values were all within the 95 confidence intervals of the observed gsw the modified models were more applicable under varying srwc and δt conditions that is the modified bbl and uso models could be applied to different degrees of water deficit or drought environment to apply the modified models to other arid areas and upscale estimates from the leave level to the canopy level can be a major focus in our future study 5 conclusions our study of spring maize in an arid irrigation district showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased net photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance and srwc and exerted negative effects on the leaf air temperature difference we have evaluated three different stomatal conductance models and their derived versions accounting for leaf air temperature difference and water response as additional limiting factors the accuracy of the bwb model was poor under varying water status the uso model performed better than the bbl model and the performance of the modified models improved after incorporating the leaf air temperature difference or the water response function the r2 and e1 of the modified models increased by 5 8 90 6 and 6 5 145 4 respectively the rmse and re of the modified models decreased by 3 5 67 9 and 4 8 65 6 respectively furthermore under plastic film mulching the models accounting for the water response function performed better than the models accounting for only the leaf air temperature difference overall our results suggest that the maize land implemented with plastic film mulching has altered biophysical conditions leading to significant changes in crop photosynthesis leaf air temperature difference and top soil water conditions accurate estimates of stomatal conductance require the model to consider water response functions and leaf air temperature difference particularly in environmental conditions associated with different extents of water deficit or drought credit authorship contribution statement cheng li writing original draft naijiang wang xiaoqi luo yue li tibin zhang writing review editing dianyuan ding qin ge dong writing review

2479,increased population is exposed to urban flooding as a result of climate change flood early warning can largely reduce the loss of life and asset while how detailed rainfall information is enough has always been a critical issue in achieving robust flood forecasting previous analysis has been limited by lacking high resolution rainfall observation or a spatially matched urban hydrological model this study couples mature modeling technologies with comprehensive hydro meteorological measurement that is comprised of x band polarimetric radar 75 m 3 min weather stations and hydrometric stations and this study further attempts to understand the rainfall spatial resolution effects and critical resolutions from a multi scale perspective e g block district and catchment scales the results show that coarser resolutions always lead to underestimation of peak flows even exceeding 40 in the case of adopting 10 km rainfall data at the block scale but such damping effects on discharge simulation can be largely attenuated with increased hydrological scale in general spatial resolutions of higher than 500 m and 10 km are needed to obtain accurate simulation results i e keep the relative bias within 20 at district and catchment scales while at least 300 m for the block scale in conclusion refined rainfall forcing contributes to better simulation of peak flows in urban hydrological modeling but the required rainfall spatial resolution changes with the scale of hydrological application these findings help to better achieve the balance between rainfall observation cost and flood simulation accuracy keywords urban hydrology precipitation flood hydrological scale data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction damaging floods occur more frequently over the past decades owing to the combination of global climate change and ongoing urbanization oh and sushama 2020 slater et al 2021 westra et al 2014 yin et al 2018 which has evolved into a major concern globally in particular for the cities situated in flood prone areas disaster losses might be dramatically aggravated given the widespread presence of population and social assets tanoue et al 2016 wing et al 2020 to deal with the growing risk induced by urban flooding model based flood forecasting and efficacy evaluation of adaptive solutions are crucial as with the construction of structural countermeasures chao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and sufficient rainfall information becomes a key to ensure the accuracy of simulated results and meet the requirements of various practical applications thorndahl et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 chao et al 2021 rainfall spatial distribution often is highly heterogeneous in urban areas emmanuel et al 2012 peleg et al 2018 wright et al 2014 partly because of the joint effects of both thermodynamics and kinetics of urban canopy fowler et al 2021 masson et al 2020 more importantly the urban hydrological response always presents high sensitivity to rainfall variability berne et al 2004 bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 peleg et al 2017 due to the characteristics of urban catchment including high impervious coverage varied land cover types as well as complicated drainage systems thus refined rainfall measurements are essential to support urban hydrological applications e g local waterlogging simulation drainage performance evaluation and fluvial flood forecasting in a spatially explicit way de vos et al 2018 wen et al 2021 however it has to be noted that high resolution in rainfall measurements always comes at a cost while cannot substantially improve model performance in some cases hence understanding the effects of rainfall spatial resolution and the added value of detailed measurements is vital to improving rainfall monitoring schemes and flood early warning capacity cristiano et al 2017 in the 1990s schilling 1991 uttered a thought provoking question rainfall data for urban hydrology what do we need and pointed out that joint efforts of meteorological and hydrological communities are needed to enable refined rainfall measuring and urban hydrologic modeling simultaneously with the advances in rainfall measurement technology scientists first attempted to identify the requirement of rainfall data in urban hydrology based on the rainfall estimation bias due to resolution changes einfalt et al 2004 fabry et al 1994 shortly afterward berne et al 2004 combined rainfall measurements with discharge records to investigate the required rainfall resolution for six different urban catchments but still no model was used up to the early 2010 s the analysis approach that relies on the combination of high resolution rainfall measurements and well established urban models emerges gradually in the studies related to urban hydrology for example notaro et al 2013 investigated the impacts of rainfall resolution in a 0 7 km2 urban catchment in italy by running a semi distributed urban hydrological model with the rainfall input derived from rain gauges in this study 1 7 km is identified as a critical resolution for urban hydrological applications gires et al 2015 examined small scale rainfall variability and its impacts on hydrological response in an urban area of 1 47 km2 based on the rainfall measurements derived from c band radar 1 km in space and two hydrological models with different discretization methods i e semi distributed and fully distributed results show that the fully distributed model presents higher sensitivity to rainfall resolution against the semi distributed model and higher resolution data from x band radar are suggested to further confirm the added value of refined measurements thus bruni et al 2015 revisited the rainfall resolution effects on hydrodynamic modeling in an urbanized catchment of 3 4 km2 taking x band radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe products as the meteorological forcing results indicate rainfall data of sufficient spatial resolution are critical to reproduce urban hydrologic response in the same year ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 conducted a similar work but extended it to seven catchments of similar size 3 8 km2 aiming to provide additional evidence on the added value of higher resolution rainfall estimates results show that the impacts of rainfall resolution can be reduced with increased catchment area the two studies above have provided important insights into the issues related to rainfall resolution but storm transposition strategies i e transfer storm data from the place of its occurrence to another place were adopted due to the lack of refined rainfall measurements in the study area that means model calibration validation is not allowed which may result in relatively large uncertainty as can be seen concurrently current studies in this direction are still few and mainly confined to the district scale within several square kilometers which is not adequate to support urban hydrologic applications concerning other scales e g runoff regulation at the block scale and flood forecasting at the catchment scale the consistencies and variations of rainfall resolution effects across a wider range of scales still wait for answers and the critical spatial resolutions need to be revisited from a multi scale perspective changes in urban hydrological scales not only imply different drainage area sizes but more importantly the contrasting drainage modes e g overland flow pipe flow open channel flow etc which is closely related to the hydrological response regime and expected to make different requirements for rainfall measurements hence this study attempts to clarify the added value of higher resolution rainfall data from a more comprehensive perspective specifically it is dedicated to elucidating the consistencies and variations among different scales centering on the following three issues 1 how rainfall spatial resolution influences urban hydrological simulation 2 why such impacts occur 3 what the critical spatial resolution is this study is performed for a range of nested urban catchments in beijing china with the size ranging from 0 01 km2 to 200 km2 and distinct drainage modes simultaneously detailed geographical data refined rainfall data from x band radar and well recorded river stage data are collected to improve the reliability of simulated results as described in section 2 section 3 is dedicated to the methodology including the urban hydrological model rainfall upscaling scheme and the involved evaluation criteria against model performance section 4 organizes the results aiming at the concerns of this study and thereafter the innovations contributions and limitations are discussed in section 5 section 6 provides closure with some findings and recommendations 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the qing river catchment is an urban catchment of 200 km2 situated in beijing china which is densely populated and covered by above 50 impervious areas as shown in fig 1 it is well monitored by multiple hydro meteorological instruments including 10 weather stations two x band dual polarization weather radars and one hydrometric station the observing system can resolve the small scale variability of rainfall fields and thus provide good data support for this study data from the hydrometric station can be applied in model validation to improve the reliability of the simulated results also a multi layer drainage system has been formed in the catchment consisting of slope surface stormwater pipe and river channel among them the qing river as the main artery plays an important role in flood protection through conveying the stormwater to wenyu river rapidly see fig 1a the stormwater pipes are used to capture the excessing runoff coming from different slope surfaces and transport it to the river channel 2 2 geographical distributed data despite the high impervious rate the spatial distribution of land cover types presents significant fragmentation due to the intervention of various vegetation e g cropland forest lawn etc hence refined data of 10 m resolution in space is first adopted to reflect the spatial variability of land covers chen et al 2019 the 30 m digital elevation model i e dem data for terrain delineation is derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http dwtkns com srtm30m to comprehensively consider infiltration related characteristics a dataset dedicated to depicting the spatial distribution of soil types is collected from the harmonized world soil database hwsd http westdc westgis ac cn of which the spatial resolution is 1 km river channel data including spatial distribution and cross sectional size are obtained from the local water management department to consider the pipe flow during heavy rains the pipe network dataset of the qing river catchment is constructed based on the road information provided by the open street map osm project http download geofabrik de and the field survey e g consulting relevant departments combining both the research objective and the actual situation learned from relevant management departments some reasonable generalizations and assumptions are made here 1 the primary and secondary road information are extracted from osm and utilized to characterize the spatial distribution of main stormwater pipes 2 all pipes are made of reinforced concrete and put under the road with a burial depth of 1 m and a slope of 1 3 the primary roads are underlain by square culverts with a size of 3000 2500 mm while round pipes with a diameter of φ2000 mm for the secondary roads it has to be noted that pipe diameters are always varied with the range in reality and the closer to downstream the larger here pipe diameters are set as the maximum values in the realistic situation i e constants aiming to ensure the study feasibility and get as close as possible to the real drainage condition of the qing river catchment during the studied rainfall events 2 3 rainfall data two x band dual polarization weather radars are employed to provide refined rainfall measurements at 75 m spatial resolution and 3 min temporal resolution which are situated at the north and east of the qing river catchment respectively the two weather radars have the same specifications minimum detection distance of 750 m maximum detection distance of 75 km and a beamwidth of 0 95 both radars adopt the vcp21 scanning mode and complete the scanning at nine elevation angles from 0 5 to 19 5 within 3 min generally observation at lower elevation angles is beneficial to get more accurate ground rainfall information but simultaneously more susceptible to signal attenuation due to beam blockage in this study 1 45 elevation angle is identified as the minimum effective elevation angle and all rainfall data are derived from the observation at this elevation angle all the radar technical parameters are detailed in table 1 as shown in fig 1b the largest distance from the catchment boundary to any one of the radars is within 50 km which is far less than the radar detection range of 75 km the two radars have been operational intermittently since 2017 seven storm events with contrasting characteristics involving both spatial distribution and rainfall intensity are selected from all the available data for analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall total for the seven events that can be roughly categorized into two groups 1 center concentrated e g event 1 and 2 edge concentrated e g event 4 and event 5 as summarized in table 2 two dominant directions of storm movement are detected northwest and southwest the storm event with the maximum of both rainfall total and peak intensity comes from the southwest direction which is also characterized by the longest duration close to three days it has to be noted that employing two radars just aims to capture more rainfall events in case of the influence of signal attenuation or other factors that is all the rainfall data are directly derived from a single radar instead of mosaic products of the two radars additionally 10 weather stations are evenly distributed in the catchment as shown in fig 1a which can provide hourly data of precipitation with reliable quality based on the selected events above station data for the corresponding periods are extracted to verify the quality of radar rainfall estimation 2 4 hydrological records the data of the river stage for four rainfall events including event 1 event 2 event 3 and event 6 are obtained from the local water authority which is recorded in hour intervals the hydrometric station is located at the lower reaches of the catchment see fig 1a which can control most of the whole catchment and almost all the urban areas the data can provide a good benchmark for model performance evaluation and improve the reliability of simulated results to some extent 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall estimation and spatial aggregation x band dual polarization radars can provide additional polarimetric parameters in addition to radar reflectivity zh e g differential phase ψdp specific differential phase kdp differential reflectivity zdr and correlation coefficient ρhv bringi and chandrasekar 2001 that enables the multi dimensional depiction of hydrometeors and provides more paths for rainfall estimation compared to zh kdp is less sensitive to hail contamination and immune to attenuation in rains ryzhkov and zrnić 1996 which aids in achieving more accurate rainfall estimation hence the kdp based method is chosen here to quantitatively estimate instantaneous rainfall rate r shown as the following formula 1 r k dp a k dp b among them r kdp denotes the rainfall rate at a given kdp mm h kdp denotes specific differential phase km a and b are statistical parameters associated with rainfall characteristics in this study the raindrop size distribution for a lot of rainfall events are derived from 11 laser distrometers in beijing china and utilized to generate the regional parameter scheme resultantly a 15 83 b 0 7727 it has to be noted that quality control against radar detected polarimetric parameters has been conducted before rainfall estimation consists of two key steps 1 eliminating non meteorological echoes based on the value of ρhv and the texture i e standard deviation of zh 2 correcting ψdp with linear programming algorithm to ensure its range derivation i e kdp subject to the non negative constraint giangrande et al 2013 based on the inherent relationship between r and kdp precipitation data at 75 m polar pixels can be obtained to lift both the compatibility with the hydrological model and the comparability with previous studies the precipitation data are projected onto a rectangular coordinate system and mapped to regular grids of 100 m subsequently a comprehensive evaluation of the radar qpe results is conducted for all hours of the events studied based on the weather station measurements fig 3 shows that the correlation coefficient cc between radar and weather station observation can reach 0 85 the mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse are 5 93 2 44 and 0 04 respectively which presents good consistency finally spatial aggregations i e averaging in space are made to generate another five sets of precipitation data with coarser resolutions including 300 m 500 m 1 km 3 km and 10 km 3 2 grid based urban hydrological model guhm given the fragmentized land cover widespread micro topography and complicated routing paths in urban areas adopting a discretization scheme based on fine grids is of great importance to reproduce hydrological processes cao et al 2020b hence a grid based urban hydrological model is built referring to the model structure and algorithm used in the previous works smith et al 2015 cao et al 2021 cao et al 2020b which discretizes the whole catchment into 20 000 regular grids with the size of 100 m corresponding to the highest resolution in rainfall datasets three layers of drainage structure are adopted here to explicitly depict the drainage mode in the urbanized catchment including slope surface stormwater pipe and river channel each grid unit is further subdivided into pervious and impervious areas to comprehensively consider various land cover types e g forest cropland urban etc by area weighting approach direct runoff is derived by subtracting interception and infiltration from the rainfall infiltration is only calculated on the pervious area using the green ampt equation brakensiek and onstad 1977 if the grid intersects stormwater pipes the generated runoff will flow into the stormwater pipe network otherwise it will flow onto adjacent grids according to the flow direction determined by the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 based on underlying surface elevation after flowing into the pipe network the generated runoff is further routed into river channels flow in both pipe networks and river channels uniformly uses the one dimensional dynamic wave approach for simulation overland flow calculation includes two steps flow inside the grid and routing between adjacent grids the nonlinear reservoir algorithm rossman 2015 is selected to calculate the overland flow inside grids with proper feature width and slope and the obtained outflow is then evenly distributed over the downstream grid despite both the model structure and involved algorithms adopted herein are well established and have been examined repeatedly in previous studies cao et al 2020a cao et al 2020b parameter calibration is still an essential step before application in particular for the parameters with large uncertainties or closely related to the scale of model grid in general the parameters associated with impervious rate and drainage system roughness can be determined directly based on the landcover type and pipe channel material and calibration is not required while urban soils may be compacted or loosened due to human activities thereby resulting in large uncertainties in soil infiltration parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity ks metric pressure at the wetting front ψf and initial soil moisture deficit θ also the key routing parameters n i e the roughness of pervious area and pr i e the subgrid routing percent have significant scale dependency and need to be calibrated according to cao et al 2020b thus using 100 m qpe products as model input a total of five parameters were calibrated against the river water stage observations and a single parameter set optimized for all the four rainfall events i e event1 event2 event3 and event6 was obtained fig 4 shows that the results between the simulation and the observation present a high degree of consistency where nse coefficients can reach 0 7 or even close to 0 9 and the peak error can be controlled within 0 1 m given that there is generally a strong correlation between river stage and discharge in urban channels liao and knight 2007 lindner and miller 2012 hence the good consistency of river stage simultaneously demonstrate the capacity of guhm to reproduce the discharge process in terms of both timing and magnitude it has to be noted that all the model parameters remain fixed while the rainfall resolution is coarsened 3 3 definition of typical scales in urban hydrology the urban area is generally equipped with a complicated drainage system involving both natural and artificial components in case of heavy rainfall generated runoff can be drained out via multi layer paths including slope surface stormwater pipes and river channels as such changes might occur in not only the drainage area but drainage mode under different urban hydrological scales considering the discrepancy in both drainage area and drainage mode three typical scales in urban hydrology can be identified e g block scale district scale and catchment scale as illustrated in fig 5 a street block can be roughly represented by a space that is bounded by a closed street and filled with buildings in general it is assumed as the basic functional unit in urban planning with a minimum size of 0 01 km2 long et al 2016 xia et al 2020 for a small sized block the conveyance of direct runoff mainly relies on overland flow i e the slope surface is the main drainage path numerous blocks will form a drainage district that is generally equipped with stormwater pipes to capture the runoff and characterized with a size of several square kilometers multiple drainage districts constitute a river catchment where river channels as an additional drainage pathway will play a critical role in excessing runoff conveyance given that the size of the model unit is exactly 0 01 km2 approaching 10 000 upstream grids i e without inflow are selected to explore the hydrological response at the block scale and a total of 25 drainage districts with sizes within 1 10 km2 are picked based on the topological structure of the drainage network as shown in fig 1a the whole qing river catchment is considered as an instance of catchment scale 3 4 evaluation index taking the simulation results forced by 100 m rainfall data as the baseline the model performance with coarser rainfall input is evaluated from two aspects the relative biases of total discharge and peak discharge the equations used to compute the evaluation indexes are shown as follows 2 bias rel var x var 100 m var 100 m 100 where biasrel denotes the relative bias of simulation var100m and varx denote the simulated hydrological variable e g total discharge and peak discharge at the rainfall resolution of 100 m and respectively also the bias transformation rate from rainfall to discharge is calculated as equation 3 which involves two aspects as well the bias transformation from total rainfall to total discharge and that from peak rainfall to peak discharge 3 r trans bias r a b s bias d a b s 100 where rtrans denotes the transformation rate of bias biasr abs and biasd abs denote the absolute bias in rainfall estimation and discharge simulation respectively here the calculation of the simulation bias under different resolutions is still based on the model outputs with 100 m rainfall forcing 4 results based on 42 rainfall inputs seven rainfall cases six rainfall resolutions and 10 000 areas including 10 000 blocks 25 drainage districts and one catchment 400 000 groups of rainfall statistics e g total and peak rainfall and discharge simulation results e g total and peak discharge are obtained taking the 100 m rainfall observations and the corresponding hydrological simulation results as truth the bias of both rainfall and discharge under other resolution conditions can be calculated thereby generating the bias ensemble simultaneously the bias results under specific rain events or urban hydrological scales can be extracted to get the bias sample sets i e the sub ensembles accordingly the results are organized around the following three aspects 1 sensitivity analysis of urban hydrological simulation 2 bias propagation analysis from rainfall to discharge 3 threshold analysis of rainfall spatial resolutions both uncertainty and comparative analysis are conducted to improve the understanding of the added value of high resolution rainfall data in particular its variation at different typical scales 4 1 sensitivity analysis of urban hydrological simulation the resolution of rainfall input is recognized as a key error source to urban hydrologic application while its impacts are likely to be changed with hydrological scales especially when distinct changes occur in drainage mode hence sensitivity analysis is carried out across the block district and catchment scales to reveal the rainfall resolution effects comprehensively relative biases of two hydrological variables i e total discharge and peak discharge are selected as the evaluation index and the ensemble medians are calculated to assess the magnitude of resolution effects the interval between upper and lower quartiles is adopted to quantify the uncertainty of the impacts 4 1 1 impacts on total discharge fig 6 a shows that the impacts on total discharge are bi directional and can be further aggravated with decreased rainfall spatial resolution in terms of the block scale over and underestimation of 20 can be yielded in the case of adopting the rainfall input of 10 km resolution while in light of the ensemble median resolution impacts on total discharge are close to zero which reflects the inherent relation between different rainfall data i e spatial averaging can lead to rainfall redistribution among adjacent blocks but is subject to mass balance however given the selected blocks especially the drainage districts cannot cover the rainfall field completely thus slight deviations between ensemble median and zero value can be detected contrasting to the block scale total discharge response at the district scale presents more sensitivity to the change of rainfall resolution rainfall input of 3 km resolution may lead to a 20 of relative bias and overestimation of above 40 probably occurs in cases of adopting 10 km rainfall data total discharge response at the catchment scale is less sensitive to rainfall resolution with the relative bias keeping steady within 10 4 1 2 impacts on peak discharge fig 6b shows that bi directional effects on the simulation of peak discharge exist as well i e the decrease of rainfall spatial resolution may lead to both over and underestimation however the ensemble median bias uniformly presents a negative value under whatever scenarios which means underestimation effects are dominant for the simulation of peak flow also such effects can be further amplified with decreased rainfall resolution in general the damping effects on peak discharge are most prominent at the block scale with an ensemble median bias exceeding 40 in the case of adopting 10 km rainfall resolution followed by that at the district scale but the impacts might be less predictable and even larger at the district scale once the rainfall spatial resolution is less than 1 km compared to that at the block scale this paradox is particularly the case in the rainfall resolution effects on total discharge simulation see fig 6a for the catchment scale peak discharge simulation shows the least sensitivity to rainfall spatial resolution but it is worth noting that the relative bias steeply rises from 5 to 20 from an overall perspective when the 3 km rainfall input is aggregated to 10 km this implies that a critical rainfall resolution exists for a given combination of catchment and storm scales cristiano et al 2019 4 2 bias propagation analysis from rainfall to discharge bias magnitude in hydrological simulation can be assumed as a function of the following two factors bias in rainfall estimation and bias transformation rate from rainfall to discharge given the dominant factor may change with scales it is necessary to analyze the differences of bias propagation among multiple scales and thus to push forward a step into the understanding of the detected impacts above here the ensemble of bias transformation rate is generated by combining all the cases examined and the sample sets i e the sub ensemble against specific rainfall events or urban hydrological scales are created as well 4 2 1 bias propagation in total volumes fig 7 a shows that the rtrans from total rainfall to total discharge is closely associated with the scale of concern which reaches a peak at the catchment scale with values exceeding 100 mostly also significant uncertainty in the bias transformation is detected which can be attributed to the dimension difference between storm core and catchment areas as can be seen in fig 2 the storm core generally is on the order of several square kilometers which is far below the size of the whole catchment 200 km2 that is the vast majority of rainfall can still fall within the catchment in most cases and thus only causes very limited bias in rainfall total despite the remarkable changes in rainfall spatial resolution while rainfall aggregation in space will reshape both the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall fields that may affect the regime of runoff response largely for the block scale the rtrans almost keeps steady under varying rainfall resolutions which reflects the effective impervious level of the selected blocks in general the minimum rtrans of the total volume always occurs at the district scale which remains below 10 under any resolution condition 4 2 2 bias propagation in peak values compared to the bias propagation in total volume the rtrans of peak value is significantly reduced especially at the catchment scale where the rtrans falls into the interval from 50 to 100 in most cases as shown in fig 7b it is largely because that spatial averaging due to resolution decrease will cause non negligible impacts on the estimation of peak rainfall and thus constrain the rtrans to some extent the relationship of rtrans among the three scales remains consistent as aforementioned i e rtrans at catchment scale presents the largest uncertainty followed by the block scale and district scale in terms of the ensemble median the rtrans can always remain below 30 no matter what resolution and scale it is worth noting that the decrease of rainfall resolution amplifies the rtrans at the block scale which suggests that decreased rainfall intensity probably results in a dramatic drop in peak discharge subject to the infiltration excess runoff mechanism especially for small land parcels with limited runoff regulation capacity 4 3 threshold analysis of rainfall spatial resolutions data requirements for multi scale urban hydrology are combed based upon the recognition of rainfall resolution effects taking model outputs forced by 100 m rainfall data as the benchmark and the relative bias of 20 as the maximum permissible bias threshold analysis is conducted systematically regarding both rainfall characterization and discharge simulation 4 3 1 critical resolution for rainfall characterization fig 8 a indicates that spatial resolutions of 500 m 1 km and 10 km are required to accurately characterize the total rainfall 95 guarantee rate at block district and catchment scales respectively in contrast grasping the magnitude of peak rainfall calls for higher spatial resolution as shown in fig 8b where the rainfall data of 300 m are no longer competent at the block scale also it can be concluded from fig 8a and b that s band radar usually at 1 km resolution can capture the rainfall characteristics i e total and peak at the district and basin scale and above 50 probability for that at the block scale while satellite products usually at 10 km resolution can only be applied to rainfall measuring at the basin scale regarding the results under both 95 and 50 guarantee rates 4 3 2 critical resolution for discharge simulation fig 8 shows that discharge simulation always puts forward higher requirements for spatial resolution compared to rainfall characterization that means the process of hydrologic response can further amplify the resolution effects compared to that on rainfall characterization such amplified effect is particularly the case for hydrological simulations at the district scale where a sharp rise from 1 km to 300 m is detected for the required rainfall resolutions in contrast the hydrological response at the catchment scale is relatively insensitive to the decrease of resolution and improving the rainfall resolution from 10 km to 3 km is adequate for the block scale rainfall input is very demanding where even 300 m data cannot reproduce the peak discharge very well 5 discussion the urban hydrological response always presents significant sensitivity to the change of rainfall condition which implies the missing of small scale rainfall variability may lead to sobering failures in flood forecasting hence deep insights into the rainfall spatial resolution effects are of great importance for the advances in urban hydrology and widely hydrological applications thanks to mature modeling technologies and the comprehensive measurement system comprising x band radar 3 min 75 m weather stations and hydrometric stations this study can revisit the impact of rainfall spatial resolution on urban hydrological modeling with more robustness more importantly its variation across scales i e different urban hydrological scales is investigated as well to enhance the understanding of the scale dependency of rainfall resolution effects as with all the previous studies on rainfall resolution effects the rainfall events and the selected catchment are still a subset of all the potential combination scenarios worldwide however through explicitly incorporating the typical factors in urban hydrology e g drainage area and drainage mode we obtain some new insights 1 larger drain area does not always lead to attenuated rainfall resolution effects for a given rainfall event e g extreme impacts may take place at the district scale instead of the block scale when the resolution is less than 1 km see fig 6 2 1 km rainfall input is inadequate for the hydrological application at the district scale with the order of several square kilometers i e a higher requirement for rainfall resolution is identified compared to previous works obled et al 1994 segond et al 2007 which can be attributed to the role of the dense drainage system and a high impervious degree in the urban area 3 discharge simulation calls for the higher resolution against rainfall characterization which implies hydrological processes can further amplify the errors in rainfall observation in general hydrological processes will cause damping effects on the changes triggered by coarser rainfall measurements via surface routing and soil infiltration as shown in fig 9 a and 9b while it may amplify rainfall relative biases due to the change of runoff coefficient and thus dramatically aggravate the rainfall resolution effects on discharge simulation see fig 9c and d the corresponding theoretical derivation of the amplified effects induced by hydrological processes can be found in appendix a these findings help to form a more complete understanding regarding both the impacts of rainfall resolution and the uncertainty in urban hydrological forecasting simultaneously it can provide some reference for device deployment and data selection rainfall resolution which are expected to improve urban flood forecasting in a cost effective way given the fact that resolution always comes at a cost based on the knowledge obtained herein future research can pay attention to the impacts of rainfall spatial resolution on the simulation of urban waterlogging i e the urban surface inundation process though waterlogging disaster always results from excessing discharge river discharge and pipe discharge the linkage and difference between the forecasting of discharge and waterlogging deserve to be further identified additionally given the rainfall resolution requirement is a complex function of the relationship between storm and catchment characteristics a regional based resolution scheme is expected to generate in future efforts which enable automatic resolution setting under any specific hydro meteorological condition 6 conclusions we have constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising high resolution hydrological meteorological and geographical information based on which a grid based urban hydrological model is built and spatial aggregation is carried out to generate rainfall inputs with different resolutions e g 100 m 300 m 500 m 1 km 3 km and 10 km a model based approach is adopted to evaluate the rainfall resolution effects on discharge simulation in urban areas taking the outputs under 100 m rainfall inputs as the benchmark quantitative analysis is conducted at three typical scales related to urban hydrology e g block district and catchment aiming to shed light on the scale inconsistency in terms of impact magnitude bias propagation and the critical rainfall resolution the main findings include 1 rainfall aggregation in space i e lower spatial resolution always leads to random under and overestimation bias in urban hydrological modeling while evident regularity can be detected from a large sample overall the simulation of total discharge is less sensitive to the change in rainfall spatial resolution while decreased resolution will lead to dramatic underestimation of peak discharge with a maximum bias above 40 see fig 6b the resolution effects are closely associated with the spatial scale of concern but the increase of scale is not doomed to attenuate the impacts more significant impacts on discharge simulation might occur at a larger scale once rainfall spatial resolution is less than a given value for example larger impacts on total discharge take place at the district scale instead of the block scale under 3 km rainfall input see fig 6a and similarly larger underestimation occurs at the catchment scale rather than the district scale under 10 km rainfall input see fig 6b 2 the dominant bias inducing factor of discharge simulation changes with scale this is particularly prominent for the comparison between the district and catchment scales in general rainfall resolution effects are more significant at the district scale compared to the catchment scale while bias transformation rates are far less than that at the catchment scale that is rainfall characterization at the district scale presents large sensitivity to the change in spatial resolution in contrast bias in areal rainfall totals is always small at the catchment scale while likely transforming into the non negligible bias of discharge due to the changes in rainfall distribution 3 urban hydrological processes can amplify the relative bias in rainfall and resultantly exacerbate the need for high resolution rainfall observations also grasping the peak value needs more rigorous rainfall input compared to reproducing the total discharge in general spatial resolutions of 300 m and 3 km are sufficient for discharge simulation at the district and catchment scales respectively in the case of taking the relative bias of 20 as the maximum permissible bias for hydrological applications at the block scale rainfall input is very demanding where even 300 m data cannot reproduce the peak discharge very well by coupling x band dual polarization weather radar qpe with the urban hydrological model this study gains some new insights into rainfall resolution effects and provides additional evidence for the added value of refined measurements in urban areas it can be an important reference for optimizing the deployment of weather stations and for scientifically picking the forcing data of models simultaneously such findings help to build a scientific paradigm for urban hydrological modeling in the context of increased rainfall variability

natural science foundation of china 51679119 appendix a theoretical derivations of the amplification effects induced by urban hydrological processes here we seek to prove the amplification effects of urban hydrological processes in a theoretical way i e explaining why the relative bias in discharge simulation is always larger than that in rainfall characterization as we know total discharge r tot is a function of volume rainfall p tot which can be expressed simply as r tot c 1 p tot where c 1 is the runoff coefficient once changes occur in total rainfall δ p tot the runoff coefficient will change along with it subject to infiltration excess runoff mechanism and the resultant total discharge can be calculated as r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot where c 2 is the runoff coefficient under the changed rainfall condition as such we can derive the amount of change in total discharge δ r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot c 1 p tot assuming the relative bias in total discharge as bias rel d t o t δ r tot r tot and that in total rainfall as bias rel r t o t then we can yield a linear function of bias rel r t o t through multi step derivation as follows bias rel d t o t δ r tot r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot c 1 p tot c 1 p tot c 2 c 1 1 δ p tot p tot 1 c 2 c 1 δ p tot p tot c 2 c 1 1 c 2 c 1 bias rel r t o t c 2 c 1 1 as can be seen bias rel d t o t will be always greater than bias rel r t o t as long as c 2 c 1 is above 1 in contrast if c 2 c 1 0 1 it largely means total rainfall is decreased i e δ p tot is below zero and δ p tot p tot 1 0 as such we can determine that 1 δ p tot p tot must be non negative and bias rel d t o t 1 bias rel r t o t given the obtained equation below bias rel d t o t c 2 c 1 1 δ p tot p tot 1 c 2 c 1 1 bias rel r t o t 1 considering bias rel r t o t is less than zero here we can conclude bias rel d t o t bias rel r t o t that is hydrological processes amplify the rainfall resolution effects the analysis against the simulation of peak discharge is similar but the connotation of the parameter c e g c 1 and c 2 is different its magnitude will be affected by more factors e g infiltration water depth etc instead of a single major factor i e infiltration such difference is expected to alter the extent of the amplification effects induced by hydrological processes but is insufficient to subvert it 
2479,increased population is exposed to urban flooding as a result of climate change flood early warning can largely reduce the loss of life and asset while how detailed rainfall information is enough has always been a critical issue in achieving robust flood forecasting previous analysis has been limited by lacking high resolution rainfall observation or a spatially matched urban hydrological model this study couples mature modeling technologies with comprehensive hydro meteorological measurement that is comprised of x band polarimetric radar 75 m 3 min weather stations and hydrometric stations and this study further attempts to understand the rainfall spatial resolution effects and critical resolutions from a multi scale perspective e g block district and catchment scales the results show that coarser resolutions always lead to underestimation of peak flows even exceeding 40 in the case of adopting 10 km rainfall data at the block scale but such damping effects on discharge simulation can be largely attenuated with increased hydrological scale in general spatial resolutions of higher than 500 m and 10 km are needed to obtain accurate simulation results i e keep the relative bias within 20 at district and catchment scales while at least 300 m for the block scale in conclusion refined rainfall forcing contributes to better simulation of peak flows in urban hydrological modeling but the required rainfall spatial resolution changes with the scale of hydrological application these findings help to better achieve the balance between rainfall observation cost and flood simulation accuracy keywords urban hydrology precipitation flood hydrological scale data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction damaging floods occur more frequently over the past decades owing to the combination of global climate change and ongoing urbanization oh and sushama 2020 slater et al 2021 westra et al 2014 yin et al 2018 which has evolved into a major concern globally in particular for the cities situated in flood prone areas disaster losses might be dramatically aggravated given the widespread presence of population and social assets tanoue et al 2016 wing et al 2020 to deal with the growing risk induced by urban flooding model based flood forecasting and efficacy evaluation of adaptive solutions are crucial as with the construction of structural countermeasures chao et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 zang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and sufficient rainfall information becomes a key to ensure the accuracy of simulated results and meet the requirements of various practical applications thorndahl et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2021 chao et al 2021 rainfall spatial distribution often is highly heterogeneous in urban areas emmanuel et al 2012 peleg et al 2018 wright et al 2014 partly because of the joint effects of both thermodynamics and kinetics of urban canopy fowler et al 2021 masson et al 2020 more importantly the urban hydrological response always presents high sensitivity to rainfall variability berne et al 2004 bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 peleg et al 2017 due to the characteristics of urban catchment including high impervious coverage varied land cover types as well as complicated drainage systems thus refined rainfall measurements are essential to support urban hydrological applications e g local waterlogging simulation drainage performance evaluation and fluvial flood forecasting in a spatially explicit way de vos et al 2018 wen et al 2021 however it has to be noted that high resolution in rainfall measurements always comes at a cost while cannot substantially improve model performance in some cases hence understanding the effects of rainfall spatial resolution and the added value of detailed measurements is vital to improving rainfall monitoring schemes and flood early warning capacity cristiano et al 2017 in the 1990s schilling 1991 uttered a thought provoking question rainfall data for urban hydrology what do we need and pointed out that joint efforts of meteorological and hydrological communities are needed to enable refined rainfall measuring and urban hydrologic modeling simultaneously with the advances in rainfall measurement technology scientists first attempted to identify the requirement of rainfall data in urban hydrology based on the rainfall estimation bias due to resolution changes einfalt et al 2004 fabry et al 1994 shortly afterward berne et al 2004 combined rainfall measurements with discharge records to investigate the required rainfall resolution for six different urban catchments but still no model was used up to the early 2010 s the analysis approach that relies on the combination of high resolution rainfall measurements and well established urban models emerges gradually in the studies related to urban hydrology for example notaro et al 2013 investigated the impacts of rainfall resolution in a 0 7 km2 urban catchment in italy by running a semi distributed urban hydrological model with the rainfall input derived from rain gauges in this study 1 7 km is identified as a critical resolution for urban hydrological applications gires et al 2015 examined small scale rainfall variability and its impacts on hydrological response in an urban area of 1 47 km2 based on the rainfall measurements derived from c band radar 1 km in space and two hydrological models with different discretization methods i e semi distributed and fully distributed results show that the fully distributed model presents higher sensitivity to rainfall resolution against the semi distributed model and higher resolution data from x band radar are suggested to further confirm the added value of refined measurements thus bruni et al 2015 revisited the rainfall resolution effects on hydrodynamic modeling in an urbanized catchment of 3 4 km2 taking x band radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe products as the meteorological forcing results indicate rainfall data of sufficient spatial resolution are critical to reproduce urban hydrologic response in the same year ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 conducted a similar work but extended it to seven catchments of similar size 3 8 km2 aiming to provide additional evidence on the added value of higher resolution rainfall estimates results show that the impacts of rainfall resolution can be reduced with increased catchment area the two studies above have provided important insights into the issues related to rainfall resolution but storm transposition strategies i e transfer storm data from the place of its occurrence to another place were adopted due to the lack of refined rainfall measurements in the study area that means model calibration validation is not allowed which may result in relatively large uncertainty as can be seen concurrently current studies in this direction are still few and mainly confined to the district scale within several square kilometers which is not adequate to support urban hydrologic applications concerning other scales e g runoff regulation at the block scale and flood forecasting at the catchment scale the consistencies and variations of rainfall resolution effects across a wider range of scales still wait for answers and the critical spatial resolutions need to be revisited from a multi scale perspective changes in urban hydrological scales not only imply different drainage area sizes but more importantly the contrasting drainage modes e g overland flow pipe flow open channel flow etc which is closely related to the hydrological response regime and expected to make different requirements for rainfall measurements hence this study attempts to clarify the added value of higher resolution rainfall data from a more comprehensive perspective specifically it is dedicated to elucidating the consistencies and variations among different scales centering on the following three issues 1 how rainfall spatial resolution influences urban hydrological simulation 2 why such impacts occur 3 what the critical spatial resolution is this study is performed for a range of nested urban catchments in beijing china with the size ranging from 0 01 km2 to 200 km2 and distinct drainage modes simultaneously detailed geographical data refined rainfall data from x band radar and well recorded river stage data are collected to improve the reliability of simulated results as described in section 2 section 3 is dedicated to the methodology including the urban hydrological model rainfall upscaling scheme and the involved evaluation criteria against model performance section 4 organizes the results aiming at the concerns of this study and thereafter the innovations contributions and limitations are discussed in section 5 section 6 provides closure with some findings and recommendations 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the qing river catchment is an urban catchment of 200 km2 situated in beijing china which is densely populated and covered by above 50 impervious areas as shown in fig 1 it is well monitored by multiple hydro meteorological instruments including 10 weather stations two x band dual polarization weather radars and one hydrometric station the observing system can resolve the small scale variability of rainfall fields and thus provide good data support for this study data from the hydrometric station can be applied in model validation to improve the reliability of the simulated results also a multi layer drainage system has been formed in the catchment consisting of slope surface stormwater pipe and river channel among them the qing river as the main artery plays an important role in flood protection through conveying the stormwater to wenyu river rapidly see fig 1a the stormwater pipes are used to capture the excessing runoff coming from different slope surfaces and transport it to the river channel 2 2 geographical distributed data despite the high impervious rate the spatial distribution of land cover types presents significant fragmentation due to the intervention of various vegetation e g cropland forest lawn etc hence refined data of 10 m resolution in space is first adopted to reflect the spatial variability of land covers chen et al 2019 the 30 m digital elevation model i e dem data for terrain delineation is derived from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa http dwtkns com srtm30m to comprehensively consider infiltration related characteristics a dataset dedicated to depicting the spatial distribution of soil types is collected from the harmonized world soil database hwsd http westdc westgis ac cn of which the spatial resolution is 1 km river channel data including spatial distribution and cross sectional size are obtained from the local water management department to consider the pipe flow during heavy rains the pipe network dataset of the qing river catchment is constructed based on the road information provided by the open street map osm project http download geofabrik de and the field survey e g consulting relevant departments combining both the research objective and the actual situation learned from relevant management departments some reasonable generalizations and assumptions are made here 1 the primary and secondary road information are extracted from osm and utilized to characterize the spatial distribution of main stormwater pipes 2 all pipes are made of reinforced concrete and put under the road with a burial depth of 1 m and a slope of 1 3 the primary roads are underlain by square culverts with a size of 3000 2500 mm while round pipes with a diameter of φ2000 mm for the secondary roads it has to be noted that pipe diameters are always varied with the range in reality and the closer to downstream the larger here pipe diameters are set as the maximum values in the realistic situation i e constants aiming to ensure the study feasibility and get as close as possible to the real drainage condition of the qing river catchment during the studied rainfall events 2 3 rainfall data two x band dual polarization weather radars are employed to provide refined rainfall measurements at 75 m spatial resolution and 3 min temporal resolution which are situated at the north and east of the qing river catchment respectively the two weather radars have the same specifications minimum detection distance of 750 m maximum detection distance of 75 km and a beamwidth of 0 95 both radars adopt the vcp21 scanning mode and complete the scanning at nine elevation angles from 0 5 to 19 5 within 3 min generally observation at lower elevation angles is beneficial to get more accurate ground rainfall information but simultaneously more susceptible to signal attenuation due to beam blockage in this study 1 45 elevation angle is identified as the minimum effective elevation angle and all rainfall data are derived from the observation at this elevation angle all the radar technical parameters are detailed in table 1 as shown in fig 1b the largest distance from the catchment boundary to any one of the radars is within 50 km which is far less than the radar detection range of 75 km the two radars have been operational intermittently since 2017 seven storm events with contrasting characteristics involving both spatial distribution and rainfall intensity are selected from all the available data for analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of rainfall total for the seven events that can be roughly categorized into two groups 1 center concentrated e g event 1 and 2 edge concentrated e g event 4 and event 5 as summarized in table 2 two dominant directions of storm movement are detected northwest and southwest the storm event with the maximum of both rainfall total and peak intensity comes from the southwest direction which is also characterized by the longest duration close to three days it has to be noted that employing two radars just aims to capture more rainfall events in case of the influence of signal attenuation or other factors that is all the rainfall data are directly derived from a single radar instead of mosaic products of the two radars additionally 10 weather stations are evenly distributed in the catchment as shown in fig 1a which can provide hourly data of precipitation with reliable quality based on the selected events above station data for the corresponding periods are extracted to verify the quality of radar rainfall estimation 2 4 hydrological records the data of the river stage for four rainfall events including event 1 event 2 event 3 and event 6 are obtained from the local water authority which is recorded in hour intervals the hydrometric station is located at the lower reaches of the catchment see fig 1a which can control most of the whole catchment and almost all the urban areas the data can provide a good benchmark for model performance evaluation and improve the reliability of simulated results to some extent 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall estimation and spatial aggregation x band dual polarization radars can provide additional polarimetric parameters in addition to radar reflectivity zh e g differential phase ψdp specific differential phase kdp differential reflectivity zdr and correlation coefficient ρhv bringi and chandrasekar 2001 that enables the multi dimensional depiction of hydrometeors and provides more paths for rainfall estimation compared to zh kdp is less sensitive to hail contamination and immune to attenuation in rains ryzhkov and zrnić 1996 which aids in achieving more accurate rainfall estimation hence the kdp based method is chosen here to quantitatively estimate instantaneous rainfall rate r shown as the following formula 1 r k dp a k dp b among them r kdp denotes the rainfall rate at a given kdp mm h kdp denotes specific differential phase km a and b are statistical parameters associated with rainfall characteristics in this study the raindrop size distribution for a lot of rainfall events are derived from 11 laser distrometers in beijing china and utilized to generate the regional parameter scheme resultantly a 15 83 b 0 7727 it has to be noted that quality control against radar detected polarimetric parameters has been conducted before rainfall estimation consists of two key steps 1 eliminating non meteorological echoes based on the value of ρhv and the texture i e standard deviation of zh 2 correcting ψdp with linear programming algorithm to ensure its range derivation i e kdp subject to the non negative constraint giangrande et al 2013 based on the inherent relationship between r and kdp precipitation data at 75 m polar pixels can be obtained to lift both the compatibility with the hydrological model and the comparability with previous studies the precipitation data are projected onto a rectangular coordinate system and mapped to regular grids of 100 m subsequently a comprehensive evaluation of the radar qpe results is conducted for all hours of the events studied based on the weather station measurements fig 3 shows that the correlation coefficient cc between radar and weather station observation can reach 0 85 the mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse are 5 93 2 44 and 0 04 respectively which presents good consistency finally spatial aggregations i e averaging in space are made to generate another five sets of precipitation data with coarser resolutions including 300 m 500 m 1 km 3 km and 10 km 3 2 grid based urban hydrological model guhm given the fragmentized land cover widespread micro topography and complicated routing paths in urban areas adopting a discretization scheme based on fine grids is of great importance to reproduce hydrological processes cao et al 2020b hence a grid based urban hydrological model is built referring to the model structure and algorithm used in the previous works smith et al 2015 cao et al 2021 cao et al 2020b which discretizes the whole catchment into 20 000 regular grids with the size of 100 m corresponding to the highest resolution in rainfall datasets three layers of drainage structure are adopted here to explicitly depict the drainage mode in the urbanized catchment including slope surface stormwater pipe and river channel each grid unit is further subdivided into pervious and impervious areas to comprehensively consider various land cover types e g forest cropland urban etc by area weighting approach direct runoff is derived by subtracting interception and infiltration from the rainfall infiltration is only calculated on the pervious area using the green ampt equation brakensiek and onstad 1977 if the grid intersects stormwater pipes the generated runoff will flow into the stormwater pipe network otherwise it will flow onto adjacent grids according to the flow direction determined by the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 based on underlying surface elevation after flowing into the pipe network the generated runoff is further routed into river channels flow in both pipe networks and river channels uniformly uses the one dimensional dynamic wave approach for simulation overland flow calculation includes two steps flow inside the grid and routing between adjacent grids the nonlinear reservoir algorithm rossman 2015 is selected to calculate the overland flow inside grids with proper feature width and slope and the obtained outflow is then evenly distributed over the downstream grid despite both the model structure and involved algorithms adopted herein are well established and have been examined repeatedly in previous studies cao et al 2020a cao et al 2020b parameter calibration is still an essential step before application in particular for the parameters with large uncertainties or closely related to the scale of model grid in general the parameters associated with impervious rate and drainage system roughness can be determined directly based on the landcover type and pipe channel material and calibration is not required while urban soils may be compacted or loosened due to human activities thereby resulting in large uncertainties in soil infiltration parameters e g saturated hydraulic conductivity ks metric pressure at the wetting front ψf and initial soil moisture deficit θ also the key routing parameters n i e the roughness of pervious area and pr i e the subgrid routing percent have significant scale dependency and need to be calibrated according to cao et al 2020b thus using 100 m qpe products as model input a total of five parameters were calibrated against the river water stage observations and a single parameter set optimized for all the four rainfall events i e event1 event2 event3 and event6 was obtained fig 4 shows that the results between the simulation and the observation present a high degree of consistency where nse coefficients can reach 0 7 or even close to 0 9 and the peak error can be controlled within 0 1 m given that there is generally a strong correlation between river stage and discharge in urban channels liao and knight 2007 lindner and miller 2012 hence the good consistency of river stage simultaneously demonstrate the capacity of guhm to reproduce the discharge process in terms of both timing and magnitude it has to be noted that all the model parameters remain fixed while the rainfall resolution is coarsened 3 3 definition of typical scales in urban hydrology the urban area is generally equipped with a complicated drainage system involving both natural and artificial components in case of heavy rainfall generated runoff can be drained out via multi layer paths including slope surface stormwater pipes and river channels as such changes might occur in not only the drainage area but drainage mode under different urban hydrological scales considering the discrepancy in both drainage area and drainage mode three typical scales in urban hydrology can be identified e g block scale district scale and catchment scale as illustrated in fig 5 a street block can be roughly represented by a space that is bounded by a closed street and filled with buildings in general it is assumed as the basic functional unit in urban planning with a minimum size of 0 01 km2 long et al 2016 xia et al 2020 for a small sized block the conveyance of direct runoff mainly relies on overland flow i e the slope surface is the main drainage path numerous blocks will form a drainage district that is generally equipped with stormwater pipes to capture the runoff and characterized with a size of several square kilometers multiple drainage districts constitute a river catchment where river channels as an additional drainage pathway will play a critical role in excessing runoff conveyance given that the size of the model unit is exactly 0 01 km2 approaching 10 000 upstream grids i e without inflow are selected to explore the hydrological response at the block scale and a total of 25 drainage districts with sizes within 1 10 km2 are picked based on the topological structure of the drainage network as shown in fig 1a the whole qing river catchment is considered as an instance of catchment scale 3 4 evaluation index taking the simulation results forced by 100 m rainfall data as the baseline the model performance with coarser rainfall input is evaluated from two aspects the relative biases of total discharge and peak discharge the equations used to compute the evaluation indexes are shown as follows 2 bias rel var x var 100 m var 100 m 100 where biasrel denotes the relative bias of simulation var100m and varx denote the simulated hydrological variable e g total discharge and peak discharge at the rainfall resolution of 100 m and respectively also the bias transformation rate from rainfall to discharge is calculated as equation 3 which involves two aspects as well the bias transformation from total rainfall to total discharge and that from peak rainfall to peak discharge 3 r trans bias r a b s bias d a b s 100 where rtrans denotes the transformation rate of bias biasr abs and biasd abs denote the absolute bias in rainfall estimation and discharge simulation respectively here the calculation of the simulation bias under different resolutions is still based on the model outputs with 100 m rainfall forcing 4 results based on 42 rainfall inputs seven rainfall cases six rainfall resolutions and 10 000 areas including 10 000 blocks 25 drainage districts and one catchment 400 000 groups of rainfall statistics e g total and peak rainfall and discharge simulation results e g total and peak discharge are obtained taking the 100 m rainfall observations and the corresponding hydrological simulation results as truth the bias of both rainfall and discharge under other resolution conditions can be calculated thereby generating the bias ensemble simultaneously the bias results under specific rain events or urban hydrological scales can be extracted to get the bias sample sets i e the sub ensembles accordingly the results are organized around the following three aspects 1 sensitivity analysis of urban hydrological simulation 2 bias propagation analysis from rainfall to discharge 3 threshold analysis of rainfall spatial resolutions both uncertainty and comparative analysis are conducted to improve the understanding of the added value of high resolution rainfall data in particular its variation at different typical scales 4 1 sensitivity analysis of urban hydrological simulation the resolution of rainfall input is recognized as a key error source to urban hydrologic application while its impacts are likely to be changed with hydrological scales especially when distinct changes occur in drainage mode hence sensitivity analysis is carried out across the block district and catchment scales to reveal the rainfall resolution effects comprehensively relative biases of two hydrological variables i e total discharge and peak discharge are selected as the evaluation index and the ensemble medians are calculated to assess the magnitude of resolution effects the interval between upper and lower quartiles is adopted to quantify the uncertainty of the impacts 4 1 1 impacts on total discharge fig 6 a shows that the impacts on total discharge are bi directional and can be further aggravated with decreased rainfall spatial resolution in terms of the block scale over and underestimation of 20 can be yielded in the case of adopting the rainfall input of 10 km resolution while in light of the ensemble median resolution impacts on total discharge are close to zero which reflects the inherent relation between different rainfall data i e spatial averaging can lead to rainfall redistribution among adjacent blocks but is subject to mass balance however given the selected blocks especially the drainage districts cannot cover the rainfall field completely thus slight deviations between ensemble median and zero value can be detected contrasting to the block scale total discharge response at the district scale presents more sensitivity to the change of rainfall resolution rainfall input of 3 km resolution may lead to a 20 of relative bias and overestimation of above 40 probably occurs in cases of adopting 10 km rainfall data total discharge response at the catchment scale is less sensitive to rainfall resolution with the relative bias keeping steady within 10 4 1 2 impacts on peak discharge fig 6b shows that bi directional effects on the simulation of peak discharge exist as well i e the decrease of rainfall spatial resolution may lead to both over and underestimation however the ensemble median bias uniformly presents a negative value under whatever scenarios which means underestimation effects are dominant for the simulation of peak flow also such effects can be further amplified with decreased rainfall resolution in general the damping effects on peak discharge are most prominent at the block scale with an ensemble median bias exceeding 40 in the case of adopting 10 km rainfall resolution followed by that at the district scale but the impacts might be less predictable and even larger at the district scale once the rainfall spatial resolution is less than 1 km compared to that at the block scale this paradox is particularly the case in the rainfall resolution effects on total discharge simulation see fig 6a for the catchment scale peak discharge simulation shows the least sensitivity to rainfall spatial resolution but it is worth noting that the relative bias steeply rises from 5 to 20 from an overall perspective when the 3 km rainfall input is aggregated to 10 km this implies that a critical rainfall resolution exists for a given combination of catchment and storm scales cristiano et al 2019 4 2 bias propagation analysis from rainfall to discharge bias magnitude in hydrological simulation can be assumed as a function of the following two factors bias in rainfall estimation and bias transformation rate from rainfall to discharge given the dominant factor may change with scales it is necessary to analyze the differences of bias propagation among multiple scales and thus to push forward a step into the understanding of the detected impacts above here the ensemble of bias transformation rate is generated by combining all the cases examined and the sample sets i e the sub ensemble against specific rainfall events or urban hydrological scales are created as well 4 2 1 bias propagation in total volumes fig 7 a shows that the rtrans from total rainfall to total discharge is closely associated with the scale of concern which reaches a peak at the catchment scale with values exceeding 100 mostly also significant uncertainty in the bias transformation is detected which can be attributed to the dimension difference between storm core and catchment areas as can be seen in fig 2 the storm core generally is on the order of several square kilometers which is far below the size of the whole catchment 200 km2 that is the vast majority of rainfall can still fall within the catchment in most cases and thus only causes very limited bias in rainfall total despite the remarkable changes in rainfall spatial resolution while rainfall aggregation in space will reshape both the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall fields that may affect the regime of runoff response largely for the block scale the rtrans almost keeps steady under varying rainfall resolutions which reflects the effective impervious level of the selected blocks in general the minimum rtrans of the total volume always occurs at the district scale which remains below 10 under any resolution condition 4 2 2 bias propagation in peak values compared to the bias propagation in total volume the rtrans of peak value is significantly reduced especially at the catchment scale where the rtrans falls into the interval from 50 to 100 in most cases as shown in fig 7b it is largely because that spatial averaging due to resolution decrease will cause non negligible impacts on the estimation of peak rainfall and thus constrain the rtrans to some extent the relationship of rtrans among the three scales remains consistent as aforementioned i e rtrans at catchment scale presents the largest uncertainty followed by the block scale and district scale in terms of the ensemble median the rtrans can always remain below 30 no matter what resolution and scale it is worth noting that the decrease of rainfall resolution amplifies the rtrans at the block scale which suggests that decreased rainfall intensity probably results in a dramatic drop in peak discharge subject to the infiltration excess runoff mechanism especially for small land parcels with limited runoff regulation capacity 4 3 threshold analysis of rainfall spatial resolutions data requirements for multi scale urban hydrology are combed based upon the recognition of rainfall resolution effects taking model outputs forced by 100 m rainfall data as the benchmark and the relative bias of 20 as the maximum permissible bias threshold analysis is conducted systematically regarding both rainfall characterization and discharge simulation 4 3 1 critical resolution for rainfall characterization fig 8 a indicates that spatial resolutions of 500 m 1 km and 10 km are required to accurately characterize the total rainfall 95 guarantee rate at block district and catchment scales respectively in contrast grasping the magnitude of peak rainfall calls for higher spatial resolution as shown in fig 8b where the rainfall data of 300 m are no longer competent at the block scale also it can be concluded from fig 8a and b that s band radar usually at 1 km resolution can capture the rainfall characteristics i e total and peak at the district and basin scale and above 50 probability for that at the block scale while satellite products usually at 10 km resolution can only be applied to rainfall measuring at the basin scale regarding the results under both 95 and 50 guarantee rates 4 3 2 critical resolution for discharge simulation fig 8 shows that discharge simulation always puts forward higher requirements for spatial resolution compared to rainfall characterization that means the process of hydrologic response can further amplify the resolution effects compared to that on rainfall characterization such amplified effect is particularly the case for hydrological simulations at the district scale where a sharp rise from 1 km to 300 m is detected for the required rainfall resolutions in contrast the hydrological response at the catchment scale is relatively insensitive to the decrease of resolution and improving the rainfall resolution from 10 km to 3 km is adequate for the block scale rainfall input is very demanding where even 300 m data cannot reproduce the peak discharge very well 5 discussion the urban hydrological response always presents significant sensitivity to the change of rainfall condition which implies the missing of small scale rainfall variability may lead to sobering failures in flood forecasting hence deep insights into the rainfall spatial resolution effects are of great importance for the advances in urban hydrology and widely hydrological applications thanks to mature modeling technologies and the comprehensive measurement system comprising x band radar 3 min 75 m weather stations and hydrometric stations this study can revisit the impact of rainfall spatial resolution on urban hydrological modeling with more robustness more importantly its variation across scales i e different urban hydrological scales is investigated as well to enhance the understanding of the scale dependency of rainfall resolution effects as with all the previous studies on rainfall resolution effects the rainfall events and the selected catchment are still a subset of all the potential combination scenarios worldwide however through explicitly incorporating the typical factors in urban hydrology e g drainage area and drainage mode we obtain some new insights 1 larger drain area does not always lead to attenuated rainfall resolution effects for a given rainfall event e g extreme impacts may take place at the district scale instead of the block scale when the resolution is less than 1 km see fig 6 2 1 km rainfall input is inadequate for the hydrological application at the district scale with the order of several square kilometers i e a higher requirement for rainfall resolution is identified compared to previous works obled et al 1994 segond et al 2007 which can be attributed to the role of the dense drainage system and a high impervious degree in the urban area 3 discharge simulation calls for the higher resolution against rainfall characterization which implies hydrological processes can further amplify the errors in rainfall observation in general hydrological processes will cause damping effects on the changes triggered by coarser rainfall measurements via surface routing and soil infiltration as shown in fig 9 a and 9b while it may amplify rainfall relative biases due to the change of runoff coefficient and thus dramatically aggravate the rainfall resolution effects on discharge simulation see fig 9c and d the corresponding theoretical derivation of the amplified effects induced by hydrological processes can be found in appendix a these findings help to form a more complete understanding regarding both the impacts of rainfall resolution and the uncertainty in urban hydrological forecasting simultaneously it can provide some reference for device deployment and data selection rainfall resolution which are expected to improve urban flood forecasting in a cost effective way given the fact that resolution always comes at a cost based on the knowledge obtained herein future research can pay attention to the impacts of rainfall spatial resolution on the simulation of urban waterlogging i e the urban surface inundation process though waterlogging disaster always results from excessing discharge river discharge and pipe discharge the linkage and difference between the forecasting of discharge and waterlogging deserve to be further identified additionally given the rainfall resolution requirement is a complex function of the relationship between storm and catchment characteristics a regional based resolution scheme is expected to generate in future efforts which enable automatic resolution setting under any specific hydro meteorological condition 6 conclusions we have constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising high resolution hydrological meteorological and geographical information based on which a grid based urban hydrological model is built and spatial aggregation is carried out to generate rainfall inputs with different resolutions e g 100 m 300 m 500 m 1 km 3 km and 10 km a model based approach is adopted to evaluate the rainfall resolution effects on discharge simulation in urban areas taking the outputs under 100 m rainfall inputs as the benchmark quantitative analysis is conducted at three typical scales related to urban hydrology e g block district and catchment aiming to shed light on the scale inconsistency in terms of impact magnitude bias propagation and the critical rainfall resolution the main findings include 1 rainfall aggregation in space i e lower spatial resolution always leads to random under and overestimation bias in urban hydrological modeling while evident regularity can be detected from a large sample overall the simulation of total discharge is less sensitive to the change in rainfall spatial resolution while decreased resolution will lead to dramatic underestimation of peak discharge with a maximum bias above 40 see fig 6b the resolution effects are closely associated with the spatial scale of concern but the increase of scale is not doomed to attenuate the impacts more significant impacts on discharge simulation might occur at a larger scale once rainfall spatial resolution is less than a given value for example larger impacts on total discharge take place at the district scale instead of the block scale under 3 km rainfall input see fig 6a and similarly larger underestimation occurs at the catchment scale rather than the district scale under 10 km rainfall input see fig 6b 2 the dominant bias inducing factor of discharge simulation changes with scale this is particularly prominent for the comparison between the district and catchment scales in general rainfall resolution effects are more significant at the district scale compared to the catchment scale while bias transformation rates are far less than that at the catchment scale that is rainfall characterization at the district scale presents large sensitivity to the change in spatial resolution in contrast bias in areal rainfall totals is always small at the catchment scale while likely transforming into the non negligible bias of discharge due to the changes in rainfall distribution 3 urban hydrological processes can amplify the relative bias in rainfall and resultantly exacerbate the need for high resolution rainfall observations also grasping the peak value needs more rigorous rainfall input compared to reproducing the total discharge in general spatial resolutions of 300 m and 3 km are sufficient for discharge simulation at the district and catchment scales respectively in the case of taking the relative bias of 20 as the maximum permissible bias for hydrological applications at the block scale rainfall input is very demanding where even 300 m data cannot reproduce the peak discharge very well by coupling x band dual polarization weather radar qpe with the urban hydrological model this study gains some new insights into rainfall resolution effects and provides additional evidence for the added value of refined measurements in urban areas it can be an important reference for optimizing the deployment of weather stations and for scientifically picking the forcing data of models simultaneously such findings help to build a scientific paradigm for urban hydrological modeling in the context of increased rainfall variability

natural science foundation of china 51679119 appendix a theoretical derivations of the amplification effects induced by urban hydrological processes here we seek to prove the amplification effects of urban hydrological processes in a theoretical way i e explaining why the relative bias in discharge simulation is always larger than that in rainfall characterization as we know total discharge r tot is a function of volume rainfall p tot which can be expressed simply as r tot c 1 p tot where c 1 is the runoff coefficient once changes occur in total rainfall δ p tot the runoff coefficient will change along with it subject to infiltration excess runoff mechanism and the resultant total discharge can be calculated as r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot where c 2 is the runoff coefficient under the changed rainfall condition as such we can derive the amount of change in total discharge δ r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot c 1 p tot assuming the relative bias in total discharge as bias rel d t o t δ r tot r tot and that in total rainfall as bias rel r t o t then we can yield a linear function of bias rel r t o t through multi step derivation as follows bias rel d t o t δ r tot r tot c 2 p tot δ p tot c 1 p tot c 1 p tot c 2 c 1 1 δ p tot p tot 1 c 2 c 1 δ p tot p tot c 2 c 1 1 c 2 c 1 bias rel r t o t c 2 c 1 1 as can be seen bias rel d t o t will be always greater than bias rel r t o t as long as c 2 c 1 is above 1 in contrast if c 2 c 1 0 1 it largely means total rainfall is decreased i e δ p tot is below zero and δ p tot p tot 1 0 as such we can determine that 1 δ p tot p tot must be non negative and bias rel d t o t 1 bias rel r t o t given the obtained equation below bias rel d t o t c 2 c 1 1 δ p tot p tot 1 c 2 c 1 1 bias rel r t o t 1 considering bias rel r t o t is less than zero here we can conclude bias rel d t o t bias rel r t o t that is hydrological processes amplify the rainfall resolution effects the analysis against the simulation of peak discharge is similar but the connotation of the parameter c e g c 1 and c 2 is different its magnitude will be affected by more factors e g infiltration water depth etc instead of a single major factor i e infiltration such difference is expected to alter the extent of the amplification effects induced by hydrological processes but is insufficient to subvert it
