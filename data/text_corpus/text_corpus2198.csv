10990,climate change associated drought stress in plants is one of the major environmental factors that cause a reduction in plant growth development and productivity therefore an improvement to obtain superior genotypes that are highly adaptable to arid and semi arid conditions remains the main objective of the future breeding efforts in this context the present study was conducted to determine the genotypic differences among 16 inbred lines and 4 commercial cultivars of pumpkin associated with the parameters such as certain fruit characteristics seed yield and seed quality in irrigated and drought conditions in the growing season of pumpkin the amount of irrigation water applied was 402 6 mm in 2017 and 425 4 mm in 2018 in all the evaluated parameters the examined genotypes exhibited a wide range of significant differences between the irrigated and drought conditions in both the years moreover a significant positive correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit number seed thickness and plant height and 1000 seed weight and seed size in terms of seed quality 1000 seed weight was determined to be a prominent parameter the results of the present study demonstrated that these relationships imply a significant potential for the selection of genotypes with superior performance in both conditions furthermore principal component analysis pca performed considering the eigenvalues indicated that the yield and quality components could be explained strongly by the pca analysis in irrigated as well as in drought conditions finally the inbred line g9 was observed to be the most superior genotype in terms of yield and fruit number in both irrigation and drought conditions therefore this inbred line is envisaged to be evaluated in future breeding studies and to be included in future hybrid programs in order to develop drought tolerant cultivars keywords breeding pumpkin water stress pca 1 introduction climate change rapid population growth indiscriminate and excessive consumption and a shortage of fresh and clean water resources have led to irrigation problems rijsberman 2006 plants exposed to arid conditions must be capable of adapting to such environmental conditions or adapt to water stress in order to serve as economically viable crops shubha and tyagı 2007 therefore using the genotypes with a higher ability to adapt to arid conditions has been established as the main criterion in the breeding efforts for the development of novel drought tolerant cultivars akashi et al 2005 karipçin et al 2009 with an increase in arid and semi arid areas in the world there is an increasing inclination toward the cultivation of plants such as appetizers squash which is able to utilize water effectively and economically despite increased production the maintenance of desired commercial qualities in a cultivar remains one of the most important constraints encountered in this field therefore it is required that drought tolerant genotypes be identified in order to allow the development of tolerant cultivars to meet the food demand of the future world cucurbita pepo c moschata and c maxima constitute economically important species of the cucurbitaceae family which are cultivated throughout the world among these species c pepo is used in human nutrition the mature seeds and flowers of the plants of the aforementioned species have been used as well in addition to the consumption of its fruit pumpkin seeds contain 28 40 protein achu et al 2005 and 35 50 fat out of which 78 are unsaturated fatty acids seymen et al 2016 türkmen et al 2015 pumpkin seeds are a source of vitamin a c and e eleiwa et al 2014 ghanbari et al 2007 ondigi et al 2008 and are rich in mineral substances such as potassium phosphorus calcium magnesium and iron which are important for human nutrition seymen et al 2016 pumpkin seeds in addition to being consumed as an appetizer are used as food additives in several products such as bread salami sausage and mayonnaise because of their high protein content mansour et al 1993 rangahau 2002 moreover pumpkin seeds are produced for medicinal purposes in russia and certain african countries murkovic et al 1996 pumpkin seeds contain significant levels of antioxidants tocopherols and tocotrienols which have been reported to reduce the risk of certain types of cancers such as gastric breast lung and colorectal cancers lee et al 1999 goodman et al 2004 nesaretnam et al 2007 stevenson et al 2007 lelley et al 2009 furthermore pumpkin seeds have been reported to be rich in phytosterols which play a key role in lowering the cholesterol levels and in reducing benign prostate hyperplasia gossell williams et al 2006 fruhwirth and hermetter 2007 hong et al 2009 thompson and grundy 2005 owing to their constituents the pumpkin seeds have been reported to exert promotive and protective effects on the human immune system chew and park 2004 the production of pumpkin has been observed to be increasing due to reasons such lesser water requirement compared to several other agricultural species ability to grow in absence of irrigation in certain areas which receive sufficient rainfall and in rotation with the field crops harvest ease availability of mechanized cultural processes ability to be relatively resistant to diseases and pests and no requirement for storage pumpkin also exhibits a higher economic yield in arid and semi arid regions compared to other agricultural products such as wheat barley and chickpeas the objective of the present study was to identify drought tolerant pumpkin lines associated with yield fruit and seed characteristics through an experimentation conducted for two years in irrigated as well as non irrigated conditions with 20 pumpkin genotypes the superior drought tolerant pumpkin cultivar candidates selected as a result of the study would also contribute to the gene pool for future breeding efforts for the development of drought tolerant hybrid pumpkin cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and climate characteristics of the experimental area the present study was conducted during the months of may and september in years 2017 and 2018 at the faculty of agriculture selcuk university konya located at 38 05 n 32 36 e at an altitude of 1006 m in central anatolia turkey konya is an area which is agriculturally important and comprises approximately 1 9 million hectares of arable land which constitutes 8 of the total agricultural land assets in turkey according to long term climate data konya plain has an arid and semi arid climate and the total amount of annual rainfall received in this region is only 320 mm of which only 90 100 mm of rainfall occurs during the plant growing season may september in addition the evaporation observed in the region in the plant growing season is greater than 1000 mm fig 1 therefore irrigation becomes a necessity for crop production in this area in the present study certain climatic parameters such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were measured and recorded on an hourly basis by using a portable automated weather station davis vantage pro 2 located at the center of the study area the total amount of precipitation during the period between the sowing of the pumpkin seeds and their harvest as observed in the present study was approximately 90 mm in 2017 and 70 mm in 2018 the temperature reached 40 c and the relative humidity dropped to 35 especially in the months of july and august the average wind speed during the study period was between 2 5 3 m s the climate data for the experimental years 2017 and 2018 were in accordance with the long term average climate data available for the region the soil of the study area has a silty clayey loamy texture the organic matter content present in 0 90 cm of the soil profile ph and the bulk density values of the soil in the study area ranged from 1 43 to 2 16 7 44 7 50 1 28 1 32 g cm3 respectively the value of total available water taw in the upper 90 cm of the soil profile in the study area was 140 7 mm there is no hurdle in the pumpkin cultivation in terms of physical and chemical properties of the soil in the studied region 2 2 plant material planting and irrigation in the present study pumpkin genotypes that were collected from different regions of turkey were used as plant material the pumpkin genotypes were self pollinated for several years to reach the s7 level subsequently 16 inbred lines that exhibited superior agronomic traits were selected from the collected gene pool in addition two hybrid g1 mertbey f1 and g2 senahanim f1 and two local cultivars g3 hatuntırnağı and g4 cercevelik with high commercial value in the market were used to serve as control group the present study was conducted using a randomized block design with three replicates in full irrigated and complete stress drought conditions each parcel consisting of 4 plant rows was designed in 4 5 m plots and the parcels were arranged 2 m from each other and 2 5 m from the blocks a total of 40 pumpkin seeds were sown by hand with 1 m row spacing and 0 5 m inter row spacing within each parcel in the present study a drip irrigation system was utilized to irrigate the plots belonging to the irrigation group round drip irrigation pipes of 5 m length 16 mm diameter and 4 l h discharge rate at a pressure of 100 kpa were placed for each plant row drippers at the lateral pipes were arranged at a distance of 50 cm from each other in consideration with the soil characteristics the lateral pipes were connected to the manifold pipes each with a diameter of 40 mm and the manifold pipes were connected to the pe main pipe with a diameter of 63 mm the amount of irrigation water required to be applied to the irrigated plots was calculated using eq 1 in consideration of the amount of cumulative water evaporation which was obtained from the class a type pan installed in the study area at seven day intervals in the programmed irrigation irrigation water was applied ten times to the experimental subjects belonging to the irrigation group at seven day intervals in the growing season of pumpkin the total amount of irrigation water applied was 402 6 mm in 2017 and 425 4 mm in 2018 table 1 1 i ep kp kc a where i amount of irrigation water liters a

applied 100 kg ha 1 n 100 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 100 kg ha 1 k2o at planting the rest of n fertilizer was applied during fruit set period at a rate of 50 kg ha 1 throughout the developmental period of the plants cultural practices such as cultivation weed control diseases management and pest management were conducted regularly twenty days prior to the harvest time irrigation was discontinued in the fully watered plots post complete drying of the plants fruits were harvested and mature seeds were extracted from these fruits 2 3 fruit and seed measurements plant length was measured at 20 day intervals in the period between flowering and the commencement of stress the fruits were harvested except in the cases of edge effects on 27 september 2017 and on 25 september 2018 the fruit number per plant was determined in proportion to the plant number in each parcel fruit width and length were measured using a large digital caliper and fruit weights were recorded using a digital scale subsequent to fruit harvest from the parcel seeds were extracted from the harvested fruits and dried under shade subsequently seed yield in each parcel was determined seed width seed length and seed thickness were measured in 20 seeds selected from each parcel by the digital caliper the 1000 seed weights were also determined for each parcel using the digital scale 2 4 evaluation of data the combined variance analysis performed for the yield and quality components obtained for both the trial years 2017 and 2018 was examined using homogeneity tests according to the results of the homogeneity tests the experimental years required to be evaluated separately as the values of yield and quality parameters were not homogeneous in terms of error variance of the years the fruit characteristics seed yield and the quality parameters were subjected to analysis of variance and the results were considered statistically significant at 1 and 5 significance levels according to duncan s test yurtsever 1984 düzgüneş et al 1987 the analysis of variance and correlation tests were performed using the spss 22 0 packaged software the present study was aimed to interpret several yield and quality parameters in combination therefore principal component analysis pca was utilized for a multivariate statistical analysis which allowed a considerable reduction in the number of parameters required to explain most of the data in this manner the values for seed yield seed characteristics and fruit characteristics obtained from the averages of results of the two experimental years in the irrigated and drought conditions were subjected to pca separately using the jmp 10 statistical program 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of drought stress on seed yield and plant length seed yield fruit number and plant length of the pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant p 0 01 in both irrigated and drought conditions for both the experimental years table 2 when considering the seed yields in the irrigated plots g1 g2 g9 g11 and g31 produced the highest yield and were statistically in the same group table 3 while g2 with an average yield of 2067 kg ha 1 was the best commercial variety among the hybrids the g9 and g31 inbred lines exhibited approximately 6 2202 kg ha 1 and 1 2114 kg ha 1 higher yields respectively in comparison to the commercial cultivars in irrigated plots the aforementioned genotypes were therefore envisaged as the inbred lines which could serve as candidates for selection as the commercial variety in irrigated conditions in full irrigated conditions the pumpkin seed yield observed in a study conducted in iran was 1700 kg ha 1 ghanbari et al 2007 in egypt was 930 kg ha 1 amer 2011 and in turkey was 1100 1200 kg ha 1 yanmaz and düzeltir 2004 it is obvious that the yield obtained in the present study was higher than the yields reported by the previous studies these higher yields could be caused by factors such as climate soil characteristics genotype planned irrigation program and drip irrigation method the drought stress resulted in about 80 reduction in the seed yield across the two seasons 2017 and 2018 drought stress was observed to exert different effects on the seed yield in the two experimental years the highest yield in the first year was obtained from g9 and g34 while the highest yield in the second year was obtained from g2 g11 g13 g14 g16 g22 and g40 in dry conditions the commercial cultivars g1 and g2 exhibited higher yields compared to the standard cultivars while among the inbred lines it was g9 and g34 that produced higher yields relative to the commercial cultivars therefore the aforementioned genotypes were considered to be the superior inbred lines which could be used for the improvement of tolerant hybrid cultivars in the arid and semi arid regions table 3 several physiological factors have been observed to be adversely affected by drought and the drought that occurs during the flowering period causes severe loss of yield farooq et al 2009 according to the result of a previous study conducted in the konya province drought resulted in severe loss of pumpkin yield yavuz et al 2015 moreover seed yield ranging from 500 to 1270 kg ha 1 at different irrigation levels and deficit irrigation exerting negative effects on the yield of pumpkin have been reported in a previous study cakir 2000 when both the experimental years are evaluated in terms of seed yield the genotypes were divided into four categories which differed in their differential yield analysis diagram fig 2 fernandez 1992 in this diagram the first category identified high yielding genotypes in irrigated as well as non irrigated conditions and included g1 g2 g9 g11 g13 g22 g32 and g40 the second category contained high yielding genotypes in the irrigated conditions and low yielding genotypes in the non irrigated conditions such as g3 g28 g30 and g31 the third category identified high yielding genotypes in the non irrigated conditions and low yielding genotypes in the irrigated conditions which comprised g14 g16 and g34 g4 g8 g25 g26 and g45 were located in the fourth category which identified the low yielding genotypes in both irrigated and non irrigated conditions it is well known from several previous reports that different genotypes respond differently to dry conditions ongom et al 2016 darkwa et al 2016 mohammadi and abdulahi 2017 therefore the determination of genotypes that are tolerant to dry conditions is crucial in the field of agricultural research according to the findings of the present study g9 and g34 genotypes which exhibited highest yields in dry conditions have been proposed as superior genotypes for arid and semi arid areas having limited water resources according to the literature by using the differential yield analyses diagram 12 genotypes in bean darkwa et al 2016 7 genotypes in wheat mohammadi and abdulahi 2017 and 5 genotypes in rice aminpanah et al 2018 have been determined as drought tolerant cultivar candidates fruit number is a parameter that has been associated directly with the yield in the first year the average fruit number observed in the irrigated plots was 1 25 while the fruit number observed in the drought conditions was 0 7 similarly in the second year the fruit number obtained in the irrigated and the non irrigated conditions was 1 26 and 0 67 respectively g9 and g45 exhibited the highest fruit number per plant in the irrigated conditions in this respect g9 g13 g14 g16 g26 g32 and g40 exhibited the highest values in dry conditions for both the experimental years table 3 in a previous study drought stress was observed to be directly related to yield and the fruit number per pumpkin plant observed in that study was 1 2 seymen et al 2012 furthermore the fruit number has been observed to decrease in pepper jeeatid et al 2018 and cucumber najarian et al 2018 as a result of drought stress plant length is an important factor in pumpkin production certain pumpkin genotypes have lateral branches while others have compact branchless structures in the present study the plant lengths of all the genotypes investigated were adversely affected by dry conditions table 4 g28 genotype was the one to exhibit the longest branches in irrigated and non irrigated conditions in both the experimental years according to the literature drought has been observed to exert a negative effect on the plant height in melon cucumis melo l kuşvuran and abak 2012 and has also been reported to cause a 31 decrease in the plant height in wild barley genotypes tyagi et al 2011 3 2 effect of drought stress on certain fruit characteristics the effects of irrigated and drought conditions on fruit weight fruit length and fruit width of a few pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant in both the experimental years p 0 01 for 2017 and p 0 05 for 2018 table 2 in the first year the average fruit weight obtained under irrigated conditions was 2 81 kg and the average fruit weight in drought conditions was 0 93 kg implying that the drought caused 67 reduction in fruit weight similarly in the second year the average fruit weights obtained in the irrigated and drought conditions were 2 58 kg and 0 77 kg respectively implying that the fruit weight decreased by 70 in drought conditions while the dry conditions in the flowering period in pumpkin caused a 37 reduction in the fruit weight the reduction observed was 67 in the fruit set period masoodi and hakimi 2017 the heaviest fruits obtained were from the g11 and g22 genotypes in the irrigated as well as in drought conditions for both the experimental years table 4 similar to the findings of the present study fruit weights reported in previous studies were 2 67 kg seymen et al 2011 3 06 kg türkmen et al 2016 and 3 48 kg masoodi and hakimi 2017 in irrigated conditions and deficit irrigation was reported to exert a negative effect on the fruit weight in pumpkin ertek et al 2004 arid conditions in the present study were observed to exert negative effects on fruit length and the fruit length was observed to decrease by 37 in the first year and by 28 in the second year similarly the decrease in the fruit width was 33 and 30 in the first and second year respectively in a previous study drought was observed to cause a 14 decrease in the fruit length and a 25 decrease in the fruit width in pumpkin yavuz et al 2017 while g32 g34 g40 and g45 lines exhibited the highest values for fruit width different genotypes were observed to exhibit different responses for fruit length in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years table 5 therefore the average fruit length and fruit width of the pumpkin genotypes were determined as 20 07 cm and 17 31 cm respectively in the irrigated plots seymen et al 2011 full irrigation conditions have been observed to exert positive effects on the fruit number fruit lenght and fruit width in previous studies on the contrary deficit irrigation has been observed to exert negative effects on the fruit characteristics ertek et al 2004 3 3 effect of drought stress on seed quality the effects of irrigated and drought conditions on 1000 seed weight seed thickness seed length and seed width of certain pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant at p 0 01 and p 0 05 levels in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 2 seed width sw is a parameter that is directly related to yield in pumpkin large and full seeds are related to enhanced yield and seed quality and are desirable among producers and consumers in the first year the average 1000 seed weight obtained in the irrigated conditions was 246 g while it was 188 g in the drought conditions implying that the 1000 seed weight decreased by 24 in the arid conditions in the second year the irrigated and non irrigated plots exhibited 253 g and 187 g of average 1000 seed weight respectively implying a decrease of 26 in arid conditions the lines g4 g11 g22 g30 and g34 produced the highest 1000 seed weight in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years and these genotypes were in the same group statistically previous studies have reported a wide range of 1000 seed weights in pumpkin in irrigated conditions for example 134 g warid et al 1993 178 g türkmen et al 2014 203 g joshi et al 1993 and 239 g türkmen et al 2016 similarly drought application in the fruit set period of pumpkin has been reported to cause a decrease of 27 in the 1000 seed weight masoodi and hakimi 2017 when compared to the irrigated conditions drought stress was observed to exert a negative effect on seed thickness which was reduced by 4 in the first year and by 14 in the second year g11 exhibited impressive seed thickness values in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years table 6 in the first year the average seed length recorded was 20 71 mm in the irrigated plots while it was 18 52 mm in the drought conditions implying that the seed length was reduced by 11 similarly the seed length values recorded in the second year were 19 86 mm and 18 52 mm in the irrigated and non irrigated plots respectively implying that the drought caused 10 reduction in the seed length in the second year similar to the findings of the present study drought stress was observed to result in a 12 reduction in the seed length and 10 reduction in the 1000 seed weight in pumpkin yavuz et al 2017 the seeds are the consumable part of pumpkin which is why longer seeds are desirable in relation to seed quality as it facilitates cracking g3 g11 and g34 exhibited the highest values for seed length and seed quality and were therefore regarded as the superior genotypes in irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years moreover drought also affected the seed width negatively and caused a decrease of 7 in the first year and 8 in the second year the highest seed width value was obtained for g11 and g32 in both the experimental years table 7 similar to the results of the present study the values for seed length and seed width recorded were 20 05 mm and 10 92 mm respectively as reported in a study by türkmen et al 2016 and 16 91 mm and 8 67 mm as reported by another study by joshi et al 1993 moreover the findings of paris and nerson 2003 demonstrated a wide range of seed length from 8 8 to 23 3 mm seed width from 5 0 to 12 5 mm and seed thickness from 1 2 to 3 8 mm in pumpkin 3 4 correlation between parameters when the correlation between the yield and the quality parameters was evaluated p 0 01 a significant positive correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit number r 0 715 in drought conditions fruit length was observed to be positively correlated with fruit weight r 0 602 and plant height r 0 685 moreover it was determined that the 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed thickness seed length seed width plant height and fruit length a similar positive and strong relationship was also determined among seed width plant height and fruit length table 8 correlatively it has been reported in a previous study that seed size exhibits a positive relationship with fruit size and seed shape in cucurbita pepo paris and nerson 2003 a positive correlation was also determined between seed thickness seed yield and fruit length under irrigated conditions in the present study similar to drought conditions 1000 seed weight demonstrated a positive relation with fruit length seed thickness seed length and seed width in the irrigated conditions as well on the other hand fruit weight was observed to have a negative relationship with fruit number and plant height there was a weak positive relationship between the seed yield and the 1000 seed weight table 9 similarly seed yield per fruit and seed size have been reported to demonstrate a weak correlation in pumpkin berenji and papp 2000 a positive relationship was observed between seed number and seed weight per fruit r 0 92 0 93 and between seed weight and seed size r 0 49 in a study by warid et al 1993 according to the findings of the present study no relationship existed between the fruit weight and the 1000 seed weight in both irrigated and drought conditions a strong relationship was observed between 1000 seed weight and seed size which confirmed 1000 seed weight as a prominent parameter in terms of seed quality on the other hand compared to irrigated conditions fruit number was identified as the decisive parameter in terms of seed yield in arid conditions which corroborated the finding that the genotypes that exhibited higher fruit number produced a greater yield 3 5 principal component analysis the two year average values of the yield fruit characteristics and seed quality parameters obtained for the pumpkin genotypes were subjected to principal component analysis pca table 10 in the principal component analysis components were generated considering the eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1 0 kamrani et al 2018 considering the eigenvalues it was observed that the first three components explained 72 51 of the total variance in the irrigated conditions and 76 24 of that in the drought conditions in order to effectively utilize and for correct interpretation of the pca it is required that the ratio of the first two or three components must be greater than 25 of the total variation mohammadi and prasanna 2003 therefore the high variance values obtained from the first three components in the present study indicated that the yield and quality components obtained in the present study could be explained strongly by the pca analysis in both irrigated and drought conditions in the irrigated conditions the first component pc1 explained 40 63 of the total variation and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with average fruit weight 1000 seed weight and seed width the second component pc2 accounted for 19 43 of the total variation while the fruit size exhibited a negative correlation a positive correlation was observed in fruit width the third component pc3 explained 12 45 of the total variation and a positive correlation was obtained between yield and fruit number while the plant height demonstrated a negative correlation with the yield and fruit number correlatively in drought conditions pc1 explained 40 61 of the total variation and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with 1000 seed weight and seed width pc2 and pc3 explained 22 35 and 13 26 of the total variation and a positive correlation was obtained between seed yield and fruit number a negative correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit length in both cases seed weight and seed width demonstrated a strong correlation in pc1 and it was revealed that these were the important parameters in the selection of drought tolerant pumpkin genotypes when the correlation table was analyzed it was observed that the 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed width and seed length therefore 1000 seed weight was considered a prominent parameter in terms of seed quality in pumpkin on the other hand high positive relationship between seed yield and fruit number appeared in the pc3 for irrigated plots while the same was identified in pc2 for drought conditions as depicted in the correlation table fruit number was an important parameter for high yield in drought conditions and therefore it was determined as an essential component in the selection of drought tolerant pumpkin genotypes in arid as well as semi arid regions in the basic component analyses performed with 20 pumpkin genotypes in irrigated conditions the distribution of the genotypes associated with the components was generated fig 3 g11 g22 g30 and g31 exhibited the highest values for fruit weight 1000 seed weight and seed width as described in the first component g9 g34 g40 and g45 exhibited the smallest values for fruit length and the highest values for fruit width as described by the second component g8 and g9 were associated with the highest yield and fruit number and the shortest plant height in the third component as depicted in fig 4 in drought conditions the highest 1000 seed weight and seed width were obtained in g11 g22 g30 and g31 as explained by the first component the second component associated g9 g13 and g14 genotypes with higher yield and fruit number as described by the third component the shortest fruits were obtained in the g45 genotype on the basis of evaluation of the irrigated and drought conditions it was observed that g11 g22 and g30 resulted in impressive seed quality and were therefore considered the prominent cultivar candidates while g9 and g28 which presented high fruit number and yield in the irrigated conditions were the highly recommendable genotypes for the irrigated conditions g9 g13 and g14 should be evaluated in arid and semi arid regions for breeding efforts in future 4 conclusion the results of the present study demonstrated that drought exerted different effects on different pumpkin genotypes and caused 80 decrease on an average in the yield in both the experimental years the parameters of 1000 seed weight and seed width which were observed to be highly correlated in pc1 were identified as important in the selection of superior genotypes in pumpkin under irrigated and drought conditions in addition it has been well documented that 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed width and seed length because of which 1000 seed weight was recommended as the most important parameter in determining the seed quality in pumpkin moreover a high positive relationship between fruit number and seed yield appeared in pc3 in the irrigated conditions while the same relationship was determined in pc2 in the drought conditions as depicted in the correlation table fruit number was important for high seed yield in the drought conditions and was therefore a determinant parameter in the selection of cultivars in arid and semi arid regions g1 and g2 hybrids were the highest yielding commercial cultivars in both irrigated and drought conditions according to the pca g11 g22 and g30 inbred lines had superior seed quality compared to the commercial cultivars due to which they were evaluated as the cultivar candidates with superior agricultural traits it is obvious that the aforementioned genotypes would gain high market value due to their significant seed quality on the other hand the g9 inbred line was observed to be the superior genotype in terms of yield and fruit number in both irrigated and drought conditions and was therefore recommended for evaluation in future breeding studies and inclusion in hybrid programs in order to develop drought tolerant cultivars acknowledgments this work was supported by the project

10990,climate change associated drought stress in plants is one of the major environmental factors that cause a reduction in plant growth development and productivity therefore an improvement to obtain superior genotypes that are highly adaptable to arid and semi arid conditions remains the main objective of the future breeding efforts in this context the present study was conducted to determine the genotypic differences among 16 inbred lines and 4 commercial cultivars of pumpkin associated with the parameters such as certain fruit characteristics seed yield and seed quality in irrigated and drought conditions in the growing season of pumpkin the amount of irrigation water applied was 402 6 mm in 2017 and 425 4 mm in 2018 in all the evaluated parameters the examined genotypes exhibited a wide range of significant differences between the irrigated and drought conditions in both the years moreover a significant positive correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit number seed thickness and plant height and 1000 seed weight and seed size in terms of seed quality 1000 seed weight was determined to be a prominent parameter the results of the present study demonstrated that these relationships imply a significant potential for the selection of genotypes with superior performance in both conditions furthermore principal component analysis pca performed considering the eigenvalues indicated that the yield and quality components could be explained strongly by the pca analysis in irrigated as well as in drought conditions finally the inbred line g9 was observed to be the most superior genotype in terms of yield and fruit number in both irrigation and drought conditions therefore this inbred line is envisaged to be evaluated in future breeding studies and to be included in future hybrid programs in order to develop drought tolerant cultivars keywords breeding pumpkin water stress pca 1 introduction climate change rapid population growth indiscriminate and excessive consumption and a shortage of fresh and clean water resources have led to irrigation problems rijsberman 2006 plants exposed to arid conditions must be capable of adapting to such environmental conditions or adapt to water stress in order to serve as economically viable crops shubha and tyagı 2007 therefore using the genotypes with a higher ability to adapt to arid conditions has been established as the main criterion in the breeding efforts for the development of novel drought tolerant cultivars akashi et al 2005 karipçin et al 2009 with an increase in arid and semi arid areas in the world there is an increasing inclination toward the cultivation of plants such as appetizers squash which is able to utilize water effectively and economically despite increased production the maintenance of desired commercial qualities in a cultivar remains one of the most important constraints encountered in this field therefore it is required that drought tolerant genotypes be identified in order to allow the development of tolerant cultivars to meet the food demand of the future world cucurbita pepo c moschata and c maxima constitute economically important species of the cucurbitaceae family which are cultivated throughout the world among these species c pepo is used in human nutrition the mature seeds and flowers of the plants of the

products such as bread salami sausage and mayonnaise because of their high protein content mansour et al 1993 rangahau 2002 moreover pumpkin seeds are produced for medicinal purposes in russia and certain african countries murkovic et al 1996 pumpkin seeds contain significant levels of antioxidants tocopherols and tocotrienols which have been reported to reduce the risk of certain types of cancers such as gastric breast lung and colorectal cancers lee et al 1999 goodman et al 2004 nesaretnam et al 2007 stevenson et al 2007 lelley et al 2009 furthermore pumpkin seeds have been reported to be rich in phytosterols which play a key role in lowering the cholesterol levels and in reducing benign prostate hyperplasia gossell williams et al 2006 fruhwirth and hermetter 2007 hong et al 2009 thompson and grundy 2005 owing to their constituents the pumpkin seeds have been reported to exert promotive and protective effects on the human immune system chew and park 2004 the production of pumpkin has been observed to be increasing due to reasons such lesser water requirement compared to several other agricultural species ability to grow in absence of irrigation in certain areas which receive sufficient rainfall and in rotation with the field crops harvest ease availability of mechanized cultural processes ability to be relatively resistant to diseases and pests and no requirement for storage pumpkin also exhibits a higher economic yield in arid and semi arid regions compared to other agricultural products such as wheat barley and chickpeas the objective of the present study was to identify drought tolerant pumpkin lines associated with yield fruit and seed characteristics through an experimentation conducted for two years in irrigated as well as non irrigated conditions with 20 pumpkin genotypes the superior drought tolerant pumpkin cultivar candidates selected as a result of the study would also contribute to the gene pool for future breeding efforts for the development of drought tolerant hybrid pumpkin cultivars 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil and climate characteristics of the experimental area the present study was conducted during the months of may and september in years 2017 and 2018 at the faculty of agriculture selcuk university konya located at 38 05 n 32 36 e at an altitude of 1006 m in central anatolia turkey konya is an area which is agriculturally important and comprises approximately 1 9 million hectares of arable land which constitutes 8 of the total agricultural land assets in turkey according to long term climate data konya plain has an arid and semi arid climate and the total amount of annual rainfall received in this region is only 320 mm of which only 90 100 mm of rainfall occurs during the plant growing season may september in addition the evaporation observed in the region in the plant growing season is greater than 1000 mm fig 1 therefore irrigation becomes a necessity for crop production in this area in the present study certain climatic parameters such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation were measured and recorded on an hourly basis by using a portable automated weather station davis vantage pro 2 located at the center of the study area the total amount of precipitation during the period between the sowing of the pumpkin seeds and their harvest as observed in the present study was approximately 90 mm in 2017 and 70 mm in 2018 the temperature reached 40 c and the relative humidity dropped to 35 especially in the months of july and august the average wind speed during the study period was between 2 5 3 m s the climate data for the experimental years 2017 and 2018 were in accordance with the long term average climate data available for the region the soil of the study area has a silty clayey loamy texture the organic matter content present in 0 90 cm of the soil profile ph and the bulk density values of the soil in the study area ranged from 1 43 to 2 16 7 44 7 50 1 28 1 32 g cm3 respectively the value of total available water taw in the upper 90 cm of the soil profile in the study area was 140 7 mm there is no hurdle in the pumpkin cultivation in terms of physical and chemical properties of the soil in the studied region 2 2 plant material planting and irrigation in the present study pumpkin genotypes that were collected from different regions of turkey were used as plant material the pumpkin genotypes were self pollinated for several years to reach the s7 level subsequently 16 inbred lines that exhibited superior agronomic traits were selected from the collected gene pool in addition two hybrid g1 mertbey f1 and g2 senahanim f1 and two local cultivars g3 hatuntırnağı and g4 cercevelik with high commercial value in the market were used to serve as control group the present study was conducted using a randomized block design with three replicates in full irrigated and complete stress drought conditions each parcel consisting of 4 plant rows was designed in 4 5 m plots and the parcels were arranged 2 m from each other and 2 5 m from the blocks a total of 40 pumpkin seeds were sown by hand with 1 m row spacing and 0 5 m inter row spacing within each parcel in the present study a drip irrigation system was utilized to irrigate the plots belonging to the irrigation group round drip irrigation pipes of 5 m length 16 mm diameter and 4 l h discharge rate at a pressure of 100 kpa were placed for each plant row drippers at the lateral pipes were arranged at a distance of 50 cm from each other in consideration with the soil characteristics the lateral pipes were connected to the manifold pipes each with a diameter of 40 mm and the manifold pipes were connected to the pe main pipe with a diameter of 63 mm the amount of irrigation water required to be applied to the irrigated plots was calculated using eq 1 in consideration of the amount of cumulative water evaporation which was obtained from the class a type pan installed in the study area at seven day intervals in the programmed irrigation irrigation water was applied ten times to the experimental subjects belonging to the irrigation group at seven day intervals in the growing season of pumpkin the total amount of irrigation water applied was 402 6 mm in 2017 and 425 4 mm in 2018 table 1 1 i ep kp kc a where i amount of irrigation water liters a

applied 100 kg ha 1 n 100 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 100 kg ha 1 k2o at planting the rest of n fertilizer was applied during fruit set period at a rate of 50 kg ha 1 throughout the developmental period of the plants cultural practices such as cultivation weed control diseases management and pest management were conducted regularly twenty days prior to the harvest time irrigation was discontinued in the fully watered plots post complete drying of the plants fruits were harvested and mature seeds were extracted from these fruits 2 3 fruit and seed measurements plant length was measured at 20 day intervals in the period between flowering and the commencement of stress the fruits were harvested except in the cases of edge effects on 27 september 2017 and on 25 september 2018 the fruit number per plant was determined in proportion to the plant number in each parcel fruit width and length were measured using a large digital caliper and fruit weights were recorded using a digital scale subsequent to fruit harvest from the parcel seeds were extracted from the harvested fruits and dried under shade subsequently seed yield in each parcel was determined seed width seed length and seed thickness were measured in 20 seeds selected from each parcel by the digital caliper the 1000 seed weights were also determined for each parcel using the digital scale 2 4 evaluation of data the combined variance analysis performed for the yield and quality components obtained for both the trial years 2017 and 2018 was examined using homogeneity tests according to the results of the homogeneity tests the experimental years required to be evaluated separately as the values of yield and quality parameters were not homogeneous in terms of error variance of the years the fruit characteristics seed yield and the quality parameters were subjected to analysis of variance and the results were considered statistically significant at 1 and 5 significance levels according to duncan s test yurtsever 1984 düzgüneş et al 1987 the analysis of variance and correlation tests were performed using the spss 22 0 packaged software the present study was aimed to interpret several yield and quality parameters in combination therefore principal component analysis pca was utilized for a multivariate statistical analysis which allowed a considerable reduction in the number of parameters required to explain most of the data in this manner the values for seed yield seed characteristics and fruit characteristics obtained from the averages of results of the two experimental years in the irrigated and drought conditions were subjected to pca separately using the jmp 10 statistical program 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of drought stress on seed yield and plant length seed yield fruit number and plant length of the pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant p 0 01 in both irrigated and drought conditions for both the experimental years table 2 when considering the seed yields in the irrigated plots g1 g2 g9 g11 and g31 produced the highest yield and were statistically in the same group table 3 while g2 with an average yield of 2067 kg ha 1 was the best commercial variety among the hybrids the g9 and g31 inbred lines exhibited approximately 6 2202 kg ha 1 and 1 2114 kg ha 1 higher yields respectively in comparison to the commercial cultivars in irrigated plots the aforementioned genotypes were therefore envisaged as the inbred lines which could serve as candidates for selection as the commercial variety in irrigated conditions in full irrigated conditions the pumpkin seed yield observed in a study conducted in iran was 1700 kg ha 1 ghanbari et al 2007 in egypt was 930 kg ha 1 amer 2011 and in turkey was 1100 1200 kg ha 1 yanmaz and düzeltir 2004 it is obvious that the yield obtained in the present study was higher than the yields reported by the previous studies these higher yields could be caused by factors such as climate soil characteristics genotype planned irrigation program and drip irrigation method the drought stress resulted in about 80 reduction in the seed yield across the two seasons 2017 and 2018 drought stress was observed to exert different effects on the seed yield in the two experimental years the highest yield in the first year was obtained from g9 and g34 while the highest yield in the second year was obtained from g2 g11 g13 g14 g16 g22 and g40 in dry conditions the commercial cultivars g1 and g2 exhibited higher yields compared to the standard cultivars while among the inbred lines it was g9 and g34 that produced higher yields relative to the commercial cultivars therefore the aforementioned genotypes were considered to be the superior inbred lines which could be used for the improvement of tolerant hybrid cultivars in the arid and semi arid regions table 3 several physiological factors have been observed to be adversely affected by drought and the drought that occurs during the flowering period causes severe loss of yield farooq et al 2009 according to the result of a previous study conducted in the konya province drought resulted in severe loss of pumpkin yield yavuz et al 2015 moreover seed yield ranging from 500 to 1270 kg ha 1 at different irrigation levels and deficit irrigation exerting negative effects on the yield of pumpkin have been reported in a previous study cakir 2000 when both the experimental years are evaluated in terms of seed yield the genotypes were divided into four categories which differed in their differential yield analysis diagram fig 2 fernandez 1992 in this diagram the first category identified high yielding genotypes in irrigated as well as non irrigated conditions and included g1 g2 g9 g11 g13 g22 g32 and g40 the second category contained high yielding genotypes in the irrigated conditions and low yielding genotypes in the non irrigated conditions such as g3 g28 g30 and g31 the third category identified high yielding genotypes in the non irrigated conditions and low yielding genotypes in the irrigated conditions which comprised g14 g16 and g34 g4 g8 g25 g26 and g45 were located in the fourth category which identified the low yielding genotypes in both irrigated and non irrigated conditions it is well known from several previous reports that different genotypes respond differently to dry conditions ongom et al 2016 darkwa et al 2016 mohammadi and abdulahi 2017 therefore the determination of genotypes that are tolerant to dry conditions is crucial in the field of agricultural research according to the findings of the present study g9 and g34 genotypes which exhibited highest yields in dry conditions have been proposed as superior genotypes for arid and semi arid areas having limited water resources according to the literature by using the differential yield analyses diagram 12 genotypes in bean darkwa et al 2016 7 genotypes in wheat mohammadi and abdulahi 2017 and 5 genotypes in rice aminpanah et al 2018 have been determined as drought tolerant cultivar candidates fruit number is a parameter that has been associated directly with the yield in the first year the average fruit number observed in the irrigated plots was 1 25 while the fruit number observed in the drought conditions was 0 7 similarly in the second year the fruit number obtained in the irrigated and the non irrigated conditions was 1 26 and 0 67 respectively g9 and g45 exhibited the highest fruit number per plant in the irrigated conditions in this respect g9 g13 g14 g16 g26 g32 and g40 exhibited the highest values in dry conditions for both the experimental years table 3 in a previous study drought stress was observed to be directly related to yield and the fruit number per pumpkin plant observed in that study was 1 2 seymen et al 2012 furthermore the fruit number has been observed to decrease in pepper jeeatid et al 2018 and cucumber najarian et al 2018 as a result of drought stress plant length is an important factor in pumpkin production certain pumpkin genotypes have lateral branches while others have compact branchless structures in the present study the plant lengths of all the genotypes investigated were adversely affected by dry conditions table 4 g28 genotype was the one to exhibit the longest branches in irrigated and non irrigated conditions in both the experimental years according to the literature drought has been observed to exert a negative effect on the plant height in melon cucumis melo l kuşvuran and abak 2012 and has also been reported to cause a 31 decrease in the plant height in wild barley genotypes tyagi et al 2011 3 2 effect of drought stress on certain fruit characteristics the effects of irrigated and drought conditions on fruit weight fruit length and fruit width of a few pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant in both the experimental years p 0 01 for 2017 and p 0 05 for 2018 table 2 in the first year the average fruit weight obtained under irrigated conditions was 2 81 kg and the average fruit weight in drought conditions was 0 93 kg implying that the drought caused 67 reduction in fruit weight similarly in the second year the average fruit weights obtained in the irrigated and drought conditions were 2 58 kg and 0 77 kg respectively implying that the fruit weight decreased by 70 in drought conditions while the dry conditions in the flowering period in pumpkin caused a 37 reduction in the fruit weight the reduction observed was 67 in the fruit set period masoodi and hakimi 2017 the heaviest fruits obtained were from the g11 and g22 genotypes in the irrigated as well as in drought conditions for both the experimental years table 4 similar to the findings of the present study fruit weights reported in previous studies were 2 67 kg seymen et al 2011 3 06 kg türkmen et al 2016 and 3 48 kg masoodi and hakimi 2017 in irrigated conditions and deficit irrigation was reported to exert a negative effect on the fruit weight in pumpkin ertek et al 2004 arid conditions in the present study were observed to exert negative effects on fruit length and the fruit length was observed to decrease by 37 in the first year and by 28 in the second year similarly the decrease in the fruit width was 33 and 30 in the first and second year respectively in a previous study drought was observed to cause a 14 decrease in the fruit length and a 25 decrease in the fruit width in pumpkin yavuz et al 2017 while g32 g34 g40 and g45 lines exhibited the highest values for fruit width different genotypes were observed to exhibit different responses for fruit length in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years table 5 therefore the average fruit length and fruit width of the pumpkin genotypes were determined as 20 07 cm and 17 31 cm respectively in the irrigated plots seymen et al 2011 full irrigation conditions have been observed to exert positive effects on the fruit number fruit lenght and fruit width in previous studies on the contrary deficit irrigation has been observed to exert negative effects on the fruit characteristics ertek et al 2004 3 3 effect of drought stress on seed quality the effects of irrigated and drought conditions on 1000 seed weight seed thickness seed length and seed width of certain pumpkin genotypes were observed to be statistically significant at p 0 01 and p 0 05 levels in 2017 and 2018 respectively table 2 seed width sw is a parameter that is directly related to yield in pumpkin large and full seeds are related to enhanced yield and seed quality and are desirable among producers and consumers in the first year the average 1000 seed weight obtained in the irrigated conditions was 246 g while it was 188 g in the drought conditions implying that the 1000 seed weight decreased by 24 in the arid conditions in the second year the irrigated and non irrigated plots exhibited 253 g and 187 g of average 1000 seed weight respectively implying a decrease of 26 in arid conditions the lines g4 g11 g22 g30 and g34 produced the highest 1000 seed weight in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years and these genotypes were in the same group statistically previous studies have reported a wide range of 1000 seed weights in pumpkin in irrigated conditions for example 134 g warid et al 1993 178 g türkmen et al 2014 203 g joshi et al 1993 and 239 g türkmen et al 2016 similarly drought application in the fruit set period of pumpkin has been reported to cause a decrease of 27 in the 1000 seed weight masoodi and hakimi 2017 when compared to the irrigated conditions drought stress was observed to exert a negative effect on seed thickness which was reduced by 4 in the first year and by 14 in the second year g11 exhibited impressive seed thickness values in the irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years table 6 in the first year the average seed length recorded was 20 71 mm in the irrigated plots while it was 18 52 mm in the drought conditions implying that the seed length was reduced by 11 similarly the seed length values recorded in the second year were 19 86 mm and 18 52 mm in the irrigated and non irrigated plots respectively implying that the drought caused 10 reduction in the seed length in the second year similar to the findings of the present study drought stress was observed to result in a 12 reduction in the seed length and 10 reduction in the 1000 seed weight in pumpkin yavuz et al 2017 the seeds are the consumable part of pumpkin which is why longer seeds are desirable in relation to seed quality as it facilitates cracking g3 g11 and g34 exhibited the highest values for seed length and seed quality and were therefore regarded as the superior genotypes in irrigated as well as drought conditions for both the experimental years moreover drought also affected the seed width negatively and caused a decrease of 7 in the first year and 8 in the second year the highest seed width value was obtained for g11 and g32 in both the experimental years table 7 similar to the results of the present study the values for seed length and seed width recorded were 20 05 mm and 10 92 mm respectively as reported in a study by türkmen et al 2016 and 16 91 mm and 8 67 mm as reported by another study by joshi et al 1993 moreover the findings of paris and nerson 2003 demonstrated a wide range of seed length from 8 8 to 23 3 mm seed width from 5 0 to 12 5 mm and seed thickness from 1 2 to 3 8 mm in pumpkin 3 4 correlation between parameters when the correlation between the yield and the quality parameters was evaluated p 0 01 a significant positive correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit number r 0 715 in drought conditions fruit length was observed to be positively correlated with fruit weight r 0 602 and plant height r 0 685 moreover it was determined that the 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed thickness seed length seed width plant height and fruit length a similar positive and strong relationship was also determined among seed width plant height and fruit length table 8 correlatively it has been reported in a previous study that seed size exhibits a positive relationship with fruit size and seed shape in cucurbita pepo paris and nerson 2003 a positive correlation was also determined between seed thickness seed yield and fruit length under irrigated conditions in the present study similar to drought conditions 1000 seed weight demonstrated a positive relation with fruit length seed thickness seed length and seed width in the irrigated conditions as well on the other hand fruit weight was observed to have a negative relationship with fruit number and plant height there was a weak positive relationship between the seed yield and the 1000 seed weight table 9 similarly seed yield per fruit and seed size have been reported to demonstrate a weak correlation in pumpkin berenji and papp 2000 a positive relationship was observed between seed number and seed weight per fruit r 0 92 0 93 and between seed weight and seed size r 0 49 in a study by warid et al 1993 according to the findings of the present study no relationship existed between the fruit weight and the 1000 seed weight in both irrigated and drought conditions a strong relationship was observed between 1000 seed weight and seed size which confirmed 1000 seed weight as a prominent parameter in terms of seed quality on the other hand compared to irrigated conditions fruit number was identified as the decisive parameter in terms of seed yield in arid conditions which corroborated the finding that the genotypes that exhibited higher fruit number produced a greater yield 3 5 principal component analysis the two year average values of the yield fruit characteristics and seed quality parameters obtained for the pumpkin genotypes were subjected to principal component analysis pca table 10 in the principal component analysis components were generated considering the eigenvalues greater than or equal to 1 0 kamrani et al 2018 considering the eigenvalues it was observed that the first three components explained 72 51 of the total variance in the irrigated conditions and 76 24 of that in the drought conditions in order to effectively utilize and for correct interpretation of the pca it is required that the ratio of the first two or three components must be greater than 25 of the total variation mohammadi and prasanna 2003 therefore the high variance values obtained from the first three components in the present study indicated that the yield and quality components obtained in the present study could be explained strongly by the pca analysis in both irrigated and drought conditions in the irrigated conditions the first component pc1 explained 40 63 of the total variation and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with average fruit weight 1000 seed weight and seed width the second component pc2 accounted for 19 43 of the total variation while the fruit size exhibited a negative correlation a positive correlation was observed in fruit width the third component pc3 explained 12 45 of the total variation and a positive correlation was obtained between yield and fruit number while the plant height demonstrated a negative correlation with the yield and fruit number correlatively in drought conditions pc1 explained 40 61 of the total variation and demonstrated a strong positive correlation with 1000 seed weight and seed width pc2 and pc3 explained 22 35 and 13 26 of the total variation and a positive correlation was obtained between seed yield and fruit number a negative correlation was observed between seed yield and fruit length in both cases seed weight and seed width demonstrated a strong correlation in pc1 and it was revealed that these were the important parameters in the selection of drought tolerant pumpkin genotypes when the correlation table was analyzed it was observed that the 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed width and seed length therefore 1000 seed weight was considered a prominent parameter in terms of seed quality in pumpkin on the other hand high positive relationship between seed yield and fruit number appeared in the pc3 for irrigated plots while the same was identified in pc2 for drought conditions as depicted in the correlation table fruit number was an important parameter for high yield in drought conditions and therefore it was determined as an essential component in the selection of drought tolerant pumpkin genotypes in arid as well as semi arid regions in the basic component analyses performed with 20 pumpkin genotypes in irrigated conditions the distribution of the genotypes associated with the components was generated fig 3 g11 g22 g30 and g31 exhibited the highest values for fruit weight 1000 seed weight and seed width as described in the first component g9 g34 g40 and g45 exhibited the smallest values for fruit length and the highest values for fruit width as described by the second component g8 and g9 were associated with the highest yield and fruit number and the shortest plant height in the third component as depicted in fig 4 in drought conditions the highest 1000 seed weight and seed width were obtained in g11 g22 g30 and g31 as explained by the first component the second component associated g9 g13 and g14 genotypes with higher yield and fruit number as described by the third component the shortest fruits were obtained in the g45 genotype on the basis of evaluation of the irrigated and drought conditions it was observed that g11 g22 and g30 resulted in impressive seed quality and were therefore considered the prominent cultivar candidates while g9 and g28 which presented high fruit number and yield in the irrigated conditions were the highly recommendable genotypes for the irrigated conditions g9 g13 and g14 should be evaluated in arid and semi arid regions for breeding efforts in future 4 conclusion the results of the present study demonstrated that drought exerted different effects on different pumpkin genotypes and caused 80 decrease on an average in the yield in both the experimental years the parameters of 1000 seed weight and seed width which were observed to be highly correlated in pc1 were identified as important in the selection of superior genotypes in pumpkin under irrigated and drought conditions in addition it has been well documented that 1000 seed weight had a positive relationship with seed width and seed length because of which 1000 seed weight was recommended as the most important parameter in determining the seed quality in pumpkin moreover a high positive relationship between fruit number and seed yield appeared in pc3 in the irrigated conditions while the same relationship was determined in pc2 in the drought conditions as depicted in the correlation table fruit number was important for high seed yield in the drought conditions and was therefore a determinant parameter in the selection of cultivars in arid and semi arid regions g1 and g2 hybrids were the highest yielding commercial cultivars in both irrigated and drought conditions according to the pca g11 g22 and g30 inbred lines had superior seed quality compared to the commercial cultivars due to which they were evaluated as the cultivar candidates with superior agricultural traits it is obvious that the aforementioned genotypes would gain high market value due to their significant seed quality on the other hand the g9 inbred line was observed to be the superior genotype in terms of yield and fruit number in both irrigated and drought conditions and was therefore recommended for evaluation in future breeding studies and inclusion in hybrid programs in order to develop drought tolerant cultivars acknowledgments this work was supported by the project

10991,agro eco hydrological models are essential for managing scarce water resources and ensuring crop productivity here a one dimensional agro eco hydrological model lawstac capable of simulating water and solute transport in layered soil coupled with crop growth is presented and validated lawstac considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of richards equation for soil water flow lawstac includes two root water uptake models and a flexible root distribution model for reliable transpiration simulation simulation of infiltration in layered soil demonstrated that the methods of arithmetic mean geometric mean and triadic mean performed well among the eight discretization methods the model was further verified by comparison with results from two widely used models hydrus 1d and swap based on the measured data in a spring wheat field for 2007 and 2008 in the northwest china the models produced similar results for flow in layered soil although swap showed some instability in the salinity dynamics lawstac models crop growth with a more efficient parameterization than swap the root mean square error for soil moisture soil salinity concentration and lai simulated by lawstac was less than 0 06 cm3 cm 3 3 56 g l 1 and 0 43 respectively in conclusion lawstac is suitable for simulating soil water and salinity dynamics crop growth and their interactions keywords hydrologic model crop growth model coupling layered soil 1 introduction water shortage and soil salinization are two major factors that negatively affect agricultural productivity molden 1997 cominelli et al 2013 to avoid such negative impacts quantification of crop growth as well as water and solute transport are necessary for development of appropriate policies and measures often field experiments are conducted to investigate the appropriateness of agricultural management practices that aim to enhance water use efficiency and grain production under limited water supply and soil salinization situations tuong and bhuiyan 1999 kahlown and azam 2003 however field experiments with different crops under various soil water salinity and environment conditions are expensive laborious and time consuming especially for long term experiments that involve frequent measurements process based simulation tools enhance the insights gained from long term experiments and potentially improve understanding of crop growth and yield under different hydrological and environmental conditions validated models also permit prognostic exploration of different strategies to improve crop yield and to maintain soil resilience many one dimensional 1d physically based models simulating water and solute dynamics in variably saturated unsaturated soil in field scale are available e g leachm leaching estimating and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1990 swap soil water atmosphere plant van dam et al 1997 rzwqm root zone water quality model hanson et al 1998 and hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 recent studies used these models to quantify soil water and solute transport processes under different boundary conditions with or without plant interactions cameira et al 2000 kumar et al 2015 salamati et al 2016 as indicated above agricultural systems models can be used as planning tools to determine agricultural management strategies under different environmental scenarios widely used agricultural systems models include epic environmental policy integrated climate williams et al 1989 apsim agricultural production systems simulator mccown et al 1996 wofost world food studies boogaard et al 1998 and dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 in the agricultural systems models the evapotranspiration soil water content and salt content level are key points for calculation eitzinger et al 2004 the water loss through evaporation and transpiration can modify the water distribution in the soil profiles and further affect the salt migration meanwhile the soil moisture and salt content are two main factors controlling the crop root water uptake and affecting the crop growth and yield crops can only consume soil water present in the reach of their roots zhou et al 2012 therefore there are strong interactions between crop growth and the soil water and salt dynamics consequently it is necessary to couple the hydrologic processes with the agricultural systems in order to better understand the agro eco hydrological process and provide basis for scientific agricultural management ma et al 2006 coupled the ceres maize agricultural systems model with rzwqm to address soil and water quality issues with a more comprehensive plant growth description a recent integrated simulation model for improving water use efficiency and crop yields was reported by zhou et al 2012 who linked wofost with hydrus 1d to optimize irrigation scheduling for spring wheat in northwest china later kumar et al 2015 used swap with wofost embedded to simulate soil moisture and solute dynamics along with wheat yields under various saline water irrigation regimes in new delhi india despite these efforts issues remain to be addressed for more accurate simulation in the agro eco hydrological system for example hydrus 1d assumes a fixed root distribution pattern when root growth is considered which might not account for the actual root water uptake in addition an aboveground crop growth model is absent in hydrus the algorithm for solving the solute transport equation in swap adopts an explicit temporal discretization which is prone to instability under abrupt variations of soil water content xu et al 2016 the coupled ceres rzwqm model ma et al 2006 combines the advantages of both a comprehensive description of specific crop growth and reliable predictions of water and nutrient distribution in the root zone however its performance for distinctly layered soils which are common in the field is unclear because it is limited to a fixed number of soil layers sophocleous et al 2009 furthermore no specific attention is paid to the model s performance under such a condition although wang et al 2014 showed that their richards equation based models were capable of simulating water flow in layered soils simulations usually encountered difficulties in achieving water balance and produced numerical oscillations lima vivancos and voller 2004 due to the nonlinearity of hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soils numerical models must incorporate strategies to reliably simulate water movement typically agro eco hydrological models adopt a fixed averaging method to calculate the internodal conductivities simunek et al 2005 alternative methods could improve accuracy and stability of simulation results under different soil structure conditions recent progress in techniques of remote sensing and gis etc have advanced the quantification of regional eco hydrologic systems the spatial and temporal scales involved require coupling between regional groundwater flow models and flow models in the unsaturated zone especially in agricultural areas where layered soil profiles are common li et al 2017 and solute transport simulations are required for practical applications models for such areas should be process based computationally efficient and with robust parameterizations the objectives of this study are a to develop an efficient model lawstac for simulating crop growth and the associated water and solute dynamics in layered soils b to evaluate various conductivity averaging methods used in lawstac for layered soil and c to assess the capabilities and performance of the model by comparing its results with the widely used hydrus 1d and swap models based on the monitored data in a spring wheat field in northwest china 2 description of lawstac lawstac is a process based model that simulates vertical 1d saturated unsaturated water flow and solute transport in layered soils together with crop growth the soil water and solute transport processes are described through the richards equation re and advection dispersion equation ade respectively the crop growth processes are driven by air temperature and solar radiation eight different averaging methods are considered in the model for computing the hydraulic conductivity in the middle of two adjacent nodes the model is compiled in the matlab programming language which can be easily transformed to a standalone executable for instance to be called by a regional scale hydrologic model 2 1 soil water flow soil water flow in the soil

crop parameters in lawstac 2 6 numerical calculation methods in this model implicit euler temporal discretization and cell centered finite difference spatial discretization are applied although the implicit euler temporal scheme is questioned about its reliability and efficiency clark and kavetski 2010 we can improve its stability by iteration and increase efficiency by adjusting the time step

various averaging methods for computing ki 1 2 are available srivastava and guzman guzman 1995 gastó et al 2002 it is well known that averaging methods can affect the accuracy stability and efficiency of the numerical solution romano et al 1998 here a range of methods are examined including 1 arithmetic mean of the conductivity ac 50 k i 1 2 k i k i 1 2 2 geometric mean of the conductivity gc 51 k

is calculated by the penman monteith method which is partitioned into potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration based on the lai calculated from the crop growth model 2 the actual soil evaporation is calculated considering the soil moisture and soil salinity at the ground surface which is used as the upper boundary condition for the soil water flow model in non infiltration period for irrigation or precipitation the upper boundary is instead switched to the infiltration condition the actual crop transpiration is assumed to be equal to the actual root uptake which is affected by soil moisture and salinity in the root zone and is used as the sink term in the soil water flow model 3 the outputs of the soil water flow model are soil moisture as well as flux which are used to calculate the soil moisture related parameters and advection term in the soil salinity transport model 4 the outputs of the soil solute transport model include the distribution of soil solute concentration in the root zone which in turn affects the root water uptake 5 the ratio between the calculated actual root water uptake and the potential crop transpiration is an indicator of the degree of water stress along with temperature stress water stress modifies crop growth in the crop model 6 the crop growth model determines crop height root length lai biomass and yield these indexes influence the soil water flow as described in 1 and 2 above at the next time step 3 evaluation of hydraulic conductivity averaging methods in a layered soil the eight averaging methods for determining hydraulic conductivity between nodes in lawstac were compared in a layered soil infiltration case gastó et al 2002 the layered soil structure used for the test case followed hills et al 1989a b alternate layers each 20 cm thick of berino loamy fine sand and glendale clay loam filled the soil domain total depth of 1 m the soil hydraulic parameters reported by hills et al 1989a b are listed in table 2 the initial condition of soil profile was uniform water pressure head of 10 000 cm and the top boundary condition was constant water pressure head of 50 cm fig 2 shows volumetric water content profiles computed using the various averaging methods after 2 d of infiltration grid spacing δz 2 cm and time increment δt 5 s a fine grid solution δz 0 5 cm δt 5 s was also calculated fig 2 which closely corresponds to the reference solution gastó et al 2002 and is found to be negligibly affected by the choice of hydraulic conductivity averaging methods considering the location of the wetting front shown in fig 2 the arithmetic mean ac geometric mean gc geometric mean of pressure head gp harmonic mean of pressure head hp triadic mean tc and upstream node uc lead to an overestimation of the internodal conductivity while the harmonic mean hc and arithmetic mean of pressure head ap underestimate it among the averaging methods the hc has the lowest calculated value of hydraulic conductivity which is inappropriate for simulating unsaturated flow in the layered soil schnabel and richie 1984 overall the ac gc and tc methods have smaller errors in simulating water movement in layered soil with the mean relative errors of 4 4 3 8 and 5 2 compared to the fine grid solution respectively thus the ac gc and tc methods are more suitable for water infiltration simulation in layered soil under the implicit euler temporal scheme to further assess the ac gc and tc procedures of the lawstac in multilayered soil more than 10 layers a lysimeter infiltration experiment of hills et al 1989a b was selected the lysimeter 94 7 cm diameter 610 cm long was filled with alternating layers of berino loamy fine sand and glendale clay loam the soil core had 29 layers with a total depth of 585 cm the soil hydraulic parameters measured by hills et al 1989a b are listed in table 2 the initial soil water contents were 0 029 cm3 cm 3 for the sand and 0 107 cm3 cm 3 for the clay loam the infiltration water flux applied to the lysimeter was 2 314 cm d 1 fig 3 shows the simulated and observed soil water content profiles after 56 days of infiltration into the layered lysimeter the ac gc and tc methods all predicted the soil water content well in the clay loam layers and slightly overestimated it in the sand layers for grid spacing of 1 cm fig 3a which closely corresponds to the reference solution simulated by hills et al 1989a b for the coarse discretization δz 4 cm the advancement of infiltration wetting fronts simulated by the ac gc and tc methods are slightly larger than the reference solution however the three averaging methods still show satisfactory simulation results of water content in the soil profile with the mean relative errors of 12 0 10 1 and 10 8 compared to the measured data respectively fig 3b moreover the coarse space discretization can improve simulation efficiency by reducing the computational time compared with the fine one especially for the gc method fig 4 therefore for water flow in a multilayered soil with deep depth coarse discretization with reasonable space is preferred when adopting ac gc and tc methods for simulation under the implicit euler temporal scheme 4 evaluation of lawstac by comparing with field data and the other model simulations 4 1 brief introduction of the models used for evaluation of lawstac in order to assess the performance of the lawstac model in a field condition two widely used hydrologic models hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 and swap van dam et al 1997 were selected for simulating soil water solute dynamics and crop growth processes the models were chosen for the following reasons firstly soil water flow and solute transport simulations in the three models are all based on the re and ade respectively secondly for the method of calculation of actual root water uptake the feddes model can be used in all models finally all these models can be applied to layered soils the detailed algorithm and structure of the three models are listed in table 3 4 2 scenario used for evaluation for model comparison we selected a simulation case based on a spring wheat growing experiment conducted at the huinong experimental site located in ningxia autonomous region northwest china 106 39 e 39 04 n with water flow and solute transport in the layered root zone during 2007 and 2008 the climate in the region is arid continental with annual rainfall of 180 200 mm spring wheat was sown on march 16 and harvested on july 11 the crop was irrigated with water diverted from the yellow river with irrigation schedule shown in table 4 the groundwater level is high about 0 5 2 5 m to the ground surface the total dissolved solid concentration of the irrigation water and groundwater averaged 0 47 and 1 2 g l 1 respectively xu et al 2013 the soil profile at the experimental site has various horizontal layers and the physical properties are shown in table 5 the details of this experiment can be found in xu et al 2013 the monitored data include soil water and salt contents in different depths leaf area index and dry grain yield 4 3 model inputs to make the results simulated by the three models comparable we tried to keep the simulation conditions i e the initial and boundary conditions and the input parameters in the three models consistent in simulating soil water and salinity dynamics we input the same soil hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters to make sure the three models have the same atmospheric evaporation capacity all three models used the reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient to calculate the potential crop transpiration for root growth as swap assumes the root length develops linearly with time the root growth pattern in the other two models was adjusted accordingly for the root distribution with soil depth when the root length changes with time only the function of hoffman and van genuchten eq 24 can be used to describe the root spatial distribution in hydrus 1d so the other two models used the same function the feddes model was used to calculate the root water uptake under water and salinity stresses in the three models in partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration lai values are necessary for all models but hydrus 1d cannot simulate leaf area changes so the lai values used in hydrus 1d were calculated by taking the averaged lai values simulated by swap and lawstac the three models all used the arithmetic mean conductivity ac given by eq 50 the upper boundary condition was defined as the atmospheric boundary condition since the soil surface was open to the atmosphere and was shifted to infiltration when rainfall or irrigation occurred a variable pressure head boundary condition was specified at the bottom based on the observed groundwater table data input parameters for swap hydrus 1d and lawstac are shown in table 6 the crop growth indicators including maximum crop height maximum root depth and maximum lai were determined according to measured values empirical parameters such as the extinction coefficient were selected by referring to the literature williams et al 1989 boons prins et al 1993 the hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters of the layered soil used in the three models are listed in table 7 the input parameters of the three models for soil water flow solute transport and crop growth were calibrated via least squares minimization using the observed data in 2007 including the soil water contents and salt concentrations in each soil layer lai and yield the calibrated models were validated using experiment data from the 2008 growing season 4 4 evaluation of model outputs model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed values with the simulated results using different criteria viz the root mean square error rmse and the mean relative error mre these metrics are defined respectively as follows 62 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 63 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 100 where pi and oi i 1 2 n are respectively the simulated and observed values and n is the number of observations the model performance comparison penalized by the number of calibrated parameters was quantified by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 64 a i c 2 k p n s ln r s s n s where kp is the number of calibrated parameters in the model ns is the sample size and rss is the residual sum of squares 4 5 comparison of simulation results model comparisons included the simulated evapotranspiration soil water content soil salinity and crop growth indicators the aboveground crop growth processes were compared only between swap and lawstac because hydrus 1d was unable to simulate these the comparisons are shown in figs 5 8 4 5 1 actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation fig 5 reveals the differences between the models in simulating cumulative actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration in 2007 and 2008 fig 5a shows that results for cumulative actual soil evaporation have similar trends although values vary somewhat swap has the highest actual evaporation rates of the three models while the rates for lawstac are the lowest for hydrus 1d when the pressure head in the soil surface is higher than the critical value the actual evaporation rate is equal to the potential evaporation rate otherwise when the surface pressure head drops below the critical value evaporation is calculated through darcy s law ma et al 2011 in swap the actual evaporation rate is determined by taking the minimum value of the potential evaporation rate and the darcy flux the actual evaporation computed by lawstac is based on the three stage evaporation process eq 22 fig 5b shows that the actual crop transpiration rates simulated by the three models are similar the actual transpiration is the product of potential transpiration and the water stress coefficient as calculated by feddes model in the three models so the differences of the actual transpiration simulated by the three models are small 4 5 2 soil water content the observed soil water contents and the simulated values by swap hydrus 1d and lawstac during calibration and validation are shown in fig 6 the three models show little difference in simulating soil water flow and they match well with the measured data in each soil layer although the numerical schemes for solving the richards equation are different in the three models finite element scheme for hydrus 1d finite difference scheme for swap and lawstac they all use fully implicit method which helps to improve convergence in iteration celia et al 1990 therefore the three models can obtain the stable and satisfying numerical solution of the soil water flow through iteration the performance of the three models was also assessed quantitatively the values of rmse and mre for soil water contents in the whole soil profile are shown in table 9 the rmse values of the three models are all 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 06 cm3 cm 3 during the calibration and validation respectively and the mre values are less than 0 91 and 8 21 for the calibration and validation respectively the results show that three models predict the soil water contents well in the field condition 4 5 3 soil salinity concentration the soil salinity concentration in various soil layers are shown in fig 7 where the three models simulate the soil salinity in different depths well compared with the observed values over the wheat growing season of 2007 and 2008 the simulated results by the three models have no significant difference except a little fluctuation for swap in salt simulation in the surface soil this is because of the different numerical schemes used in swap for solute transport simulation an implicit temporal discretization was used by hydrus 1d and lawstac while swap used an explicit temporal discretization although the swap managed to simulate the evolution of the soil salinity in this simulation case the explicit scheme it used may potentially induce some stability problems in soil with strong heterogeneity the fitness indicators of soil salinity concentration by the three models are given in table 9 results show that the rmse values of the swap hydrus 1d and lawstac are among 1 59 3 73 g l 1 and the respective mre values are among 4 41 1 40 for the calibration and validation which demonstrates that the results of simulated salinity are still satisfactory 4 5 4 lai biomass and crop yield the crop growth as explained earlier could only be simulated by swap and lawstac results for lai and biomass are presented in fig 8 the swap and lawstac both simulate crop growth using the incoming photo synthetically active radiation absorbed by the crop canopy however swap considers crop photosynthesis and respiration which is more complex than lawstec in terms of mechanism singh et al 2006 from fig 8 we can see that despite this lawstac give the reasonable results for the evolution of lai and biomass compared with swap for lai the deviations were considered acceptable for the two models swap 0 43 rmse 0 46 3 88 mre 14 86 lawstac 0 29 rmse 0 43 0 27 mre 13 57 the larger mean relative error mre for validation is due to less measured lai data in 2008 the simulated crop yield by swap 4610 kg ha 1 and lawstac 4619 kg ha 1 are only slightly higher than the observed yield 4600 kg ha 1 during the calibration the observed crop yield was 4771 kg ha 1 for 2008 and the simulated yields by swap and lawstac were 4423 kg ha 1 and 4372 kg ha 1 during the validation respectively thus showing a small difference only the results indicate that the lawstac model can be used to estimate agricultural production 4 5 5 comparison of model performance the model performance comparison was conducted only for swap and lawstac as hydrus 1d is unable to simulate crop growth the total calibrated parameters in swap and lawstac were 77 and 50 respectively as shown in table 8 the aic values for soil water content soil salinity and leaf area index simulated by swap are all larger than that simulated by lawstac which indicates the lawstac is more efficient than swap 5 conclusions in this study a new coupled hydrology crop growth model lawstac was developed based on richards equation for soil water flow the advection dispersion equation for solute transport as well as a detailed crop growth model lawstac considers the soil vertical heterogeneity in simulating water solute dynamics in the root zone as well as crop growth the interaction of crop growth and soil water flow solute transport was improved by integration of two different root water uptake models feddes and s shaped lawstac provides eight different hydraulic conductivity internodal averaging methods to account for abrupt variations at the interfaces of soil layers numerical testing showed that the model can be used into multilayered soils and the internodal conductivity computed using the arithmetic mean ac the geometric mean gc or the triadic mean tc were suitable for simulating water infiltration in layered soil lawstac was assessed by comparing its simulation results with the other two widely used models hydrus 1d and swap the three models were calibrated and validated for prediction of soil water and salt dynamics and growth of spring wheat based on experimental data from 2007 calibration year and 2008 validation year in an experimental station in northwest china under the same scenario the three models performed almost the same in simulating soil water contents in different soil layers while lawstac and hydrus 1d in contrast to swap simulated the soil salinity dynamics more consistently and stably in terms of crop growth simulation although lawstac requires fewer crop data inputs it was found to perform reasonable compared with the more complex swap model therefore the lawstac can be used for simulating soil water and salt dynamics and crop growth processes in layered soil farmland note that we have tested lawstac with two years of field data in the arid region of northwest china in future study the model needs to be tested by more data under different climate and soil

10991,agro eco hydrological models are essential for managing scarce water resources and ensuring crop productivity here a one dimensional agro eco hydrological model lawstac capable of simulating water and solute transport in layered soil coupled with crop growth is presented and validated lawstac considers eight hydraulic conductivity discretization methods to address the nonlinearity of richards equation for soil water flow lawstac includes two root water uptake models and a flexible root distribution model for reliable transpiration simulation simulation of infiltration in layered soil demonstrated that the methods of arithmetic mean geometric mean and triadic mean performed well among the eight discretization methods the model was further verified by comparison with results from two widely used models hydrus 1d and swap based on the measured data in a spring wheat field for 2007 and 2008 in the northwest china the models produced similar results for flow in layered soil although swap showed some instability in the salinity dynamics lawstac models crop growth with a more efficient parameterization than swap the root mean square error for soil moisture soil salinity concentration and lai simulated by lawstac was less than 0 06 cm3 cm 3 3 56 g l 1 and 0 43 respectively in conclusion lawstac is suitable for simulating soil water and salinity dynamics crop growth and their interactions keywords hydrologic model crop growth model coupling layered soil 1 introduction water shortage and soil salinization are two major factors that negatively affect agricultural productivity molden 1997 cominelli et al 2013 to avoid such negative impacts quantification of crop growth as well as water and solute transport are necessary for development of appropriate policies and measures often field experiments are conducted to investigate the appropriateness of agricultural management practices that aim to enhance water use efficiency and grain production under limited water supply and soil salinization situations tuong and bhuiyan 1999 kahlown and azam 2003 however field experiments with different crops under various soil water salinity and environment conditions are expensive laborious and time consuming especially for long term experiments that involve frequent measurements process based simulation tools enhance the insights gained from long term experiments and potentially improve understanding of crop growth and yield under different hydrological and environmental conditions validated models also permit prognostic exploration of different strategies to improve crop yield and to maintain soil resilience many one dimensional 1d physically based models simulating water and solute dynamics in variably saturated unsaturated soil in field scale are available e g leachm leaching estimating and chemistry model hutson and wagenet 1990 swap soil water atmosphere plant van dam et al 1997 rzwqm root zone water quality model hanson et al 1998 and hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 recent studies used these models to quantify soil water and solute transport processes under different boundary conditions with or without plant interactions cameira et al 2000 kumar et al 2015 salamati et al 2016 as indicated above agricultural systems models can be used as planning tools to determine agricultural management strategies under different environmental scenarios widely used agricultural systems models include epic environmental policy integrated climate williams et al 1989 apsim agricultural production systems simulator mccown et al 1996 wofost world food studies boogaard et al 1998 and dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 in the agricultural systems models the evapotranspiration soil water content and salt content level are key points for calculation eitzinger et al 2004 the water loss through evaporation and transpiration can modify the water distribution in the soil profiles and further affect the salt migration meanwhile the soil moisture and salt content are two main factors controlling the crop root water uptake and affecting the crop growth and yield crops can only consume soil water present in the reach of their roots zhou et al 2012 therefore there are strong interactions between crop growth and the soil water and salt dynamics consequently it is necessary to couple the hydrologic processes with the agricultural systems in order to better understand the agro eco hydrological process and provide basis for scientific agricultural management ma et al 2006 coupled the ceres maize agricultural systems model with rzwqm to address soil and water quality issues with a more comprehensive plant growth description a recent integrated simulation model for improving water use efficiency and crop yields was reported by zhou et al 2012 who linked wofost with hydrus 1d to optimize irrigation scheduling for spring wheat in northwest china later kumar et al 2015 used swap with wofost embedded to simulate soil moisture and solute dynamics along with wheat yields under various saline water irrigation regimes in new delhi india despite these efforts issues remain to be addressed for more accurate simulation in the agro eco hydrological system for example hydrus 1d assumes a fixed root distribution pattern when root growth is considered which might not account for the actual root water uptake in addition an aboveground crop growth model is absent in hydrus the algorithm for solving the solute transport equation in swap adopts an explicit temporal discretization which is prone to instability under abrupt variations of soil water content xu et al 2016 the coupled ceres rzwqm model ma et al 2006 combines the advantages of both a comprehensive description of specific crop growth and reliable predictions of water and nutrient distribution in the root zone however its performance for distinctly layered soils which are common in the field is unclear because it is limited to a fixed number of soil layers sophocleous et al 2009 furthermore no specific attention is paid to the model s performance under such a condition although wang et al 2014 showed that their richards equation based models were capable of simulating water flow in layered soils simulations usually encountered difficulties in achieving water balance and produced numerical oscillations lima vivancos and voller 2004 due to the nonlinearity of hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soils numerical models must incorporate strategies to reliably simulate water movement typically agro eco hydrological models adopt a fixed averaging method to calculate the internodal conductivities simunek et al 2005 alternative methods could improve accuracy and stability of simulation results under different soil structure conditions recent progress in techniques of remote sensing and gis etc have advanced the quantification of regional eco hydrologic systems the spatial and temporal scales involved require coupling between regional groundwater flow models and flow models in the unsaturated zone especially in agricultural areas where layered soil profiles are common li et al 2017 and solute transport simulations are required for practical applications models for such areas should be process based computationally efficient and with robust parameterizations the objectives of this study are a to develop an efficient model lawstac for simulating crop growth and the associated water and solute dynamics in layered soils b to evaluate various conductivity averaging methods used in lawstac for layered soil and c to assess the capabilities and performance of the model by comparing its results with the widely used hydrus 1d and swap models based on the monitored data in a spring wheat field in northwest china 2 description of lawstac lawstac is a process based model that simulates vertical 1d saturated unsaturated water flow and solute transport in layered soils together with crop growth the soil water and solute transport processes are described through the richards equation re and advection dispersion equation ade respectively the crop growth processes are driven by air temperature and solar radiation eight different averaging methods are considered in the model for computing the hydraulic conductivity in the middle of two adjacent nodes the model is compiled in the matlab programming language which can be easily transformed to a standalone executable for instance to be called by a regional scale hydrologic model 2 1 soil water flow soil water flow in the soil

development characteristics are described by the root length and the root density distribution along the soil profile in the model the root length can be given either according to periodically measured experimental data or by the root growth algorithm for the root density distribution we use a normalized spatial distribution function b z to quantify the spatial variation of water extraction

is calculated by the penman monteith method which is partitioned into potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration based on the lai calculated from the crop growth model 2 the actual soil evaporation is calculated considering the soil moisture and soil salinity at the ground surface which is used as the upper boundary condition for the soil water flow model in non infiltration period for irrigation or precipitation the upper boundary is instead switched to the infiltration condition the actual crop transpiration is assumed to be equal to the actual root uptake which is affected by soil moisture and salinity in the root zone and is used as the sink term in the soil water flow model 3 the outputs of the soil water flow model are soil moisture as well as flux which are used to calculate the soil moisture related parameters and advection term in the soil salinity transport model 4 the outputs of the soil solute transport model include the distribution of soil solute concentration in the root zone which in turn affects the root water uptake 5 the ratio between the calculated actual root water uptake and the potential crop transpiration is an indicator of the degree of water stress along with temperature stress water stress modifies crop growth in the crop model 6 the crop growth model determines crop height root length lai biomass and yield these indexes influence the soil water flow as described in 1 and 2 above at the next time step 3 evaluation of hydraulic conductivity averaging methods in a layered soil the eight averaging methods for determining

table 2 the initial condition of soil profile was uniform water pressure head of 10 000 cm and the top boundary condition was constant water pressure head of 50 cm fig 2 shows volumetric water content profiles computed using the various averaging methods after 2 d of infiltration grid spacing δz 2 cm and time increment δt 5 s a fine grid solution δz 0 5 cm δt 5 s was also calculated fig 2 which closely corresponds to the reference solution gastó et al 2002 and is found to be negligibly affected by the choice of hydraulic conductivity averaging methods considering the location of the wetting front shown in fig 2 the arithmetic mean ac geometric mean gc geometric mean of pressure head gp harmonic mean of pressure head hp triadic mean tc and upstream node uc lead to an overestimation of the internodal conductivity while the harmonic mean hc and arithmetic mean of pressure head ap underestimate it among the averaging methods the hc has the lowest calculated value of hydraulic conductivity which is inappropriate for simulating unsaturated flow in the layered soil schnabel and richie 1984 overall the ac gc and tc methods have smaller errors in simulating water movement in layered soil with the mean relative errors of 4 4 3 8 and 5 2 compared to the fine grid solution respectively thus the ac gc and tc methods are more suitable for water infiltration simulation in layered soil under the implicit euler temporal scheme to further assess the ac gc and tc procedures of the lawstac in multilayered soil more than 10 layers a lysimeter infiltration experiment of hills et al 1989a b was selected the lysimeter 94 7 cm diameter 610 cm long was filled with alternating layers of berino loamy fine sand and glendale clay loam the soil core had 29 layers with a total depth of 585 cm the soil hydraulic parameters measured by hills et al 1989a b are listed in table 2 the initial soil water contents were 0 029 cm3 cm 3 for the sand and 0 107 cm3 cm 3 for the clay loam the infiltration water flux applied to the lysimeter was 2 314 cm d 1 fig 3 shows the simulated and observed soil water content profiles after 56 days of infiltration into the layered lysimeter the ac gc and tc methods all predicted the soil water content well in the clay loam layers and slightly overestimated it in the sand layers for grid spacing of 1 cm fig 3a which closely corresponds to the reference solution simulated by hills et al 1989a b for the coarse discretization δz 4 cm the advancement of infiltration wetting fronts simulated by the ac gc and tc methods are slightly larger than the reference solution however the three averaging methods still show satisfactory simulation results of water content in the soil profile with the mean relative errors of 12 0 10 1 and 10 8 compared to the measured data respectively fig 3b moreover the coarse space discretization can improve simulation efficiency by reducing the computational time compared with the fine one especially for the gc method fig 4 therefore for water flow in a multilayered soil with deep depth coarse discretization with reasonable space is preferred when adopting ac gc and tc methods for simulation under the implicit euler temporal scheme 4 evaluation of lawstac by comparing with field data and the other model simulations 4 1 brief introduction of the models used for evaluation of lawstac in order to assess the performance of the lawstac model in a field condition two widely used hydrologic models hydrus 1d simunek et al 2005 and swap van dam et al 1997 were selected for simulating soil water solute dynamics and crop growth processes the models were chosen for the following reasons firstly soil water flow and solute transport simulations in the three models are all based on the re and ade respectively secondly for the method of calculation of actual root water uptake the feddes model can be used in all models finally all these models can be applied to layered soils the detailed algorithm and structure of the three models are listed in table 3 4 2 scenario used for evaluation for model comparison we selected a simulation case based on a spring wheat growing experiment conducted at the huinong experimental site located in ningxia autonomous region northwest china 106 39 e 39 04 n with water flow and solute transport in the layered root zone during 2007 and 2008 the climate in the region is arid continental with annual rainfall of 180 200 mm spring wheat was sown on march 16 and harvested on july 11 the crop was irrigated with water diverted from the yellow river with irrigation schedule shown in table 4 the groundwater level is high about 0 5 2 5 m to the ground surface the total dissolved solid concentration of the irrigation water and groundwater averaged 0 47 and 1 2 g l 1 respectively xu et al 2013 the soil profile at the experimental site has various horizontal layers and the physical properties are shown in table 5 the details of this experiment can be found in xu et al 2013 the monitored data include soil water and salt contents in different depths leaf area index and dry grain yield 4 3 model inputs to make the results simulated by the three models comparable we tried to keep the simulation conditions i e the initial and boundary conditions and the input parameters in the three models consistent in simulating soil water and salinity dynamics we input the same soil hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters to make sure the three models have the same atmospheric evaporation capacity all three models used the reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient to calculate the potential crop transpiration for root growth as swap assumes the root length develops linearly with time the root growth pattern in the other two models was adjusted accordingly for the root distribution with soil depth when the root length changes with time only the function of hoffman and van genuchten eq 24 can be used to describe the root spatial distribution in hydrus 1d so the other two models used the same function the feddes model was used to calculate the root water uptake under water and salinity stresses in the three models in partitioning evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration lai values are necessary for all models but hydrus 1d cannot simulate leaf area changes so the lai values used in hydrus 1d were calculated by taking the averaged lai values simulated by swap and lawstac the three models all used the arithmetic mean conductivity ac given by eq 50 the upper boundary condition was defined as the atmospheric boundary condition since the soil surface was open to the atmosphere and was shifted to infiltration when rainfall or irrigation occurred a variable pressure head boundary condition was specified at the bottom based on the observed groundwater table data input parameters for swap hydrus 1d and lawstac are shown in table 6 the crop growth indicators including maximum crop height maximum root depth and maximum lai were determined according to measured values empirical parameters such as the extinction coefficient were selected by referring to the literature williams et al 1989 boons prins et al 1993 the hydraulic parameters and solute transport parameters of the layered soil used in the three models are listed in table 7 the input parameters of the three models for soil water flow solute transport and crop growth were calibrated via least squares minimization using the observed data in 2007 including the soil water contents and salt concentrations in each soil layer lai and yield the calibrated models were validated using experiment data from the 2008 growing season 4 4 evaluation of model outputs model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed values with the simulated results using different criteria viz the root mean square error rmse and the mean relative error mre these metrics are defined respectively as follows 62 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 63 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 100 where pi and oi i 1 2 n are respectively the simulated and observed values and n is the number of observations the model performance comparison penalized by the number of calibrated parameters was quantified by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 64 a i c 2 k p n s ln r s s n s where kp is the number of calibrated parameters in the model ns is the sample size and rss is the residual sum of squares 4 5 comparison of simulation results model comparisons included the simulated evapotranspiration soil water content soil salinity and crop growth indicators the aboveground crop growth processes were compared only between swap and lawstac because hydrus 1d was unable to simulate these the comparisons are shown in figs 5 8 4 5 1 actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation fig 5 reveals the differences between the models in simulating cumulative actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration in 2007 and 2008 fig 5a shows that results for cumulative actual soil evaporation have similar trends although values vary somewhat swap has the highest actual evaporation rates of the three models while the rates for lawstac are the lowest for hydrus 1d when the pressure head in the soil surface is higher than the critical value the actual evaporation rate is equal to the potential evaporation rate otherwise when the surface pressure head drops below the critical value evaporation is calculated through darcy s law ma et al 2011 in swap the actual evaporation rate is determined by taking the minimum value of the potential evaporation rate and the darcy flux the actual evaporation computed by lawstac is based on the three stage evaporation process eq 22 fig 5b shows that the actual crop transpiration rates simulated by the three models are similar the actual transpiration is the product of potential transpiration and the water stress coefficient as calculated by feddes model in the three models so the differences of the actual transpiration simulated by the three models are small 4 5 2 soil water content the observed soil water contents and the simulated values by swap hydrus 1d and lawstac during calibration and validation are shown in fig 6 the three models show little difference in simulating soil water flow and they match well with the measured data in each soil layer although the numerical schemes for solving the richards equation are different in the three models finite element scheme for hydrus 1d finite difference scheme for swap and lawstac they all use fully implicit method which helps to improve convergence in iteration celia et al 1990 therefore the three models can obtain the stable and satisfying numerical solution of the soil water flow through iteration the performance of the three models was also assessed quantitatively the values of rmse and mre for soil water contents in the whole soil profile are shown in table 9 the rmse values of the three models are all 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 06 cm3 cm 3 during the calibration and validation respectively and the mre values are less than 0 91 and 8 21 for the calibration and validation respectively the results show that three models predict the soil water contents well in the field condition 4 5 3 soil salinity concentration the soil salinity concentration in various soil layers are shown in fig 7 where the three models simulate the soil salinity in different depths well compared with the observed values over the wheat growing season of 2007 and 2008 the simulated results by the three models have no significant difference except a little fluctuation for swap in salt simulation in the surface soil this is because of the different numerical schemes used in swap for solute transport simulation an implicit temporal discretization was used by hydrus 1d and lawstac while swap used an explicit temporal discretization although the swap managed to simulate the evolution of the soil salinity in this simulation case the explicit scheme it used may potentially induce some stability problems in soil with strong heterogeneity the fitness indicators of soil salinity concentration by the three models are given in table 9 results show that the rmse values of the swap hydrus 1d and lawstac are among 1 59 3 73 g l 1 and the respective mre values are among 4 41 1 40 for the calibration and validation which demonstrates that the results of simulated salinity are still satisfactory 4 5 4 lai biomass and crop yield the crop growth as explained earlier could only be simulated by swap and lawstac results for lai and biomass are presented in fig 8 the swap and lawstac both simulate crop growth using the incoming photo synthetically active radiation absorbed by the crop canopy however swap considers crop photosynthesis and respiration which is more complex than lawstec in terms of mechanism singh et al 2006 from fig 8 we can see that despite this lawstac give the reasonable results for the evolution of lai and biomass compared with swap for lai the deviations were considered acceptable for the two models swap 0 43 rmse 0 46 3 88 mre 14 86 lawstac 0 29 rmse 0 43 0 27 mre 13 57 the larger mean relative error mre for validation is due to less measured lai data in 2008 the simulated crop yield by swap 4610 kg ha 1 and lawstac 4619 kg ha 1 are only slightly higher than the observed yield 4600 kg ha 1 during the calibration the observed crop yield was 4771 kg ha 1 for 2008 and the simulated yields by swap and lawstac were 4423 kg ha 1 and 4372 kg ha 1 during the validation respectively thus showing a small difference only the results indicate that the lawstac model can be used to estimate agricultural production 4 5 5 comparison of model performance the model performance comparison was conducted only for swap and lawstac as hydrus 1d is unable to simulate crop growth the total calibrated parameters in swap and lawstac were 77 and 50 respectively as shown in table 8 the aic values for soil water content soil salinity and leaf area index simulated by swap are all larger than that simulated by lawstac which indicates the lawstac is more efficient than swap 5 conclusions in this study a new coupled hydrology crop growth model lawstac was developed based on richards equation for soil water flow the advection dispersion equation for solute transport as well as a detailed crop growth model lawstac considers the soil vertical heterogeneity in simulating water solute dynamics in the root zone as well as crop growth the interaction of crop growth and soil water flow solute transport was improved by integration of two different root water uptake models feddes and s shaped lawstac provides eight different hydraulic conductivity internodal averaging methods to account for abrupt variations at the interfaces of soil layers numerical testing showed that the model can be used into multilayered soils and the internodal conductivity computed using the arithmetic mean ac the geometric mean gc or the triadic mean tc were suitable for simulating water infiltration in layered soil lawstac was assessed by comparing its simulation results with the other two widely used models hydrus 1d and swap the three models were calibrated and validated for prediction of soil water and salt dynamics and growth of spring wheat based on experimental data from 2007 calibration year and 2008 validation year in an experimental station in northwest china under the same scenario the three models performed almost the same in simulating soil water contents in different soil layers while lawstac and hydrus 1d in contrast to swap simulated the soil salinity dynamics more consistently and stably in terms of crop growth simulation although lawstac requires fewer crop data inputs it was found to perform reasonable compared with the more complex swap model therefore the lawstac can be used for simulating soil water and salt dynamics and crop growth processes in layered soil farmland note that we have tested lawstac with two years of field data in the arid region of northwest china in future study the model needs to be tested by more data under different climate and soil

10992,irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72 of water globally many regions of the world are subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders which contain a mixture of management policies leading to the requirement to monitor irrigation water use the study reported here aims to develop and test an approach using landsat observations to monitor irrigation water use over paddock scales without the need for in situ observations ground data or knowledge of planting dates using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice i e negligible runoff drainage and soil moisture change the irrigation is calculated over 25 m x 25 m landsat images the approach uses a combination of three vegetation indices derived from landsat images to calculate crop coefficients k c based on multiple published relationships these are combined through the fao56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two gridded reference evapotranspiration e t o products to estimate actual evapotranspiration providing six e t o k c combinations which are then compared to actual recorded irrigation volumes from test sites the method was tested over an almond farm two vineyards and a cotton field in addition to goulburn murray water s gmw individual farm scale sites with unknown crops all located within australia the developed approach provided estimated irrigation volumes that closely matched measured data for almond and cotton farms while vineyards returned less accurate results due to localised management techniques that do not agree with land management assumptions made the results from gmw showed some indication of the irrigation water use although more details of the site being assessed needs to be available i e crop type and extent this study demonstrates the ability of certain remote sensing k c relationships for sensing irrigation water use and shows the potential applications of the developed approach in monitoring irrigation over paddock scale environments keywords irrigation compliance murray darling basin water resource management remote sensing 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest user of water globally accounting for 72 with estimates increasing to 90 in developing countries wisser et al 2008 australia follows a similar trend with agriculture accounting for 70 of water use in the 2016 17 financial year bom 2018 there is strong competition between stakeholders for access to water resource particularly within prime agricultural areas such as the murray darling basin mdb in australia hart 2016 williams 2017 the fight for water resources is not a problem unique to australia with competition for access to water seen in countries such as egypt sudan ethiopia india bangladesh myanmar thailand laos vietnam cambodia and canada arjoon et al 2016 bjornlund et al 2013 lebel et al 2005 tanzeema and faisal 2001 all these regions face management of policy across both federal and state provincial borders many of these trans governmental disputes for water resource have led to the creation and implementation of water sharing plans in an attempt to manage water levels and extractions although for these management techniques to be effective and enforced there needs to be a simple and effective way to monitor irrigated water use in remote areas this study is focused in australia which water sharing plans are in the process of being implemented to aid in the management of the mdb the mdb is a large interconnected river system which covers parts of four states and encompasses one territory which is managed with rules set out in the murray darling basin plan mdbp the mdbp sets out sustainable diversion limits which have been established by the murray darling basin authority mdba to achieve sharing of water resources between irrigators and communities while ensuring environmental sustainability hart 2016 irrigators within the mbd hold entitlements which leads to the assignment of allocations extractable volumes the allocations assigned each year is determined by factors including water storage levels and forecasts as well as the security levels of user s entitlements both entitlements and allocations can be traded between irrigators and a range of other users such as government departments the water use of irrigators needs to be monitored to ensure compliance with allocation assignments and long term ecosystem sustainability currently the ability to monitor individual irrigator water use in the mdb is based on in situ pump meters which is critical for effectively monitoring water take holley and sinclair 2012 state that the most common breaches of water licencing in nsw occurred when irrigators exceeded their water allocations which should be picked up by effective metering the current technology implemented can be susceptible to equipment failures and potential tampering holley and sinclair 2012 mdba 2017b additionally the need of field staff to read non telemetric devices increases costs dramatically installing and maintaining meters when users may only use pumps intermittently meaning readings are low could be economically ineffective leading to no pump being installed a survey of water users in nsw between september 2012 and july 2013 showed that approximately 62 of respondents had not had their meter recalibrated in the last 3 years holley and sinclair 2015 multiple publications state poor reliability or patchy and low network density particularly in the northern basin in the metering of water take with self reporting of meter readings also prevalent grafton 2019 grafton and wheeler 2018 holley and sinclair 2012 matthews 2017b mdba 2017b an independent nsw government review into water management and compliance recommended among other improvements the adoption and implementation of remote sensing methodologies both as a primary checking method and cross check of traditional methods such as metering matthews 2017a b a recent effort from the mdba in australia has used remote sensing technology to determine extension of reservoirs extraction locations and timing and extents of irrigated areas mdba 2017a 2018 although the method devised by the mdba does not estimate irrigation water use it provides a tool that will aid in the overall compliance monitoring system especially useful in no pump events which are times when no pumping is allowed the current methodologies employed by compliance monitoring agencies related to the management of the mdb do not take advantage of remote sensing observations to simulate irrigation water use this could be used to backup or cross check of compliance enforcement prosecutions used as replacements during meter outages and pinpoint areas that require greater traditional on the ground monitoring the remote sensing approaches can potentially give spatial extends and location of application rather than just the volume of water used as provided by metering as the compliance issue crosses governmental boarders the potential for remote sensing to assess irrigation water use allows validation of water use outside the management area with infrastructure installed the implementation of remote sensing in compliance will not be a replacement for traditional methods rather acts as a compliment in a similar relationship land clearing compliance in australia is already being targeted with earth observation satellites purdy 2009 2010 the irrigation water use can easily be transferable to other important aspects of anthropogenic hydrology previous studies have used irrigation efficiency terms to relate an irrigation application term to water extractions peña arancibia et al 2016 van eekelen et al 2015 which may be more informative in a compliance case additionally the use of remote sensing to identify irrigation water use is easily scaled to larger regions and allows the data and methodology to be repurposed in other hydrological studies this could be used for purposes of water accounting or assessing how irrigation water fluxes affect catchment hydrology ranging from streamflow to groundwater to soil moisture modelling irrigation scheduling and water use calculations are predominately performed with the food and agriculture organisation paper 56 fao56 methodology developed by allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 the fao56 process involves calculating an reference evapotranspiration e t o from meteorological data and using crop coefficients k c based on typical crop phenology to scale the e t o to a crop a e t the k c takes into account the growth stage and type of crop to estimate the transpiration rate the tabled values of k c lack the ability to show variations from the typical behaviour of crops which neglects environmental factors like water stress disease pests salinity or nutrient poor soils the rise of remote sensing relationships to derive k c has somewhat addressed this limitation pereira et al 2015 additionally the remote sensing relationships do not require knowledge of planting dates as it calculates a k c based on the properties of the field at the time of observation there have been many studies performed that aim to develop a relationship to relate a k c to remote sensing observations the majority of these studies validate their relationship with evapotranspiration or canopy cover not irrigation water use calera et al 2017 campos et al 2010 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 johnson and trout 2012 odi lara et al 2016 taherparvar and pirmoradian 2018 trout and johnson 2007 many of the published relationships are developed for single crop types and hence their ability to provide accurate results over a range of crops may be reduced the main relationships investigated in this paper were derived in studies that used multiple crop types which should provide better results for a wider range of crops and situations these relationships are based on the work completed by montgomery et al 2015 kamble et al 2013 and guerschman et al 2009 previous studies have used various forms of remote sensing observations to assess and monitor irrigation water use a study by saadi et al 2015 uses satellite pour l observation de la terre spot high resolution data to assess k c and then run a water balance to calculate water deficits in the soil root zone to schedule irrigation and count water applied the model described by saadi et al 2015 is highly parameterised to account for soil hydraulic properties and initial conditions which leads to it being difficult to implement effectively in locations without in situ measurements or reliable modelled properties relying on modelled soil properties may provide adequate results over regional scales but localised in situ conditions can be different to digital maps published by government agencies this can be particularly evident in agricultural regions or remote areas where soil sampling density is reduced grundy et al 2015 additionally work by senay et al 2016 2017 has used the landsat thermal bands for water use mapping this method does not calculate a typical k c instead using the thermal properties of selected crops to assess crop growth conditions and assign an et fraction this removes the ability to assess crop growth with a known and established coefficient system additionally the 100 m x 100 m resolution of the landsat thermal bands images removes the ability to sense detailed changes over small paddock scales such as localised disease or salinity commonly studies in this area lack simulations over the small farm paddock scale and validation of their results with irrigation data the approach developed for this study aims to combine three k c values obtained from remote sensing images with gridded climate data in the form of two e t o to simulate irrigation water use over paddock scales this paper 1 tests the developed approach over multiple farm paddock scale sites without the need of field analysis or digital soil maps and 2 compare three published k c relationships and two gridded e t o products in simulating irrigation water use through validation with irrigation data this paper lays the groundwork for remote sensing applications to be used in irrigation water use monitoring these applications may include larger regions or different crop types the method has potential to be blended with other remote sensing and modelling methodologies to form a complete crop identification and water use assessment tool the results presented in this paper may give future water managers and researchers the knowledge to choose between various remote sensing k c relationships and gridded e t o products to find the best result for their situation 2 material and methods 2 1 site descriptions in this study actual irrigation volumes were collected from multiple sites over australia including four discrete farms located in south australia and queensland with known crop types additionally irrigation was simulated for 2861 fields from within goulburn murray water s gmw area of operations located in victoria australia with unknown crop types selection of these sites for the study was based on gaining a spread of different sites to cover long and short crop types various time periods different size paddocks and changing climate conditions fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites within australia with corresponding aerial photos of the field extents 2 1 1 discrete farms four discrete farm areas with three different crops grown under conventional monoculture conditions were selected for this study the availability of reliable irrigation data was a predominate driver in the selection of these sites as well as the need to show different crop varieties the key features of the study sites are follows site 1 almond farm nonpareil price and keane varieties located in the northern adelaide plains south australia pitt et al 2015 site 2 vineyard cabernet sauvignon varieties located in the mclaren vale wine region south australia pitt et al 2015 site 3 vineyard chardonnay grapes on ramsey rootstock located near waikerie south australia phogat et al 2017 and site 4 cotton farm bollgard ii roundup ready variety located near emerald in central queensland pendergast et al 2013 the almond farm and vineyard from mclaren vale have comprehensive data that was provided by the south australian research and development institute sardi this allows comparison with observed monthly irrigation depths the lengths of this data is from july 2013 june 2016 for the almond farm and from july 2011 june 2014 for the wine grape 1 location the cotton and wine grapes 2 fields were taken from manuscripts published by pendergast et al 2013 and phogat et al 2017 with irrigation data and hence only a yearly comparison is possible the date ranges for these locations ranges from july 2010 june 2012 and july 2007 june 2012 for the wine grapes 2 and cotton respectively the annual average irrigation depths recorded for the almond wine grapes 1 and 2 and the cotton farm are 923 mm 139 mm 281 mm and 363 mm respectively 2 1 2 goulburn murray water goulburn murray water gmw is a regional water authority located directly south of the murray river in northern victoria gmw provides irrigation services to the goulburn murray irrigation district which is approximately 9900 km2 mdba 2010 land use within the goulburn murray irrigation district contains agricultural commodities such as dairy cereal grains rice fruit and nut trees grapes and livestock mdba 2010 the mdba 2010 stated that pressures from dry periods are pushing farmers from activities like dairying to more horticultural style commodities that are more adaptable to available water and remove the economic cost of buying feed grown externally additionally the mdba 2010 mention the lowered commodity price seen in december 2008 due to the global financial crisis as impacting the production of dairy in the region this is also seen in the milk price index published by the department of agriculture and water resources dawr 2019 dairy australia and murray dairy 2017 show that from a survey performed in the period of 2000 2004 to the 2009 10 financial year the area used for dairy had decreased from 235 584 ha 2721 properties to 123 571 ha 1143 properties showing the pressures felt on the region from the extended dry period during the millennium drought the high cost of temporary water trade was cited as effecting their business viability the same report by dairy australia and murray dairy 2017 shows that in the 2015 16 season the predominate land use in the region was still dairy which has slightly increased since 2009 10 rising to 126 720 ha 1142 properties land that has transitioned away from dairying due to pressures from drought has predominately changed to land associated with the dairy industry fodder or grazing or to cropping properties gmw has provided de identified meter readings for approximately 2800 site specific land parcels ranging from 15 ha to approximately 4000 ha from within its area of operations for one water year 1 july 2016 30 june 2017 the data was shared with the proviso that individual locations and readings are not published the location of gmw is shown in fig 1 as a single point 2 2 ancillary data 2 2 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data in this study gridded climate data from both the bureau of meteorology bom and through the queensland government s scientific information for land owners silo service was used these are available in a 0 05 0 05 grid approximately 5 km x 5 km over australia which is delivered on daily time steps and interpolated from gauging stations jeffrey et al 2001 jones et al 2009 a monthly time step of the precipitation was downloaded from the bom s operational australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model http www bom gov au water landscape frost et al 2016 a daily time step for two different e t o products are downloaded from silo https silo longpaddock qld gov au gridded data jeffrey et al 2001 the e t o provides the et of a theoretical crop which is considered the reference ground cover either grass or alfalfa which is scaled based on the k c to calculate the actual evapotranspiration a e t the products downloaded include the fao56 short crop e t o allen et al 1998 for a grass reference crop and the american society of civil engineers asce tall crop e t o allen et al 2000 for an alfalfa reference crop the process of calculating these e t o products is through a modified penman monteith equation defined by allen et al 1998 which is described in eq 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where e t o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day γ is the psychometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa c n is a constant that is a function of the time step and aerodynamic resistance c d is a constant that is a function of the time step bulk surface resistance and aerodynamic roughness the c n and c d values vary between the fao56 and asce methods the values for fao56 are 900 and 0 34 for c n and c d respectively which corresponds to a grass reference crop allen et al 2000 the asce calculation use values 1600 and 0 38 for c n and c d respectively which is based on an alfalfa reference crop allen et al 2000 these values are changed to account for the differences that would be seen when comparing the vegetation properties and responses during transpiration the two et products were downloaded as daily values and summed into monthly time steps for analysis as the products are computed over a daily time step typical assumptions such as a negligible soil heat flux g are applied to this product finally the silo fao56 and asce methods assume a 2 m s wind speed u 2 for calculation silo 2016 preliminary studies using point based rainfall and et data showed poor results when using evapotranspiration products other than the fao56 or asce e t o bretreger et al 2018 the simulations using the morton potential evapotranspiration p e t and penman p e t showed large overestimations compared to using the fao56 or asce e t o for this reason products that calculate a p e t or e t o using morton penman or pan evaporations are not considered in the current calculations mcmahon et al 2013 also reported that the e t o methods are more suited for crop water demand modelling 2 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study comprises the optical and infrared bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites these were accessed remotely through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which processes the satellite images through the correction process developed by li et al 2012 to obtain a normalised surface reflectance the landsat surface reflectance values were used for the calculation of the various indices that were then related to the k c dea provides landsat images with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m while their revisit time is approximately 16 days in australian albers gda94 projected coordinate system epsg 3577 the time series of the three satellites were concatenated through time to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis during times when multiple satellites were orbiting during periods of three satellites orbiting this allows for approximately weekly revisit times the use of satellites with higher spatial or temporal frequency such as the esa s sentinel satellites were dismissed as they lack the historical backlog of images to match validation data the pixels affected by clouds were removed from satellite images using a pixel quality masking function developed by sixsmith et al 2013 which is built into dea the pixel quality masking is a combination of the function of mask fmask zhu and woodcock 2012 and automated cloud cover assessment acca irish et al 2006 methods this removal functions also removes cloud and terrain shadow from the images 2 3 methodology the general schematic of the method developed for this study is presented in fig 2 the detailed processes followed in this paper is described following this schematic the methodology described in this paper involves using work initially developed for irrigation scheduling the natural water balance is altered to make it more representative of a water balance that would be observed in an agricultural setting the method described here allows the simulation of irrigation water use without the need to know on ground conditions and does not require site visits a natural pristine environment water balance could be considered by eq 2 2 δ s p a e t q d where δ s is the change in soil moisture p is the precipitation a e t is the actual evapotranspiration q is the runoff and d is drainage to the aquifer in this study all units are in mm month an assumption was made that farmers and irrigators are attempting to follow best agricultural practice reducing drainage and runoff wallace 2000 and capturing any that does occur hsiao et al 2007 which will minimise these fluxes additional assumptions include that due to the method being implemented at monthly time scales the changes in soil moisture and any leaching to remove the accumulation of salt in the system will be negligible compared to the other fluxes this monthly time scale assumption also contributes to the drainage and runoff terms with the addition of an irrigation term to the natural water balance in combination with the assumptions stated above the irrigation depth could then be described by eq 3 3 i r r a e t p where i r r is the irrigation depth mm month while a e t and p are the actual evapotranspiration mm month and precipitation mm month respectively senay et al 2016 also reported the same assumption in their study as they performed simulations in a semi arid to arid area which is similar to the vast majority of regional australia as the simulation assesses a depth of irrigation the spatial extent of the study plot is accounted for when preparing the comparison data the assumptions made to get to this point greatly reduce the complexity of the water balance and the need to know the hydraulic characteristics and initial moisture conditions of the soil although may introduce small errors into the resulting final value using the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the a e t was calculated using eq 4 4 a e t e t o k c where a e t is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month and k c is the crop coefficient generally k c can be taken from published tables as outlined in the introduction alternatively k c values can be determined from remote sensing vegetation indices which address some of these limitations as the image characterises the crops at the instance the image was taken in the study reported here the k c values were calculated using three established methods i e irrisat kamble and cmrset based on remote sensing vegetation indices formulas used to calculate various vegetation indices used in this study are given in table 1 while equations used to calculate the three k c values are given in table 2 trout and johnson 2007 reported a relationship between the ndvi and canopy cover with the canopy cover linked to k c value trout and johnson 2007 recommended not combining the equations so the canopy cover term can be corrected the irrisat irrigation scheduling application in australia hornbuckle et al 2016 montgomery et al 2015 https irrisat cloud appspot com used an alternative version of this which relates ndvi directly to k c and consequently has been used in the study reported here table 2 the original relationship was derived over a field containing watermelon cantaloupe peppers beans tomatoes lettuce onion garlic cotton pistachio almond and grapes trout and johnson 2007 meaning they should provide reliable results over a range of crop types trout and johnson 2007 state that as their relationship relies solely upon the ndvi it is likely to only work on predominately green vegetation this was found during the derivation of the relationship as a field of dark red lettuce returned very low ndvi values trout and johnson 2007 another k c relationship was also calculated using a linear regression equation with ndvi values as described by kamble et al 2013 the study reported by kamble et al 2013 was conducted over soybeans maize and grass crops providing a range of crop signatures in its derivation their study found that there was little difference between the derived equations for types of agriculture and consequently the relationships reported for dryland agriculture irrigated agriculture and combined agriculture returned similar accuracies in the present study the relationship for combined agriculture is used which returned an r2 value of 0 83 as this method relies solely upon the ndvi it will be subject to reduced accuracy over non green vegetation similar to the irrisat relationship guerschman et al 2009 derived a model to obtain a k c table 2 which by using the global vegetation moisture index gvmi as a parameter in the residual moisture index rmi removes the sole reliance on the near infrared to red relationship which may limit the irrisat and kamble equations the method is known as the csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration cmrset method http remote sensing nci org au u39 public html wirada index shtml the model uses the enhanced vegetation index evi rather than ndvi as it minimised the saturation effects experienced with the ndvi when leaf area index is high only the model variant 2b as described by guerschman et al 2009 has been used in our study as this provided the best results during their tests over australia as this method uses both the evi and rmi it is taking into account the greenness and water content of the plant which may improve its ability to sense non green vegetation additionally the method described by guerschman et al 2009 accounts for intercepted water evaporation using k e i p in eq 5 when combining with e t o the equation used in the cmrset method is shown in eq 5 5 a e t k c e t o k e i p where a e t is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month k c is the crop coefficient k e i is a fraction of a k e i m a x term that is scaled by the rescaled evi e v i r that quantifies evaporation from the leaf surface and p is the precipitation mm month although these general k c relationships will be used predominately throughout the analysis of this paper experiments testing the performance of k c relationships specific for the crops observed were performed the equations used are for cotton hunsaker et al 2005 and row vineyards campos et al 2010 specific relationships to model almonds the other crop being studied was not found for evaluation these k c relationships are related to ndvi through a regression in a similar manner to the kamble and irrisat equations as plastic mulching was identified in the wine grapes 1 field the k c was altered using mulching factors as per the information detailed by allen et al 1998 this is performed by reducing the k c by a percentage ranging from 10 to 30 which changes based on the irrigation technique and material used for mulching to account for the reduction in soil evaporation from the site in months of complete cloud cover irrigation is assumed to be zero as this generally occurs during the wet season during times of high rain and the increased cloud cover will reduce et in south east australia the wet season occurs during winter hence there is lower et and deciduous dormancy or breaks in the growing season for annual commodities crops in areas that are subject to a summer wet season e g the qld cotton farm are more likely to have cloudy months during the hot summer period which may be when rainfall may not completely fulfil crop water requirements which is a potential limitation of the approach in the fields simulated in this study months with no satellite observations coincided during months of zero metered irrigation meaning no change in results occurred this assumption is a limitation that should be investigated when implementing in other regions a potential solution is interpolating between the neighbouring months or use of additional satellite data with higher temporal coverage the irrigation readings for some of the paddocks were provided in irrigation depth mm while others were given as a volumetric flow ml these flows were divided by the area of the respective field to find an irrigation depth over each property the values were recorded by timing irrigation events through a system with a known static flowrate the irrigation data used for analysis from gmw was filtered with only sites using over 100 mm of irrigated water depth per year being simulated as sites with less were deemed non irrigating that year by filtering by 100 mm the number of comparison sites was reduced to from approximately 2800 to 1365 the 100 mm value was picked conservatively as no other comparison sites recorded depths under 100 mm with the exception of wine grapes 1 in 2011 12 which was due to above average rainfall events pitt et al 2015 as the extractions recorded by gmw may be being used for livestock or domestic drinking water this may cause anomalies in results as ground cover will not change to correspond with pump meter readings particularly on sites with lower water use the comparisons for the discrete farm sites are performed over both monthly where available and yearly metering periods yearly comparisons are performed over water years july june as this is the typical reporting period in australia annual simulated values are obtained by simulating monthly irrigation time steps monthly k c and aggregating these for the 12 month period of interest the data from gmw is simulated in separated land parcels although aggregated for analysis some customer parcels were combined into aggregated land masses that contained more than one pump meter in these cases meter readings were combined the gmw simulations are compared with one annual irrigation depth for each field the comparison of the simulated irrigation depths with the depths recorded via metering for all sites is performed via a root mean square error rmse eq 6 6 r m s e y ˆ t y t t 1 t 2 t where r m s e is the root mean square error mm y t ˆ is the average irrigation depth mm y t is the irrigation depth mm and t is the number of months that are compared additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 meaning the simulation is averaging the correct value finally the gmw sites are compared with a 1 1 scatter graph showing simulated vs observed irrigation 3 results and discussion the results and discussion firstly focuses on the four discrete farm sites in relation to crop coefficient changes through the season irrigation time series and then finally the evaluation metrics followed by the discussion of results from the gmw simulations 3 1 discrete farms 3 1 1 crop coefficient changes over time the monthly average values of k c determined from remote sensing vegetation indices over the four discrete farms are shown in fig 3 while the average monthly k c derived from landsat pixels using the irrisat method changing spatially over time for the four farms are shown in the appendix fig a1 the k c values calculated by the cmrset relationship were found to be not as sensitive to seasonal change in crop conditions compared to k c values calculated by the irrisat and kamble methods this is shown in fig 3 this is could be due to the k c m a x term used in the cmrset relationship that prevents higher values the almond crop is showing significant growth in the irrisat and kamble k c values 0 6 to 0 8 from august to september october when leaf and bud development would be occurring before pit hardening in late october early november harvest for this almond farm occurs predominately in february where the k c value is shown to reduce when transitioning to senescence in april the mechanical process of harvesting which shakes the trees pitt et al 2015 contributes to this reduction through leaf drop as the almond crop is dormant for the deciduous winter phase of growth there is a reduction in k c values lowering to 0 5 0 6 the leaf drop on this field is recorded as occurring in early may pitt et al 2015 the spatial patterns over the almond farm show a decrease in k c closer to the property boundary which may be due to decreased canopy density on field edges as show in fig a1 despite this the images show the general trend of the almond growing season although slight spatial variation within the field is evident this may be caused by water stress or disease within localised parts the field pitt et al 2015 show images of almond trees subject to salinity stress after a heat wave in january 2013 outside our comparison that demonstrate how the signatures may alter across the field the winter months produce higher values of k c than expected for a deciduous crop this could be contributed to the growths of cover crops grasses etc during this period as shown in aerial images available through google earth not shown in this paper while the aerial images indicated that the grasses were removed during the summer period which could be due to the slashing process as reported by pitt et al 2015 the monthly average k c for the wine grapes farms showed less obvious correlation with the traditional growing seasons in consistency with the observation from almond farm the cmrset method does not show much sensitivity to the changes occurring in the field during growing seasons for the same reasons as the almond tree observations fig 3b 3c the observations of k c from the wine grapes 1 field is continually higher than wine grapes 2 an access path through the wine grapes 2 field visible in fig 1 could contribute to this this feature is also evident in the landsat images producing a decreased k c through the field fig a1 phogat et al 2017 reported that bud burst for wine grapes typically occurs in late august early september which can be seen with an upward trend of k c beginning during these months as leaves continue to grow increasing until the fruit development stage this is also shown in the spatial patterns fig a1b a1c of both fields as they begin to change colour as this typical fruiting period is reached full leaf cover for wine grapes 2 occurs in late november early december and lasts approximately three months phogat et al 2017 the summer period shows a continuously high k c until the autumn leaf fall occurring near the end of march the march to may period shows a decline as vines start to drop leaves for their winter dormancy although there is an increase in k c before the typical growth season starts again the aerial images available through google earth shows that there is still greenness seen in winter similar to the almond field the increase in the k c values is likely related to the winter wet season allowing grasses to grow under the dormant vines this trend is seen in both the wine grapes 1 and 2 fields in contrast to wine grapes 2 the wine grapes 1 field shows irregular patterns of k c across the fields in particularly there are continuously higher values in the south west corner fig a1 b from the aerial image in fig 1 the soil can be seen through the canopy of the vines meaning the vineyard floor spectral properties are likely contributing to the ndvi and hence the k c values pitt et al 2015 and phogat et al 2017 described that the row spacing in wine grapes 1 and 2 as 2 75 m and 3 35 m respectively while the vine spacing is 1 8 m and 2 5 m the large spaces between vines are filled with a mixture of annual and perennial grasses that may contribute to the green readings shown in these images extreme events may be causing average values to reduce such as a severe hailstorm hitting the area near wine grapes 2 in november 2016 during the following season a much lower k c was observed although this particular event is outside our study period it gives an indication of how severe weather events may alter observations the k c values from the irrisat and kamble methods over the cotton field match with typical growing seasons described by cotton australia 2018 after harvest and during soil preparation june september there is a defined low period in k c values fig 3d cotton planting occurs in september to november pendergast et al 2013 and consequently the k c was found to spike in november in time with the typical growing season the growing season typically lasts until february which leads to harvesting from march to june which is shown in the decline in k c the low value is maintained over winter while there would be no crops sown and satellites would observe only the bare soil the spatial patterns fig a1 d shown although the k c values are uniform the edges are showing noticeable decreases during the summer high period the k c values observed in the centre of the cotton farm in december 2011 show extremely high values although the lower values observed on the edge of the field are lowering the overall field s k c during april there is a decrease shown across the south east side of the field which coincides with the harvest period the pattern could be showing spectral patterns from a mid harvest image or due to nutrient deficiencies over parts of the field caused by crop uptake during the growing season the changes seen throughout the seasons follow a clear trend for the almond and cotton farms while the wine grapes are not as stark this may be due to a less extensive canopy cover which allows soil colour or under canopy vegetation to contribute to the overall spectral observation it is evident that the irrisat and kamble relationships are providing a more representative trend of the growing seasons than the cmrset method when comparing winter observations to summer observations indicating they should provide a better estimate of irrigation 3 1 2 time series of irrigation depths the monthly irrigation depth mm were estimated for each landsat pixels as described in section 2 3 and the average monthly values for the almond farm and wine grapes 1 field both with and without the mulching factor applied are presented in fig 4 time series data for wine grapes 2 and cotton farms were not available the general trend of the irrigation time series shows the crop growth and water requirements change through the seasons during the winter months there was no irrigation water required this is partially due to the lower water requirements of crops due to the reduced e t o during winter and as the crops are entering winter dormancy or at breaks in the cropping cycle for the almond farm no significant difference was found between the estimated irrigation depth and actual irrigation as shown in fig 4 the cmrset method is less effective showing a clear underestimation compared to the other relationships using the same e t o compared to the other methods differences between the actual irrigation and estimated irrigation from the asce e t o with the irrisat and kamble k c were minimum obtaining better results with the asce method is due to the derivation of aerodynamic and stomatal resistance being representative of tall crops as opposed to short crops from the fao56 method as tree roots would typically have a deeper rooting depth the volume of water that would be lost to deep drainage and not accounted for in this approach will be minimised franco and abrisqueta 1997 found that young almond trees had high density rooting depth to 60 cm with some roots observed deeper as almonds are commonly irrigated using regulated deficit irrigation the results indicate that the reduced shoot leaf development caused by reduced water availability is observed in the satellite images and the approach developed for this paper portrays that physiological change in the irrigation simulation results in contrast to the almond farm the fao56 method is showing a closer representation than the asce method for the wine grapes 1 simulation this could be due to the aerodynamic and stomatal resistance being suitable for shorter crops this means that for accurate simulations there could be a broad classification of the crop being grown into a tall asce or short fao56 crop before simulation future work especially in an operational setting or when applying this for unspecific cropping areas may be able to identify the crop type into tall and short categories before simulating irrigation water use to improve accuracy this may be through using additional remote sensing approaches that use image time series to classify each crop type many methods have been developed using a range of sensors both individually and combined products belgiu and csillik 2018 li et al 2014 peña barragán et al 2011 van tricht et al 2018 an alternative option is integration with relevant government agency published land use maps that show commodity extents although this will change between years for the wine grapes 1 field estimated irrigation depths from all methods were found to be much higher compared to the actual irrigation volume fig 4b phogat et al 2017 found that wine grape vines show similar yields when subject to sustained water stress meaning an assumption in this study s approach that water stress is avoided or minimised may not be true when simulating wine grape irrigation the row spacing for wine grapes 1 is outlined by pitt et al 2015 at 2 75 m intervals and hence the ground cover of volunteer grasses and soils may influence the spectral values observed additionally the high over estimation of the actual irrigation on the wine grapes 1 field can be partly attributed to rainfall redirection plastic sheeting as presented in pitt et al 2015 study this plastic sheeting did not cover the complete field with five different methods being tested including buried plastic sheeting infiltration reduction chemical sprays and bare earth mounds the presence of the plastic acts as a mulch which reduces the soil evaporation component of the evapotranspiration term in the approach while also increasing transpiration potential additionally modelling results from pitt et al 2015 showed that this management technique increased drainage as the same irrigation volume was applied to plastic mulched fields as bare soil fields although the approach over estimated the total irrigation volume the simulations successfully showed the trend of the peaks and troughs indicating there may be a scaling issue in the relationships a 30 reduction factor was applied to the k c accounting for the plastic mulch as this field has been watered by drip irrigation as recommended by allen et al 1998 a simulation with this reduction in k c was performed and is shown in fig 4c this showed an improvement in the simulations over the comparison period with a reduction of approximately 50 mm in the irrigation peak of the 2012 13 summer although the reduction in simulated irrigation depth is improving the accuracy of the developed approach it is still producing substantial over estimations compared to the actual irrigation this suggests that the mulching factor improves the accuracy of the approach although in areas with heavy water stress the method is still unable to simulate irrigation with high levels of accuracy phogat et al 2017 reported that a number of studies found that daily crop et from various wine grape fields from australia the mediterranean and california averaged between 2 and 2 2 mm day the daily average a e t for the wine grapes 1 field during 2000 2017 shows an average of 2 5 mm day between the combinations of k c and e t o while reducing to 1 7 mm day in the mulched simulations the values are approximately what is expected based on these previous et studies over wine grape fields as the approach is still over estimating the irrigation even with a mulching factor this indicates that water stress is likely applied to the vineyard it is common for wine grapes to be subject to minor sustained water deficits to improve fruit and wine quality chaves et al 2007 van leeuwen et al 2009 this may partially explain the over estimation in the wine grapes 1 field as regulated deficit irrigation can cause a controlled depletion of soil moisture chai et al 2015 which is not accounted for in this approach zarcotejada et al 2005 found that indices such as the ndvi perform poorly at identifying physiological stress conditions in vineyards meaning the method is unlikely to be picking up the induced minor water stress goldhamer et al 2005 showed that although water deficits may help almond yield production per unit of area this is due to a reduction in a e t from a reduced canopy size and lower tree density this has been seen in satellite images through a reduced k c value caused by a reduction in red light absorption leading to accurate irrigation simulations the effects of chronic water stress has been observed by ndvis in vineyards and orchards by glenn et al 2011 indicating that significant stress should still be detected by the ndvi despite its limitations when observing minor stress the general trends of the peaks and troughs are occurring in the correct spots indicating that in certain circumstances simulations may be improved by calibrating the k c relationships or by using a relationship that takes these management practices into account calibrating for each crop to address the error concerns will require large amounts of on the ground data which may reduce the practicality of developing and using the approach an option for calibration may be to produce a relationship for tall crops and a relationship for short crops rather than individual crop types which will reduce the data requirements the use of a calibrated relationship will of course mean some knowledge of the crop will be required which is discussed previously in this section the method can be used in its current state in situations where calibration is not possible or practical although users need to be aware of the potential limitations the results of this method only compare against irrigation depths as this is the observed data available the requirements to know the extractions or changes in farm dam storage is an anthropogenic water flux which is also of interest this has not been discussed in this paper due to the lack of validation data although a potential solution is using typical efficiency values van eekelen et al 2015 used a 0 75 efficiency value for irrigation efficiency to find surface water extraction values from irrigation estimation a similar method could be applicable to finding groundwater extraction values using typical efficiency values for certain crop types and irrigation methods will likely work for this application as shown by peña arancibia et al 2016 the knowledge of water extraction and farm storage changes are more closely linked with water compliance that irrigation application with the potential to also effective other hydrological modelling approaches such as streamflow assessments 3 1 3 results from evaluation metrics the monthly irrigation depths mm were estimated for each landsat pixels as described in section 2 3 and the annual values for each discrete farm were calculated from the monthly outputs the ratios of the yearly accumulated simulated irrigation depths to the actual irrigation were calculated and an average between each year simulated is shown in fig 5 for the wine grapes 1 field the mulching factor 30 reduction factor simulations are presented the rmse values of simulations are shown in table 3 spatial variation in irrigation depth is shown in the appendix in fig a2 for the almond farm the methods used provided estimated irrigation volumes that closely matched measured data fig 5a the results with the best fit to measured data estimated irrigation actual irrigation ratio 1 09 rmse for annual data 90 5 mm and rmse for monthly data 24 3 mm was obtained when the asce kamble combination was incorporated the asce method shows its effectiveness at taking into account taller crop wind and stomatal resistance more effectively additionally the deeper tree roots withdrawing from deeper soil layers removes the chance of losses to drainage the irrisat and kamble methods both show a good match with seasonal almond growing fig 3 which is a substantial driver in obtaining accurate irrigation depths the lower irrigation value obtained in january 2015 is evident of high rainfall in contrast february and december 2015 both have low rainfall values and hence a higher irrigation volume is simulated as also shown in fig a2a the wine grapes 1 and 2 fields both show overestimation of the irrigation water use over yearly time scales estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 86 for wine grapes 1 farm and 1 24 for wine grape 2 farm for the wine grape 1 farm the results with the best fit to measured data estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 86 rmse for annual data 112 mm and rmse for monthly data 17 8 mm was obtained when the fao56 cmrset combination was incorporated while for the wine grape 2 farm the results with the best fit to measured data estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 24 and rmse for annual data 93 4 mm was obtained when the fao56 kamble combination was incorporated the differences in e t o k c combinations between the two vineyards is potentially caused by differing management practices phogat et al 2017 states that the k c that they calculated over wine grapes 2 was much lower than the tabulated k c stressed values presented in fao56 for wine grapes allen et al 1998 whereas pitt et al 2015 does not detail the water stress involved in the management of the wine grapes 1 field and therefore is assumed typical sensing chronic water stress in vineyards and orchards has been observed with ndvi glenn et al 2011 while minor stress is difficult to identify zarcotejada et al 2005 the differences seen in these wine grapes fields may be due to the ndvi picking up the significant stress in wine grapes 2 while the wine grapes 1 minor stress is unnoticed causing the wine grapes 2 field to be better simulated the cloud cover in july 2013 i e winter month has caused the wine grapes 1 to be completely observation free fig a2b although the months on either side of this event indicate that zero or close to zero irrigation would be occurring agreeing with the structure of the approach in months where there are large portions of the observation pixels missing it is evident that averaging the irrigation from the available pixels would provide a reasonable estimation the wine grapes 2 field in november 2011 contains a line of empty pixels that has removed a large part of the southern field which tends to show deeper irrigation this shows that cloud cover in the spring summer months can cover parts of the field which may have an effect on the approach s ability to simulate irrigation accurately over the field for the cotton farm the approach shows greater accuracy compared to that for the wine grapes farms with most simulation s standard deviation encompassing the actual irrigation fig 5d this could be partly due to the high water needs of cotton and consequently farmers are more inclined and or forced to implement best practice irrigation which agrees with the assumptions made in the approach the better results were observed with the fao56 method in combination with the cmrset k c estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 07 and rmse for annual data 129 5 mm the better results with the cmrset relationship may be only accurate over a yearly comparison when observing the monthly averaged k c fig 3d the cmrset method shows less correlation with the typical cotton growing season in australia cotton australia 2018 compared to the irrisat or kamble methods the fao56 and irrisat combination also provided decent results with a 12 underestimation on average with a rmse of 130 mm and 145 mm for the cmrset and irrisat methods respectively both of these methods show similar overall accuracies the spatial images of the cotton irrigation fig a2d shows that the december irrigation for 2011 is extremely low this corresponds with the queensland summer wet season and in particularly an extremely high rainfall event that caused flooding in south east queensland during the 2010 11 summer a simulation was performed using k c remote sensing relationships defined specifically for row vineyards campos et al 2010 and cotton hunsaker et al 2005 against the general k c values used throughout this paper an almond specific relationship was not found for testing the results not shown did not show any significant improvements in wine grapes 1 mulched or 2 nor in simulations in the cotton farm in some instances it reduced the accuracy of the approach compared to the kamble or irrisat k c relationships overall the developed approach shows decent results for almond and cotton farms with very low errors ratios of estimated to observed irrigation of 1 09 and 1 07 respectively the 1 09 achieved over the almond farm translated to decent results on a monthly time series fig 4a using this as a guide we can recommend an error of 10 to be considered accurate over yearly scales as the different crops provide different levels of error knowledge of the crop type is required to define tall or short crops to allow an appropriate e t o method to be used for simulation this is only possible due to the knowledge of the commodity being grown this is investigated further in the following section as the comparisons are performed yearly it reduces the number of comparison data points which may reduce reliability of the validation results additionally over the four farms studied here the accuracy decreases as land size increases this may be an indication that as more land is included in simulations land use differences and localised management practices may be altering the simulation output and propagating the errors as land size increases the results indicate that this approach can simulate irrigation although care should be taken when simulating in areas with minor water stress 3 2 goulburn murray water simulations the gmw simulations were run only for sites with over 100 mm of irrigated water depth 1365 sites over the 2016 17 water year as described in the section 2 3 results are presented via 1 1 scatter plots of simulated versus observed irrigation which are presented in fig 6 the rmse and ratios of estimated to observed irrigation as per the discrete farm study analysis are also included attached to each graph the results show the fao56 e t o performing better than the asce e t o for gmw properties this is evident in all three evaluation measures ratio rmse and scatter graph the asce method is continually overestimating the irrigation water use while the cmrset k c was found to be under estimating the irrigation volume as shown in fig 6 the asce methods contain a large number of extreme outliers and overall shows a larger spread of results compared to the fao56 combinations which provide estimates much closer to the 1 1 line the fao cmrset method produces a very tight set of points although as seen in the four farms previously the cmrset method lacks the seasonal variability seen with kamble or irrisat shown in fig 3 the cmrset method has been seen to underestimate irrigation when simulating the discrete farm sites this is also observed in gmw the better results shown with the fao irrisat combination is likely due to the type of crops grown the fao56 e t o uses grass as a reference crop which is likely similar to crops being grown in an area that focuses predominately on dairying industry e g grasses there are other crops included in the study sites including fruit and nut trees and vineyards although this makes up smaller percentages when looking at results from individual farms some land parcels return better results with the asce e t o the fields with these results are predominately identified by the victorian government land use maps vic agriculture 2017 as orchards groves and plantations not presented due to privacy although it is worth noting that even with a relatively good ratio of estimated to actual irrigation 1 03 there can still be extreme outliers within the simulation dataset with extreme underestimations occurring i e 150 200 mm simulated with 500 mm observed these underestimations are somewhat counteracted in the evaluation measures by overestimations also observed the fao56 simulations although underestimating produce a trend that may be improved with an alternative k c relationship or through calibration of the parameters used to derived the k c from ndvi it is likely a single relationship will not be able to account for the vast differences seen in crop phenology between commodities and the localised climate and management techniques farahani et al 2007 suggests generalised k c s can cause discrepancies due to growing conditions that are different to assumed pristine conditions assumed in the fao56 approach being observed the implementation of multiple relationships based on a tall or short classification will likely be better suited as previously discussed the overall results from gmw still provides a reasonable overall estimation although to gain a reliable and accurate insight into water use prior knowledge of crop type is a minimum requirement possible causes of errors arise from the shapefiles being used as input into the approach the land parcels in the shapefiles provided include everything on the property which can include features such as houses dams canals or larger non agricultural trees the spectral characteristics when observing features on properties have the possibility of disrupting the k c relationships water bodies or houses within the shapefile may cause issues with high reflectivity causing higher a e t values to be calculated and hence increasing estimated irrigation trees with deep root zones that are non agricultural e g trees used for wind breaks or ornamental trees near homes may draw water from soil layers below the irrigated effected layers meaning greenness will be seen during non irrigation events these hydrologic effects are not accounted for by the assumptions in this methodology additionally as the gmw pump meter readings are recorded for billing purposes it may include smaller volumes destined for stock and domestic purposes which are not accounted for in this approach finally some customers own more than a single property with multiple pump meter readings this may cause issues when farm managers may only irrigate or crop part of their property whereas the approach is run over the property boundaries this is particularly evident as some fields may be included in simulations although the field could be comprised of predominately bare soil or dryland crops that will alter the vegetation indices these issues are not seen in the discrete farm properties studied as the shapefiles are situated directly over the cropping areas these features that may interfere with the landsat reflectance may take up substantial parts of or entire pixels 25 m x 25 m which could potentially alter the field s aggregated spectral properties despite these uncertainties the approach still provides an indication of the irrigation water use which would likely improve with additional knowledge of the crop type and spatial extent 4 conclusion the results indicate that the approached outlined in this paper can simulate irrigation although care should be taken when simulating in areas with minor water stress and selecting the k c relationship or e t o product to use in simulation the approach developed in this study has shown its potential for monitoring irrigation water use in a simple but effective way the approach can be used without knowing on the ground information such as soil properties initial conditions planting dates and irrigation techniques although users should be aware of current limitations that may affect their simulations limitations may include lack of knowledge about crop type and hence using inappropriate e t o or minor induced water stress not being identified by ndvi the remotely sensed k c s showed seasonal variations that closely followed typical cropping cycles for the almond cotton and wine grape farms the irrigation results showed a good correlation for the almond farm with the asce kamble combination overestimating slightly with a monthly rmse of 24 mm and an annual ratio of estimated to observed being 1 09 the results from the wine grapes 1 field showed that the approach is able to simulate plastic mulching showing improvements although knowledge of the management technique is required the result from the mulched wine grapes 1 and the unchanged wine grapes 2 field showed that the approach was ineffective at modelling vineyard irrigation with the current k c relationships showing irrigation overestimation for the cotton farm the asce simulations slightly overestimating the irrigation while the cmrset fao56 and irrisat fao56 combinations provided a ratio of 1 07 and 0 88 respectively the use of k c relationships derived specifically for row vineyards and cotton farms did not show significant improvements in simulations the goulburn murray water results showed that the fao56 irrisat combination produced the most accurate values overall for the 1365 sites although some individual sites within gmw classified as orchards groves or plantations showed asce methods performing better as is expected based on the discrete farm results showing that between the e t o products a one method fits all approach is unlikely to produce optimal results currently this method could be used to monitor irrigation once the land parcel is identified as irrigated land in situations where crop type is known the simulation accuracy can be greatly improved by selecting an appropriate e t o the k c relationships indicate that the irrisat and kamble methods are performing the best overall with only rare cases occurring that cmrset returns greater accuracy future work will investigate simulating larger regional scale areas which will include areas not covered my monoculture farming conditions in the method s current form it could be used to inform or trigger additional regulatory actions in compliance monitoring or as a metering crosscheck when run with known crop types although the current uncertainties are too large to be a primary compliance monitoring tool setting a goal of 10 error over an annual scale will likely show decent results over monthly periods and be appropriate for a supplementary compliance tool future work will determine if accuracies over vineyards and potential other study areas will increase to an acceptable level declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the south australian research and development institute sardi and goyder institute

10992,irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72 of water globally many regions of the world are subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders which contain a mixture of management policies leading to the requirement to monitor irrigation water use the study reported here aims to develop and test an approach using landsat observations to monitor irrigation water use over paddock scales without the need for in situ observations ground data or knowledge of planting dates using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice i e negligible runoff drainage and soil moisture change the irrigation is calculated over 25 m x 25 m landsat images the approach uses a combination of three vegetation indices derived from landsat images to calculate crop coefficients k c based on multiple published relationships these are combined through the fao56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two gridded reference evapotranspiration e t o products to estimate actual evapotranspiration providing six e t o k c combinations which are then compared to actual recorded irrigation volumes from test sites the method was tested over an almond farm two vineyards and a cotton field in addition to goulburn murray water s gmw individual farm scale sites with unknown crops all located within australia the developed approach provided estimated irrigation volumes that closely matched measured data for almond and cotton farms while vineyards returned less accurate results due to localised management techniques that do not agree with land management assumptions made the results from gmw showed some indication of the irrigation water use although more details of the site being assessed needs to be available i e crop type and extent this study demonstrates the ability of certain remote sensing k c relationships for sensing irrigation water use and shows the potential applications of the developed approach in monitoring irrigation over paddock scale environments keywords irrigation compliance murray darling basin water resource management remote sensing 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is the largest user of water globally accounting for 72 with estimates increasing to 90 in developing countries wisser et al 2008 australia follows a similar trend with agriculture accounting for 70 of water use in the 2016 17 financial year bom 2018 there is strong competition between stakeholders for access to water resource particularly within prime agricultural areas such as the murray darling basin mdb in australia hart 2016 williams 2017 the fight for water resources is not a problem unique to australia with competition for access to water seen in countries such as egypt sudan ethiopia india bangladesh myanmar thailand laos vietnam cambodia and canada arjoon et al 2016 bjornlund et al 2013 lebel et al 2005 tanzeema and faisal 2001 all these regions face management of policy across both federal and state provincial borders many of these trans governmental disputes for water resource have led to the creation and implementation of water sharing plans in an attempt to manage water levels and extractions although for these management techniques to be effective and enforced there needs to be a simple and effective way to monitor irrigated water use in remote areas this study is focused in australia which water sharing plans are in the process of being implemented to aid in the management of the mdb the mdb is a large interconnected river system which covers parts of four states and encompasses one territory which is managed with rules set out in the murray darling basin plan mdbp the mdbp sets out sustainable diversion limits which have been established by the murray darling basin authority mdba to achieve sharing of water resources between irrigators and communities while ensuring environmental sustainability hart 2016 irrigators within the mbd hold entitlements which leads to the assignment of allocations extractable volumes the allocations assigned each year is determined by factors including water storage levels and forecasts as well as the security levels of user s entitlements both entitlements and allocations can be traded between irrigators and a range of other users such as government departments the water use of irrigators needs to be monitored to ensure compliance with allocation assignments and long term ecosystem sustainability currently the ability to monitor individual irrigator water use in the mdb is based on in situ pump meters which is critical for effectively monitoring water take holley and sinclair 2012 state that the most common breaches of water licencing in nsw occurred when irrigators exceeded their water allocations which should be picked up by effective metering the current technology implemented can be susceptible to equipment failures and potential tampering holley and sinclair 2012 mdba 2017b additionally the need of field staff to read non telemetric devices increases costs dramatically installing and maintaining meters when users may only use pumps intermittently meaning readings are low could be economically ineffective leading to no pump being installed a survey of water users in nsw between september 2012 and july 2013 showed that approximately 62 of respondents had not had their meter recalibrated in the last 3 years holley and sinclair 2015 multiple publications state poor reliability or patchy and low network density particularly in the northern basin in the metering of water take with self reporting of meter readings also prevalent grafton 2019 grafton and wheeler 2018 holley and sinclair 2012 matthews 2017b mdba 2017b an independent nsw government review into water management and compliance recommended among other improvements the adoption and implementation of remote sensing methodologies both as a primary checking method and cross check of traditional methods such as metering matthews 2017a b a recent effort from the mdba in australia has used remote sensing technology to determine extension of reservoirs extraction locations and timing and extents of irrigated areas mdba 2017a 2018 although the method devised by the mdba does not estimate irrigation water use it provides a tool that will aid in the overall compliance monitoring system especially useful in no pump events which are times when no pumping is allowed the current methodologies employed by compliance monitoring agencies related to the management of the mdb do not take advantage of remote sensing observations to simulate irrigation water use this could be used to backup or cross check of compliance enforcement prosecutions used as replacements during meter outages and pinpoint areas that require greater traditional on the ground monitoring the remote sensing approaches can potentially give spatial extends and location of application rather than just the volume of water used as provided by metering as the compliance issue crosses governmental boarders the potential for remote sensing to assess irrigation water use allows validation of water use outside the management area with infrastructure installed the implementation of remote sensing in compliance will not be a replacement for traditional methods rather acts as a compliment in a similar relationship land clearing compliance in australia is already being targeted with earth observation satellites purdy 2009 2010 the irrigation water use can easily be transferable to other important aspects of anthropogenic hydrology previous studies have used irrigation efficiency terms to relate an irrigation application term to water extractions peña arancibia et al 2016 van eekelen et al 2015 which may be more informative in a compliance case additionally the use of remote sensing to identify irrigation water use is easily scaled to larger regions and allows the data and methodology to be repurposed in other hydrological studies this could be used for purposes of water accounting or assessing how irrigation water fluxes affect catchment hydrology ranging from streamflow to groundwater to soil moisture modelling irrigation scheduling and water use calculations are predominately performed with the food and agriculture organisation paper 56 fao56 methodology developed by allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 the fao56 process involves calculating an reference evapotranspiration e t o from meteorological data and using crop coefficients k c based on typical crop phenology to scale the e t o to a crop a e t the k c takes into account the growth stage and type of crop to estimate the transpiration rate the tabled values of k c lack the ability to show variations from the typical behaviour of crops which neglects environmental factors like water stress disease pests salinity or nutrient poor soils the rise of remote sensing relationships to derive k c has somewhat addressed this limitation pereira et al 2015 additionally the remote sensing relationships do not require knowledge of planting dates as it calculates a k c based on the properties of the field at the time of observation there have been many studies performed that aim to develop a relationship to relate a k c to remote sensing observations the majority of these studies validate their relationship with evapotranspiration or canopy cover not irrigation water use calera et al 2017 campos et al 2010 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 hunsaker et al 2005 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 johnson and trout 2012 odi lara et al 2016 taherparvar and pirmoradian 2018 trout and johnson 2007 many of the published relationships are developed for single crop types and hence their ability to provide accurate results over a range of crops may be reduced the main relationships investigated in this paper were derived in studies that used multiple crop types which should provide better results for a wider range of crops and situations these relationships are based on the work completed by montgomery et al 2015 kamble et al 2013 and guerschman et al 2009 previous studies have used various forms of remote sensing observations to assess and monitor irrigation water use a study by saadi et al 2015 uses satellite pour l observation de la terre spot high resolution data to assess k c and then run a water balance to calculate water deficits in the soil root zone to schedule irrigation and count water applied the model described by saadi et al 2015 is highly parameterised to account for soil hydraulic properties and initial conditions which leads to it being difficult to implement effectively in locations without in situ measurements or reliable modelled properties relying on modelled soil properties may provide adequate results over regional scales but localised in situ conditions can be different to digital maps published by government agencies this can be particularly evident in agricultural regions or remote areas where soil sampling density is reduced grundy et al 2015 additionally work by senay et al 2016 2017 has used the landsat thermal bands for water use mapping this method does not calculate a typical k c instead using the thermal properties of selected crops to assess crop growth conditions and assign an et fraction this removes the ability to assess crop growth with a known and established coefficient system additionally the 100 m x 100 m resolution of the landsat thermal bands images removes the ability to sense detailed changes over small paddock scales such as localised disease or salinity commonly studies in this area lack simulations over the small farm paddock scale and validation of their results with irrigation data the approach developed for this study aims to combine three k c values obtained from remote sensing images with gridded climate data in the form of two e t o to simulate irrigation water use over paddock scales this paper 1 tests the developed approach over multiple farm paddock scale sites without the need of field analysis or digital soil maps and 2 compare three published k c relationships and two gridded e t o products in simulating irrigation water use through validation with irrigation data this paper lays the groundwork for remote sensing applications to be used in irrigation water use monitoring these applications may include larger regions or different crop types the method has potential to be blended with other remote sensing and modelling methodologies to form a complete crop identification and water use assessment tool the results presented in this paper may give future water managers and researchers the knowledge to choose between various remote sensing k c relationships and gridded e t o products to find the best result for their situation 2 material and methods 2 1 site descriptions in this study actual irrigation volumes were collected from multiple sites over australia including four discrete farms located in south australia and queensland with known crop types additionally irrigation was simulated for 2861 fields from within goulburn murray water s gmw area of operations located in victoria australia with unknown crop types selection of these sites for the study was based on gaining a spread of different sites to cover long and short crop types various time periods different size paddocks and changing climate conditions fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites within australia with corresponding aerial photos of the field extents 2 1 1 discrete farms four discrete farm areas with three different crops grown under conventional monoculture conditions were selected for this study the availability of reliable irrigation data was a predominate driver in the selection of these sites as well as the need to show different crop varieties the key features of the study sites are follows site 1 almond farm nonpareil price and keane varieties located in the northern adelaide plains south australia pitt et al 2015 site 2 vineyard cabernet sauvignon varieties located in the mclaren vale wine region south australia pitt et al 2015 site 3 vineyard chardonnay grapes on ramsey rootstock located near waikerie south australia phogat et al 2017 and site 4 cotton farm bollgard ii roundup ready variety located near emerald in central queensland pendergast et al 2013 the almond farm and vineyard from mclaren vale have comprehensive data that was provided by the south australian research and development institute sardi this allows comparison with observed monthly irrigation depths the lengths of this data is from july 2013 june 2016 for the almond farm and from july 2011 june 2014 for the wine grape 1 location the cotton and wine grapes 2 fields were taken from manuscripts published by pendergast et al 2013 and phogat et al 2017 with irrigation data and hence only a yearly comparison is possible the date ranges for these locations ranges from july 2010 june 2012 and july 2007 june 2012 for the wine grapes 2 and cotton respectively the annual average irrigation depths recorded for the almond wine grapes 1 and 2 and the cotton farm are 923 mm 139 mm 281 mm and 363 mm respectively 2 1 2 goulburn murray water goulburn murray water gmw is a regional water authority located directly south of the murray river in northern victoria gmw provides irrigation services to the goulburn murray irrigation district which is approximately 9900 km2 mdba 2010 land use within the goulburn murray irrigation district contains agricultural commodities such as dairy cereal grains rice fruit and nut trees grapes and livestock mdba 2010 the mdba 2010 stated that pressures from dry periods are pushing farmers from activities like dairying to more horticultural style commodities that are more adaptable to available water and remove the economic cost of buying feed grown externally additionally the mdba 2010 mention the lowered commodity price seen in december 2008 due to the global financial crisis as impacting the production of dairy in the region this is also seen in the milk price index published by the department of agriculture and water resources dawr 2019 dairy australia and murray dairy 2017 show that from a survey performed in the period of 2000 2004 to the 2009 10 financial year the area used for dairy had decreased from 235 584 ha 2721 properties to 123 571 ha 1143 properties showing the pressures felt on the region from the extended dry period during the millennium drought the high cost of temporary water trade was cited as effecting their business viability the same report by dairy australia and murray dairy 2017 shows that in the 2015 16 season the predominate land use in the region was still dairy which has slightly increased since 2009 10 rising to 126 720 ha 1142 properties land that has transitioned away from dairying due to pressures from drought has predominately changed to land associated with the dairy industry fodder or grazing or to cropping properties gmw has provided de identified meter readings for approximately 2800 site specific land parcels ranging from 15 ha to approximately 4000 ha from within its area of operations for one water year 1 july 2016 30 june 2017 the data was shared with the proviso that individual locations and readings are not published the location of gmw is shown in fig 1 as a single point 2 2 ancillary data 2 2 1 precipitation and evapotranspiration data in this study gridded climate data from both the bureau of meteorology bom and through the queensland government s scientific information for land owners silo service was used these are available in a 0 05 0 05 grid approximately 5 km x 5 km over australia which is delivered on daily time steps and interpolated from gauging stations jeffrey et al 2001 jones et al 2009 a monthly time step of the precipitation was downloaded from the bom s operational australian water resources assessment landscape awra l model http www bom gov au water landscape frost et al 2016 a daily time step for two different e t o products are downloaded from silo https silo longpaddock qld gov au gridded data jeffrey et al 2001 the e t o provides the et of a theoretical crop which is considered the reference ground cover either grass or alfalfa which is scaled based on the k c to calculate the actual evapotranspiration a e t the products downloaded include the fao56 short crop e t o allen et al 1998 for a grass reference crop and the american society of civil engineers asce tall crop e t o allen et al 2000 for an alfalfa reference crop the process of calculating these e t o products is through a modified penman monteith equation defined by allen et al 1998 which is described in eq 1 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where e t o is the reference evapotranspiration mm day δ is the slope of the vapour pressure curve kpa c r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day γ is the psychometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s e s is the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a is the actual vapour pressure kpa c n is a constant that is a function of the time step and aerodynamic resistance c d is a constant that is a function of the time step bulk surface resistance and aerodynamic roughness the c n and c d values vary between the fao56 and asce methods the values for fao56 are 900 and 0 34 for c n and c d respectively which corresponds to a grass reference crop allen et al 2000 the asce calculation use values 1600 and 0 38 for c n and c d respectively which is based on an alfalfa reference crop allen et al 2000 these values are changed to account for the differences that would be seen when comparing the vegetation properties and responses during transpiration the two et products were downloaded as daily values and summed into monthly time steps for analysis as the products are computed over a daily time step typical assumptions such as a negligible soil heat flux g are applied to this product finally the silo fao56 and asce methods assume a 2 m s wind speed u 2 for calculation silo 2016 preliminary studies using point based rainfall and et data showed poor results when using evapotranspiration products other than the fao56 or asce e t o bretreger et al 2018 the simulations using the morton potential evapotranspiration p e t and penman p e t showed large overestimations compared to using the fao56 or asce e t o for this reason products that calculate a p e t or e t o using morton penman or pan evaporations are not considered in the current calculations mcmahon et al 2013 also reported that the e t o methods are more suited for crop water demand modelling 2 2 2 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study comprises the optical and infrared bands from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites these were accessed remotely through digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 lewis et al 2017 which processes the satellite images through the correction process developed by li et al 2012 to obtain a normalised surface reflectance the landsat surface reflectance values were used for the calculation of the various indices that were then related to the k c dea provides landsat images with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m while their revisit time is approximately 16 days in australian albers gda94 projected coordinate system epsg 3577 the time series of the three satellites were concatenated through time to improve the temporal resolution of the analysis during times when multiple satellites were orbiting during periods of three satellites orbiting this allows for approximately weekly revisit times the use of satellites with higher spatial or temporal frequency such as the esa s sentinel satellites were dismissed as they lack the historical backlog of images to match validation data the pixels affected by clouds were removed from satellite images using a pixel quality masking function developed by sixsmith et al 2013 which is built into dea the pixel quality masking is a combination of the function of mask fmask zhu and woodcock 2012 and automated cloud cover assessment acca irish et al 2006 methods this removal functions also removes cloud and terrain shadow from the images 2 3 methodology the general schematic of the method developed for this study is presented in fig 2 the detailed processes followed in this paper is described following this schematic the methodology described in this paper involves using work initially developed for irrigation scheduling the natural water balance is altered to make it more representative of a water balance that would be observed in an agricultural setting the method described here allows the simulation of irrigation water use without the need to know on ground conditions and does not require site visits a natural pristine environment water balance could be considered by eq 2 2 δ s p a e t q d where δ s is the change in soil moisture p is the precipitation a e t is the actual evapotranspiration q is the runoff and d is drainage to the aquifer in this study all units are in mm month an assumption was made that farmers and irrigators are attempting to follow best agricultural practice reducing drainage and runoff wallace 2000 and capturing any that does occur hsiao et al 2007 which will minimise these fluxes additional assumptions include that due to the method being implemented at monthly time scales the changes in soil moisture and any leaching to remove the accumulation of salt in the system will be negligible compared to the other fluxes this monthly time scale assumption also contributes to the drainage and runoff terms with the addition of an irrigation term to the natural water balance in combination with the assumptions stated above the irrigation depth could then be described by eq 3 3 i r r a e t p where i r r is the irrigation depth mm month while a e t and p are the actual evapotranspiration mm month and precipitation mm month respectively senay et al 2016 also reported the same assumption in their study as they performed simulations in a semi arid to arid area which is similar to the vast majority of regional australia as the simulation assesses a depth of irrigation the spatial extent of the study plot is accounted for when preparing the comparison data the assumptions made to get to this point greatly reduce the complexity of the water balance and the need to know the hydraulic characteristics and initial moisture conditions of the soil although may introduce small errors into the resulting final value using the methodology described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the a e t was calculated using eq 4 4 a e t e t o k c where a e t is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month and k c is the crop coefficient generally k c can be taken from published tables as outlined in the introduction alternatively k c values can be determined from remote sensing vegetation indices which address some of these limitations as the image characterises the crops at the instance the image was taken in the study reported here the k c values were calculated using three established methods i e irrisat kamble and cmrset based on remote sensing vegetation indices formulas used to calculate various vegetation indices used in this study are given in table 1 while equations used to calculate the three k c values are given in table 2 trout and johnson 2007 reported a relationship between the ndvi and canopy cover with the canopy cover linked to k c value trout and johnson 2007 recommended not combining the equations so the canopy cover term can be corrected the irrisat irrigation scheduling application in australia hornbuckle et al 2016 montgomery et al 2015 https irrisat cloud appspot com used an alternative version of this which relates ndvi directly to k c and consequently has been used in the study reported here table 2 the original relationship was derived over a field containing watermelon cantaloupe peppers beans tomatoes lettuce onion garlic cotton pistachio almond and grapes trout and johnson 2007 meaning they should provide reliable results over a range of crop types trout and johnson 2007 state that as their relationship relies solely upon the ndvi it is likely to only work on predominately green vegetation this was found during the derivation of the relationship as a field of dark red lettuce returned very low ndvi values trout and johnson 2007 another k c relationship was also calculated using a linear regression equation with ndvi values as described by kamble et al 2013 the study reported by kamble et al 2013 was conducted over soybeans maize and grass crops providing a range of crop signatures in its derivation their study found that there was little difference between the derived equations for types of agriculture and consequently the relationships reported for dryland agriculture irrigated agriculture and combined agriculture returned similar accuracies in the present study the relationship for combined agriculture is used which returned an r2 value of 0 83 as this method relies solely upon the ndvi it will be subject to reduced accuracy over non green vegetation similar to the irrisat relationship guerschman et al 2009 derived a model to obtain a k c table 2 which by using the global vegetation moisture index gvmi as a parameter in the residual moisture index rmi removes the sole reliance on the near infrared to red relationship which may limit the irrisat and kamble equations the method is known as the csiro modis rescaled evapotranspiration cmrset method http remote sensing nci org au u39 public html wirada index shtml the model uses the enhanced vegetation index evi rather than ndvi as it minimised the saturation effects experienced with the ndvi when leaf area index is high only the model variant 2b as described by guerschman et al 2009 has been used in our study as this provided the best results during their tests over australia as this method uses both the evi and rmi it is taking into account the greenness and water content of the plant which may improve its ability to sense non green vegetation additionally the method described by guerschman et al 2009 accounts for intercepted water evaporation using k e i p in eq 5 when combining with e t o the equation used in the cmrset method is shown in eq 5 5 a e t k c e t o k e i p where a e t is the actual evapotranspiration mm month e t o is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm month k c is the crop coefficient k e i is a fraction of a k e i m a x term that is scaled by the rescaled evi e v i r that quantifies evaporation from the leaf surface and p is the precipitation mm month although these general k c relationships will be used predominately throughout the analysis of this paper experiments testing the performance of k c relationships specific for the crops observed were performed the equations used are for cotton hunsaker et al 2005 and row vineyards campos et al 2010 specific relationships to model almonds the other crop being studied was not found for evaluation these k c relationships are related to ndvi through a regression in a similar manner to the kamble and irrisat equations as plastic mulching was identified in the wine grapes 1 field the k c was altered using mulching factors as per the information detailed by allen et al 1998 this is performed by reducing the k c by a percentage ranging from 10 to 30 which changes based on the irrigation technique and material used for mulching to account for the reduction in soil evaporation from the site in months of complete cloud cover irrigation is assumed to be zero as this generally occurs during the wet season during times of high rain and the increased cloud cover will reduce et in south east australia the wet season occurs during winter hence there is lower et and deciduous dormancy or breaks in the growing season for annual commodities crops in areas that are subject to a summer wet season e g the qld cotton farm are more likely to have cloudy months during the hot summer period which may be when rainfall may not completely fulfil crop water requirements which is a potential limitation of the approach in the fields simulated in this study months with no satellite observations coincided during months of zero metered irrigation meaning no change in results occurred this assumption is a limitation that should be investigated when implementing in other regions a potential solution is interpolating between the neighbouring months or use of additional satellite data with higher temporal coverage the irrigation readings for some of the paddocks were provided in irrigation depth mm while others were given as a volumetric flow ml these flows were divided by the area of the respective field to find an irrigation depth over each property the values were recorded by timing irrigation events through a system with a known static flowrate the irrigation data used for analysis from gmw was filtered with only sites using over 100 mm of irrigated water depth per year being simulated as sites with less were deemed non irrigating that year by filtering by 100 mm the number of comparison sites was reduced to from approximately 2800 to 1365 the 100 mm value was picked conservatively as no other comparison sites recorded depths under 100 mm with the exception of wine grapes 1 in 2011 12 which was due to above average rainfall events pitt et al 2015 as the extractions recorded by gmw may be being used for livestock or domestic drinking water this may cause anomalies in results as ground cover will not change to correspond with pump meter readings particularly on sites with lower water use the comparisons for the discrete farm sites are performed over both monthly where available and yearly metering periods yearly comparisons are performed over water years july june as this is the typical reporting period in australia annual simulated values are obtained by simulating monthly irrigation time steps monthly k c and aggregating these for the 12 month period of interest the data from gmw is simulated in separated land parcels although aggregated for analysis some customer parcels were combined into aggregated land masses that contained more than one pump meter in these cases meter readings were combined the gmw simulations are compared with one annual irrigation depth for each field the comparison of the simulated irrigation depths with the depths recorded via metering for all sites is performed via a root mean square error rmse eq 6 6 r m s e y ˆ t y t t 1 t 2 t where r m s e is the root mean square error mm y t ˆ is the average irrigation depth mm y t is the irrigation depth mm and t is the number of months that are compared additionally a ratio of the estimated irrigation to the actual irrigation is calculated with a value of 1 meaning the simulation is averaging the correct value finally the gmw sites are compared with a 1 1 scatter graph showing simulated vs observed irrigation 3 results and discussion the results and discussion firstly focuses on the four discrete farm sites in relation to crop coefficient changes through the season irrigation time series and then finally the evaluation metrics followed by the discussion of results from the gmw simulations 3 1 discrete farms 3 1 1 crop coefficient changes over time the monthly average values of k c determined from remote sensing vegetation indices over the four discrete farms are shown in fig 3 while the average monthly k c derived from landsat pixels using the irrisat method changing spatially over time for the four farms are shown in the appendix fig a1 the k c values calculated by the cmrset relationship were found to be not as sensitive to seasonal change in crop conditions compared to k c values calculated by the irrisat and kamble methods this is shown in fig 3 this is could be due to the k c m a x term used in the cmrset relationship that prevents higher values the almond crop is showing significant growth in the irrisat and kamble k c values 0 6 to 0 8 from august to september october when leaf and bud development would be occurring before pit hardening in late october early november harvest for this almond farm occurs predominately in february where the k c value is shown to reduce when transitioning to senescence in april the mechanical process of harvesting which shakes the trees pitt et al 2015 contributes to this reduction through leaf drop as the almond crop is dormant for the deciduous winter phase of growth there is a reduction in k c values lowering to 0 5 0 6 the leaf drop on this field is recorded as occurring in early may pitt et al 2015 the spatial patterns over the almond farm show a decrease in k c closer to the property boundary which may be due to decreased canopy density on field edges as show in fig a1 despite this the images show the general trend of the almond growing season although slight spatial variation within the field is evident this may be caused by water stress or disease within localised parts the field pitt et al 2015 show images of almond trees subject to salinity stress after a heat wave in january 2013 outside our comparison that demonstrate how the signatures may alter across the field the winter months produce higher values of k c than expected for a deciduous crop this could be contributed to the growths of cover crops grasses etc during this period as shown in aerial images available through google earth not shown in this paper while the aerial images indicated that the grasses were removed during the summer period which could be due to the slashing process as reported by pitt et al 2015 the monthly average k c for the wine grapes farms showed less obvious correlation with the traditional growing seasons in consistency with the observation from almond farm the cmrset method does not show much sensitivity to the changes occurring in the field during growing seasons for the same reasons as the almond tree observations fig 3b 3c the observations of k c from the wine grapes 1 field is continually higher than wine grapes 2 an access path through the wine grapes 2 field visible in fig 1 could contribute to this this feature is also evident in the landsat images producing a decreased k c through the field fig a1 phogat et al 2017 reported that bud burst for wine grapes typically occurs in late august early september which can be seen with an upward trend of k c beginning during these months as leaves continue to grow increasing until the fruit development stage this is also shown in the spatial patterns fig a1b a1c of both fields as they begin to change colour as this typical fruiting period is reached full leaf cover for wine grapes 2 occurs in late november early december and lasts approximately three months phogat et al 2017 the summer period shows a continuously high k c until the autumn leaf fall occurring near the end of march the march to may period shows a decline as vines start to drop leaves for their winter dormancy although there is an increase in k c before the typical growth season starts again the aerial images available through google earth shows that there is still greenness seen in winter similar to the almond field the increase in the k c values is likely related to the winter wet season allowing grasses to grow under the dormant vines this trend is seen in both the wine grapes 1 and 2 fields in contrast to wine grapes 2 the wine grapes 1 field shows irregular patterns of k c across the fields in particularly there are continuously higher values in the south west corner fig a1 b from the aerial image in fig 1 the soil can be seen through the canopy of the vines meaning the vineyard floor spectral properties are likely contributing to the ndvi and hence the k c values pitt et al 2015 and phogat et al 2017 described that the row spacing in wine grapes 1 and 2 as 2 75 m and 3 35 m respectively while the vine spacing is 1 8 m and 2 5 m the large spaces between vines are filled with a mixture of annual and perennial grasses that may contribute to the green readings shown in these images extreme events may be causing average values to reduce such as a severe hailstorm hitting the area near wine grapes 2 in november 2016 during the following season a much lower k c was observed although this particular event is outside our study period it gives an indication of how severe weather events may alter observations the k c values from the irrisat and kamble methods over the cotton field match with typical growing seasons described by cotton australia 2018 after harvest and during soil preparation june september there is a defined low period in k c values fig 3d cotton planting occurs in september to november pendergast et al 2013 and consequently the k c was found to spike in november in time with the typical growing season the growing season typically lasts until february which leads to harvesting from march to june which is shown in the decline in k c the low value is maintained over winter while there would be no crops sown and satellites would observe only the bare soil the spatial patterns fig a1 d shown although the k c values are uniform the edges are showing noticeable decreases during the summer high period the k c values observed in the centre of the cotton farm in december 2011 show extremely high values although the lower values observed on the edge of the field are lowering the overall field s k c during april there is a decrease shown across the south east side of the field which coincides with the harvest period the pattern could be showing spectral patterns from a mid harvest image or due to nutrient deficiencies over parts of the field caused by crop uptake during the growing season the changes seen throughout the seasons follow a clear trend for the almond and cotton farms while the wine grapes are not as stark this may be due to a less extensive canopy cover which allows soil colour or under canopy vegetation to contribute to the overall spectral observation it is evident that the irrisat and kamble relationships are providing a more representative trend of the growing seasons than the cmrset method when comparing winter observations to summer observations indicating they should provide a better estimate of irrigation 3 1 2 time series of irrigation depths the monthly irrigation depth mm were estimated for each landsat pixels as described in section 2 3 and the average monthly values for the almond farm and wine grapes 1 field both with and without the mulching factor applied are presented in fig 4 time series data for wine grapes 2 and cotton farms were not available the general trend of the irrigation time series shows the crop growth and water requirements change through the seasons during the winter months there was no irrigation water required this is partially due to the lower water requirements of crops due to the reduced e t o during winter and as the crops are entering winter dormancy or at breaks in the cropping cycle for the almond farm no significant difference was found between the estimated irrigation depth and actual irrigation as shown in fig 4 the cmrset method is less effective showing a clear underestimation compared to the other relationships using the same e t o compared to the other methods differences between the actual irrigation and estimated irrigation from the asce e t o with the irrisat and kamble k c were minimum obtaining better results with the asce method is due to the derivation of aerodynamic and stomatal resistance being representative of tall crops as opposed to short crops from the fao56 method as tree roots would typically have a deeper rooting depth the volume of water that would be lost to deep drainage and not accounted for in this approach will be minimised franco and abrisqueta 1997 found that young almond trees had high density rooting depth to 60 cm with some roots observed deeper as almonds are commonly irrigated using regulated deficit irrigation the results indicate that the reduced shoot leaf development caused by reduced water availability is observed in the satellite images and the approach developed for this paper portrays that physiological change in the irrigation simulation results in contrast to the almond farm the fao56 method is showing a closer representation than the asce method for the wine grapes 1 simulation this could be due to the aerodynamic and stomatal resistance being suitable for shorter crops this means that for accurate simulations there could be a broad classification of the crop being grown into a tall asce or short fao56 crop before simulation future work especially in an operational setting or when applying this for unspecific cropping areas may be able to identify the crop type into tall and short categories before simulating irrigation water use to improve accuracy this may be through using additional remote sensing approaches that use image time series to classify each crop type many methods have been developed using a range of sensors both individually and combined products belgiu and csillik 2018 li et al 2014 peña barragán et al 2011 van tricht et al 2018 an alternative option is integration with relevant government agency published land use maps that show commodity extents although this will change between years for the wine grapes 1 field estimated irrigation depths from all methods were found to be much higher compared to the actual irrigation volume fig 4b phogat et al 2017 found that wine grape vines show similar yields when subject to sustained water stress meaning an assumption in this study s approach that water stress is avoided or minimised may not be true when simulating wine grape irrigation the row spacing for wine grapes 1 is outlined by pitt et al 2015 at 2 75 m intervals and hence the ground cover of volunteer grasses and soils may influence the spectral values observed additionally the high over estimation of the actual irrigation on the wine grapes 1 field can be partly attributed to rainfall redirection plastic sheeting as presented in pitt et al 2015 study this plastic sheeting did not cover the complete field with five different methods being tested including buried plastic sheeting infiltration reduction chemical sprays and bare earth mounds the presence of the plastic acts as a mulch which reduces the soil evaporation component of the evapotranspiration term in the approach while also increasing transpiration potential additionally modelling results from pitt et al 2015 showed that this management technique increased drainage as the same irrigation volume was applied to plastic mulched fields as bare soil fields although the approach over estimated the total irrigation volume the simulations successfully showed the trend of the peaks and troughs indicating there may be a scaling issue in the relationships a 30 reduction factor was applied to the k c accounting for the plastic mulch as this field has been watered by drip irrigation as recommended by allen et al 1998 a simulation with this reduction in k c was performed and is shown in fig 4c this showed an improvement in the simulations over the comparison period with a reduction of approximately 50 mm in the irrigation peak of the 2012 13 summer although the reduction in simulated irrigation depth is improving the accuracy of the developed approach it is still producing substantial over estimations compared to the actual irrigation this suggests that the mulching factor improves the accuracy of the approach although in areas with heavy water stress the method is still unable to simulate irrigation with high levels of accuracy phogat et al 2017 reported that a number of studies found that daily crop et from various wine grape fields from australia the mediterranean and california averaged between 2 and 2 2 mm day the daily average a e t for the wine grapes 1 field during 2000 2017 shows an average of 2 5 mm day between the combinations of k c and e t o while reducing to 1 7 mm day in the mulched simulations the values are approximately what is expected based on these previous et studies over wine grape fields as the approach is still over estimating the irrigation even with a mulching factor this indicates that water stress is likely applied to the vineyard it is common for wine grapes to be subject to minor sustained water deficits to improve fruit and wine quality chaves et al 2007 van leeuwen et al 2009 this may partially explain the over estimation in the wine grapes 1 field as regulated deficit irrigation can cause a controlled depletion of soil moisture chai et al 2015 which is not accounted for in this approach zarcotejada et al 2005 found that indices such as the ndvi perform poorly at identifying physiological stress conditions in vineyards meaning the method is unlikely to be picking up the induced minor water stress goldhamer et al 2005 showed that although water deficits may help almond yield production per unit of area this is due to a reduction in a e t from a reduced canopy size and lower tree density this has been seen in satellite images through a reduced k c value caused by a reduction in red light absorption leading to accurate irrigation simulations the effects of chronic water stress has been observed by ndvis in vineyards and orchards by glenn et al 2011 indicating that significant stress should still be detected by the ndvi despite its limitations when observing minor stress the general trends of the peaks and troughs are occurring in the correct spots indicating that in certain circumstances simulations may be improved by calibrating the k c relationships or by using a relationship that takes these management practices into account calibrating for each crop to address the error concerns will require large amounts of on the ground data which may reduce the practicality of developing and using the approach an option for calibration may be to produce a relationship for tall crops and a relationship for short crops rather than individual crop types which will reduce the data requirements the use of a calibrated relationship will of course mean some knowledge of the crop will be required which is discussed previously in this section the method can be used in its current state in situations where calibration is not possible or practical although users need to be aware of the potential limitations the results of this method only compare against irrigation depths as this is the observed data available the requirements to know the extractions or changes in farm dam storage is an anthropogenic water flux which is also of interest this has not been discussed in this paper due to the lack of validation data although a potential solution is using typical efficiency values van eekelen et al 2015 used a 0 75 efficiency value for irrigation efficiency to find surface water extraction values from irrigation estimation a similar method could be applicable to finding groundwater extraction values using typical efficiency values for certain crop types and irrigation methods will likely work for this application as shown by peña arancibia et al 2016 the knowledge of water extraction and farm storage changes are more closely linked with water compliance that irrigation application with the potential to also effective other hydrological modelling approaches such as streamflow assessments 3 1 3 results from evaluation metrics the monthly irrigation depths mm were estimated for each landsat pixels as described in section 2 3 and the annual values for each discrete farm were calculated from the monthly outputs the ratios of the yearly accumulated simulated irrigation depths to the actual irrigation were calculated and an average between each year simulated is shown in fig 5 for the wine grapes 1 field the mulching factor 30 reduction factor simulations are presented the rmse values of simulations are shown in table 3 spatial variation in irrigation depth is shown in the appendix in fig a2 for the almond farm the methods used provided estimated irrigation volumes that closely matched measured data fig 5a the results with the best fit to measured data estimated irrigation actual irrigation ratio 1 09 rmse for annual data 90 5 mm and rmse for monthly data 24 3 mm was obtained when the asce kamble combination was incorporated the asce method shows its effectiveness at taking into account taller crop wind and stomatal resistance more effectively additionally the deeper tree roots withdrawing from deeper soil layers removes the chance of losses to drainage the irrisat and kamble methods both show a good match with seasonal almond growing fig 3 which is a substantial driver in obtaining accurate irrigation depths the lower irrigation value obtained in january 2015 is evident of high rainfall in contrast february and december 2015 both have low rainfall values and hence a higher irrigation volume is simulated as also shown in fig a2a the wine grapes 1 and 2 fields both show overestimation of the irrigation water use over yearly time scales estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 86 for wine grapes 1 farm and 1 24 for wine grape 2 farm for the wine grape 1 farm the results with the best fit to measured data estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 86 rmse for annual data 112 mm and rmse for monthly data 17 8 mm was obtained when the fao56 cmrset combination was incorporated while for the wine grape 2 farm the results with the best fit to measured data estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 24 and rmse for annual data 93 4 mm was obtained when the fao56 kamble combination was incorporated the differences in e t o k c combinations between the two vineyards is potentially caused by differing management practices phogat et al 2017 states that the k c that they calculated over wine grapes 2 was much lower than the tabulated k c stressed values presented in fao56 for wine grapes allen et al 1998 whereas pitt et al 2015 does not detail the water stress involved in the management of the wine grapes 1 field and therefore is assumed typical sensing chronic water stress in vineyards and orchards has been observed with ndvi glenn et al 2011 while minor stress is difficult to identify zarcotejada et al 2005 the differences seen in these wine grapes fields may be due to the ndvi picking up the significant stress in wine grapes 2 while the wine grapes 1 minor stress is unnoticed causing the wine grapes 2 field to be better simulated the cloud cover in july 2013 i e winter month has caused the wine grapes 1 to be completely observation free fig a2b although the months on either side of this event indicate that zero or close to zero irrigation would be occurring agreeing with the structure of the approach in months where there are large portions of the observation pixels missing it is evident that averaging the irrigation from the available pixels would provide a reasonable estimation the wine grapes 2 field in november 2011 contains a line of empty pixels that has removed a large part of the southern field which tends to show deeper irrigation this shows that cloud cover in the spring summer months can cover parts of the field which may have an effect on the approach s ability to simulate irrigation accurately over the field for the cotton farm the approach shows greater accuracy compared to that for the wine grapes farms with most simulation s standard deviation encompassing the actual irrigation fig 5d this could be partly due to the high water needs of cotton and consequently farmers are more inclined and or forced to implement best practice irrigation which agrees with the assumptions made in the approach the better results were observed with the fao56 method in combination with the cmrset k c estimated actual irrigation ratio 1 07 and rmse for annual data 129 5 mm the better results with the cmrset relationship may be only accurate over a yearly comparison when observing the monthly averaged k c fig 3d the cmrset method shows less correlation with the typical cotton growing season in australia cotton australia 2018 compared to the irrisat or kamble methods the fao56 and irrisat combination also provided decent results with a 12 underestimation on average with a rmse of 130 mm and 145 mm for the cmrset and irrisat methods respectively both of these methods show similar overall accuracies the spatial images of the cotton irrigation fig a2d shows that the december irrigation for 2011 is extremely low this corresponds with the queensland summer wet season and in particularly an extremely high rainfall event that caused flooding in south east queensland during the 2010 11 summer a simulation was performed using k c remote sensing relationships defined specifically for row vineyards campos et al 2010 and cotton hunsaker et al 2005 against the general k c values used throughout this paper an almond specific relationship was not found for testing the results not shown did not show any significant improvements in wine grapes 1 mulched or 2 nor in simulations in the cotton farm in some instances it reduced the accuracy of the approach compared to the kamble or irrisat k c relationships overall the developed approach shows decent results for almond and cotton farms with very low errors ratios of estimated to observed irrigation of 1 09 and 1 07 respectively the 1 09 achieved over the almond farm translated to decent results on a monthly time series fig 4a using this as a guide we can recommend an error of 10 to be considered accurate over yearly scales as the different crops provide different levels of error knowledge of the crop type is required to define tall or short crops to allow an appropriate e t o method to be used for simulation this is only possible due to the knowledge of the commodity being grown this is investigated further in the following section as the comparisons are performed yearly it reduces the number of comparison data points which may reduce reliability of the validation results additionally over the four farms studied here the accuracy decreases as land size increases this may be an indication that as more land is included in simulations land use differences and localised management practices may be altering the simulation output and propagating the errors as land size increases the results indicate that this approach can simulate irrigation although care should be taken when simulating in areas with minor water stress 3 2 goulburn murray water simulations the gmw simulations were run only for sites with over 100 mm of irrigated water depth 1365 sites over the 2016 17 water year as described in the section 2 3 results are presented via 1 1 scatter plots of simulated versus observed irrigation which are presented in fig 6 the rmse and ratios of estimated to observed irrigation as per the discrete farm study analysis are also included attached to each graph the results show the fao56 e t o performing better than the asce e t o for gmw properties this is evident in all three evaluation measures ratio rmse and scatter graph the asce method is continually overestimating the irrigation water use while the cmrset k c was found to be under estimating the irrigation volume as shown in fig 6 the asce methods contain a large number of extreme outliers and overall shows a larger spread of results compared to the fao56 combinations which provide estimates much closer to the 1 1 line the fao cmrset method produces a very tight set of points although as seen in the four farms previously the cmrset method lacks the seasonal variability seen with kamble or irrisat shown in fig 3 the cmrset method has been seen to underestimate irrigation when simulating the discrete farm sites this is also observed in gmw the better results shown with the fao irrisat combination is likely due to the type of crops grown the fao56 e t o uses grass as a reference crop which is likely similar to crops being grown in an area that focuses predominately on dairying industry e g grasses there are other crops included in the study sites including fruit and nut trees and vineyards although this makes up smaller percentages when looking at results from individual farms some land parcels return better results with the asce e t o the fields with these results are predominately identified by the victorian government land use maps vic agriculture 2017 as orchards groves and plantations not presented due to privacy although it is worth noting that even with a relatively good ratio of estimated to actual irrigation 1 03 there can still be extreme outliers within the simulation dataset with extreme underestimations occurring i e 150 200 mm simulated with 500 mm observed these underestimations are somewhat counteracted in the evaluation measures by overestimations also observed the fao56 simulations although underestimating produce a trend that may be improved with an alternative k c relationship or through calibration of the parameters used to derived the k c from ndvi it is likely a single relationship will not be able to account for the vast differences seen in crop phenology between commodities and the localised climate and management techniques farahani et al 2007 suggests generalised k c s can cause discrepancies due to growing conditions that are different to assumed pristine conditions assumed in the fao56 approach being observed the implementation of multiple relationships based on a tall or short classification will likely be better suited as previously discussed the overall results from gmw still provides a reasonable overall estimation although to gain a reliable and accurate insight into water use prior knowledge of crop type is a minimum requirement possible causes of errors arise from the shapefiles being used as input into the approach the land parcels in the shapefiles provided include everything on the property which can include features such as houses dams canals or larger non agricultural trees the spectral characteristics when observing features on properties have the possibility of disrupting the k c relationships water bodies or houses within the shapefile may cause issues with high reflectivity causing higher a e t values to be calculated and hence increasing estimated irrigation trees with deep root zones that are non agricultural e g trees used for wind breaks or ornamental trees near homes may draw water from soil layers below the irrigated effected layers meaning greenness will be seen during non irrigation events these hydrologic effects are not accounted for by the assumptions in this methodology additionally as the gmw pump meter readings are recorded for billing purposes it may include smaller volumes destined for stock and domestic purposes which are not accounted for in this approach finally some customers own more than a single property with multiple pump meter readings this may cause issues when farm managers may only irrigate or crop part of their property whereas the approach is run over the property boundaries this is particularly evident as some fields may be included in simulations although the field could be comprised of predominately bare soil or dryland crops that will alter the vegetation indices these issues are not seen in the discrete farm properties studied as the shapefiles are situated directly over the cropping areas these features that may interfere with the landsat reflectance may take up substantial parts of or entire pixels 25 m x 25 m which could potentially alter the field s aggregated spectral properties despite these uncertainties the approach still provides an indication of the irrigation water use which would likely improve with additional knowledge of the crop type and spatial extent 4 conclusion the results indicate that the approached outlined in this paper can simulate irrigation although care should be taken when simulating in areas with minor water stress and selecting the k c relationship or e t o product to use in simulation the approach developed in this study has shown its potential for monitoring irrigation water use in a simple but effective way the approach can be used without knowing on the ground information such as soil properties initial conditions planting dates and irrigation techniques although users should be aware of current limitations that may affect their simulations limitations may include lack of knowledge about crop type and hence using inappropriate e t o or minor induced water stress not being identified by ndvi the remotely sensed k c s showed seasonal variations that closely followed typical cropping cycles for the almond cotton and wine grape farms the irrigation results showed a good correlation for the almond farm with the asce kamble combination overestimating slightly with a monthly rmse of 24 mm and an annual ratio of estimated to observed being 1 09 the results from the wine grapes 1 field showed that the approach is able to simulate plastic mulching showing improvements although knowledge of the management technique is required the result from the mulched wine grapes 1 and the unchanged wine grapes 2 field showed that the approach was ineffective at modelling vineyard irrigation with the current k c relationships showing irrigation overestimation for the cotton farm the asce simulations slightly overestimating the irrigation while the cmrset fao56 and irrisat fao56 combinations provided a ratio of 1 07 and 0 88 respectively the use of k c relationships derived specifically for row vineyards and cotton farms did not show significant improvements in simulations the goulburn murray water results showed that the fao56 irrisat combination produced the most accurate values overall for the 1365 sites although some individual sites within gmw classified as orchards groves or plantations showed asce methods performing better as is expected based on the discrete farm results showing that between the e t o products a one method fits all approach is unlikely to produce optimal results currently this method could be used to monitor irrigation once the land parcel is identified as irrigated land in situations where crop type is known the simulation accuracy can be greatly improved by selecting an appropriate e t o the k c relationships indicate that the irrisat and kamble methods are performing the best overall with only rare cases occurring that cmrset returns greater accuracy future work will investigate simulating larger regional scale areas which will include areas not covered my monoculture farming conditions in the method s current form it could be used to inform or trigger additional regulatory actions in compliance monitoring or as a metering crosscheck when run with known crop types although the current uncertainties are too large to be a primary compliance monitoring tool setting a goal of 10 error over an annual scale will likely show decent results over monthly periods and be appropriate for a supplementary compliance tool future work will determine if accuracies over vineyards and potential other study areas will increase to an acceptable level declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the south australian research and development institute sardi and goyder institute

10993,the subtropical mediterranean climate of southeastern andalusian coast allows spain to be the largest european producer of subtropical fruit with the avocado as the main representative in this region precipitations are scarce and erratic and limit water availability for irrigation under this climatic uncertainty appropriate water use is required for assuring crop environmental sustainability and increasing water productivity wp of avocado orchards for this purpose it is necessary to evaluate if current water endowments in the region match crop water requirements and to what extent water use can be improved in this study water productivity was assessed in a mature avocado cv hass orchard along six consecutive seasons the physiological and agronomical responses of avocado trees to five water treatments t1 t5 were also evaluated during two consecutive seasons water amounts supplied by irrigation were compared with fao s estimations for the six seasons averaged fao irrigation needs were 7916 395 m3 ha 1 season 1 but averaged water supplied was 6503 328 m3 ha 1 season 1 18 below fao s with yields 11 2 t ha 1 meaning a wp of 1 7 kg m 3 fao s recommendations matched t2 and irrigation over or below t2 affected avocado yield fruit quality i e size and wp water supplies 15 above fao s t3 did not involve better yields but decreased wp conventional irrigation for mature orchards t1 was 20 lower than fao s and entailed yield decreases 16 but similar fruit sizes and wp water supplies 40 and 60 below fao s t4 and t5 respectively caused significant water stress and decreased yields and fruit quality of avocado trees but increased wp these effects were more noticeable during the productive season in which t5 trees showed weakening symptoms and marked fruit drop results are discussed in the context of viability of avocado cropping in the mediterranean region under low water resource scenarios keywords field irrigation overwatering persea americana water productivity water stress 1 introduction spain with more than 11 000 ha in 2017 is the unique european country with a significant production of avocado persea americana mill allowing the distribution of a high quality product into the european market within few hours time andalusian in the south of spain represents the 86 of the spanish production concentrated in the so called subtropical coast of malaga and granada over the 80 of the avocado fruits harvested in andalusian are exported to the european union with france united kingdom and germany as the main consumers mapama 2017 however this region is currently subjected to water scarcity and heat extremes which are expected to increase in a near future as a consequence of the greater aridity predicted by climate change impacts studies for the region rodríguez díaz et al 2007 martínez ferri et al 2013 fao 2016 actually this area has been identified as one of the climate change hotspot by the european environmental agency recent report eea 2017 and in fact water resources for avocado irrigation is already restricted after the severe droughts of the last years therefore for assuring environmental sustainability of avocado orchards in the andalusian region adequate irrigation water management and reductions of the irrigation demand are required in this sense the use of water savings approaches may help to increase water productivity i e crop yield per volume of water supplied by irrigation wp and crop water use efficiency i e crop yield per crop evapotranspiration however there is a lack of knowledge about if current water endowments for avocado cultivation in the region match crop water requirements and to what extent wp can be improved moreover no information pertaining avocado water requirements in the region is available and there are no data about the feasibility of the fao method allen et al 1998 for water needs estimations in the diverse agro environmental conditions of avocado groves from this area water allowance for irrigating avocado orchards in this region is about 5300 m3 ha 1 season 1 but it can reach about 7000 m3 ha 1 season 1 in mature avocado groves of the andalusian coast these figures are far from those of other productive regions 8000 9000 m3 ha 1 season 1 in chile ferreyra and selles 2012 which also have higher productivity i e 10 5 t ha 1 for mexico or 12 t ha 1 for peru versus 8 8 t ha 1 for spain faostat 2016 this is the main reason why growers claim that water allowance is insufficient to fulfil avocado water requirements for achieving good productivity and for keeping the competitiveness of the andalusian subtropical sector however fruit yield is not linearly related to water supply lahav and whilley 2002 and contrasting effects of different water supplies on yield and fruit size have been reported in several studies on avocado hass silber et al 2012 kiggundu et al 2012 gil et al 2011 kalmar and lahav 1977 low water availability at different phenological stages such as flowering and fruit set coinciding with the seasons with higher evaporative demand spring and summer alcaraz et al 2013 could have a negative impact on fruit set and fruit size in avocado and would increase fruit drop resulting into a lower productivity ferreyra and selles 2012 lahav and whiley 2002 also internal fruit quality can be affected negatively by water stress schaffer and whiley 2002 regardless of the crop water requirements an adequate water management on avocado orchards is particularly important under water scarcity scenarios thus it should be taken into account that more than 70 of the avocado root system is located in the upper 0 6 m of the soil lahav and whiley 2002 with main water abstraction occurring from this top layer thus water in deeper soil layers would not be available for roots and overwatering might increase the losses by drainage and the inefficiency of the irrigation system on the contrary if the amount of water supplied is extremely tuned or even below water needs soil salinity may become a problem by increasing the concentration of salts due to lack of washing especially if water electrical conductivity is high to assure that most of the water supplied by irrigation is available for the tree root system irrigation frequency and dose should be modulated on the basis of top soil layers moisture in this sense the use of tensiometers is extended among growers in commercial avocado orchards as a tool for keeping soil moisture in the top 30 cm above different thresholds varying according to the season carr 2013 du plessis 1991 these thresholds have been established on a grower s experience basis and it is not known if they involve some degree of water stress for the trees in this context this work aims contributing to improve water use and water productivity on avocado orchards from the mediterranean coast of se spain and minimizing the impact of water scarcity on crop yield and fruit quality in particular the objectives of this study were to evaluate i the relationship between the current irrigation supplies and yield and fruit quality of andalusian avocado orchards ii to what extent the current irrigation practices involve any degree of water stress for the plants and iii the possibility of using deficit irrigation strategies for sustainable water management in avocado groves under water shortage scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 area of study and experimental design the study was conducted in a 30 year old commercial avocado orchard persea americana mill cv hass grafted onto

electrical conductivity was 392 μs cm 2 and ph 6 63 at this site the upper layer of soil was enriched with humus resulting from mulching with pruning residues over many years hydraulic parameters of the soil were extrapolated from water retention curves data previously reported on similar soil types sandy clay loam tombul et al 2004 moncef and khemaies 2016 according to these soil water holding

gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 wet bulb volume size for the 2 l h 1 and 4 l h 1 emitters after irrigation was inferred from data reported by moncef and khemaies 2016 and the maximum soil water holding capacity for each treatment was roughly estimated assuming that soil water content after irrigation is at field capacity 0 345v v the agronomical performance of the orchard was assessed during 2012 2018 cropping seasons by monitoring irrigation fertilization foliar nutrient content and yield in the last two seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 trees were subjected to five irrigation treatments defined on the basis of conventional irrigation practices of the zone t1 accordingly water is managed by differentiating between two periods along the cropping season 1 from june to september when the highest evaporative demand occurs and rainfall is practically zero in which irrigation was done daily for 4 5 h per day supplied in two irrigation pulses 2 from october to may in which irrigation

1 m apart of the trunk different water treatments were established above t2 and t3 and below t4 and t5 of the irrigation supply of t1 by varying the number of emitters in t2 and t3 or the discharging rate in t4 and t5 table 1 thus two or four additional emitters of 4 l h 1 were pricked in a central pipeline in t2 12 4 and t3 14 4 respectively in t4 and t5 10 emitters of 3 l h 1 10 3 or 2 l h 1 10

trees table 1 in june 2017 after the end of the first cropping season t5 was replaced by t4 since trees displayed visual symptoms of weakening the experiment was a complete randomized block design with four replications per treatment and four trees per replication central trees from each plot were used for assessing soil moisture physiological measurements and yield and fruit quality parameters to standardize the amount of water supplied in every treatment theoretical irrigation water needs in m3 ha 1 season 1 were calculated by fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 as a reference value data

in t4 and t5 treatments lower irrigation supply was paralleled by a reduction of fertilizers to avoid possible soil salinization during the last two cropping seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 besides the agronomical performance on each treatment soil moisture was monitored and physiological measurements leaf water potential leaf mass area spad index and leaf gas exchange were taken 2 2 soil water

the emitter 1 m from the trunk measurements were taken monthly from mid january 2017 to end may 2018 at 0 1 m intervals in 0 1 to 0 7 m depth profiles on clear and non rainy days and before irrigation from these measurements it can be assessed the shape of the bulb wetting front and water distribution in the soil profile in the different treatments 2 3 avocado yield and fruit quality during the first four seasons avocado fruits were gradually harvested from february to april for assessing yield and water productivity under conventional irrigation management in the last two seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 all fruits from the central trees of each plot on each water treatment were harvested in mid april for quantification of total fruit yield per tree in order to evaluate the effects of water treatments on fruit size i e indicative of commercial quality fruits were analyzed and classified into different size classes gap according to their weight dorantes et al 2004 fao codex stan 1995 in 2017 18 the percentage of dry matter was also analyzed in two randomly selected fruits per block with a near infrared analyzer nir spectrastar xl unity scientific brookfield usa previously calibrated for avocado fruits on each fruit four different measurements were done and the average value was taken as fruit dry matter water productivity estimated as fruit yield per water supplied by irrigation kg m 3 was calculated for all cropping seasons and for each treatment in the last two seasons the alternate bearing index abi pearce and dobersek urbanc 1967 a measure of the crop tendency for alternating high on crop and low off crop yields was estimated as follows abi a2 a1 a2 a1 where a2 and a1 are fruit production per treatment for each season being a2 the on crop year abi equal 0 implies no alternate bearing and abi equal 1 implies complete alternate bearing abi index was calculated for the six cropping seasons and for each water treatment in the last two seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 2 4 leaf nutrient content the nutritional status of the trees was assessed in bulk leaf samples from the spring flush sampling was done once per year in autumn october to december but in the 2016 2017 season samples were taken in spring in the last two experimental seasons samples from each treatment were taken separately on each sample five to ten fully expanded leaves from three to five different trees were picked and chemically analyzed after dried at 80 c for 48 h until constant weight macro and microelements concentrations were determined by icp oes spectrometry 2 5 physiological measurements physiological measurements were seasonally taken in four trees per treatment one central tree per block in fully expanded and mature leaves starting three months after the onset of the water treatments water potential was determined at 10 00 13 00 am using a pressure chamber model 3005 soil moisture equipment corporation santa barbara ca usa in two leaves near the trunk located on the east and west faces of each tree at 1 5 2 m height the leaves were cut and immediately placed in the chamber following the recommendations made by hsiao 1990 spad index was also measured at midday

equipped with a led light source 6400 02b coupled to a sensor head irga and with a co2 mixer 6400 01 to modify the incoming air s co2 concentrations operating flow rate was 500 ml min 1 and co2 partial pressure was 400 ppm saturating photosynthetic photon flux density 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 was chosen as default condition leaf temperature was kept at 20 c and relative humidity was adjusted to 50 vapor pressure deficits 1 4 kpa net co2 assimilation rates a stomatal conductance gs inter cellular co2 concentration ci and transpiration rates e were estimated with the equations of von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the analytical software statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 statistica data analysis software system version 7 differences among treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance anova in a randomized block design significant differences were considered at the 5 probability level unless otherwise stated prior to anova normality and homogeneity assumptions were tested by using the kolmogorov smirnov and the cochran s c test respectively when significant differences were found fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare mean values 3 results 3 1 avocado water requirements and irrigation water supply environmental conditions of the study area were typical of a mediterranean type climate potential evapotranspiration et0 was quite similar along the study seasons while the amount and pattern of precipitations varied greatly between years fig 1 crop water requirements estimated as the evapotranspiration etc calculated irrigation needs in and water supplied under conventional irrigation management t1 on each season are presented in table 2 results show that irrigation in t1 for the six cropping seasons was below the calculated in 6503 and 7916 m3 ha 1 season 1 on average respectively these differences were also evidenced by the relative irrigation supply index ris values in t1 73 94 table 2 in the last two seasons water supplied in the irrigation treatments ranged between 3382 and 9470 m3 ha 1 season 1 with ris values between 41 115 table 3 the amount of water supplied per tree on each irrigation event matched quite well with the estimated soil water holding capacity table 1 more than 60 of total irrigation was provided in summer months from june to september when irrigation was done daily fig 2 a c during this period in were similar in both seasons but supplied irrigation was lower in the 2017 2018 than in the 2016 2017 season this discrepancy responds to the government s restriction of water availability for irrigating avocados during this season nevertheless water supply in t2 during 2017 2018 and t3 during 2016 2017 was close to in in both seasons fig 2 a c indicating that water availability was not limited in these treatments in the tensiometer based irrigation period october to may there were differences in in between seasons fig 2 b d but irrigation supplied on each treatment was similar in both seasons since during 2017 18 one point torrential rainfall events occurred in this period fig 1 and accounted to increase rainfall in this season 528 mm compared to 377 mm in 2016 2017 3 2 soil water status fig 3 depicts variation in volumetric soil water content swc at 15 cm depth throughout the two last cropping seasons monitored by 10hs probes on each irrigation treatment although absolute values of swc of each sensor differed they mirrored consistently irrigation and precipitation events and swc depletion on each treatment in general all treatments displayed similar trends with a tendency to sharpen decreases in the low irrigation treatments i e t4 and t5 fig 3 measurements of swc with a fdr probe displayed a bell shape distribution of water in the profile on each treatment fig 4 reaching the higher moisture values at 30 50 cm depth in most profiles the range of swc variation was greater in the top 40 cm suggesting that water is mainly absorbed by the roots from the top layers along the profile soil moisture was always lower in t4 and t5 than in the other treatments fig 4 pointing out differences in their wet bulb size resulting from lower emitter s discharge rates 3 l h 1 and 2 l h 1 respectively and lower water availability for trees along the cropping season these findings are consistent with the estimations of wet bulb volume in the 4 l h 1 and 2 l h 1 emitters table 1 and with the hypothetical semi elliptic shape of the moistened bulb in this type of soils moncef and khemaies 2016 3 3 avocado fruit yield and quality average fruit yield for the whole orchard under conventional irrigation t1 from 2012 to 2018 was 10 34 1 98 t ha 1 table 2 being 16 5 t ha 1 in 2016 2017 i e on crop season and 8 7 t ha 1 in 2017 2018 i e off crop season these yields translated into a water productivity wp that ranged between 0 80 kg m 3 and 2 57 kg m 3 in the off crop and on crop season respectively table 2 being always lower in the off crop season in the last two cropping seasons there were no significant differences in avocado yields among irrigation treatments but a tendency towards higher and lower yields than in t1 was observed in t2 t3 and t4 t5 respectively during the on crop season table 3 this tendency was statistically significant p 0 05 when treatments above and below t1 were analyzed jointly in both seasons t3 displayed the lowest wp and it was significantly increased in the treatment with lower water supply during the on crop season i e t5 table 3 in the off crop season avocado yield kg tree 1 was reduced by 40 in t1 t2 and t4 whereas in t3 yield decreased more than 60 and in t5 it was only 20 lower than in the on crop season table 3 this translated into significant differences in alternative bearing index abi between t3 and t5 0 43 0 12 and 0 13 0 07 respectively differences in yield between on crop and off crop seasons were statistically significant in all treatments except in t5 the comparatively lower yields observed in the off crop season in most treatments cannot be attributable to comparatively lower water supply during 2017 2018 since the over irrigated treatment t3 received as much water as theoretical in but its yield was not higher than in the other irrigation treatments in this season this result is suggesting that productivity during 2017 2018 is not limited by tree water availability and that the observed lower yields match with the alternate bearing behavior off crop season of avocados in this orchard in all treatments wp decreased in the off crop season table 3 fruit size distribution was determined for each treatment in the last two cropping seasons significant differences between treatments were mainly observed in the larger fruit sizes gaps 12 14 and 16 in the on crop season 2016 2017 i e the higher the water supply the higher the amount of larger fruits fig 5 a in the off crop season 2017 2018 trees from t5 switched to t4 in june 2017 displayed significantly higher proportion of fruits with medium size gaps 22 and 24 fig 5b no differences were observed in the percentage of dry matter between treatments which was 32 22 0 49 on average for all treatments 3 4 leaf nutrient content leaf concentrations of most macro and micro nutrients in the conventional irrigated treatment during the six cropping seasons were within the normal reference range for avocado leaves olalla et al 1993 variation between seasons was observed in macro nutrient concentrations which were higher in 2016 17 as a consequence of different sampling date also zinc concentration was increased in the last two seasons due to an additional supply to amend possible deficiencies affecting fruit load lahav and whiley 2002 water treatments in the last two seasons did not significantly affect leaf nutrient content although there was a tendency to lower boron content in t4 and t5 leaves data not shown 3 5 physiological measurements water potential measurements were taken on different dates at midday 11 00 13 00 am during the last two seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 on each water treatment fig 6 values observed in t1 t2 and t3 did not vary along the experimental period and were mostly over 0 30 mpa except in july 18 in which values decreased significantly until 0 74 mpa fig 6 on the contrary values of t4 and t5 treatments fluctuated along sampling dates ranging between 0 24 mpa and 1 48 mpa pointing out to some degree of water stress fig 6 consistently a significant treatment effect was observed on leaf water potential no differences among t1 t2 and t3 were found but t4 and t5 displayed significantly lower values in most sampling dates p 0 05 fig 6 in the second year there were significant differences between t4 and t5 in may 2018 despite trees were switched from t5 to t4 in june 2017 leaf mass area lma measurements were taken in april 2017 july 2017 and july 2018 a variation between sampling dates was found being mean lma values of april 17 61 04 5 33 g m 2 significantly lower than those of july 76 12 3 28 g m 2 and 75 81 2 39 g m 2 for 2017 and 2018 respectively but no differences among irrigation treatments were found no significant variation was found either between dates or treatments in the relative chlorophyll content spad index average values of spad index measured in four different sampling dates were 58 38 0 42 and no symptoms of leaf chlorosis were observed in any of the irrigation treatments net co2 assimilation rates a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rates e intercellular co2 concentration ci intrinsic water use efficiency a gs and instantaneous water use efficiency a e medrano et al 2015 were measured along 2016 2017 cropping season fig 7 in all treatments gas exchange parameters displayed a similar trend and no significant differences were found among treatments throughout sampling dates 4 discussion appropriate irrigation of avocado orchards is an important duty to assure environmental sustainability and crop productivity of the main productive regions worldwide however there is a lack of knowledge of how effectively available water is being used in avocado groves in key productive regions where actual water availability is shrinking such as se spain in this sense to our knowledge this is the first report dealing with this important task on a well established and mature avocado orchard under field conditions the results of the present study show that irrigation over or below theoretical water requirements affect in a different manner crop yield and fruit quality as well as water productivity of avocado orchards from the se spain thus in this area estimated irrigation needs following the fao methodology for the last six cropping seasons were on average 8000 m3 ha 1 season 1 and their annual variation is according to the variability in precipitations fao irrigation needs matched the amount of water supplied in t2 treatment with a fruit yield of 23 2 t ha 1 in the on crop season and 13 5 t ha 1 in the off crop season these figures are comparable but lower than those reported in recent studies on young avocado trees from other mediterranean climate regions 28 t ha 1 and 13 t ha 1 on each type of season holzapfel et al 2017 in that study higher yields were achieved in the on crop season with similar or even lower water supply resulting in great differences in water productivity between both regions 3 kg m 3 in our study and 4 kg m 3 in holzapfel et al 2017 although both studies differ largely in their agronomical features and irrigation system and management i e tree age emitters wetted area tree spacing raised beds rootstock etc it is necessary to point out that differences in water productivity between both regions could be magnified by a different contribution of rainfalls during autumn and winter months i e in our study 40 of the irrigation is supplied in this period to avocado watering nevertheless yield discrepancies between both studies could be also attributable to an insufficient water supply in our fao treatment t2 during the on crop season however this assumption can be discarded since irrigation with a 20 of more water t3 did not result neither into better yields nor water productivity on the contrary over irrigating with 120 of fao s recommendations reduced water productivity in both on and off crop seasons main differences in water supply between both treatments t2 and t3 were not related to higher water availability in the soil profile 0 7 m depth but mostly to a widespread distribution of the additional amount of water supplied on the top soil layers i e t3 had two more emitters than t2 in this sense the lower water productivity on t3 involves that increasing the wetted area below the canopy does not necessarily comprise a higher water exploitation derived from root spreading towards the wetted soil salgado and cautín 2008 in this sense the higher water supply of t3 compared to t2 did not involve greater nutrient washing since trees from both treatments displayed similar wetted bulb sizes and leaf values of macro and micro nutrients thus as it has been reported for avocados in other regions lahav and whiley 2002 the application of higher amounts of water than those supplied in t2 does not increase productivity of avocado orchards in se of spain suggesting that other factors than water availability are responsible of the comparatively low avocado productivity in this region further studies are necessary to elucidate this issue from this statement it could be argued that water supplied in t2 could even exceed tree water requirements suggesting the possibility of achieving similar yields with lower water amounts in this sense the conventional irrigation treatment t1 with an average water supply for the cropping season of 6700 m3 ha 1 80 of fao s irrigation needs entailed a proportional yield reduction 18 compared to t2 but similar fruit size and water productivity however t2 and t1 treatments differed not only in the amount of water but also in its distribution below the canopy although both treatments showed similar wet bulb sizes i e similar emitter s discharge rate and irrigation seems to match maximum soil water holding capacity it remains unclear if water supplied by the 4 l h 1 emitters is entirely used by avocado trees and if irrigation efficiency can be improved by generating a wider wetted area with the same water supply as in t1 i e by increasing emitter s number and decreasing their flow rates this issue needs to be addressed in future studies seeking for a more efficient water use the results obtained in t2 treatment are suggesting the fao s methodology used in our study can be an appropriate method for estimating irrigation needs of avocado groves in se spain however fao s recommendations are far above the current water endowments for avocado cultivation in the region from 5300 to 7500 m3 ha 1 year 1 for young and mature groves respectively which is already subjected to water constrains moreover this area can be seen as a climate change hotspot which will experience a higher frequency of events of extreme temperatures and droughts eea 2017 thus to help growers to face mandatory reductions in water availability for irrigation it becomes necessary to develop and adopt strategies for increasing the efficiency of irrigation management which guarantee the sustainability and profitability of avocado crops in mediterranean regions in this sense we evaluated the effect of a sustained reduction in water supply on yield and fruit quality reductions of 40 t4 and 60 t5 of the estimated irrigations needs for the region t2 during the on crop season decreased yield 30 and the proportion of large fruits gaps 12 14 16 these effects were accompanied by a significant degree of drought stress in those periods of higher evaporative demand as evidenced the values of stem water potential which reached 1 5 mpa scholefield et al 1980 however no effects of lowering water supply on photosynthetic parameters chlorophyll content and leaf mass area were detected suggesting that trees were able to stand the water stress resulting from the lower soil water availability observed in these treatments chartzoulakis et al 2002 these results are in consonance with previous field studies on avocado trees reporting the robustness of stomatal conductance after water withholding neuhaus et al 2009 celedon et al 2012 therefore our results are pointing out that leaf water potential seems to be a good plant based water stress indicator for avocado mature trees as for other tree crops ortuño et al 2006 despite the decrease on yield and fruit size at lower water supplies still a significant and profitable production was achieved in t4 with no apparent damage on the trees but with an improvement in water productivity moreover the reduction in alternate bearing index abi in the low watering treatments can represent a marketing advantage for growers it is interesting to note that in the off crop season the negative effects of lower water supply on productivity were lowered in spite of the proportion of smaller fruits increased in t4 and t5 but their internal fruit quality was still good thus similar yields were obtained in all water treatments and water productivity decreased suggesting that irrigation could be reduced in the off crop season allowing significant water savings these results could become relevant for cropping avocados in water scarcity scenarios but further research on the use of different deficit irrigation strategies and or rootstock selection for coping water stress must be done to keep productivity under low water availability and for saving water in mediterranean semiarid agrosystems moreover reducing water use may also have positive implications in the control of the spreading of soil pathogens which are threatening andalusian avocado groves allowing a certain level of soil desiccation could be beneficial to decrease the load of pathogenic fungi i e rosellinia necatrix and phytophthora cinnamomi in the soil and therefore prevent its dispersion from the infested plantations i e lower soil moisture lower zoospores dispersion less contact between different tree roots therefore adequate water management in avocado orchards could rely on the compromise between avoiding the negative effects of water shortages on fruit production due either to water stress or to soil salinity and diminishing disease widespread 5 conclusions the present study contributes to the better understanding of crop water use in avocado orchards of the mediterranean region water requirements for achieving maximal yields of this socio economically important crop were over 7500 m3 ha 1 year 1 representing 30 over current water allowances pointing out that the environmental sustainability of avocado orchards in this region should rely on the enhancement of water use efficiency in this sense this study provides the first insights on the use of sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategies for saving water and their impact on yield and fruit quality although sdi decreased productivity and fruit size it still could represent an economically feasible option for cropping avocados in water scarcity scenarios however further studies on management of deficit irrigation and on the optimization soil water distribution are necessary for sustainable and profitable avocado

10993,the subtropical mediterranean climate of southeastern andalusian coast allows spain to be the largest european producer of subtropical fruit with the avocado as the main representative in this region precipitations are scarce and erratic and limit water availability for irrigation under this climatic uncertainty appropriate water use is required for assuring crop environmental sustainability and increasing water productivity wp of avocado orchards for this purpose it is necessary to evaluate if current water endowments in the region match crop water requirements and to what extent water use can be improved in this study water productivity was assessed in a mature avocado cv hass orchard along six consecutive seasons the physiological and agronomical responses of avocado trees to five water treatments t1 t5 were also evaluated during two consecutive seasons water amounts supplied by irrigation were compared with fao s estimations for the six seasons averaged fao irrigation needs were 7916 395 m3 ha 1 season 1 but averaged water supplied was 6503 328 m3 ha 1 season 1 18 below fao s with yields 11 2 t ha 1 meaning a wp of 1 7 kg m 3 fao s recommendations matched t2 and irrigation over or below t2 affected avocado yield fruit quality i e size and wp water supplies 15 above fao s t3 did not involve better yields but decreased wp conventional irrigation for mature orchards t1 was 20 lower than fao s and entailed yield decreases 16 but similar fruit sizes and wp water supplies 40 and 60 below fao s t4 and t5 respectively caused significant water stress and decreased yields and fruit quality of avocado trees but increased wp these effects were more noticeable during the productive season in which t5 trees showed weakening symptoms and marked fruit drop results are discussed in the context of viability of avocado cropping in the mediterranean region under low water resource scenarios keywords field irrigation overwatering persea americana water productivity water stress 1 introduction spain with more than 11 000 ha in 2017 is the unique european country with a significant production of avocado persea americana mill allowing the distribution of a high quality product into the european market within few hours time andalusian in the south of spain represents the 86 of the spanish production concentrated in the so called subtropical coast of malaga and granada over the 80 of the avocado fruits harvested in andalusian are exported to the european union with france united kingdom and germany as the main consumers mapama 2017 however this region is currently subjected to water scarcity and heat extremes which are expected to increase in a near future as a consequence of the greater aridity predicted by climate change impacts studies for the region rodríguez díaz et al 2007 martínez ferri et al 2013 fao 2016 actually this area has been identified as one of the climate change hotspot by the european environmental agency recent report eea 2017 and in fact water resources for avocado irrigation is already restricted after the severe droughts of the last years therefore for assuring environmental sustainability of avocado orchards in the andalusian region adequate irrigation water management and reductions of the irrigation demand are required in this sense the use of water savings approaches may help to increase water productivity i e crop yield per volume of water supplied by irrigation wp and crop water use efficiency i e crop yield per crop evapotranspiration however there is a lack of knowledge about if current water endowments for avocado cultivation in the region match crop water requirements and to what extent wp can be improved moreover no information pertaining avocado water requirements in the region is available and there are no data about the feasibility of the fao method allen et al 1998 for water needs estimations in the diverse agro environmental conditions of avocado groves from this area water allowance for irrigating avocado orchards in this region is about 5300 m3 ha 1 season 1 but it can reach about 7000 m3 ha 1 season 1 in mature avocado groves of the andalusian coast these figures are far from those of other productive regions 8000 9000 m3 ha 1 season 1 in chile ferreyra and selles 2012 which also have higher productivity i e 10 5 t ha 1 for mexico or 12 t ha 1 for peru versus 8 8 t ha 1 for spain faostat 2016 this is the main reason why growers claim that water allowance is insufficient to fulfil avocado water requirements for achieving good productivity and for keeping the competitiveness of the andalusian subtropical sector however fruit yield is not linearly related to water supply lahav and whilley 2002 and contrasting effects of different water supplies on yield and fruit size have been reported in several studies on avocado hass silber et al 2012 kiggundu et al 2012 gil et al 2011 kalmar and lahav 1977 low water availability at different phenological stages such as flowering and fruit set coinciding with the seasons with higher evaporative demand spring and summer alcaraz et al 2013 could have a negative impact on fruit set and fruit size in avocado and would increase fruit drop resulting into a lower productivity ferreyra and selles 2012 lahav and whiley 2002 also internal fruit quality can be affected negatively by water stress schaffer and whiley 2002 regardless of the crop water requirements an adequate water management on avocado orchards is particularly important under water scarcity scenarios thus it should be taken into account that more than 70 of the avocado root system is located in the upper 0 6 m of the soil lahav and whiley 2002 with main water abstraction occurring from this top layer thus water in deeper soil layers would not be available for roots and overwatering might increase the losses by drainage and the inefficiency of the irrigation system on the contrary if the amount of water supplied is extremely tuned or even below water needs soil salinity may become a problem by increasing the concentration of salts due to lack of washing especially if water electrical conductivity is high to assure that most of the water supplied by irrigation is available for the tree root system irrigation frequency and dose should be modulated on the basis of top soil layers moisture in this sense the use of tensiometers is extended among growers in commercial avocado orchards as a tool for keeping soil moisture in the top 30 cm above different thresholds varying according to the season carr 2013 du plessis 1991 these thresholds have been established on a grower s experience basis and it is not known if they involve some degree of water stress for the trees in this context this work aims contributing to improve water use and water productivity on avocado orchards from the mediterranean coast of se spain and minimizing the impact of water scarcity on crop yield and fruit quality in particular the objectives of this study were to evaluate i the relationship between the current irrigation supplies and yield and fruit quality of andalusian avocado orchards ii to what extent the current irrigation practices involve any degree of water stress for the plants and iii the possibility of using deficit irrigation strategies for sustainable water management in avocado groves under water shortage scenarios 2 material and methods 2 1 area of study and experimental design the study was conducted in a 30 year old commercial avocado orchard persea americana mill cv hass grafted onto topa topa during six consecutive growing seasons 2012 2018 the orchard 9 5 ha was located in the axarquia málaga south eastern spain 36 47 39 n 4 10 16 w at an elevation of 126 m a s l trees were at 8 m row spacing and 7 m tree spacing 178 trees ha 1 the site has a subtropical mediterranean type climate with maximum and minimum average daily temperatures of 24 2 c and 12 2 c respectively averaged over the past ten years mean annual precipitation for the same period was 496 mm with most rainfall occurring from october to april minor temperature variation in this area is observed but precipitation regimes are quite erratic with rainfalls ranging from 260 0 mm in 2017 to 916 8 mm in 2010 the soil composition is 51 of sand 28 of clay and 21 of silt sandy clay loam containing 8 78 of organic matter 3990 mg kg 1 of n with 71 8 mg kg 1 p 17 5 meq 100g 1 of assimilable ca 6 44 meq 100g 1 of assimilable mg 0 28 meq 100g 1 of assimilable na and 1 25 meq 100g 1 assimilable k soil electrical conductivity was 392 μs cm 2 and ph 6 63 at this site the upper layer of soil was enriched with humus resulting from mulching with pruning residues over many years hydraulic parameters of the soil were extrapolated from water retention curves data previously reported on similar soil types sandy clay loam tombul et al 2004 moncef and khemaies 2016 according to these soil water holding at saturation θ s at field capacity θ fc and at wilting point θ wp are 0 42 0 45 v v 0 30 0 35 v v and 0 15 0 19 v v respectively in this type of soil average hydraulic conductivity ks is 0 30 cm h 1 gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 wet bulb volume size for the 2 l h 1 and 4 l h 1 emitters after irrigation was inferred from data reported by moncef and khemaies 2016 and the maximum soil water holding capacity for each treatment was roughly estimated assuming that soil water content after irrigation is at field capacity 0 345v v the agronomical performance of the orchard was assessed during 2012 2018 cropping seasons by monitoring irrigation fertilization foliar nutrient content and yield in the last two seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 trees were subjected to five irrigation treatments defined on the basis of conventional irrigation practices of the zone t1 accordingly water is managed by differentiating between two periods along the cropping season 1 from june to september when the highest evaporative demand occurs and rainfall is practically zero in which irrigation was done daily for 4 5 h per day supplied in two irrigation pulses 2 from october to may in which irrigation frequency was set according to the readings of tensiometers irrometer watermark installed at 30 cm depth in a middle point of the orchard irrigation was done when a threshold of 20 25 cb was reached θ 0 15 0 2 v v moncef and khemaies 2016 in the conventional irrigation t1 water was delivered through 10 emitters with a flow rate of 4 l h 1 10 4 spaced at 0 75 cm and distributed in two parallel lines 1 m apart of the trunk different water treatments were established above t2 and t3 and below t4 and t5 of the irrigation supply of t1 by varying the number of emitters in t2 and t3 or the discharging rate in t4 and t5 table 1 thus two or four additional emitters of 4 l h 1 were pricked in a central pipeline in t2 12 4 and t3 14 4 respectively in t4 and t5 10 emitters of 3 l h 1 10 3 or 2 l h 1 10 2 were used respectively therefore irrigation treatments involved differences in the amount of water supplied per tree but also in water distribution volume of wetted bulb and wetted area below the trees table 1 in june 2017 after the end of the first cropping season t5 was replaced by t4 since trees displayed visual symptoms of weakening the experiment was a complete randomized block design with four replications per treatment and four trees per replication central trees from each plot were used for assessing soil moisture physiological measurements and yield and fruit quality parameters to standardize the amount of water supplied in every treatment theoretical irrigation water needs in m3 ha 1 season 1 were calculated by fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 as a reference value data

in t4 and t5 treatments lower irrigation supply was paralleled by a reduction of fertilizers to avoid possible soil salinization during the last two cropping seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 besides the agronomical performance on each treatment soil moisture was monitored and physiological measurements leaf water potential leaf mass area spad index and leaf gas exchange were taken 2 2 soil water status volumetric soil water content swc was measured during the last two experimental seasons variation in top soil water content 15 cm depth was continuously registered by 10hs probes decagon devices pullman wa usa installed between two emitters 1 m apart from the trunk in one central tree per treatment a frequency domain reflectometry fdr probe diviner sentek pty ltd was used to characterize the soil moisture profile in depth in three trees per treatment on each tree access tubes were installed following the irrigation line in the middle point between two emitters 0 35 m from the emitter 1 m from the trunk measurements were taken monthly from mid january 2017 to end may 2018 at 0 1 m intervals in 0 1 to 0 7 m depth profiles on clear and non rainy days and before irrigation from these measurements it can be assessed the shape of the bulb wetting front and water distribution in the soil profile in the different treatments 2 3 avocado yield and fruit quality during the first four seasons avocado fruits were gradually harvested from february to april for assessing yield and water productivity under conventional irrigation management in the last two seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 all fruits from the central trees of each plot on each water treatment were harvested in mid april for quantification of total fruit yield per tree in order to evaluate the effects of water treatments on fruit size i e indicative of commercial quality fruits were analyzed and classified into different size classes gap according to their weight dorantes et al 2004 fao codex stan 1995 in 2017 18 the percentage of dry matter was also analyzed in two randomly selected fruits per block with a near infrared analyzer nir spectrastar xl unity scientific brookfield usa previously calibrated for avocado fruits on each fruit four different measurements were done and the average value was taken as fruit dry matter water productivity estimated as fruit yield per water supplied by irrigation kg m 3 was calculated for all cropping seasons and for each treatment in the last two seasons the alternate bearing index abi pearce and dobersek urbanc 1967 a measure of the crop tendency for alternating high on crop and low off crop yields was estimated as follows abi a2 a1 a2 a1 where a2 and a1 are fruit production per treatment for each season being a2 the on crop year abi equal 0 implies no alternate bearing and abi equal 1 implies complete alternate bearing abi index was calculated for the six cropping seasons and for each water treatment in the last two seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 2 4 leaf nutrient content the nutritional status of the trees was assessed in bulk leaf samples from the spring flush sampling was done once per year in autumn october to december but in the 2016 2017 season samples were taken in spring in the last two experimental seasons samples from each treatment were taken separately on each sample five to ten fully expanded leaves from three to five different trees were picked and chemically analyzed after dried at 80 c for 48 h until constant weight macro and microelements concentrations were determined by icp oes spectrometry 2 5 physiological measurements physiological measurements were seasonally taken in four trees per treatment one central tree per block in fully expanded and mature leaves starting three months after the onset of the water treatments water potential was determined at 10 00 13 00 am using a pressure chamber model 3005 soil moisture equipment corporation santa barbara ca usa in two leaves near the trunk located on the east and west faces of each tree at 1 5 2 m height the leaves were cut and immediately placed in the chamber following the recommendations made by hsiao 1990 spad index was also measured at midday by a hand held spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta osaka japan it provides a measure of leaf greenness ranging from 0 to 100 that is an estimation of leaf chlorophyll content markwell et al 1995 jifon

wavelengths red 650 nm peak of chlorophyll absorbance and infrared 940 nm non chlorophyll absorbance on each tree averaged spad values were calculated from three readings per leaf leaf gas exchange was measured in two mature exposed leaves per tree in all sampling dates at midday 11 00 14 00 h measurements were performed with an open portable photosynthesis system model li 6400 li cor usa equipped with a led light source 6400 02b coupled to a sensor head irga and with a co2 mixer 6400 01 to modify the incoming air s co2 concentrations operating flow rate was 500 ml min 1 and co2 partial pressure was 400 ppm saturating photosynthetic photon flux density 1000 μmol m 2 s 1 was chosen as default condition leaf temperature was kept at 20 c and relative humidity was adjusted to 50 vapor pressure deficits 1 4 kpa net co2 assimilation rates a stomatal conductance gs inter cellular co2 concentration ci and transpiration rates e were estimated with the equations of von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the analytical software statistica 7 statsoft inc 2004 statistica data analysis software system version 7 differences among treatments were evaluated by analysis of variance anova in a randomized block design significant differences were considered at the 5 probability level unless otherwise stated prior to anova normality and homogeneity assumptions were tested by using the kolmogorov smirnov and the cochran s c test respectively when significant differences were found fisher s least significant difference lsd test was used to compare mean values 3 results 3 1 avocado water requirements and irrigation water supply environmental conditions of the study area were typical of a mediterranean type climate potential evapotranspiration et0 was quite similar along the study seasons while the amount and pattern of precipitations varied greatly between years fig 1 crop water requirements estimated as the evapotranspiration etc calculated irrigation needs in and water supplied under conventional irrigation management t1 on each season are presented in table 2 results show that irrigation in t1 for the six cropping seasons was below the calculated in 6503 and 7916 m3 ha 1 season 1 on average respectively these differences were also evidenced by the relative irrigation supply index ris values in t1 73 94 table 2 in the last two seasons water supplied in the irrigation treatments ranged between 3382 and 9470 m3 ha 1 season 1 with ris values between 41 115 table 3 the amount of water supplied per tree on each irrigation event matched quite well with the estimated soil water holding capacity table 1 more than 60 of total irrigation was provided in summer months from june to september when irrigation was done daily fig 2 a c during this period in were similar in both seasons but supplied irrigation was lower in the 2017 2018 than in the 2016 2017 season this discrepancy responds to the government s restriction of water availability for irrigating avocados during this season nevertheless water supply in t2 during 2017 2018 and t3 during 2016 2017 was close to in in both seasons fig 2 a c indicating that water availability was not limited in these treatments in the tensiometer based irrigation period october to may there were differences in in between seasons fig 2 b d but irrigation supplied on each treatment was similar in both seasons since during 2017 18 one point torrential rainfall events occurred in this period fig 1 and accounted to increase rainfall in this season 528 mm compared to 377 mm in 2016 2017 3 2 soil water status fig 3 depicts variation in volumetric soil water content swc at 15 cm depth throughout the two last cropping seasons monitored by 10hs probes on each irrigation treatment although absolute values of swc of each sensor differed they mirrored consistently irrigation and precipitation events and swc depletion on each treatment in general all treatments displayed similar trends with a tendency to sharpen decreases in the low irrigation treatments i e t4 and t5 fig 3 measurements of swc with a fdr probe displayed a bell shape distribution of water in the profile on each treatment fig 4 reaching the higher moisture values at 30 50 cm depth in most profiles the range of swc variation was greater in the top 40 cm suggesting that water is mainly absorbed by the roots from the top layers along the profile soil moisture was always lower in t4 and t5 than in the other treatments fig 4 pointing out differences in their wet bulb size resulting from lower emitter s discharge rates 3 l h 1 and 2 l h 1 respectively and lower water availability for trees along the cropping season these findings are consistent with the estimations of wet bulb volume in the 4 l h 1 and 2 l h 1 emitters table 1 and with the hypothetical semi elliptic shape of the moistened bulb in this type of soils moncef and khemaies 2016 3 3 avocado fruit yield and quality average fruit yield for the whole orchard under conventional irrigation t1 from 2012 to 2018 was 10 34 1 98 t ha 1 table 2 being 16 5 t ha 1 in 2016 2017 i e on crop season and 8 7 t ha 1 in 2017 2018 i e off crop season these yields translated into a water productivity wp that ranged between 0 80 kg m 3 and 2 57 kg m 3 in the off crop and on crop season respectively table 2 being always lower in the off crop season in the last two cropping seasons there were no significant differences in avocado yields among irrigation treatments but a tendency towards higher and lower yields than in t1 was observed in t2 t3 and t4 t5 respectively during the on crop season table 3 this tendency was statistically significant p 0 05 when treatments above and below t1 were analyzed jointly in both seasons t3 displayed the lowest wp and it was significantly increased in the treatment with lower water supply during the on crop season i e t5 table 3 in the off crop season avocado yield kg tree 1 was reduced by 40 in t1 t2 and t4 whereas in t3 yield decreased more than 60 and in t5 it was only 20 lower than in the on crop season table 3 this translated into significant differences in alternative bearing index abi between t3 and t5 0 43 0 12 and 0 13 0 07 respectively differences in yield between on crop and off crop seasons were statistically significant in all treatments except in t5 the comparatively lower yields observed in the off crop season in most treatments cannot be attributable to comparatively lower water supply during 2017 2018 since the over irrigated treatment t3 received as much water as theoretical in but its yield was not higher than in the other irrigation treatments in this season this result is suggesting that productivity during 2017 2018 is not limited by tree water availability and that the observed lower yields match with the alternate bearing behavior off crop season of avocados in this orchard in all treatments wp decreased in the off crop season table 3 fruit size distribution was determined for each treatment in the last two cropping seasons significant differences between treatments were mainly observed in the larger fruit sizes gaps 12 14 and 16 in the on crop season 2016 2017 i e the higher the water supply the higher the amount of larger fruits fig 5 a in the off crop season 2017 2018 trees from t5 switched to t4 in june 2017 displayed significantly higher proportion of fruits with medium size gaps 22 and 24 fig 5b no differences were observed in the percentage of dry matter between treatments which was 32 22 0 49 on average for all treatments 3 4 leaf nutrient content leaf concentrations of most macro and micro nutrients in the conventional irrigated treatment during the six cropping seasons were within the normal reference range for avocado leaves olalla et al 1993 variation between seasons was observed in macro nutrient concentrations which were higher in 2016 17 as a consequence of different sampling date also zinc concentration was increased in the last two seasons due to an additional supply to amend possible deficiencies affecting fruit load lahav and whiley 2002 water treatments in the last two seasons did not significantly affect leaf nutrient content although there was a tendency to lower boron content in t4 and t5 leaves data not shown 3 5 physiological measurements water potential measurements were taken on different dates at midday 11 00 13 00 am during the last two seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 on each water treatment fig 6 values observed in t1 t2 and t3 did not vary along the experimental period and were mostly over 0 30 mpa except in july 18 in which values decreased significantly until 0 74 mpa fig 6 on the contrary values of t4 and t5 treatments fluctuated along sampling dates ranging between 0 24 mpa and 1 48 mpa pointing out to some degree of water stress fig 6 consistently a significant treatment effect was observed on leaf water potential no differences among t1 t2 and t3 were found but t4 and t5 displayed significantly lower values in most sampling dates p 0 05 fig 6 in the second year there were significant differences between t4 and t5 in may 2018 despite trees were switched from t5 to t4 in june 2017 leaf mass area lma measurements were taken in april 2017 july 2017 and july 2018 a variation between sampling dates was found being mean lma values of april 17 61 04 5 33 g m 2 significantly lower than those of july 76 12 3 28 g m 2 and 75 81 2 39 g m 2 for 2017 and 2018 respectively but no differences among irrigation treatments were found no significant variation was found either between dates or treatments in the relative chlorophyll content spad index average values of spad index measured in four different sampling dates were 58 38 0 42 and no symptoms of leaf chlorosis were observed in any of the irrigation treatments net co2 assimilation rates a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rates e intercellular co2 concentration ci intrinsic water use efficiency a gs and instantaneous water use efficiency a e medrano et al 2015 were measured along 2016 2017 cropping season fig 7 in all treatments gas exchange parameters displayed a similar trend and no significant differences were found among treatments throughout sampling dates 4 discussion appropriate irrigation of avocado orchards is an important duty to assure environmental sustainability and crop productivity of the main productive regions worldwide however there is a lack of knowledge of how effectively available water is being used in avocado groves in key productive regions where actual water availability is shrinking such as se spain in this sense to our knowledge this is the first report dealing with this important task on a well established and mature avocado orchard under field conditions the results of the present study show that irrigation over or below theoretical water requirements affect in a different manner crop yield and fruit quality as well as water productivity of avocado orchards from the se spain thus in this area estimated irrigation needs following the fao methodology for the last six cropping seasons were on average 8000 m3 ha 1 season 1 and their annual variation is according to the variability in precipitations fao irrigation needs matched the amount of water supplied in t2 treatment with a fruit yield of 23 2 t ha 1 in the on crop season and 13 5 t ha 1 in the off crop season these figures are comparable but lower than those reported in recent studies on young avocado trees from other mediterranean climate regions 28 t ha 1 and 13 t ha 1 on each type of season holzapfel et al 2017 in that study higher yields were achieved in the on crop season with similar or even lower water supply resulting in great differences in water productivity between both regions 3 kg m 3 in our study and 4 kg m 3 in holzapfel et al 2017 although both studies differ largely in their agronomical features and irrigation system and management i e tree age emitters wetted area tree spacing raised beds rootstock etc it is necessary to point out that differences in water productivity between both regions could be magnified by a different contribution of rainfalls during autumn and winter months i e in our study 40 of the irrigation is supplied in this period to avocado watering nevertheless yield discrepancies between both studies could be also attributable to an insufficient water supply in our fao treatment t2 during the on crop season however this assumption can be discarded since irrigation with a 20 of more water t3 did not result neither into better yields nor water productivity on the contrary over irrigating with 120 of fao s recommendations reduced water productivity in both on and off crop seasons main differences in water supply between both treatments t2 and t3 were not related to higher water availability in the soil profile 0 7 m depth but mostly to a widespread distribution of the additional amount of water supplied on the top soil layers i e t3 had two more emitters than t2 in this sense the lower water productivity on t3 involves that increasing the wetted area below the canopy does not necessarily comprise a higher water exploitation derived from root spreading towards the wetted soil salgado and cautín 2008 in this sense the higher water supply of t3 compared to t2 did not involve greater nutrient washing since trees from both treatments displayed similar wetted bulb sizes and leaf values of macro and micro nutrients thus as it has been reported for avocados in other regions lahav and whiley 2002 the application of higher amounts of water than those supplied in t2 does not increase productivity of avocado orchards in se of spain suggesting that other factors than water availability are responsible of the comparatively low avocado productivity in this region further studies are necessary to elucidate this issue from this statement it could be argued that water supplied in t2 could even exceed tree water requirements suggesting the possibility of achieving similar yields with lower water amounts in this sense the conventional irrigation treatment t1 with an average water supply for the cropping season of 6700 m3 ha 1 80 of fao s irrigation needs entailed a proportional yield reduction 18 compared to t2 but similar fruit size and water productivity however t2 and t1 treatments differed not only in the amount of water but also in its distribution below the canopy although both treatments showed similar wet bulb sizes i e similar emitter s discharge rate and irrigation seems to match maximum soil water holding capacity it remains unclear if water supplied by the 4 l h 1 emitters is entirely used by avocado trees and if irrigation efficiency can be improved by generating a wider wetted area with the same water supply as in t1 i e by increasing emitter s number and decreasing their flow rates this issue needs to be addressed in future studies seeking for a more efficient water use the results obtained in t2 treatment are suggesting the fao s methodology used in our study can be an appropriate method for estimating irrigation needs of avocado groves in se spain however fao s recommendations are far above the current water endowments for avocado cultivation in the region from 5300 to 7500 m3 ha 1 year 1 for young and mature groves respectively which is already subjected to water constrains moreover this area can be seen as a climate change hotspot which will experience a higher frequency of events of extreme temperatures and droughts eea 2017 thus to help growers to face mandatory reductions in water availability for irrigation it becomes necessary to develop and adopt strategies for increasing the efficiency of irrigation management which guarantee the sustainability and profitability of avocado crops in mediterranean regions in this sense we evaluated the effect of a sustained reduction in water supply on yield and fruit quality reductions of 40 t4 and 60 t5 of the estimated irrigations needs for the region t2 during the on crop season decreased yield 30 and the proportion of large fruits gaps 12 14 16 these effects were accompanied by a significant degree of drought stress in those periods of higher evaporative demand as evidenced the values of stem water potential which reached 1 5 mpa scholefield et al 1980 however no effects of lowering water supply on photosynthetic parameters chlorophyll content and leaf mass area were detected suggesting that trees were able to stand the water stress resulting from the lower soil water availability observed in these treatments chartzoulakis et al 2002 these results are in consonance with previous field studies on avocado trees reporting the robustness of stomatal conductance after water withholding neuhaus et al 2009 celedon et al 2012 therefore our results are pointing out that leaf water potential seems to be a good plant based water stress indicator for avocado mature trees as for other tree crops ortuño et al 2006 despite the decrease on yield and fruit size at lower water supplies still a significant and profitable production was achieved in t4 with no apparent damage on the trees but with an improvement in water productivity moreover the reduction in alternate bearing index abi in the low watering treatments can represent a marketing advantage for growers it is interesting to note that in the off crop season the negative effects of lower water supply on productivity were lowered in spite of the proportion of smaller fruits increased in t4 and t5 but their internal fruit quality was still good thus similar yields were obtained in all water treatments and water productivity decreased suggesting that irrigation could be reduced in the off crop season allowing significant water savings these results could become relevant for cropping avocados in water scarcity scenarios but further research on the use of different deficit irrigation strategies and or rootstock selection for coping water stress must be done to keep productivity under low water availability and for saving water in mediterranean semiarid agrosystems moreover reducing water use may also have positive implications in the control of the spreading of soil pathogens which are threatening andalusian avocado groves allowing a certain level of soil desiccation could be beneficial to decrease the load of pathogenic fungi i e rosellinia necatrix and phytophthora cinnamomi in the soil and therefore prevent its dispersion from the infested plantations i e lower soil moisture lower zoospores dispersion less contact between different tree roots therefore adequate water management in avocado orchards could rely on the compromise between avoiding the negative effects of water shortages on fruit production due either to water stress or to soil salinity and diminishing disease widespread 5 conclusions the present study contributes to the better understanding of crop water use in avocado orchards of the mediterranean region water requirements for achieving maximal yields of this socio economically important crop were over 7500 m3 ha 1 year 1 representing 30 over current water allowances pointing out that the environmental sustainability of avocado orchards in this region should rely on the enhancement of water use efficiency in this sense this study provides the first insights on the use of sustained deficit irrigation sdi strategies for saving water and their impact on yield and fruit quality although sdi decreased productivity and fruit size it still could represent an economically feasible option for cropping avocados in water scarcity scenarios however further studies on management of deficit irrigation and on the optimization soil water distribution are necessary for sustainable and profitable avocado

10994,water potential is considered to be the gold standard measure for plant water status determination however there are some discrepancies on how and at what time of the day water potential measurements should be performed in order to obtain meaningful information the aim of this work is to evaluate the discrimination ability of water potential measurements in grapevines depending on the time of the day and of the measurement procedure leaf vs stem to do so a meta analysis was performed using 78 000 measurements of water potential data obtained in field irrigation experiments provided by 13 research teams working in this subject in spain for each measurement day and experiment discrimination ratio dr was calculated and used to determine the discrimination ability of each method and then pooled for comparison the measurement procedure with the greatest dr can be hypothesised to be the most suitable under the average working conditions leaf water potential showed lower dr mean values than predawn or stem water potential the climatic conditions and the cultivar may affect to the discrimination ability although the abovementioned trend was always maintained leaf water potential in vineyards should therefore be replaced as a general rule by either stem or predawn water potential readings without a clear pre eminence of the performance of predawn and stem water potential measurements building a common dataset and its subsequent meta analysis has been proved to be an efficient and robust tool to compare plant measurements and should be implemented for other species and or measurement procedures keywords collaborative research methods pressure chamber water status 1 introduction water availability is the most limiting factor for vineyard productivity in

water status through the measurement of water potential ψ considered a reference measure for water status determination scholander et al 1965 however there are some discrepancies on how and at what time of the day these measurements should be performed in order to obtain meaningful information accurate for research and vineyard management concerning the measurement procedure two major approaches exist either measuring leaf ψl or stem ψs water potential the former procedure consists in measuring directly on readily detached leaves only bagged at the moment of detachment whereas the latter requires bagging leaves in opaque and hermetic bags 1 2 h prior to measurement this way in bagged leaves leaf water potential reaches an equilibrium with stem xylem water potential begg and turner 1976 although some researchers have used ψl successfully girona et al 2006 sebastian et al 2015 williams and baeza 2007 there is an increasing trend to use ψs cancela et al 2016 choné et al 2001 gálvez et al 2014 intrigliolo et al 2015 munitz et al 2017 olivo et al 2009 patakas et al 2005 salon et al 2005 santesteban et al 2011a choné et al 2001 in their study combining data from experiments performed in france and california concluded that ψs was a better indicator of water stress in grapevines than ψl mirás avalos et al 2014 observed that ψl and ψs performed similarly well whereas lanari et al 2014 indicated that despite ψl and ψs correlated equally well to soil water content the former was more closely related to leaf net assimilation than the latter nevertheless all those research works were based on relatively limited datasets in terms of climatic conditions and grape varieties there is therefore a lack of global analysis that could lead to more generalizable conclusions concerning the moment of measurement there are two mainstream trends that rely on measuring water potential predawn ψpd or at noon ψn before dawn stomata are majorly closed the plant has rehydrated at the maximum and consequently all the leaves are considered to reach a relative equilibrium among them and with the wetter part of the soil under these conditions it is generally assumed that leaf and stem water potential are the same at noon when the evaporative demand is usually maximum and plants are subjected to the greatest water stress discrepancies between studies evaluating the suitability of each procedure arise for instance williams and trout 2005 choné et al 2001 and mirás avalos et al 2014 outlined that under their study conditions ψpd measurements could not distinguish among irrigation regimes while stem water potential at noon ψs n did on the contrary intrigliolo and castel 2006 and loveys et al 2008 found that ψs n could not discriminate between irrigation treatments shown to be different according to ψpd santesteban et al 2011b reported no differences in the discrimination ability of ψpd and ψs n moreover some authors claim that either early or mid morning ψs m can be a more suitable moment for taking measurements as differences in water status become maximum and discrimination ability is between irrigation treatments is maximum cole and pagay 2015 santesteban et al 2011b last some researchers argue that since all the methods used to assess vineyard water status are highly correlated with one another all of them can assess vine water status equally well williams 2017 2012 or that measuring ψl in leaves of shaded shoots can be a suitable alternative williams 2012 therefore there is no consensus on how leaf or stem and at what time of the day grapevine water potential has to be measured when discussing this issue each researcher gives more or less weight to the pros and cons of each method and time of the day based on his her own experience and beliefs this lack of agreement can be explained as some external factors are affecting to the suitability of each measurement modality and that as suggested by some authors climatic conditions variety and vine water status may condition it in this context the aim of this work is to evaluate through a wide scope meta analysis the discrimination ability of water potential measurements in grapevines depending on the procedure of measurement leaf vs stem and of the time of the day the hypothesis underlying is that the measurement procedure with the greatest discrimination ability between irrigation treatments can be considered the most suitable under the average working conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 data acquisition within the activities of the redvitis network 13 research teams working in grapevine water relations all over spain were contacted in order to have access to complete datasets of grapevine water potential data from irrigation experiments redvitis is a research network coordinated by the public university of navarra upna and funded by the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness mineco aimed at increasing the interaction among spanish research teams in viticulture researchers were asked to provide the original data individual leaf data of water potential measurements and data needed to fulfil several requirements i to have been obtained in field experiments not potted vines ii to include at least two doses of irrigation strategies and iii to provide at least five measurement days per year when irrigation experiments had been performed within a factorial design for instance in combination with cluster thinning or leaf removal only data from the control vines were included in the analysis the data received for each experiment were subjected to an exploratory analysis using box plots to remove potential outliers and rearranged to fit a format that allowed later meta analyses measurements performed before dawn were labelled as pre dawn those between 8 00 and 10 30 solar time as morning and those between 11 00 and 13 00 solar time as noon as a whole leaf measures included in the meta analysis amounted 78 854 and comprised data from 438 experimental replicates considering as such every experiment year variety and methodology of determining water potential for which irrigation doses had been compared the location of the experiment sites is detailed in fig 1 a whereas the total number of leaves measured at each region is indicated in fig 1b table 1 provides a description of the experimental datasets included in this work indicating the varieties the measurement procedures and the number of leaves considered for each site location in any case it is necessary to highlight that the irrigation experiment vineyards included in this meta analysis followed the standards of vineyard irrigation practices in spain and that irrigated vines receive less than 200 mm per year under rainfall regimes that very rarely exceed 300 400 mm during the growing season 2 2 data analysis data from each experiment replicate were used to estimate the discrimination ability of water potential measured following each procedure and time of the day through the calculation of its discrimination ratio dr this index has already been used to compare the discriminating ability of water potential measurements in grapevines cole and pagay 2015 santesteban et al 2011b and follows the principles described in levy et al 1999 and browning et al 2004 briefly for each experiment replicate the mean standard deviation sd of the measurements obtained from different leaves on the same day within an irrigation treatment sdw and the sd of the mean values measured from different treatments throughout the season sdb were calculated then sdb was corrected using sdw to estimate the seasonal underlying sd sdu as follows 1 s d u s d b 2 s d w 2 k where sdu represents an unbiased estimate of the sd and k accounts for the number of leaves measured in each irrigation treatment each day finally dr was calculated as 2 d r s d u s d w then dr values calculated for each experimental replicate were pooled according to the water potential measurement procedure and time of the day and compared i graphically using boxplots and ii by means of pairwise t tests in both cases the comparisons gave a weighted relevance to each experimental replicate depending on its contribution in terms of the number of leaves measured the higher dr the greater discrimination ability the measurement method has as variation between the leaves measured within a treatment are smaller with respect to the variation in the whole experiment it is necessary to underline that the fact that dr is greater for a given than for other is mainly due to the effective difference between the irrigation treatments compared and does not have additional implications in terms of measurement method comparison on the contrary that fact that in this meta analysis data from a wide dataset are considered altogether implies that the evidences that will arise will serve as a tool to compare discrimination ability and broad scale usefulness all calculations were performed using r v 3 1 2 r core team 2014 whereas and ggplot2 wickham 2009 and gridextra auguie 2016 packages were used for figure production and weights package pasek 2018 was used for producing t tests comparing weighted data 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics the range of water potential values observed for each measurement method was different fig 2 as expected the highest less negative values were recorded at pre dawn followed by mid morning and noon measurements when the medians of leaf and stem water potential values were compared the gap between them was ca 0 08 mpa at mid morning and ca 0 10 mpa at noon this average difference is similar to that reported at noon by mirás avalos et al 2014 and intrigliolo and castel 2006 in two regions of spain with very different soil and climate conditions 0 12 mpa but smaller than those reported by williams and araujo 2002 and williams 2012 in the unites states 0 25 mpa or by shackel 2007 in the us 0 4 mpa this fact is probably linked to the low irrigation rates applied usually in our vineyards despite the reduced water availability resulting in reduced transpiration due to stomatal closure and as a consequence to a smaller gradient between stem and leaf water potential in the average conditions in spain quite surprisingly the distribution pattern of the values recorded for each measurement modality varied remarkably in the violin plot fig 2 leaf water potential measurements showed the most disperse distribution pattern particularly at mid morning whereas stem and pre dawn measurements followed a sharper normal curve shape this difference is probably a consequence of the fact that ψl is more dependent on leaf exposure and environmental conditions than ψs patakas et al 2005 and it could be a hint of the dependency of leaf water potential measurement on the microclimatic conditions of the leaf where the measurements are made concerning the evolution of the values recorded along the season fig 3 all the measurement modalities provided the lowest values at the central part of the measuring campaign matching the typical seasonal pattern of water deficit under mediterranean climates flexas et al 2002 intrigliolo and castel 2008 santesteban et al 2011a the period with the lowest water availability for the vines was located between doy 210 and 240 corresponding to august in the northern hemisphere for all the measurement modalities except for ψl m in this case this period was anticipated approximately one month to doy 180 210 this advancement can be due to the fact that the time window selected to determine water potential in the morning is usually established by researchers using noon as reference e g between 2 5 and 3 5 h before noon and significant differences occur in the time lapse between sunrise and the measurement time depending on the calendar date therefore in order to get more easily comparable results it would be advisable to fix the morning measurement period as referred to sunrise time and not to noon the fact this advancement was not observed for ψs m is a consequence of the lesser dependence of ψs on atmospheric conditions but does not imply that the aforementioned consideration for morning measurements should not be taken into account when measuring ψs m 3 2 discrimination ability the discrimination ability of the five water potential measurement procedures compared was evaluated through the calculation of their discrimination ratio dr despite there were remarkable differences between the dr values observed between experiments a clear trend arose ψl had much lower discriminating ability than either ψpd or ψs fig 4 therefore the meta analysis of our complete dataset stresses the limitations of leaf water potential measurement supporting the concerns manifested in earlier research choné et al 2001 cole and pagay 2015 intrigliolo and castel 2006 patakas et al 2005 although part of the poorer performance of ψl could be blamed to be due to leaf transpiration during measurement williams 2017 the authors supplying data bagged the leaves just before severing the petiole to avoid this error source when the dr obtained for ψpd ψs m and ψs n were compared the differences observed were much smaller and not significant according to the p values fig 4 although ψs m provided the highest median dr value followed by ψpd and ψs n it was not possible to identify a significant superiority for any of the three modalities this result agrees with santesteban et al 2011b where ψs m slightly outperformed ψpd and ψs n but without great differences cole and pagay 2015 using a more limited dataset similarly found that ψs m displayed the highest dr values the two elements considered for dr calculation eq 2 played a relevant role in the differences observed between measurement methods fig 5 the low dr ratio of ψl m appears to be mainly caused by a high variability between the measurements within each treatment as its cv values are high whereas in ψs n the mean variability between treatments decreases as its cv is the lowest as the morning advances the differences between treatments tend to be smaller under the majority of the conditions considered fig 5b this trend had already been outlined by several authors cole and pagay 2015 intrigliolo and castel 2006 santesteban et al 2011b who observed that water potential differences between irrigation treatments diminish over the day making more difficult to find differences between irrigation treatments at noon therefore from that point of view the earlier in the day we measure the clearer the difference in water status appears however ψpd measurement showed an increased within treatment variability that makes its dr to be similar to that of ψs m and ψs n this increased variability probably arises from the greater impact associated to the error of the measuring process as resolution of most chambers is 0 02 mpa and a certain degree of subjectivity can exist in the water potential readings goldhamer and fereres 2001 this increased cv for ψpd measures was also observed by centeno et al 2010 though no additional comments were made therein some authors have pointed out that ψpd alleged to be a surrogate measure of water potential in the rhizosphere has some inconveniences as it may come into equilibrium only with the wettest portion of the soil profile ameglio et al 1997 and can be overestimating the amount of water available if the irrigation bulbs are small taking all the above into consideration it can be concluded that for the majority of the conditions in mediterranean like areas it is better to use either ψs or ψpd to discern vineyard water status and that for the latter an increased sample size could yield the best discrimination results however as outlined in the introduction there are some external factors that affect the performance of the measurement methods so no categorical statements on which one performs best should be carelessly made as every method can be most suitable under certain agronomic or operational conditions in the next section two of the factors climate and variety that can affect discrimination ability are examined using this dataset 3 3 factors affecting discrimination ability 3 3 1 influence of climatic conditions environmental conditions are frequently mentioned as a factor conditioning the suitability of water potential measurement modalities cole and pagay 2015 santesteban et al 2011b in order to analyze that factor with this dataset the experimental sites were classified according to their mean temperature t of the growing season april october and labelled as cool t 18 c mild 18 20 c and warm 20 c as the number of sites with growing season t 18 c was low only mild and warm sites were considered for comparison fig 6 the major effect of site climatic conditions on dr was observed in ψs m for which a change for the worse occurred at mid morning in warm sites this poorer performance can be hypothesized to be caused by a greater impact of the rapidly changing conditions during the morning on water status in warmer climates making measurements less reliable therefore caution should be taken if ψs m is measured in the warmer climates and according to our dataset ψpd and ψs n should be preferred in those areas 3 3 2 influence of the cultivar grapevine varieties respond very distinctly to water deficit chaves et al 2010 to an extent that lead researchers to classify them as isohydric and anisohydric medrano et al 2003 santesteban et al 2009 schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 although later research demonstrated that this classification may prove inappropriate and that variety response can range at least from near isohydric to near anisohydric depending on the circumstances chaves et al 2010 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 there is still a consensus on the differential response of grapevine cultivars facing water deficit these differences probably arise out of centuries of human mediated selection of cultivars to make them fit to very diverse growing environments in order to investigate the implication of the cultivar on the dr of water potential measurement methods the 23 varieties included in our dataset were classified as native from relatively cool or warm grape growing regions 10 and 7 varieties respectively the remaining six varieties were classified as neutral since no clear origin could be assigned or that they came from regions with intermediate climatic conditions and were not used for comparison when dr values depending on the origin of the variety are compared fig 7 a significantly differential pattern can be observed for ψs m and ψs n stem water potential measurements in varieties native from warm areas were much more discriminant at noon than at mid morning whereas the opposite behaviour can be observed for those native from cool areas it is not easy to set a sound hypothesis on the reasons behind that behaviour however this could be linked to differences in their diurnal patterns of transpiration or water use bota et al 2001 escalona et al 1999 schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 4 conclusions building a common dataset and its subsequent meta analysis can be a very efficient and robust tool to discern the suitability of the most commonly used procedures for assessing grapevine water status under growing conditions similar to those considered in this work the measures of leaf water potential in vineyards should be replaced as a general rule by either stem or predawn water potential readings since the former has been proved to be much less discriminant than the two latter and only operational limitations that restrict their implementation could justify its use among the three other measurement procedures evaluated a preference towards mid morning stem water potential appeared could be concluded although the discriminating abilities of the three procedures were relatively similar the main limitation of predawn water potential is linked to higher internal variability of the measurements so if sample size is increased it would lead to the most discriminant information climatic conditions and variety seem to affect the discriminating ability of stem water potential measurements at different times of the day mid morning measures being more discriminant in milder climates and for varieties original from cooler areas finally the authors would like to highlight that it would be very advisable to perform meta analyses for other crops and or measurement procedures commonly used in order to increase the certainty on the appropriateness of measured variables or procedures this approach provides a robustness that can hardly obtained by the analysis of individual experiments all the authors have contributed significantly to the manuscript and manifest no conflict of interest acknowledgements

10994,water potential is considered to be the gold standard measure for plant water status determination however there are some discrepancies on how and at what time of the day water potential measurements should be performed in order to obtain meaningful information the aim of this work is to evaluate the discrimination ability of water potential measurements in grapevines depending on the time of the day and of the measurement procedure leaf vs stem to do so a meta analysis was performed using 78 000 measurements of water potential data obtained in field irrigation experiments provided by 13 research teams working in this subject in spain for each measurement day and experiment discrimination ratio dr was calculated and used to determine the discrimination ability of each method and then pooled for comparison the measurement procedure with the greatest dr can be hypothesised to be the most suitable under the average working conditions leaf water potential showed lower dr mean values than predawn or stem water potential the climatic conditions and the cultivar may affect to the discrimination ability although the abovementioned trend was always maintained leaf water potential in vineyards should therefore be replaced as a general rule by either stem or predawn water potential readings without a clear pre eminence of the performance of predawn and stem water potential measurements building a common dataset and its subsequent meta analysis has been proved to be an efficient and robust tool to compare plant measurements and should be implemented for other species and or measurement procedures keywords collaborative research methods pressure chamber water status 1 introduction water availability is the most limiting factor for vineyard productivity in arid and semi arid areas since water deficit results in i significant reductions in yield santesteban and royo 2006 van leeuwen et al 2018 ii lower sugar accumulation matthews and anderson 1988 salon et al 2005 santesteban and royo 2006 and if severe stress occurs iii impairs wine quality van leeuwen et al 2018 even more climate change has made that in some grape growing areas where water scarcity was traditionally not considered to be a relevant issue currently need to analyse its impact on grape ripening and on the quality of the resulting wine coipel et al 2006 van leeuwen et al 2009 recent research suggests that grape production will increasingly depend on irrigation as water stress conditions may intensify fraga et al 2018 2016 due to an increase in evapotranspiration fraga et al 2013 more uneven rainfall patterns jones et al 2005 ramos et al 2008 and to a significant drying trend expected over southern europe santos et al 2016 therefore anticipating irrigation requirements in the

differences between treatments tend to be smaller under the majority of the conditions considered fig 5b this trend had already been outlined by several authors cole and pagay 2015 intrigliolo and castel 2006 santesteban et al 2011b who observed that water potential differences between irrigation treatments diminish over the day making more difficult to find differences between irrigation treatments at noon therefore from that point of view the earlier in the day we measure the clearer the difference in water status appears however ψpd measurement showed an increased within treatment variability that makes its dr to be similar to that of ψs m and ψs n this increased variability probably arises from the greater impact associated to the error of the measuring process as resolution of most chambers is 0 02 mpa and a certain degree of subjectivity can exist in the water potential readings goldhamer and fereres 2001 this increased cv for ψpd measures was also observed by centeno et al 2010 though no additional comments were made therein some authors have pointed out that ψpd alleged to be a surrogate measure of water potential in the rhizosphere has some inconveniences as it may come into equilibrium only with the wettest portion of the soil profile ameglio et al 1997 and can be overestimating the amount of water available if the irrigation bulbs are small taking all the above into consideration it can be concluded that for the majority of the conditions in mediterranean like areas it is better to use either ψs or ψpd to discern vineyard water status and that for the latter an increased sample size could yield the best discrimination results however as outlined in the introduction there are some external factors that affect the performance of the measurement methods so no categorical statements on which one performs best should be carelessly made as every method can be most suitable under certain agronomic or operational conditions in the next section two of the factors climate and variety that can affect discrimination ability are examined using this dataset 3 3 factors affecting discrimination ability 3 3 1 influence of climatic conditions environmental conditions are frequently mentioned as a factor conditioning the suitability of water potential measurement modalities cole and pagay 2015 santesteban et al 2011b in order to analyze that factor with this dataset the experimental sites were classified according to their mean temperature t of the growing season april october and labelled as cool t 18 c mild 18 20 c and warm 20 c as the number of sites with growing season t 18 c was low only mild and warm sites were considered for comparison fig 6 the major effect of site climatic conditions on dr was observed in ψs m for which a change for the worse occurred at mid morning in warm sites this poorer performance can be hypothesized to be caused by a greater impact of the rapidly changing conditions during the morning on water status in warmer climates making measurements less reliable therefore caution should be taken if ψs m is measured in the warmer climates and according to our dataset ψpd and ψs n should be preferred in those areas 3 3 2 influence of the cultivar grapevine varieties respond very distinctly to water deficit chaves et al 2010 to an extent that lead researchers to classify them as isohydric and anisohydric medrano et al 2003 santesteban et al 2009 schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 although later research demonstrated that this classification may prove inappropriate and that variety response can range at least from near isohydric to near anisohydric depending on the circumstances chaves et al 2010 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 there is still a consensus on the differential response of grapevine cultivars facing water deficit these differences probably arise out of centuries of human mediated selection of cultivars to make them fit to very diverse growing environments in order to investigate the implication of the cultivar on the dr of water potential measurement methods the 23 varieties included in our dataset were classified as native from relatively cool or warm grape growing regions 10 and 7 varieties respectively the remaining six varieties were classified as neutral since no clear origin could be assigned or that they came from regions with intermediate climatic conditions and were not used for comparison when dr values depending on the origin of the variety are compared fig 7 a significantly differential pattern can be observed for ψs m and ψs n stem water potential measurements in varieties native from warm areas were much more discriminant at noon than at mid morning whereas the opposite behaviour can be observed for those native from cool areas it is not easy to set a sound hypothesis on the reasons behind that behaviour however this could be linked to differences in their diurnal patterns of transpiration or water use bota et al 2001 escalona et al 1999 schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 4 conclusions building a common dataset and its subsequent meta analysis can be a very efficient and robust tool to discern the suitability of the most commonly used procedures for assessing grapevine water status under growing conditions similar to those considered in this work the measures of leaf water potential in vineyards should be replaced as a general rule by either stem or predawn water potential readings since the former has been proved to be much less discriminant than the two latter and only operational limitations that restrict their implementation could justify its use among the three other measurement procedures evaluated a preference towards mid morning stem water potential appeared could be concluded although the discriminating abilities of the three procedures were relatively similar the main limitation of predawn water potential is linked to higher internal variability of the measurements so if sample size is increased it would lead to the most discriminant information climatic conditions and variety seem to affect the discriminating ability of stem water potential measurements at different times of the day mid morning measures being more discriminant in milder climates and for varieties original from cooler areas finally the authors would like to highlight that it would be very advisable to perform meta analyses for other crops and or measurement procedures commonly used in order to increase the certainty on the appropriateness of measured variables or procedures this approach provides a robustness that can hardly obtained by the analysis of individual experiments all the authors have contributed significantly to the manuscript and manifest no conflict of interest acknowledgements
