focus for our model of panama in the present study we first built and tested the performance of an uncalibrated swat model of panama using the default precipitation interpolation method of swat and

gauge data in two steps for occurrence and then quantity within each region and for each day and finally iii allowing for seasonal variation in the strength of this autocorrelation by fitting the distance decay parameters for each month as well as each region we demonstrate that it is crucial to capture these regional and spatio temporal autocorrelation patterns in precipitation for both default and modified swat models we examine predictive power for water availability mean monthly flow as well as variability standard deviation and maxima of flow across space and time we also examine the performance of the models within each watershed and identify characteristics of watersheds that explain the variation in this performance 2 methods 2 1 study area panama the national water security plan of panama predicts a rise in water insecurity as human consumption reaches 50 of freshwater availability in the country by 2050 comité de alto nivel de seguridad hídrica 2016 freshwater is also a key resource for the panama canal system which requires 52 million gallons per ship transit the canal authority came close to having to impose draft restrictions due to lack of water during the dry season in 2015 an el niño year anon 2015 the canal is uniquely important not only to panama s economy with 2 6 billion in revenue oecd 2017 but also as a key node in the global shipping trade additionally about 45 of the country s electrical capacity is accounted for by hydropower asep 2021 making variability in flow patterns critical to predict along with droughts like the one in 2015 floods and associated landslides are also problems faced by the country e g wohl and ogden 2013 these changes are projected to have further downstream effects ranging from agricultural yield changes to the persistence of chagas disease fábrega et al 2013 beyond human impacts panama is also at the center of one of the world s most biodiverse regions myers et al 2000 and the rich tropical forests and aquatic ecosystems that support this diversity are heavily reliant on the health of its waterways while temperatures across panama are quite even and vary primarily based on elevation there is considerable variation in precipitation patterns within the country both between regions and across time due to a combination of topographic complexity and seasonal drivers of precipitation palka 2005 the country is long and narrow with the central spine of mountains forming a higher topographic barrier in the western half of the country the pacific side of this central spine of mountains experiences a marked dry season from roughly december to april while the caribbean side has rainfall more evenly throughout the year and in higher quantity in general fábrega et al 2013 the primary seasonal driver of precipitation is the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and interannual variation is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso cycles these characteristics led to our choices to incorporate seasonality and regionality as two facets of the precipitation interpolation method that is fitting the parameters for the method to each region and to each season furthermore the country s reliance on hydropower and susceptibility to floods are among the factors that led to our focus on variability and extreme events in streamflow in addition to mean values the 6 climatic regions in the model henceforth just referred to as regions see fig 2 were delineated with reference to the climatic regions outlined in panama s national water plan document comité de alto nivel de seguridad hídrica 2016 p 22 as well as the latest köppen climate classification maps beck et al 2018 both sources were consistent in separating the caribbean pacific faces of the tabasara mountains the azuero peninsula and the central canal region regions 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the part of the country to the east of the canal was grouped into a single region in the water plan document but the köppen map shows a gradation with more tropical savannah köppen classification aw in the western half surrounding lake bayano model region 5 and more tropical rainforest köppen af in the darien region 6 2 2 swat model setup in this study we use swat to build a countrywide hydrological model of panama swat is a process based model that incorporates information about meteorology physical geography and human land use to simulate the entire hydrological cycle of the study area spatial variation is made explicit in swat by splitting each watershed into subbasins of non branching stream segments and their drainage areas and further splitting each subbasin into a set of hydrological response units hrus which represent a particular combination of slope land use land management and soil type swat can thus provide sophisticated and holistic hydrological projections for given patterns of changes in its inputs the swat model requires a set of spatially explicit inputs for the study area a digital elevation model dem a soil map a land use map and a set of weather station locations the weather stations further must be provided with precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind data in the form of either i records for each day of the simulation or ii parameters for a rainfall distribution that the model samples from on each simulated day the data sources used for each of the above in the current study are summarized in table 1 data on river discharge from the etesa empresa de transmisión eléctrica s a https www etesa com pa hydrological monitoring network from the period 2005 2015 was used for model validation while etesa precipitation data from the periods 1990 2000 and 2005 2015 were used for fitting the precipitation submodel parameters and running the validation simulation respectively all the above rain gauges and hydrological monitoring stations are mapped in fig 1 the three main lakes reservoirs of note in the study area are lake gatún lake alajuela and lake bayano all three were modeled as reservoirs in swat using the res input file and estimates of volume area from lewis et al 1971 and etesa watershed delineation was carried out in arcswat a threshold of 5000 cells was chosen as the minimum inflow into an outlet for which a subbasin would be defined which amounts to a drainage area of about 4 75 km2 given the dem cell size 1 arc second at the equator 30 8 m areas smaller than this which drain directly into the sea or either neighboring country were not part of the model resulting in a model delineation covering roughly 65 000 km2 or 86 of the total land area of panama swat further assigns each non branching segment of stream its own subbasin unit and calculates hrus within each subbasin based on existing combinations of soils land use and slope swat generates daily mean discharge output m3s 1 at the outlet of each subbasin so additional outlets were manually defined at the location of each hydrological measurement station 52 in total to provide direct comparison points this resulted in a delineation of 980 subbasins in total 2 3 precipitation interpolation daily precipitation data from etesa was downloaded for 249 rain gauge locations across panama of which 120 were active during the simulation period of 2005 2015 though many had substantial temporal gaps in their records swat requires daily precipitation values for each subbasin 980 in total in the current model and thus some method of interpolation is required to fill both spatial and temporal gaps in the data coverage for spatial gaps the method used by default is a nearest neighbor or thiessen polygon interpolation from each subbasin centroid to the nearest rain gauge for temporal gaps the default method is sampling from an empirically determined rainfall distribution at rain gauge locations using a skew normal distribution see neitsch et al 2011 means standard deviations skew and wet dry transition probability values were calculated at all gauge locations using the observations spanning the period of 1990 2000 henceforth this method will be referred to as the default model this spatial interpolation method can result in locations sampling from gauges that are in different climatic zones e g across the peaks of a mountain range while the temporal interpolation method results in breaking of spatial autocorrelation patterns due to independent sampling at spatially related locations which tends to drive overall flow down towards the mean reducing variance and the magnitude of extremes in streamflow instead we expect precipitation patterns to be spatially autocorrelated but that the strength of autocorrelation may change seasonally with climatic forcing we also expect regional gauge data to be more informative than just the nearest neighbor at least for some regions and months in our modified method interpolation of precipitation gauge data at each subbasin centroid was carried out for each day and separately for each of six climatic regions that the country was split into fig 2 we first tested a single step inverse distance weighting model with a single distance decay parameter α see eq 1 fit by region and month this model was named rdw1 for single step regional distance weighting then we tested a two step method rdw2 at each location which incorporated an explicit prediction of rainfall occurrence 1 first we predicted the probability of a wet or dry day occurrence using a logistic regression on the inverse distance weighted mean of observations in the region using a threshold observation 0 5 mm dry gauges were given a value of 0 and wet gauges a value of 1 2 then given the probability of a wet day we performed a binomial trial and if a wet day was generated we interpolated the quantity of rain again using an inverse distance weighted mean of all observed quantities of precipitation within the region for that day dry days were assigned a quantity of 0 mm the two steps involved a single parameter each α1 and α2 which controlled the decay of the relative weighting with distance eq 1 represents the interpolation process we used where pikt was the precipitation value of interest i e either a predictor of wet dry through a logistic regression or the quantity of rain in mm for month t and region k pjkt denoted all measured precipitation values dijkt was the distance between points i and j and αkt was a shape parameter 1 p i k t p j k t e α k t d i j k t e α k t d i j k t these αkt values were fit separately to each monthly time interval and each of 6 regions in panama to capture expected differences in spatial and seasonal autocorrelation patterns in the rdw2 model the predicted total quantity of rain across a region on a given day q1 was reallocated to those locations that were predicted to be wet on that day with a total quantity q2 where q2 q1 i e the predicted quantity in each of these locations was scaled by the ratio q1 q2 to prevent underestimation caused by the independent prediction of occurrence using binomial trials each fitted parameter α in eq 1 represented the strength of the distance weighting with high α severely penalizing information from gauges further away from the target point and prioritizing immediate neighbors the fitting process minimizing the sum of squared deviations was run using the gauge data from 1990 to 2000 and the fitted algorithm was then used to interpolate daily values at the 980 subbasin centroids using gauge data from 2005 to 2015 for the validation run 2 4 model evaluation as the objective was to gain insight into patterns of water distribution the hydrological model results were compared against river discharge data from etesa which was not used to calibrate or parameterize any part of the models r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias of mean model predictions against mean observed daily discharge values were calculated for each calendar month and station across the entire simulation period and these were used as metrics of the ability to predict average flow we also used nse r2 and pbias to examine the ability of the hydrological model to estimate variation in runoff at a given location using as metrics i standard deviation of discharge and ii the magnitudes of the 3 highest daily discharge events across the simulation period in each location month combination we chose the latter to represent of the extreme highs of the discharge distribution for that combination and as a coarse indicator of flood risk finally we used nse and r2 to examine the model s ability to simulate the observed monthly time series of mean discharge within each basin from 2005 to 2015 instead of spatial variation across locations this procedure tested the ability of the model to capture temporal variation within each watershed using the lowermost hydrological station in each of 35 watersheds we posited several variables across that could explain variation in model predictiveness namely i elevation of the observation as we did not account for orographic effects explicitly ii existence of a precipitation gauge within the same subbasin as the observation and iii number of precipitation gauges in the region both as measures of the relevance and quantity of precipitation information v number of subbasins in the watershed as larger watersheds could have more complex behaviour vi number of subbasins downstream from the observation as interior reaches could behave differently regardless of elevation and vi simulated standard deviation of mean monthly discharge at the location as the ability to predict flow might depend on variability we used a stepwise forward selection algorithm in r to arrive at the linear combination of these variables and their pairwise combinations with the lowest aic value 3 results 3 1 precipitation interpolation in the regional distance weighted rdw1 and rdw2 models there was a strong seasonal signal in the autocorrelation patterns as represented by the fitted distance decay parameters α fig 3 maximum values of the α parameters correspond to the greatest weighting of the closest stations and correspondingly the fastest decay in weighting with distance these maxima consistently occurred for both precipitation occurrence and quantity in april and october and these months represent the two transitions between the wet generally may to november and dry seasons over the remainder of each season parameter values decline and then rise gradually for both the single parameter in rdw1 and the occurrence parameter in rdw2 or remain generally low for the quantity parameter in rdw2 until the next seasonal transition variation across region was comparatively higher for both rdw2 parameters than for the single rdw1 parameter 3 2 model evaluation the standard swat model using default precipitation interpolation performed reasonably well for mean discharge across locations with an nse of 0 69 improving the precipitation interpolation approach yielded even better predictions nse 0 88 using the rdw2 model and nse 0 89 using the rdw1 model while the default model worked well for mean discharge nse 0 69 it was less able to capture variability with nse 0 26 for standard deviation of locations month combinations in contrast for standard deviation the rdw2 model achieved nse 0 59 and rdw1 nse 0 53 which compared very favorably with the default model for predicting maxima of daily discharge at each location month combination we found again that the default model performed poorly with nse 0 22 while the rdw2 model achieved a higher nse of 0 53 and rdw1 again performed similarly to rdw2 with nse 0 51 notably however pbias values were significantly larger in magnitude for the rdw1 model than for rdw2 across all analyses these results are summarized in table 2 and fig 4 we also examined the ability to predict temporal patterns within each watershed for the default and rdw models across the ten year period fig 5 we found that the default model performed generally poorly being a worse predictor in 24 out of 35 sites than simply using the observed mean i e nse 0 the rdw2 model performed significantly better while 8 sites still performed poorly nse 0 15 43 sites had satisfactory performance at nse 0 5 and the median nse was 0 4 across locations the rdw1 model performed intermediately with no sites achieving nse 0 5 and a median nse of 0 21 rdw2 was chosen as the overall best model due to this as well as the lower magnitude of bias mentioned above while there were areas of failure the performance of rdw2 was largely predictable 71 of the variation in nse across locations was explained by six variables and two interaction terms the variables were i elevation ii total number of rain gauges in region iii number of downstream subbasins iv size of watershed i e number of subbasins v simulated standard deviation of discharge and vi presence of of which ii iv and vi were significant and the significant interaction terms were between watershed size and number of downstream subbasins and between watershed size and simulated standard deviation table 3 4 discussion panama faces a variety of issues related to potential changes in the water cycle ranging from shortages of drinking water and hydropower to increased impact of floods and droughts while sophisticated hydrological modeling tools such as swat exist the data available with which to build and calibrate such models is generally more limited in panama and other countries of the global south thus while srinivasan and zhang 2010 demonstrated that an uncalibrated swat model predicted streamflow similarly to calibrated ones in the upper mississippi basin of the usa testing the performance of such a model in panama is necessary given differences in environmental conditions and limitations of the available input data indeed we found that while the default swat model performed well for predicting monthly mean flow across watersheds it fared poorly for predicting monthly standard deviations and maxima substantial improvements were obtained across all three metrics by using a 2 stage regional distance weighted interpolation algorithm for precipitation i e our rdw2 model these findings highlight the importance of validating model performance in different regions but also the potential promise of uncalibrated models even in locations where hydrological data are limited standard deviations and maxima which the default model predict poorly represent information about streamflow distributions that are crucially important in the predictive modeling of flood risk e g van der wiel et al 2019 furthermore variability in water availability is a critical indicator of potential water scarcity and has significant impacts on human water use despite often being overlooked in favour of annual means damkjaer and taylor 2017 modeling studies also show that hydropower output is sensitive to variability in hydroclimatic inputs arriagada et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2020 while future hydroclimate projections for panama have been made for monthly mean discharge fábrega et al 2013 the present study lays the groundwork for improved projections based on a more sophisticated hydrological model with higher spatial resolution and finer prediction of variability and extremes the relative predictive failure of the default model was due to the precipitation model which by default matches each subbasin to its nearest precipitation gauge and fills temporal gaps in the daily records of each gauge by sampling from an empirical distribution that models the behavior of that gauge neitsch et al 2011 this sampling is done independently of any other gauge value on that day as these temporal gaps occurred frequently the mean precipitation gauge was only active on 60 of days from 2005 to 2015 the result of this independent sampling would tend to average out variability across subbasins and contribute to the observed pattern of underestimated variances and extremes of streamflow in the default model such spatial and especially temporal gaps in rainfall data have been shown to have significant negative impacts on swat performance tan and yang 2020 in contrast due to the use of distance weighted interpolation fitted on seasonal and regional spatial patterns of precipitation estimated values across gauges within a region on a given day more faithfully replicated real precipitation patterns in the rdw1 and rdw2 models while both distance weighted models were clear improvements on the default model rdw2 outperformed rdw1 in terms of predicting standard deviations and maxima of discharge in terms of both nse and percentage bias and also performed much better than rdw1 in predicting time series of discharge at each location fig 5 most often distance weighted interpolation for precipitation has been modeled as a single step calculating quantity of rain e g chen and liu 2012 cheng et al 2017 tuo et al 2016 xue et al 2018 as in the rdw1 model yet two step interpolation treating i the occurrence of precipitation and ii the quantity separately has been found to regenerate more realistic patterns of spatial variability for daily precipitation hwang et al 2012 as these two factors need not be linearly related and cannot be captured with a single distance function rdw2 is thus overall the best model of the three tested only one station with hydrological data used for validation was downstream of reservoir outflow specifically of lake bayano etesa station id 148 08 01 and the final model achieved a within basin nse of 0 21 at that station an improvement on the default model which had nse 0 01 more precise specification and treatment of these large bodies of water is one of the key next steps to be addressed in future as they are locally important for among many other reasons their direct connection to the canal better accounting for spatial relatedness of precipitation gauges was also crucial for estimating fluctuations in streamflow across time within each watershed as opposed to variation across watersheds discussed above the uncalibrated default swat model generally performed no better than simply using the mean flow in most watersheds median nse 0 again highlighting the importance of testing in different regions and for different metrics with our rdw2 model the median watershed nse was 0 4 and 43 of locations achieved nse 0 5 defined to be satisfactory performance by moriasi et al 2007 furthermore we could largely identify where failures in the rdw2 model occurred explaining 71 of the variation in basin nses and showed that the total number of gauges in the region and the presence of a gauge in the subbasin itself were both predictors of higher nse at a given location additionally our findings suggest that spatial patterning of rainfall varied over time with peaks in parameter values of the distance weighted interpolation kernel in the months of april and october high parameter values indicate that nearby gauges are much more predictive of precipitation at a point than ones further away low parameter values on the other hand indicate a broader averaging and more regional forcing the two months of highest parameter values april and october coincide with the periods of change in patterns of observed variation in rainfall fábrega et al 2013 as well as periods of strongest increase and decrease in average rainfall respectively kusunoki et al 2019 further elucidation of the processes that lead to the variation in spatial autocorrelation captured by the current model may aid in the development of a dynamical procedure that can account for nonstationarity while seasonal and regional patterns of spatial autocorrelation in precipitation and their effects on extreme events are being studied in some arid and semi arid areas in regions such as china xu et al 2021 and iran darand et al 2017 rousta et al 2017 they remain understudied in the tropics where they may also be of importance 5 conclusions the main finding is that the default precipitation model of swat was a key limitation in applying it to panama and that modifying it to account for regional and seasonal patterns of spatial autocorrelation of precipitation dramatically improved predictions of flow across a range of metrics while the treatment of precipitation input remains a key element further improvement of the model could incorporate integration with a regionalization approach to improve the accuracy of physical swat parameters or focusing on parameterizing areas of interest using direct field measurements we focused on the streamflow output one of the most fundamental hydrological variables but swat also has the capacity for integrative modeling of other aspects of the hydrological system such as sediment load and nutrient pollution in runoff and these represent natural avenues for future work finally more precise treatment of reservoirs and the canal system in general is an important next step our model demonstrates that careful treatment of spatial autocorrelation in precipitation input can yield substantial benefits for prediction even in regions where data limitations make hydrological calibration

and aquatic ecosystems that support this diversity are heavily reliant on the health of its waterways while temperatures across panama are quite even and vary primarily based on elevation there is considerable variation in precipitation patterns within the country both between regions and across time due to a combination of topographic complexity and seasonal drivers of precipitation palka 2005 the country is long and narrow with the central spine of mountains forming a higher topographic barrier in the western half of the country the pacific side of this central spine of mountains experiences a marked dry season from roughly december to april while the caribbean side has rainfall more evenly throughout the year and in higher quantity in general fábrega et al 2013 the primary seasonal driver of precipitation is the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and interannual variation is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso cycles these characteristics led to our choices to incorporate seasonality and regionality as two facets of the precipitation interpolation method that is fitting the parameters for the method to each region and to each season furthermore the country s reliance on hydropower and susceptibility to floods are among the factors that led to our focus on variability and extreme events in streamflow in addition to mean values the 6 climatic regions in the model henceforth just referred to as regions see fig 2 were delineated with reference to the climatic regions outlined in panama s national water plan document comité de alto nivel de seguridad hídrica 2016 p 22 as well as the latest köppen climate classification maps beck et al 2018 both sources were consistent in separating the caribbean pacific faces of the tabasara mountains the azuero peninsula and the central canal region regions 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the part of the country to the east of the canal was grouped into a single region in the water plan document but the köppen map shows a gradation with more tropical savannah köppen classification aw in the western half surrounding lake bayano model region 5 and more tropical rainforest köppen af in the darien region 6 2 2 swat model setup in this study we use swat to build a countrywide hydrological model of panama swat is a process based model that incorporates information about meteorology physical geography and human land use to simulate the entire hydrological cycle of the study area spatial variation is made explicit in swat by splitting each watershed into subbasins of non branching stream segments and their drainage areas and further splitting each subbasin into a set of hydrological response units hrus which represent a particular combination of slope land use land management and soil type swat can thus provide sophisticated and holistic hydrological projections for given patterns of changes in its inputs the swat model requires a set of spatially explicit inputs for the study area a digital elevation model dem a soil map a land use map and a set of weather station locations the weather stations further must be provided with precipitation solar radiation relative humidity and wind data in the form of either i records for each day of the simulation or ii parameters for a rainfall distribution that the model samples from on each simulated day the data sources used for each of the above in the current study are summarized in table 1 data on river discharge from the etesa empresa de transmisión eléctrica s a https www etesa com pa hydrological monitoring network from the period 2005 2015 was used for model validation while etesa precipitation data from the periods 1990 2000 and 2005 2015 were used for fitting the precipitation submodel parameters and running the validation simulation respectively all the above rain gauges and hydrological monitoring stations are mapped in fig 1 the three main lakes reservoirs of note in the study area are lake gatún lake alajuela and lake bayano all three were modeled as reservoirs in swat using the res input file and estimates of volume area from lewis et al 1971 and etesa watershed delineation was carried out in arcswat a threshold of 5000 cells was chosen as the minimum inflow into an outlet for which a subbasin would be defined which amounts to a drainage area of about 4 75 km2 given the dem cell size 1 arc second at the equator 30 8 m areas smaller than this which drain directly into the sea or either neighboring country were not part of the model resulting in a model delineation covering roughly 65 000 km2 or 86 of the total land area of panama swat further assigns each non branching segment of stream its own subbasin unit and calculates hrus within each subbasin based on existing combinations of soils land use and slope swat generates daily mean discharge output m3s 1 at the outlet of each subbasin so additional outlets were manually defined at the location of each hydrological measurement station 52 in total to provide direct comparison points this resulted in a delineation of 980 subbasins in total 2 3 precipitation interpolation daily precipitation data from etesa was downloaded for 249 rain gauge locations across panama of which 120 were active during the simulation period of 2005 2015 though many had substantial temporal gaps in their records swat requires daily precipitation values for each subbasin 980 in total in the current model and thus some method of interpolation is required to fill both spatial and temporal gaps in the data coverage for spatial gaps the method used by default is a nearest neighbor or thiessen polygon interpolation from each subbasin centroid to the nearest rain gauge for temporal gaps the default method is sampling from an empirically determined rainfall distribution at rain gauge locations using a skew normal distribution see neitsch et al 2011 means standard deviations skew and wet dry transition probability values were calculated at all gauge locations using the observations spanning the period of 1990 2000 henceforth this method will be referred to as the default model this spatial interpolation method can result in locations sampling from gauges that are in different climatic zones e g across the peaks of a mountain range while the temporal interpolation method results in breaking of spatial autocorrelation patterns due to independent sampling at spatially related locations which tends to drive overall flow down towards the mean reducing variance and the magnitude of extremes in streamflow instead we expect precipitation patterns to be spatially autocorrelated but that the strength of autocorrelation may change seasonally with climatic forcing we also expect regional gauge data to be more informative than just the nearest neighbor at least for some regions and months in our modified method interpolation of precipitation gauge data at each subbasin centroid was carried out for each day and separately for each of six climatic regions that the country was split into fig 2 we first tested a single step inverse distance weighting model with a single distance decay parameter α see eq 1 fit by region and month this model was named rdw1 for single step regional distance weighting then we tested a two step method rdw2 at each location which incorporated an explicit prediction of rainfall occurrence 1 first we predicted the probability of a wet or dry day occurrence using a logistic regression on the inverse distance weighted mean of observations in the region using a threshold observation 0 5 mm dry gauges were given a value of 0 and wet gauges a value of 1 2 then given the probability of a wet day we performed a binomial trial and if a wet day was generated we interpolated the quantity of rain again using an inverse distance weighted mean of all observed quantities of precipitation within the region for that day dry days were assigned a quantity of 0 mm the two steps involved a single parameter each α1 and α2 which controlled the decay of the relative weighting with distance eq 1 represents the interpolation process we used where pikt was the precipitation value of interest i e either a predictor of wet dry through a logistic regression or the quantity of rain in mm for month t and region k pjkt denoted all measured precipitation values dijkt was the distance between points i and j and αkt was a shape parameter 1 p i k t p j k t e α k t d i j k t e α k t d i j k t these αkt values were fit separately to each monthly time interval and each of 6 regions in panama to capture expected differences in spatial and seasonal autocorrelation patterns in the rdw2 model the predicted total quantity of rain across a region on a given day q1 was reallocated to those locations that were predicted to be wet on that day with a total quantity q2 where q2 q1 i e the predicted quantity in each of these locations was scaled by the ratio q1 q2 to prevent underestimation caused by the independent prediction of occurrence using binomial trials each fitted parameter α in eq 1 represented the strength of the distance weighting with high α severely penalizing information from gauges further away from the target point and prioritizing immediate neighbors the fitting process minimizing the sum of squared deviations was run using the gauge data from 1990 to 2000 and the fitted algorithm was then used to interpolate daily values at the 980 subbasin centroids using gauge data from 2005 to 2015 for the validation run 2 4 model evaluation as the objective was to gain insight into patterns of water distribution the hydrological model results were compared against river discharge data from etesa which was not used to calibrate or parameterize any part of the models r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias of mean model predictions against mean observed daily discharge values were calculated for each calendar month and station across the entire simulation period and these were used as metrics of the ability to predict average flow we also used nse r2 and pbias to examine the ability of the hydrological model to estimate variation in runoff at a given location using as metrics i standard deviation of discharge and ii the magnitudes of the 3 highest daily discharge events across the simulation period in each location month combination we chose the latter to represent of the extreme highs of the discharge distribution for that combination and as a coarse indicator of flood risk finally we used nse and r2 to examine the model s ability to simulate the observed monthly time series of mean discharge within each basin from 2005 to 2015 instead of spatial variation across locations this procedure tested the ability of the model to capture temporal variation within each watershed using the lowermost hydrological station in each of 35 watersheds we posited several variables across that could explain variation in model predictiveness namely i elevation of the observation as we did not account for orographic effects explicitly ii existence of a precipitation gauge within the same subbasin as the observation and iii number of precipitation gauges in the region both as measures of the relevance and quantity of precipitation information v number of subbasins in the watershed as larger watersheds could have more complex behaviour vi number of subbasins downstream from the observation as interior reaches could behave differently regardless of elevation and vi simulated standard deviation of mean monthly discharge at the location as the ability to predict flow might depend on variability we used a stepwise forward selection algorithm in r to arrive at the linear combination of these variables and their pairwise combinations with the lowest aic value 3 results 3 1 precipitation interpolation in the regional distance weighted rdw1 and rdw2 models there was a strong seasonal signal in the autocorrelation patterns as represented by the fitted distance decay parameters α fig 3 maximum values of the α parameters correspond to the greatest weighting of the closest stations and correspondingly the fastest decay in weighting with distance these maxima consistently occurred for both precipitation occurrence and quantity in april and october and these months represent the two transitions between the wet generally may to november and dry seasons over the remainder of each season parameter values decline and then rise gradually for both the single parameter in rdw1 and the occurrence parameter in rdw2 or remain generally low for the quantity parameter in rdw2 until the next seasonal transition variation across region was comparatively higher for both rdw2 parameters than for the single rdw1 parameter 3 2 model evaluation the standard swat model using default precipitation interpolation performed reasonably well for mean discharge across locations with an nse of 0 69 improving the precipitation interpolation approach yielded even better predictions nse 0 88 using the rdw2 model and nse 0 89 using the rdw1 model while the default model worked well for mean discharge nse 0 69 it was less able to capture variability with nse 0 26 for standard deviation of locations month combinations in contrast for standard deviation the rdw2 model achieved nse 0 59 and rdw1 nse 0 53 which compared very favorably with the default model for predicting maxima of daily discharge at each location month combination we found again that the default model performed poorly with nse 0 22 while the rdw2 model achieved a higher nse of 0 53 and rdw1 again performed similarly to rdw2 with nse 0 51 notably however pbias values were significantly larger in magnitude for the rdw1 model than for rdw2 across all analyses these results are summarized in table 2 and fig 4 we also examined the ability to predict temporal patterns within each watershed for the default and rdw models across the ten year period fig 5 we found that the default model performed generally poorly being a worse predictor in 24 out of 35 sites than simply using the observed mean i e nse 0 the rdw2 model performed significantly better while 8 sites still performed poorly nse 0 15 43 sites had satisfactory performance at nse 0 5 and the median nse was 0 4 across locations the rdw1 model performed intermediately with no sites achieving nse 0 5 and a median nse of 0 21 rdw2 was chosen as the overall best model due to this as well as the lower magnitude of bias mentioned above while there were areas of failure the performance of rdw2 was largely predictable 71 of the variation in nse across locations was explained by six variables and two interaction terms the variables were i elevation ii total number of rain gauges in region iii number of downstream subbasins iv size of watershed i e number of subbasins v simulated standard deviation of discharge and vi presence of of which ii iv and vi were significant and the significant interaction terms were between watershed size and number of downstream subbasins and between watershed size and simulated standard deviation table 3 4 discussion panama faces a variety of issues related to potential changes in the water cycle ranging from shortages of drinking water and hydropower to increased impact of floods and droughts while sophisticated hydrological modeling tools such as swat exist the data available with which to build and calibrate such models is generally more limited in panama and other countries of the global south thus while srinivasan and zhang 2010 demonstrated that an uncalibrated swat model predicted streamflow similarly to calibrated ones in the upper mississippi basin of the usa testing the performance of such a model in panama is necessary given differences in environmental conditions and limitations of the available input data indeed we found that while the default swat model performed well for predicting monthly mean flow across watersheds it fared poorly for predicting monthly standard deviations and maxima substantial improvements were obtained across all three metrics by using a 2 stage regional distance weighted interpolation algorithm for precipitation i e our rdw2 model these findings highlight the importance of validating model performance in different regions but also the potential promise of uncalibrated models even in locations where hydrological data are limited standard deviations and maxima which the default model predict poorly represent information about streamflow distributions that are crucially important in the predictive modeling of flood risk e g van der wiel et al 2019 furthermore variability in water availability is a critical indicator of potential water scarcity and has significant impacts on human water use despite often being overlooked in favour of annual means damkjaer and taylor 2017 modeling studies also show that hydropower output is sensitive to variability in hydroclimatic inputs arriagada et al 2019 chowdhury et al 2020 while future hydroclimate projections for panama have been made for monthly mean discharge fábrega et al 2013 the present study lays the groundwork for improved projections based on a more sophisticated hydrological model with higher spatial resolution and finer prediction of variability and extremes the relative predictive failure of the default model was due to the precipitation model which by default matches each subbasin to its nearest precipitation gauge and fills temporal gaps in the daily records of each gauge by sampling from an empirical distribution that models the behavior of that gauge neitsch et al 2011 this sampling is done independently of any other gauge value on that day as these temporal gaps occurred frequently the mean precipitation gauge was only active on 60 of days from 2005 to 2015 the result of this independent sampling would tend to average out variability across subbasins and contribute to the observed pattern of underestimated variances and extremes of streamflow in the default model such spatial and especially temporal gaps in rainfall data have been shown to have significant negative impacts on swat performance tan and yang 2020 in contrast due to the use of distance weighted interpolation fitted on seasonal and regional spatial patterns of precipitation estimated values across gauges within a region on a given day more faithfully replicated real precipitation patterns in the rdw1 and rdw2 models while both distance weighted models were clear improvements on the default model rdw2 outperformed rdw1 in terms of predicting standard deviations and maxima of discharge in terms of both nse and percentage bias and also performed much better than rdw1 in predicting time series of discharge at each location fig 5 most often distance weighted interpolation for precipitation has been modeled as a single step calculating quantity of rain e g chen and liu 2012 cheng et al 2017 tuo et al 2016 xue et al 2018 as in the rdw1 model yet two step interpolation treating i the occurrence of precipitation and ii the quantity separately has been found to regenerate more realistic patterns of spatial variability for daily precipitation hwang et al 2012 as these two factors need not be linearly related and cannot be captured with a single distance function rdw2 is thus overall the best model of the three tested only one station with hydrological data used for validation was downstream of reservoir outflow specifically of lake bayano etesa station id 148 08 01 and the final model achieved a within basin nse of 0 21 at that station an improvement on the default model which had nse 0 01 more precise specification and treatment of these large bodies of water is one of the key next steps to be addressed in future as they are locally important for among many other reasons their direct connection to the canal better accounting for spatial relatedness of precipitation gauges was also crucial for estimating fluctuations in streamflow across time within each watershed as opposed to variation across watersheds discussed above the uncalibrated default swat model generally performed no better than simply using the mean flow in most watersheds median nse 0 again highlighting the importance of testing in different regions and for different metrics with our rdw2 model the median watershed nse was 0 4 and 43 of locations achieved nse 0 5 defined to be satisfactory performance by moriasi et al 2007 furthermore we could largely identify where failures in the rdw2 model occurred explaining 71 of the variation in basin nses and showed that the total number of gauges in the region and the presence of a gauge in the subbasin itself were both predictors of higher nse at a given location additionally our findings suggest that spatial patterning of rainfall varied over time with peaks in parameter values of the distance weighted interpolation kernel in the months of april and october high parameter values indicate that nearby gauges are much more predictive of precipitation at a point than ones further away low parameter values on the other hand indicate a broader averaging and more regional forcing the two months of highest parameter values april and october coincide with the periods of change in patterns of observed variation in rainfall fábrega et al 2013 as well as periods of strongest increase and decrease in average rainfall respectively kusunoki et al 2019 further elucidation of the processes that lead to the variation in spatial autocorrelation captured by the current model may aid in the development of a dynamical procedure that can account for nonstationarity while seasonal and regional patterns of spatial autocorrelation in precipitation and their effects on extreme events are being studied in some arid and semi arid areas in regions such as china xu et al 2021 and iran darand et al 2017 rousta et al 2017 they remain understudied in the tropics where they may also be of importance 5 conclusions the main finding is that the default precipitation model of swat was a key limitation in applying it to panama and that modifying it to account for regional and seasonal patterns of spatial autocorrelation of precipitation dramatically improved predictions of flow across a range of metrics while the treatment of precipitation input remains a key element further improvement of the model could incorporate integration with a regionalization approach to improve the accuracy of physical swat parameters or focusing on parameterizing areas of interest using direct field measurements we focused on the streamflow output one of the most fundamental hydrological variables but swat also has the capacity for integrative modeling of other aspects of the hydrological system such as sediment load and nutrient pollution in runoff and these represent natural avenues for future work finally more precise treatment of reservoirs and the canal system in general is an important next step our model demonstrates that careful treatment of spatial autocorrelation in precipitation input can yield substantial benefits for prediction even in regions where data limitations make hydrological calibration

7831,study region the study covers the freshwater lakes of ethiopia which constitute about 87 billion cubic meters of water volume the lakes are facing continued ecosystem degradation threats study focus the aim of this study was to make an inventory of existing literature regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia and identify gaps and priorities for future research directions this was done through a systematic review of published scientific literature related to the lakes and characterizing each study based on different criteria new hydrological insights for the region we found a total of 231 articles on freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in peer reviewed journals between 1930 and march 2021 most studies were focused on hydrochemical and biological characteristics of lakes with less attention to physical structure and processes including siltation lake morphometry and catchment biophysical characteristics furthermore a less attention was given to the spatial and temporal dynamics of variables that affect the freshwater lakes b there was limited linkage between landscape hydrological dynamics and freshwater lakes and c the smaller highland lakes were given limited attention future research should be oriented to the study of the relationship between catchment biophysical dynamics and lake hydrological characteristics graphical abstract ga1 keywords systematic literature review freshwater ethiopia lake hydrological dynamics hydrologic modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction different geological formations and climatic conditions have endowed ethiopia with vast water resources and wetland ecosystems including 12 river basins eight major lakes and floodplains and several man made reservoirs with a total annual surface runoff of about 122 billion cubic meters bcm awulachew et al 2007 there is a diversity of information published about the lake resources of ethiopia including their number hillman 1993 listed 77 lakes in the then geographical boundary of ethiopia including eritrea a study by leykun 2003 based on secondary sources estimated the number of lakes in the country to reach 70 but a report by awulachew et al 2007 estimated the number of lakes in the country to be only 20 30 another study by messager et al 2016 identified about 240 sites as freshwater lakes in ethiopia using a geostatistical and remote sensing approach a compilation of results from bathymetry survey reports of the larger lakes seven of the rift valley lakes plus lakes tana haike hardibo and bishoftu revealed that they contain about 87 bcm of water in a more comprehensive study by messager et al 2016 the water in all the open water bodies of the country is estimated to be more than 335 bcm many of these lakes are recognized for their outstanding biological diversity and societal significance belete et al 2015 however the lakes are facing substantial threats due to natural and anthropogenic factors such as increased water abstraction and intensified pollution sources population in the lake basins is high and continually growing due to the recent increase in large scale irrigation which depends on water resources in the lakes and the rivers flowing to them seyoum et al 2015 such water use competition between irrigation industrial and domestic uses contributes to complexity in the sustainable management of freshwater resources in ethiopia moreover climate change exacerbates the situation and induces water balance anomalies in many hydrological systems getnet et al 2014 the threat is highly pronounced in the rift valley lakes comprising a chain of nine lakes from north to south ziway abiyata langano shala hawasa abaya beseka chamo and chew bahir occupying the southern part of the ethiopian rift valley basin lakes in the highland parts of the country also face water level reduction belete et al 2015 water volume reduction aynew 2002 surface area shrinkage ayenew 2004 increasing levels of sediment deposition gadissa et al 2018 reduced runoff inputs to the lakes and increased evaporation losses getnet et al 2014 many studies have generated information on different aspects of freshwater resources in ethiopia using various in situ observation remote sensing empirical and modeling approaches despite this and also the fact that both the highlands and the rift valley lakes of ethiopia attract national and international scientific attention due to their ecological and ecosystem significance systematically organized and synthesized information on the country s freshwater lakes is limited thus a systematic review of existing scientific studies on ethiopian freshwater lakes is an important endeavor in organizing a body of knowledge on the overall lake water resources of the country such a review can contribute to the building of a database and development of data driven and knowledge based lake catchment management plans for the sustainable utilization of freshwater resources the aim of this study therefore was to make an inventory of existing literature regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia systematically synthesize the available knowledge and pinpoint gaps to be prioritized by future research the specific objectives were to 1 examine the temporal pattern of scientific studies of freshwater lakes in ethiopia 2 analyze the major research themes covered by previous studies and thus the gaps in freshwater lake research 3 analyze methods used by studies to extract hydrological information from freshwater lakes of ethiopia and 4 synthesize the findings of previous studies about the hydrological status of the lakes the outputs of this study provide a database about the freshwater lakes identify research gaps and suggest future research directions 2 methods 2 1 study area ethiopia is situated in the horn of africa between 3 4 n and 14 9 n and 33 0 e and 48 0 e with an area of 1 104 300 km2 it is characterized by a wide variety of landscapes and landforms which results from a complex geological process with alternating phases of orogenesis peneplanation crustal updoming faulting emplacement of huge amounts of lava and deep fluvial dissection abbate et al 2015 this has created the great rift valley of east africa of which ethiopia contains a major part and the huge land masses along its escarpments fig 1 this varied topography in turn produces a complex climate system ranging from semi arid in the lowlands to humid and warm temperate in the southwest highlands fazzini et al 2015 another result of the topography is the prevalence of complex hydrological systems with distinct basin characteristics between the lowlands and the highlands abbate et al 2015 the highlands found in the northwestern and the southeastern parts of the rift valley are the source of eight large river basins which radiate towards the surrounding lowlands with the exception of the rift valley lake basins and the afar depression the drainage basins of the lowlands are to a great extent subject to the hydrology of the river basins descending from the highlands a rough estimation of the surface water potentials of all these drainage basins is about 124 4 bcm about 97 of which flows towards neighboring countries billi et al 2015 freshwater lakes make up the principal part of these hydrological resources and are large in number exceeding 70 and vary considerably in their size and location some of them e g lakes hayk and hashenge form part of the large river basins others those in the rift valley are marked by their own closed drainage basins and lake tana makes up a principal part of the nile basin fig 1 these lakes together with their associated drainage basins are fundamental parts of the structure and welfare of societies and natural ecosystems in the study of hughes 1992 the wetlands and lakes of ethiopia were divided into ten major groups with each group constituting the lakes and the nearby wetlands these included lake tana the hashenge and hayk lakes lakes of the bale mountains lakes of bishoftu lakes of the southwest rift valley lakes of the awash river system lakes of the afar depression and artificial impoundments and micro dams in this study we have covered all the relevant scientific articles associated with these lakes 2 2 literature search and selection criteria the literature search process was conducted by targeting all scientific articles about the freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in the english language in peer reviewed journals and available in the following online databases google scholar web of science science direct proques springer link and wiley online we developed our search strategy in two different ways the first being to find articles based on their study area and the second based on thematic relevance to address the first strategy we initially listed the names and geographical locations of lakes from literature awulachew et al 2007 leykun 2003 messager et al 2016 schagerl 2016 some lakes were given different names in different studies and we tried to list all alternative names for each lake we then searched scientific articles using the identified lake names as a key word the second strategy was to find studies based on a search item relevant to lake hydrological characteristics the combinations of words used were lakes and ethiopia and water volume or water quality or hydrology or water balance or climate change or limnology or hydrogeology or hydrobiology or aquatic ecosystem or ground water or human impact or siltation or climate change or hydrochemical or physicochemical or phytoplankton or zooplankton or evapotranspiration or river inflow or fauna or flora or watershed or catchment or basin or water resource or irrigation the last search was conducted on 21 march 2021 this produced a total of 696 papers we then refined the search results based on inclusion criteria fig 2 to only include studies that 1 included self produced data at least in one variable 2 were conducted in at least one of the lakes of ethiopia or their catchments 3 considered the effect of catchment behavior on at least one lake hydrological variable 4 were based on empirical observation of samples of organic and inorganic elements from the lakes in relation to lake hydrological characteristics and 5 were published in peer reviewed journals in total 231 articles met the inclusion criteria and were then further categorized and analyzed for the systematic review 2 3 data compilation and classification a tabular template was prepared to record the metadata extracted from the respective publications these metadata were reviewed and their characteristics assessed based on selected parameters such as the specific hydrological variables measured the list of studied lakes the spatial scale of the study the observed analytical dimension temporal spatial a combination of these or none the study methods used and the research theme topic the first step started with article registration and metadata organization an article which passed the selection criteria was imported to mendeley reference manager software it was then registered with a unique identification number in the ms excel based metadata template relevant information e g topic author year of publication was then registered in consecutive columns secondly the variables of hydrological interest that were measured estimated quantified or analyzed quantitatively using first hand data i e measured data or secondary data that were compiled by the researcher during the research process were extracted and labeled as either effect or causal variables based on how they were considered in the study the effect variables were those subjected to the influence of one or more independent variables while the causal variables were those exerting some influence on another dependent variable studies which considered only one of the two variable types were considered as descriptive next the co occurrence frequencies of specific effect and causal variables were enumerated to examine the degree to which a pair of variables had been studied or which variable pairs are missing in literature future research activity is recommended to focus on variables where low co occurrence frequency is recorded as little attention has so far been given to the causal associations of these variables thirdly the lakes that were studied in each of the articles were listed and the result was used to analyze the number of times each lake appeared in all the studies the lake names were further cross referenced with a list of variables in the articles which was used to determine the number of times that a variable was studied for a specific lake the assumption here was that lower frequency values would suggest increasing probabilities of research gaps and vice versa in the fourth step the spatial units studied in each article were identified as terrestrial aquatic or aquatic terrestrial based on the data collection site and the characteristics of the variables measured aquatic studies are those conducted on data from the lake ecosystem s aquatic part only with no variables representing the terrestrial parts terrestrial studies are those which were conducted with data from the drainage areas that contribute water to the lake with no variables measured from the aquatic part aquatic terrestrial studies are those conducted using data from both the lake and its drainage area or those which consider both components as aggregated units the result was used to evaluate if the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic parts of a lake ecosystem has been well addressed fifthly the studies were categorized into four major groups based on whether the studies considered temporal spatial spatiotemporal analytical dimensions or did not consider any analytical dimensions at all the latter studies are those that did not present any spatial and temporal variation in variables of interest instead they presented information in spatially aggregated form or at a specific location and at an instant time lastly the methods employed to extract information about the characteristics of each variable were listed and used to quantify the frequency of each method per variable for all the reviewed articles which helped in evaluating the pattern of hydrological research methods used in the studies once registration of the major characteristics was completed the studies were grouped into six exclusive categories with each category characterized by a similar research thematic area namely catchment biophysical analysis hydrobiology hydrogeology lake water storage analysis paleohydrology and water quality analysis the criteria for categorization were the topic abstract list of variables spatial unit studied and temporal scope of the study the process started with a preliminary evaluation of the articles to derive a possible list of research themes by which the articles could be grouped the resulting list of more than ten research themes was then refined to six categories based on similarities between the themes each article was then assigned to one of the six categories based on the characterization criteria the categorization process was conducted based on a sequence of steps illustrated in fig 2 it starts with assigning an article to one of the research themes based on its topic and abstract relevance however if the topic and abstract information implied multiple themes the article continued to be evaluated through four consecutive evaluation steps until it was possible to assign it to one of the appropriate research themes a detailed description of each criterion can be found in appendix i 2 4 synthesis of findings on the hydrological status of major lakes to present synthesized hydrological information on the lakes the papers were further screened for information on the hydrological status of some major lakes based on the following selection criteria 1 studies conducted on one of the ethiopian rift valley lakes or lake tana 2 studies presenting original research not review of the temporal dynamics of one or more lake water storage variables such as water balance water volume storage water level dynamics lake surface area size and lake siltation rate and 3 studies addressing the causes of the changes in a specific variable based on the water balance closure and water volume conditions the lakes are characterized into static stable water balance closure and water volume and relatively small anthropogenic intervention in their catchments resilient positive and stable water balance closure and water volume even with intensive anthropogenic intervention in their catchments and declining reduction of water volume and a negative water balance closure term 3 results 3 1 historical trend of scientific publications on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia the earliest publication on ethiopian freshwater lakes was in 1930 fig 3 while the number of studies per year tended to increase through time at different rates the publication pattern until the 1990s was very intermittent for most of the research themes with the gap between consecutive publications exceeding two decades specifically between 1940 and 1960 even though the gap was narrowed in the following decades in the 1970s and 1980s the total number of publications per year remained lower than five until 2000 rose to more than six between 2001 and 2003 and then reached 23 between 2018 and 2020 fig 3 3 2 major research themes in freshwater lake studies in ethiopia a comparison of studies among different research themes shows that lake water storage analysis with 65 articles was the most frequently studied fig 3 in terms of historical trends the earliest publication found on this theme was the bathymetry study of lake bishoftu by prosser et al 1968 followed by a bathymetry survey report on lakes chamo and abaya by awulachew 1999 the most frequently investigated effect variable in this theme was water balance 49 hereafter the number in parentheses refers to the number of studies as influenced by climate 22 anthropogenic factors 8 and land cover change 5 fig 4 lake water volume was the second most frequently studied variable 39 of which 17 were investigated as a function of climate and eight as affected by anthropogenic variables lake morphometric variables were covered by 15 studies of which four were investigated in relation to climate and three to land cover change siltation was the other effect variable studied under this theme particularly in relation to catchment soil characteristics 7 in the co occurrence analysis we found a considerable number of purely descriptive studies that did not report any causal variables particularly for water balance 13 and water volume 11 studies in terms of analytical dimensions the majority of the studies of lake water storage 62 considered the spatiotemporal dynamics of water storage characteristics fig 5a the remaining 25 and 12 considered the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively most of the studies 62 took the aquatic and terrestrial parts of the lake system as the spatial unit of study while the remaining studies focused only on the aquatic parts fig 5b the second highest number of studies was found in the hydrobiology research theme 50 with a focus on the study of aquatic organisms in relation to the environmental factors affecting them the earliest publication located was the study of omer cooper 1930 which is the expedition report by a british scientist in which he introduced the freshwater fauna of ethiopia to the international scientific community subsequent publications were in 1969 urban 1969 and 1973 talling et al 1973 with a gap until 1982 goll 1982 since when publication has continued with only a short time interval between studies fig 3 the variable co occurrence is restricted largely to that between aquatic organisms and hydrochemical characteristics 34 with a very limited appearance of the other causal variables which have been shown to have a significant effect on aquatic organisms in other international studies yang et al 2013 an example is the relationship between aquatic organisms and many catchment biophysical variables such as land cover climate change anthropogenic activity and soil characteristics joniak et al 2017 szpakowska et al 2022 tahiru et al 2020 similarly the influence of lake morphometric characteristics on the behavior of aquatic ecosystems is also poorly addressed haas et al 2010 stefanidis and papastergiadou 2012 the majority of the studies 38 were only spatially aggregated and related to a specific point in time rather than examining spatial and temporal dynamics the spatial coverage of almost all studies was limited to the aquatic parts of the lake ecosystem with little or no attention to the terrestrial parts fig 5b catchment biophysical analysis ranked third in terms of study frequency the focus of studies in this theme was on catchment biophysical variables such as land cover topography soil anthropogenic factors and their impact on hydrological characteristics the number of studies found was 38 with the earliest publication in 1935 cheesman 1935 giving a historical record of lake tana and its environment this study might be significant as a historical document of basin environments but is less relevant in terms of the actual hydrological behavior of the basin a substantial increase in publications on biophysical characterization of lakes and basins was observed since 2005 in terms of variable frequency most studies were conducted to assess land and water resource utilization patterns with the majority of them being descriptive studies 15 conducted without any use of explanatory variables the causality studies are focused on climate change impacts on water balance 7 and anthropogenic effects on land cover change 6 fig 4 the majority of studies 64 considered the spatiotemporal dimension with most of the rest being simply attribute studies fig 5b the spatial scope of most studies 78 was limited to the terrestrial parts of the lake ecosystems lake water quality was the fourth most frequently studied research theme 31 the main concern of these studies was the measurement and analysis of the hydrochemical characteristics of the surface and underground waters found within the lake basins the earliest publication date was 1965 with two publications both of which were about a chemical study of african lakes including the rift valley lakes of ethiopia baxter et al 1965 talling and talling 1965 in following years publication was neither sustained continuously nor interrupted totally but continued to appear on a five year average interval baumann et al 1975 baxter et al 1973 a sustained trend of publication started only in 2004 from when there is a minimum of one publication every other year fig 3 in terms of the variables examined they are characterized by the predominant use of hydrochemical characteristics as the effect variable with only anthropogenic factors as causal variables to explain the water quality dynamics many studies 15 in this research theme are also descriptive focused only on presenting water quality characteristics without reference to the causal factors affecting water quality fig 4 some 33 and 24 of these studies considered the spatial and the spatiotemporal dimensions respectively while most of the remaining studies exceeding 26 did not consider any aspects of variability in terms of spatial coverage the majority of the studies 57 looked at the aquatic parts of the lake ecosystems with 43 considering both the aquatic and terrestrial parts fig 5b the hydrogeology studies focused on groundwater characterization and geological evolution analysis of the lake basins we found 28 studies with the first publication in 1972 searle and gouin 1972 although this was not directly relevant to the hydrological features of the lakes but gave some accounts of the geological characteristics of the basins related to their gravity profile however more regular publication did not start until the study of darling et al 1996 which gives the earliest account of groundwater interactions between the lakes and their catchments in terms of variable frequency studies in this category tended to focus on the groundwater flux flow direction and volume estimation and its hydrochemical characteristics with the frequent use of hydro geomorphological factors as explanatory variables the focus was only limited to these three variables with a limited co occurrence frequency of other important variables which might have an influence on groundwater characteristics fig 4 some 58 of studies considered the spatial dimensions of the hydrogeological variables fig 5a in terms of spatial scope 42 of studies were conducted on the terrestrial parts 32 on the aquatic terrestrial parts and 26 on the aquatic parts fig 5b paleohydrology studies were the least frequently addressed research theme 19 these focused on tracing the evolution of water and material movement in the lake basins on a geological time scale the earliest publication was in 1940 nilsson 1940 which can be considered as a pioneering study of the lake basin evolution process of the rift valley lakes and lake tana and was a paleolimnological account of past climate change at a regional scale subsequent publications were in 1971 grove and goudie 1971 and 1975 grove et al 1975 with a trend of more frequent publication starting only in 1990 fig 3 the commonly used effect variables have included lake water volume 12 water balance 8 and hydrochemical variables 5 all of which were assessed as a function of climate variables in addition to climate variables tectonic factors were employed as causal variables mainly to assess the hydro geomorphological process fig 4 most of the paleohydrological research was conducted by considering only the temporal dimension 58 the remainder covering both the spatial and temporal dimensions fig 5a the target of most studies was the aquatic parts of the lake system 67 with only 23 of studies considering both the aquatic and terrestrial parts in their spatial coverage fig 5b 3 3 number and type of study lake from the total of 70 lakes included in the literature search process using their names as a keyword we found scientific studies on only 27 of them fig 6 the most studied lakes were lakes ziway and hawasa with 77 and 50 studies respectively the next most referenced was lake tana with 47 studies followed by lakes abiyata 41 shalla 36 langano 34 abaya 28 and chamo 22 there were also several studies on the smaller lakes including five of the bishoftu crater lakes 22 hayk 10 and ardibo 2 the number of studies for these and many other lakes are not displayed in fig 6 instead they were merged and reported as other smaller lakes osl fig 7 since they are too numerous to mention individually there were also many regional studies which provide essential hydrological information for entire basins typically for the central rift valley lakes basin region crlb without explicitly attributing their results to a specific lake grove et al 1975 wagesho et al 2012 analysis of the articles by lake and variable revealed two different patterns for lake tana and for the rift valley lakes for lake tana most studies were associated with climate and water balance aspects with the fewest investigating hydro geomorphology and lake morphometry variables in the rift valley lakes on the other hand most studies looked at hydrochemical water balance anthropogenic activity and climate variables followed by aquatic organisms and lake water volume variables the least frequently addressed topics included siltation catchment soil characteristics lake morphometry and groundwater flux fig 7 there was also a substantial variation in study numbers per variable between the different rift valley lakes with most records relating to three of them ziway abiyata and hawasa and with decreasing numbers towards the southern rift valley lakes such as abaya and chamo fig 7 3 4 hydrological information estimation methods used in freshwater lake studies the hydrological information estimation methods differed depending on the variable types fig 8 physical modeling numerical modeling analytical water sampling analysis and confirmatory statistical analysis constituted the most common hydrological information estimation methods modeling constituted the most frequently used method predominantly physical modeling followed by numerical modeling one of the most frequent application areas of modeling was to estimate information about water balance components numerical modeling was typically based on the use of time series hydroclimate records of nearby meteorological stations while the physical modeling technique derived the required parameters after representing the variables of interest in a geospatial database alemu et al 2020 both modeling methods were also common in the study of lake water volume dynamics through estimating lake water volume from time series lake level records lumped water budget equations for numerical models and lake bathymetry datasets for physical models the other common application areas of modeling were related to siltation and catchment soil erosion volume estimation more specifically physical modeling approaches were used to quantify the average sediment load of studied lakes and to estimate lake bottom sediment volumes through bathymetry differentiation methods the most frequent use of physical models 109 studies might indicate increasing attempts to consider spatial and temporal dimensions while measuring hydrological dynamics many of the physical and numerical models used by the reviewed studies were however universal in nature and employed without prior understanding of their compatibility with the context of the study area the use of infrequent both spatially and temporally observation data for calibration of model simulation was another critical problem observed in water balance studies the approach used to study climate variability differed depending on the temporal scale of the studies most studies concerned with the last few hundred years of climate change were conducted through time series analysis of climate data and physical modeling approaches the former is used to trace climate change through confirmatory statistical analysis of meteorological data while the latter identifies past and future changes based on different downscaled regional and global climate models the other method used in the climate change studies was paleolimnological climate analysis which was mainly employed to trace climate change on a geological time scale e g legesse et al 2002 telford et al 1999 it determined the chronology e g lamb et al 2007 accumulation rate e g sagri et al 2008 and lithological characteristics of sediments on a millennium scale time frame and associated the result with climate change observations lamb 2002 many studies about the surface and subsurface water physicochemical characteristics were conducted using analytical water sampling techniques teklu et al 2018 there were also some water quality studies conducted through mineralogical analysis of sediments in which the physicochemical characteristics of sample sediments from the lake were used as the main indicators of pollution from the catchments moges et al 2017 a few others concerned with tracing geological time scale change in the physicochemical characteristics of lake waters used an isotope based water age determination system wagner et al 2018 aquatic life studies of the lakes have mostly used a confirmatory data analysis system through making empirical observations of the interaction between the aquatic organisms characteristics and water characteristics the observations were then analyzed using inferential statistics hypothesis testing producing estimates regression analysis to verify the effect of lake water hydrological characteristics on the behavior of aquatic organisms fetahi et al 2011 lemma 2009 wood and talling 1988 confirmatory data analysis was also applied to study anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems to verify whether different anthropogenic interventions both in the catchment and the lakes and socio economic changes have had any significant impacts on lake hydrology typical examples are estimation of water abstraction impacts on lake water volume by lake water storage studies and tracing anthropogenic sources of water pollution from nearby catchments with very few exceptions e g yohannes et al 2013 many studies indicated potential impacts of certain anthropogenic interventions on lake ecosystems without explicitly stating the magnitude of such influences this is partly a reflection that most studies aimed to infer the impact of terrestrial basin areas on the aquatic system without considering both the aquatic and terrestrial components in their spatial scope this was typically exhibited in water quality and hydrobiology research where the spatial scope of most studies was restricted only to the aquatic parts of the lakes the problem was also apparent in catchment biophysical studies in which the likelihood of land cover change and land management impacts on lake hydrology were inferred from literature with no empirically observed data elias et al 2019 lemma 2003 meshesha et al 2012 the study of groundwater dynamics was mainly based on isotopic analysis geophysical analysis and ground water modeling approaches the isotope analysis approach compared the isotope composition of different water sources that contribute to the groundwater system of the basins legesse et al 2002 revealing any subsurface hydraulic links and the contribution of different water balance components to recharging or depleting the groundwater of the basin the geophysical analysis approach on the other hand was used to identify subsurface hydraulic links and groundwater flow volumes through direct measurement of groundwater flux ayenew et al 2009 molin and corti 2015 many of these studies were subjected to the problem of limited hydrologic data from poor observation networks and repetitive use of similar hydrologic parameters while estimating many variables a geospatial data analysis approach was typically employed to derive lake morphometric and catchment land cover variables it was based on the representation of lake bathymetry data in a geospatial database and then deriving the required parameters with the 3d analytical capacities of spatial analysis software in the case of catchment land cover studies geospatial approaches were used to derive multi temporal land cover information from remote sensing observations 3 5 synthesis of findings on the hydrological status of major freshwater lakes of ethiopia in table 1 we present synthesized findings related to selected lake water volume variables with a specific focus on the major rift valley lakes and lake tana the static lakes are shalla ayenew 2004 and langano alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2004 belete et al 2015 getnet et al 2014 seyoum et al 2015 which are characterized by positive water balance closure terms and a stable water volume condition with a relatively small anthropogenic intervention in their catchments the resilient lakes are abiyata chamo hawasa and tana which maintain a positive water balance closure term and a relatively stable water volume even though they are subject to intensive anthropogenic intervention and climate change factors some examples of these interventions are massive sediment load from upland watersheds abebe et al 2018 awulachew 2006a lemma 2009 new settlement and conversion of forest to agricultural land abebe et al 2018 awulachew 2006a ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 wondie 2018 and water diversions that decrease water flows into the lakes awulachew 2006a dile et al 2016 the reason the lakes can maintain a positive water balance closure term with the presence of such intensive anthropogenic intervention is however poorly documented in many studies an exception to this is lake hawasa where neo tectonism ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 and climate factors ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 belete et al 2017 explain why its water volume remained unchanged over time the declining lakes are abiyata and ziway which were characterized by a reduction of water volume and a negative water balance closure term in many of the studies the causes of the change are associated with high water abstraction and climate factors table 1 the underlying threat emanates from diversion of lake ziway s inflowing rivers for irrigation in the upper catchment which consequently reduces the volume of water flowing into the lake and eventually the water volume of the lake itself aynew 2002 meshesha et al 2012 seyoum et al 2015 the lowered water volume in lake ziway in turn brought about a reduction in the outflowing river volume that inflows towards lake abiyata belete et al 2015 seyoum et al 2015 which is thus one of the main causes of abiyata s water volume reduction water abstraction from lake abiyata for soda ash production is an added factor aynew 2002 legesse et al 2004 although it is not clearly defined which of the two factors has the greater impact on the other hand increasing evaporation due to prolonged dry periods has been reported as a common factor aggravating the reduction of water volumes of both lakes asfaw et al 2020 desta and lemma 2017 seyoum et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 historical trend of publication records scientific inquiry and acquisition of information regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia date back to the beginning of the 20th century with a notable contribution from colonial expeditions and personal accounts of travelers the earliest available scientific records were from hugh scott s expedition to the then abyssinia omer cooper 1930 which presented quantitative information about selected hydrochemical characteristics of lakes of the rift valley region the detailed results of his investigation published as a series of papers in consecutive study years presented the earliest known scientific records of the freshwater fauna of ethiopia the other study of significant historical importance is that of nilsson 1940 which presented a comprehensive scientific account of the geological evolution of the lakes of the central rift valley region and lake tana with a qualitative description of their basin environments we then found hardly any published articles in the following years until 1965 talling and talling 1965 the year 1965 could be considered the beginning of a new era in the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia in terms of sustained publication the institutionalization of research activities and the widening of research themes this period marked the introduction of higher education and the establishment of research institutions in the country making possible the development of longer lasting research activities than the colonial expedition and travel account based research traditions the average number of research publications per year was still less than two but it continued without interruption with a gradually increasing volume with the exception of lake water storage studies publications started to emerge in all the other research themes the initial themes of this period the post 1965 era were water quality talling and talling 1965 and hydrobiology urban 1969 followed by paleohydrology grove and goudie 1971 and hydrogeological studies searle and gouin 1972 the number of lakes studied and the diversity of research approaches used also increased ranging from descriptive study to confirmatory analysis of water quality impacts on aquatic organisms baxter et al 1973 talling et al 1973 talling and talling 1965 however there exists an interruption in the publication record between 1974 and 1984 a period that coincided with a time of political transition from the imperial regime to a socialist military power this was known for its political instability and economic stagnation where state attention was diverted towards security and political issues mengistie 2021 which might account for the reduced number of publications during this time most significantly the country s political alignment was directed towards the then soviet bloc and its relations with the west were severely strained markakis 1981 this might have halted the involvement in the scientific endeavors of western scholars who contributed the most during the previous decades in the last 25 years the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia has advanced in more ways than ever before in terms of thematic area the number of lakes studied and the number of research studies published per year in this period the number of state owned universities grew which resulted in an increase in research involvement by domestic scholars it was also a time where strong institutional linkages were created between domestic and international research institutions the progress is also attributed to significant advances in hydrological research methods easier accessibility of hydrological data software and hardware advancements the explosion of geospatial technology and greater international linkage through internet and web based data sharing mechanisms this might also be the reason for the abrupt increase in the frequency of lake water storage studies after the 1990s awulachew 1999 in the lake water storage research theme the different morphometric characteristics of the lakes were determined abebe et al 2018 including lake areas depths volumes and overall bathymetry measurements the water balance state of most of the lakes was also estimated to a reasonable level of accuracy through a variety of numerical and physical water balance modeling approaches belete et al 2017 lake water quality levels and their usability for different human consumption purposes were also determined zinabu et al 2002 cause and effect relational analysis between catchment biophysical dynamics and lake hydrological dynamics has also started to be considered billi and caparrini 2006 understanding the long term hydrological dynamics of the lakes both qualitative and quantitative dynamics and their response to the changing trends of hydrological causal factors became the main research agenda of studies in recent decades awulachew 2006a legesse et al 2004 the historical record of publication on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia is evidence for the ongoing advancement of scientific research endeavors in the field of hydrology and lake ecosystem studies one of the observed trends is an increase in the number of variables addressed by the studies over time studies in the early period pre 1960 were limited to aquatic organism characterization and lake water physiochemical characteristics this was followed after the 1970s by lake water volume studies and water balance measurement with the causal factors affecting it variables dealing with catchment biophysical characteristics specifically land cover and climate change newly emerged after the 1990s methodological complexity also advanced with the increasing number of variables addressed by the studies in this regard articles in the early days were narrative qualitative studies based on personal observation this was followed by quantitative measurement of variables based on empirical observation of hydrological phenomena empirical observation based analysis then transformed to modeling hydrological phenomena using a variety of conceptual and hydrological models the current frontier is now causality analysis of multiple hydrological variables and simulation and prediction of hydrological phenomena 4 2 implications of variable co occurrence frequency and research methods our analysis shows that variable co occurrence frequency differs between the research categories in the lake water storage theme water balance and lake water volume analysis were largely examined in relation to land use change climate change and morphology with the majority of studies focused on climate change effects on water balance and lake water volume a potential research gap in the study of lake water volume is the impact of land cover and anthropogenic activity on lake water volume another potential research gap is in lake morphometric and siltation studies where there is a less frequent appearance of these variables with the majority of studies conducted without considering any causal factors affecting lake hydrology on the other hand in the hydrogeology research category much effort has been directed to the study of groundwater flux and mobilization of hydrochemical variables as a function of basin geomorphological characteristics other important factors that could have affected groundwater characteristics such as anthropogenic intervention climate change and land cover change were given less attention in paleoenvironmental research the focus was oriented to reconstruction of millennia scale hydrological histories of the basins but among the many environmental variables involved in the basin evolution process climate change was the only driving factor considered by the studies with very few exceptions the tradition of hydrobiology research was characterized by a single variable combination limited only to lake water hydrochemical variables and aquatic organism characteristics this was also an issue in the water quality studies where anthropogenic intervention was considered as the only source of water pollution in contrast the attention given to examining the effects of many hydrological variables such as lake morphometric characteristics lake water volume dynamics catchment biophysical changes including land cover and soil characteristics and climate change on water quality and aquatic organisms was very limited in catchment biophysical studies a research gap is indicated both in terms of the very low number of variables investigated compared to current studies in hydrological science and in the limited study of causality analysis most attention was given to situational analyses of prevailing land and water utilization patterns rather than causality analyses between different biophysical variables more specifically the impact of ongoing land cover vegetation socio economic and demographic changes on water balance and catchment erosion processes received little attention our observations about the frequency of studied variables and the way the variables were treated whether they are effect or causal variables might have implications for the state of current hydrological research beyond the specific case of hydrological research in ethiopia one of these implications relates to the repetitive use of specific cause and effect variables while conducting casualty analysis the most focused on cause and effect studies are legacy driven variables which were proved to have a well known causality relationship by the scientific literature and little attention has been given to new insights relationships and associations of variables an example is the tendency to focus only on water physico chemical characteristics while studying the factors affecting aquatic organism characteristics olkeba et al 2020 wood and talling 1988 there has been also a tendency to focus on the linear relationship of hydrological variables without considering the counter effect of a change in one variable on the other or validating if the association between variables could work in reverse order for instance there is a consideration of anthropogenic factors only as a causal variable with little attention given to the impact of hydrological factors on the anthropogenic ones desta et al 2017 getnet et al 2014 furthermore the meta analysis shows that most hydrological studies while conducting causality analysis on different hydrological variables have made limited efforts to establish new empirical relationships for example demographic changes have been put forward as evidence of anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems without providing measured evidence elias et al 2019 pascual ferrer et al 2014 teffera et al 2017 4 3 spatial and temporal variability measurement approaches hydrological phenomena and their causal factors change through time and space consideration of these dynamics in the research process is of fundamental importance to the reliability of a study zhang et al 2016 in this regard the reviewed papers vary considerably in terms of research strategies to consider spatial and temporal dynamics although hydrobiology and water quality studies took approximately the same approach in considering these dimensions the typical method for consideration of spatial variation was to take water and plankton samples at different locations in the lakes and determine the presence of statistically significant variation in the characteristics of the samples kibret and harrison 1989 tamire and mengistou 2013 teklu et al 2018 the results were however less informative on the spatial variation of the variables at different parts of the lake since the geographical location was rarely considered in the data analysis process this approach is also not purely experimental and the results might be subject to methodological biases since they were drawn from observations where the researcher had no mechanism to control all the dependent and independent variables for temporal change the research tradition has been to take samples at the same location at different times typically to reveal seasonal dynamics rather than tracing long term changes gebre mariam 2002 kebede and belay 1994 which remains a critical research gap both in the study of hydrobiology and water quality the absence of routine water quality and aquatic organism monitoring mechanisms in and around the lakes makes it a challenge to conduct space time analyses the typical spatial dimension considered by the hydrogeological studies consisted of taking groundwater samples at different parts of the basin and analyzing them to look for corresponding similarities in their hydrochemical characteristics the results have been used to define a hypothetical boundary for groundwater flow direction in a basin there has also been a strong tendency to represent the spatial variation of geomorphological characteristics using geospatial data sources and spatially explicit data analysis approaches le turdu et al 1999 studies which considered the temporal dimension have attempted to reveal groundwater flow dynamics by comparing radiocarbon and isotope characteristics of groundwater samples taken from recharge and destination areas of a basin e g bretzler et al 2011 in hydrogeological studies the greatest attention has been directed only to tracing the direction of groundwater flow with little focus on the estimation of groundwater volume and flow dynamics in specific geographical areas ayenew et al 2009 paleohydrological studies generally used the same strategy both in data collection and geospatial data analysis as the hydrogeological studies when considering the spatial dimension the only difference was the sample type with the former using paleoenvironmental samples instead of groundwater the result being used to analyze the spatial and temporal variation of sediment deposition rates in different parts of the studied basin benvenuti et al 2002 sagri et al 2008 the temporal dimension was addressed through estimation of sediment and water ages using carbon radiogenic stable isotope geochemistry and diatom stratigraphy techniques benvenuti et al 2013 telford et al 1999 on the other hand there were many studies which focused only on the temporal dimension relying on environmental samples from a single location or using non spatially explicit methods of data analysis in representing their result legesse et al 2002 among the research themes lake water storage studies consider the spatiotemporal dimension more frequentely than other themes the studies in this category used long term hydroclimate records for estimation of important hydrological variables ayenew 2004 vallet coulomb et al 2001 which made the majority of them consider the temporal dimension the spatial dimension was addressed through estimation of areal average climate variables deriving catchment biophysical variables ayenew 2003 getnet et al 2014 and estimation of lake morphometric variables awulachew 2006b aynew 2002 typically using a geospatial data analysis approach despite the increasing attempts to consider spatial and temporal variabilities long term lake water volume estimations still rely on point based water level records this however could affect the accurate estimation of water volume because of water level variations that result from lake morphometric changes due to sediment erosion and deposition håkanson 1982 the use of 3d based lake bathymetry datasets and spatially distributed hydrological models would overcome this problem but these methods are rarely used for water volume dynamics estimation most likely due to their large data requirements duan and bastiaanssen 2013 studies in the catchment biophysical analysis category used a similar approach to lake water storage studies in measuring spatial and temporal variations temesgen et al 2013 despite this most studies failed to present empirical evidence about the magnitude of change of many catchments biophysical variables specifically hydroclimate variables this may be because the data interpretation phase of many studies ended at a descriptive analysis stage mainly presenting long term average results without proving if statistically significant change had happened throughout their study period in addition many of the climate change studies irrespective of their use of different approaches failed to trace fine detail temporal and spatial changes as they relied on climate data from sparse weather observation networks despite this challenge recent advances in geospatial technologies and remote sensing based weather variable estimation methods are creating an opportunity for increased use of physical based climate change models however the spatial and temporal details are still very coarse when compared to the heterogeneity of many factors affecting climate variables 4 4 studies on the different lake ecosystem components the lake ecosystem is one that is intimately coupled with the land surrounding it in its drainage area thus considering the drainage basin as a unit and as a basic component in the functioning of lakes is an important research approach to address these complex relationships wetzel 2001 with the exception of the lake water storage research theme where the majority of studies included basin area as a spatial unit of study most studies failed to adopt this integration as they were conducted on only one of the two components of a lake ecosystem either the aquatic or terrestrial parts or considered them as separate entities in their data analysis this is one of the notable research gaps of the previous studies as it limits understanding of the functional relationship between aquatic and terrestrial parts of lake ecosystems as well as not identifying the root causes of lake water dynamics the issue is evident in water quality and hydrological studies where insufficient attention was given to studying the effects of catchment biophysical dynamics on water quality and aquatic ecosystems 4 5 frequency of studies in different lakes the analysis of the number of studies per lake indicates that the greatest focus was given to the rift valley lakes and lake tana with the total number of lakes studied being 27 the total number of lakes in the country has however been estimated to be more than 70 which indicates that many of them have been left unexplored by the scientific community some examples of lakes missed in the assembled studies include a series of lakes in the afar triangle region such as lakes beda liddo debado yardi and afambo and lakes in the southwest of ethiopia such as lakes mago gesi wagaan chomen and granger the most frequently investigated lakes ziway and hawasa are those with relatively higher levels of economic significance in terms of lake water usability as they are less alkaline than the others the least studied variable for most of the lakes was related to catchment biophysical conditions indicating lack of emphasis on basin based studies as well as a pattern of overlooking causal variables 4 6 synthesis of results and implication to research gaps a synthesis of previous studies findings suggests that much of the existing literature is focused on the understanding of prevailing hydrological conditions and ongoing temporal trends with less emphasis on quantifying the effect of different causal factors on the hydrological system there was clearly a consensus that the primary threats came more from anthropogenic than from natural factors in all the studies however quantitative evidence about the contribution of each factor to observed hydrological changes was lacking most of the causal claims were based on inference from previous literature and qualitative analysis of perceived causal factors ayenew 2004 ayenew and becht 2008 this makes it difficult to prioritize the different factors of change based on their effect on lake hydrology on the other hand it was found that the results of the studies specifically those which claimed the prevalence of a stable hydrological state for some lakes were not in line with the most widely held views of current lake hydrological conditions the public perception is that ecosystem degradation has reached its worst ever levels however many studies did not show how bad these impacts are and some others even claimed that the lakes are resilient rather than being degraded one of the reasons could be that the severe ecosystem degradation is a relatively recent phenomenon whereas the studies were done over the last 30 years or more the other reason could be the coarseness in the temporal and spatial scale of measurements commonly employed to detect ongoing hydrological changes which might have left undetected micro scale changes and their accumulated impacts a case in point is the use of medium and coarse resolution remote sensing products to detect catchment biophysical changes and lake morphometric dynamics yet little is known about whether changes are really occurring at these resolutions likewise there is doubt as to whether methods used to detect siltation and runoff impacts are sensitive enough to detect micro level changes some of the approaches are not spatially explicit at all while in others where the spatial dimension is considered the data models were developed at a catchment level whereas actual changes happen at a farm plot level which may be less than a hectare in size aga et al 2018 gadissa et al 2018 legesse et al 2010 thus current change detection methods may only be able to detect changes once the magnitude of the change has become large in size and reached an irreversible stage we therefore believe that an important scientific endeavor in the discipline of hydrology might be the development of research methods that can detect micro scale environmental and hydrological changes 5 conclusion in this study making use of a systematic literature review we have examined research trends listed major achievements and identified evidence based research gaps we found 231 scientific articles about the freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in peer reviewed journals between 1930 and march 2021 scientific achievements and research gaps vary considerably depending on the research theme the highest number of studies was found in lake water storage and hydrobiology research themes and the least in paleohydrology in the water quality and hydrobiology themes the research was almost entirely limited to studying only two variables namely lake hydrochemistry and aquatic organisms other important variables such as lake morphometry dynamics climate change were barely considered in the lake water storage analysis research theme the sharpest focus was on estimation of water balance with less attention to morphometric characteristics of the lakes our assessment of spatial and temporal variability indicated that many studies considered only one of the two dimensions or focused on the attributes of the phenomenon rather than its variability in terms of study area coverage the number of studies of smaller highland lakes was very limited which makes them the least known aquatic ecosystems in the country methodologically the method of information acquisition for some variables was less diverse as well as far behind contemporary hydrological research methods e g for aquatic organism and lake water hydrochemical characteristics based on these and other results we have identified major research gaps which should be prioritized in future endeavors the results reported here provide useful preliminary information that can guide the formulation of future research activities on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia further recommended review work includes a critical assessment of the findings of previous studies based on the major research themes this would add detail to the findings of the current study and reveal more explicit information about the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia a further recommendation is to make a comparison of the results of previous studies to trace historical trends in lake ecosystems based on the chronology of studies a detailed review of the hydrological models used in these studies and their compatibility with the context of the freshwater lakes of ethiopia is another research topic we identified credit authorship contribution statement yonas getaneh

7831,study region the study covers the freshwater lakes of ethiopia which constitute about 87 billion cubic meters of water volume the lakes are facing continued ecosystem degradation threats study focus the aim of this study was to make an inventory of existing literature regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia and identify gaps and priorities for future research directions this was done through a systematic review of published scientific literature related to the lakes and characterizing each study based on different criteria new hydrological insights for the region we found a total of 231 articles on freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in peer reviewed journals between 1930 and march 2021 most studies were focused on hydrochemical and biological characteristics of lakes with less attention to physical structure and processes including siltation lake morphometry and catchment biophysical characteristics furthermore a less attention was given to the spatial and temporal dynamics of variables that affect the freshwater lakes b there was limited linkage between landscape hydrological dynamics and freshwater lakes and c the smaller highland lakes were given limited attention future research should be oriented to the study of the relationship between catchment biophysical dynamics and lake hydrological characteristics graphical abstract ga1 keywords systematic literature review freshwater ethiopia lake hydrological dynamics hydrologic modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction different geological formations and climatic conditions have endowed ethiopia with vast water resources and wetland ecosystems including 12 river basins eight major lakes and floodplains and several man made reservoirs with a total annual surface runoff of about 122 billion cubic meters bcm awulachew et al 2007 there is a diversity of information published about the lake resources of ethiopia including their number hillman 1993 listed 77 lakes in the then geographical boundary of ethiopia including eritrea a study by leykun 2003 based on secondary sources estimated the number of lakes in the country to reach 70 but a report by awulachew et al 2007 estimated the number of lakes in the country to be only 20 30 another study by messager et al 2016 identified about 240 sites as freshwater lakes in ethiopia using a geostatistical and remote sensing approach a compilation of results from bathymetry survey reports of the larger lakes seven of the rift valley lakes plus lakes tana haike hardibo and bishoftu revealed that they contain about 87 bcm of water in a more comprehensive study by messager et al 2016 the water in all the open water bodies of the country is estimated to be more than 335 bcm many of these lakes are recognized for their outstanding biological diversity and societal significance belete et al 2015 however the lakes are facing substantial threats due to natural and anthropogenic factors such as increased water abstraction and intensified pollution sources population in the lake basins is high and continually growing due to the recent increase in large scale irrigation which depends on water resources in the lakes and the rivers flowing to them seyoum et al 2015 such water use competition between irrigation industrial and domestic uses contributes to complexity in the sustainable management of freshwater resources in ethiopia moreover climate change exacerbates the situation and induces water balance anomalies in many hydrological systems getnet et al 2014 the threat is highly pronounced in the rift valley lakes comprising a chain of nine lakes from north to south ziway abiyata langano shala hawasa abaya beseka chamo and chew bahir occupying the southern part of the ethiopian rift valley basin lakes in the highland parts of the country also face water level reduction belete et al 2015 water volume reduction aynew 2002 surface area shrinkage ayenew 2004 increasing levels of sediment deposition gadissa et al 2018 reduced runoff inputs to the lakes and increased evaporation losses getnet et al 2014 many studies have generated information on different aspects of freshwater resources in ethiopia using various in situ observation remote sensing empirical and modeling approaches despite this and also the fact that both the highlands and the rift valley lakes of ethiopia attract national and international scientific attention due to their ecological and ecosystem significance systematically organized and synthesized information on the country s freshwater lakes is limited thus a systematic review of existing scientific studies on ethiopian freshwater lakes is an important endeavor in organizing a body of knowledge on the overall lake water resources of the country such a review can contribute to the building of a database and development of data driven and knowledge based lake catchment management plans for the sustainable utilization of freshwater resources the aim of this study therefore was to make an inventory of existing literature regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia systematically synthesize the available knowledge and pinpoint gaps to be prioritized by future research the specific objectives were to 1 examine the temporal pattern of scientific studies of freshwater lakes in ethiopia 2 analyze the major research themes covered by previous studies and thus the gaps in freshwater lake research 3 analyze methods used by studies to extract hydrological information from freshwater lakes of ethiopia and 4 synthesize the findings of previous studies about the hydrological status of the lakes the outputs of this study provide a database about the freshwater lakes identify research gaps and suggest future research directions 2 methods 2 1 study area ethiopia is situated in the horn of africa between 3 4 n and 14 9 n and 33 0 e and 48 0 e with an area of 1 104 300 km2 it is characterized by a wide variety of landscapes and landforms which results from a complex geological process with alternating phases of orogenesis peneplanation crustal updoming faulting emplacement of huge amounts of lava and deep fluvial dissection abbate et al 2015 this has created the great rift valley of east africa of which ethiopia contains a major part and the huge land masses along its escarpments fig 1 this varied topography in turn produces a complex climate system ranging from semi arid in the lowlands to humid and warm temperate in the southwest highlands fazzini et al 2015 another result of the topography is the prevalence of complex hydrological systems with distinct basin characteristics between the lowlands and the highlands abbate et al 2015 the highlands found in the northwestern and the southeastern parts of the rift valley are the source of eight large river basins which radiate towards the surrounding lowlands with the exception of the rift valley lake basins and the afar depression the drainage basins of the lowlands are to a great extent subject to the hydrology of the river basins descending from the highlands a rough estimation of the surface water potentials of all these drainage basins is about 124 4 bcm about 97 of which flows towards neighboring countries billi et al 2015 freshwater lakes make up the principal part of these hydrological resources and are large in number exceeding 70 and vary considerably in their size and location some of them e g lakes hayk and hashenge form part of the large river basins others those in the rift valley are marked by their own closed drainage basins and lake tana makes up a principal part of the nile basin fig 1 these lakes together with their associated drainage basins are fundamental parts of the structure and welfare of societies and natural ecosystems in the study of hughes 1992 the wetlands and lakes of ethiopia were divided into ten major groups with each group constituting the lakes and the nearby wetlands these included lake tana the hashenge and hayk lakes lakes of the bale mountains lakes of bishoftu lakes of the southwest rift valley lakes of the awash river system lakes of the afar depression and artificial impoundments and micro dams in this study we have covered all the relevant scientific articles associated with these lakes 2 2 literature search and selection criteria the literature search process was conducted by targeting all scientific articles about the freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in the english language in peer reviewed journals and available in the following online databases google scholar web of science science direct proques springer link and wiley online we developed our search strategy in two different ways the first being to find articles based on their study area and the second based on thematic relevance to address the first strategy we initially listed the names and geographical locations of lakes from literature awulachew et al 2007 leykun 2003 messager et al 2016 schagerl 2016 some lakes were given different names in different studies and we tried to list all alternative names for each lake we then searched scientific articles using the identified lake names as a key word the second strategy was to find studies based on a search item relevant to lake hydrological characteristics the combinations of words used were lakes and ethiopia and water volume or water quality or hydrology or water balance or climate change or limnology or hydrogeology or hydrobiology or aquatic ecosystem or ground water or human impact or siltation or climate change or hydrochemical or physicochemical or phytoplankton or zooplankton or evapotranspiration or river inflow or fauna or flora or watershed or catchment or basin or water resource or irrigation the last search was conducted on 21 march 2021 this produced a total of 696 papers we then refined the search results based on inclusion criteria fig 2 to only include studies that 1 included self produced data at least in one variable 2 were conducted in at least one of the lakes of ethiopia or their catchments 3 considered the effect of catchment behavior on at least one lake hydrological variable 4 were based on empirical observation of samples of organic and inorganic elements from the lakes in relation to lake hydrological characteristics and 5 were published in peer reviewed journals in total 231 articles met the inclusion criteria and were then further categorized and analyzed for the systematic review 2 3 data compilation and classification a tabular template was prepared to record the metadata extracted from the respective publications these metadata were reviewed and their characteristics assessed based on selected parameters such as the specific hydrological variables measured the list of studied lakes the spatial scale of the study the observed analytical dimension temporal spatial a combination of these or none the study methods used and the research theme topic the first step started with article registration and metadata organization an article which passed the selection criteria was imported to mendeley reference manager software it was then registered with a unique identification number in the ms excel based metadata template relevant information e g topic author year of publication was then registered in consecutive columns secondly the variables of hydrological interest that were measured estimated quantified or analyzed quantitatively using first hand data i e measured data or secondary data that were compiled by the researcher during the research process were extracted and labeled as either effect or causal variables based on how they were considered in the study the effect variables were those subjected to the influence of one or more independent variables while the causal variables were those exerting some influence on another dependent variable studies which considered only one of the two variable types were considered as descriptive next the co occurrence frequencies of specific effect and causal variables were enumerated to examine the degree to which a pair of variables had been studied or which variable pairs are missing in literature future research activity is recommended to focus on variables where low co occurrence frequency is recorded as little attention has so far been given to the causal associations of these variables thirdly the lakes that were studied in each of the articles were listed and the result was used to analyze the number of times each lake appeared in all the studies the lake names were further cross referenced with a list of variables in the articles which was used to determine the number of times that a variable was studied for a specific lake the assumption here was that lower frequency values would suggest increasing probabilities of research gaps and vice versa in the fourth step the spatial units studied in each article were identified as terrestrial aquatic or aquatic terrestrial based on the data collection site and the characteristics of the variables measured aquatic studies are those conducted on data from the lake ecosystem s aquatic part only with no variables representing the terrestrial parts terrestrial studies are those which were conducted with data from the drainage areas that contribute water to the lake with no variables measured from the aquatic part aquatic terrestrial studies are those conducted using data from both the lake and its drainage area or those which consider both components as aggregated units the result was used to evaluate if the relationship between terrestrial and aquatic parts of a lake ecosystem has been well addressed fifthly the studies were categorized into four major groups based on whether the studies considered temporal spatial spatiotemporal analytical dimensions or did not consider any analytical dimensions at all the latter studies are those that did not present any spatial and temporal variation in variables of interest instead they presented information in spatially aggregated form or at a specific location and at an instant time lastly the methods employed to extract information about the characteristics of each variable were listed and used to quantify the frequency of each method per variable for all the reviewed articles which helped in evaluating the pattern of hydrological research methods used in the studies once registration of the major characteristics was completed the studies were grouped into six exclusive categories with each category characterized by a similar research thematic area namely catchment biophysical analysis hydrobiology hydrogeology lake water storage analysis paleohydrology and water quality analysis the criteria for categorization were the topic abstract list of variables spatial unit studied and temporal scope of the study the process started with a preliminary evaluation of the articles to derive a possible list of research themes by which the articles could be grouped the resulting list of more than ten research themes was then refined to six categories based on similarities between the themes each article was then assigned to one of the six categories based on the characterization criteria the categorization process was conducted based on a sequence of steps illustrated in fig 2 it starts with assigning an article to one of the research themes based on its topic and abstract relevance however if the topic and abstract information implied multiple themes the article continued to be evaluated through four consecutive evaluation steps until it was possible to assign it to one of the appropriate research themes a detailed description of each criterion can be found in appendix i 2 4 synthesis of findings on the hydrological status of major lakes to present synthesized hydrological information on the lakes the papers were further screened for information on the hydrological status of some major lakes based on the following selection criteria 1 studies conducted on one of the ethiopian rift valley lakes or lake tana 2 studies presenting original research not review of the temporal dynamics of one or more lake water storage variables such as water balance water volume storage water level dynamics lake surface area size and lake siltation rate and 3 studies addressing the causes of the changes in a specific variable based on the water balance closure and water volume conditions the lakes are characterized into static stable water balance closure and water volume and relatively small anthropogenic intervention in their catchments resilient positive and stable water balance closure and water volume even with intensive anthropogenic intervention in their catchments and declining reduction of water volume and a negative water balance closure term 3 results 3 1 historical trend of scientific publications on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia the earliest publication on ethiopian freshwater lakes was in 1930 fig 3 while the number of studies per year tended to increase through time at different rates the publication pattern until the 1990s was very intermittent for most of the research themes with the gap between consecutive publications exceeding two decades specifically between 1940 and 1960 even though the gap was narrowed in the following decades in the 1970s and 1980s the total number of publications per year remained lower than five until 2000 rose to more than six between 2001 and 2003 and then reached 23 between 2018 and 2020 fig 3 3 2 major research themes in freshwater lake studies in ethiopia a comparison of studies among different research themes shows that lake water storage analysis with 65 articles was the most frequently studied fig 3 in terms of historical trends the earliest publication found on this theme was the bathymetry study of lake bishoftu by prosser et al 1968 followed by a bathymetry survey report on lakes chamo and abaya by awulachew 1999 the most frequently investigated effect variable in this theme was water balance 49 hereafter the number in parentheses refers to the number of studies as influenced by climate 22 anthropogenic factors 8 and land cover change 5 fig 4 lake water volume was the second most frequently studied variable 39 of which 17 were investigated as a function of climate and eight as affected by anthropogenic variables lake morphometric variables were covered by 15 studies of which four were investigated in relation to climate and three to land cover change siltation was the other effect variable studied under this theme particularly in relation to catchment soil characteristics 7 in the co occurrence analysis we found a considerable number of purely descriptive studies that did not report any causal variables particularly for water balance 13 and water volume 11 studies in terms of analytical dimensions the majority of the studies of lake water storage 62 considered the spatiotemporal dynamics of water storage characteristics fig 5a the remaining 25 and 12 considered the temporal and spatial dimensions respectively most of the studies 62 took the aquatic and terrestrial parts of the lake system as the spatial unit of study while the remaining studies focused only on the aquatic parts fig 5b the second highest number of studies was found in the hydrobiology research theme 50 with a focus on the study of aquatic organisms in relation to the environmental factors affecting them the earliest publication located was the study of omer cooper 1930 which is the expedition report by a british scientist in which he introduced the freshwater fauna of ethiopia to the international scientific community subsequent publications were in 1969 urban 1969 and 1973 talling et al 1973 with a gap until 1982 goll 1982 since when publication has continued with only a short time interval between studies fig 3 the variable co occurrence is restricted largely to that between aquatic organisms and hydrochemical characteristics 34 with a very limited appearance of the other causal variables which have been shown to have a significant effect on aquatic organisms in other international studies yang et al 2013 an example is the relationship between aquatic organisms and many catchment biophysical variables such as land cover climate change anthropogenic activity and soil characteristics joniak et al 2017 szpakowska et al 2022 tahiru et al 2020 similarly the influence of lake morphometric characteristics on the behavior of aquatic ecosystems is also poorly addressed haas et al 2010 stefanidis and papastergiadou 2012 the majority of the studies 38 were only spatially aggregated and related to a specific point in time rather than examining spatial and temporal dynamics the spatial coverage of almost all studies was limited to the aquatic parts of the lake ecosystem with little or no attention to the terrestrial parts fig 5b catchment biophysical analysis ranked third in terms of study frequency the focus of studies in this theme was on catchment biophysical variables such as land cover topography soil anthropogenic factors and their impact on hydrological characteristics the number of studies found was 38 with the earliest publication in 1935 cheesman 1935 giving a historical record of lake tana and its environment this study might be significant as a historical document of basin environments but is less relevant in terms of the actual hydrological behavior of the basin a substantial increase in publications on biophysical characterization of lakes and basins was observed since 2005 in terms of variable frequency most studies were conducted to assess land and water resource utilization patterns with the majority of them being descriptive studies 15 conducted without any use of explanatory variables the causality studies are focused on climate change impacts on water balance 7 and anthropogenic effects on land cover change 6 fig 4 the majority of studies 64 considered the spatiotemporal dimension with most of the rest being simply attribute studies fig 5b the spatial scope of most studies 78 was limited to the terrestrial parts of the lake ecosystems lake water quality was the fourth most frequently studied research theme 31 the main concern of these studies was the measurement and analysis of the hydrochemical characteristics of the surface and underground waters found within the lake basins the earliest publication date was 1965 with two publications both of which were about a chemical study of african lakes including the rift valley lakes of ethiopia baxter et al 1965 talling and talling 1965 in following years publication was neither sustained continuously nor interrupted totally but continued to appear on a five year average interval baumann et al 1975 baxter et al 1973 a sustained trend of publication started only in 2004 from when there is a minimum of one publication every other year fig 3 in terms of the variables examined they are characterized by the predominant use of hydrochemical characteristics as the effect variable with only anthropogenic factors as causal variables to explain the water quality dynamics many studies 15 in this research theme are also descriptive focused only on presenting water quality characteristics without reference to the causal factors affecting water quality fig 4 some 33 and 24 of these studies considered the spatial and the spatiotemporal dimensions respectively while most of the remaining studies exceeding 26 did not consider any aspects of variability in terms of spatial coverage the majority of the studies 57 looked at the aquatic parts of the lake ecosystems with 43 considering both the aquatic and terrestrial parts fig 5b the hydrogeology studies focused on groundwater characterization and geological evolution analysis of the lake basins we found 28 studies with the first publication in 1972 searle and gouin 1972 although this was not directly relevant to the hydrological features of the lakes but gave some accounts of the geological characteristics of the basins related to their gravity profile however more regular publication did not start until the study of darling et al 1996 which gives the earliest account of groundwater interactions between the lakes and their catchments in terms of variable frequency studies in this category tended to focus on the groundwater flux flow direction and volume estimation and its hydrochemical characteristics with the frequent use of hydro geomorphological factors as explanatory variables the focus was only limited to these three variables with a limited co occurrence frequency of other important variables which might have an influence on groundwater characteristics fig 4 some 58 of studies considered the spatial dimensions of the hydrogeological variables fig 5a in terms of spatial scope 42 of studies were conducted on the terrestrial parts 32 on the aquatic terrestrial parts and 26 on the aquatic parts fig 5b paleohydrology studies were the least frequently addressed research theme 19 these focused on tracing the evolution of water and material movement in the lake basins on a geological time scale the earliest publication was in 1940 nilsson 1940 which can be considered as a pioneering study of the lake basin evolution process of the rift valley lakes and lake tana and was a paleolimnological account of past climate change at a regional scale subsequent publications were in 1971 grove and goudie 1971 and 1975 grove et al 1975 with a trend of more frequent publication starting only in 1990 fig 3 the commonly used effect variables have included lake water volume 12 water balance 8 and hydrochemical variables 5 all of which were assessed as a function of climate variables in addition to climate variables tectonic factors were employed as causal variables mainly to assess the hydro geomorphological process fig 4 most of the paleohydrological research was conducted by considering only the temporal dimension 58 the remainder covering both the spatial and temporal dimensions fig 5a the target of most studies was the aquatic parts of the lake system 67 with only 23 of studies considering both the aquatic and terrestrial parts in their spatial coverage fig 5b 3 3 number and type of study lake from the total of 70 lakes included in the literature search process using their names as a keyword we found scientific studies on only 27 of them fig 6 the most studied lakes were lakes ziway and hawasa with 77 and 50 studies respectively the next most referenced was lake tana with 47 studies followed by lakes abiyata 41 shalla 36 langano 34 abaya 28 and chamo 22 there were also several studies on the smaller lakes including five of the bishoftu crater lakes 22 hayk 10 and ardibo 2 the number of studies for these and many other lakes are not displayed in fig 6 instead they were merged and reported as other smaller lakes osl fig 7 since they are too numerous to mention individually there were also many regional studies which provide essential hydrological information for entire basins typically for the central rift valley lakes basin region crlb without explicitly attributing their results to a specific lake grove et al 1975 wagesho et al 2012 analysis of the articles by lake and variable revealed two different patterns for lake tana and for the rift valley lakes for lake tana most studies were associated with climate and water balance aspects with the fewest investigating hydro geomorphology and lake morphometry variables in the rift valley lakes on the other hand most studies looked at hydrochemical water balance anthropogenic activity and climate variables followed by aquatic organisms and lake water volume variables the least frequently addressed topics included siltation catchment soil characteristics lake morphometry and groundwater flux fig 7 there was also a substantial variation in study numbers per variable between the different rift valley lakes with most records relating to three of them ziway abiyata and hawasa and with decreasing numbers towards the southern rift valley lakes such as abaya and chamo fig 7 3 4 hydrological information estimation methods used in freshwater lake studies the hydrological information estimation methods differed depending on the variable types fig 8 physical modeling numerical modeling analytical water sampling analysis and confirmatory statistical analysis constituted the most common hydrological information estimation methods modeling constituted the most frequently used method predominantly physical modeling followed by numerical modeling one of the most frequent application areas of modeling was to estimate information about water balance components numerical modeling was typically based on the use of time series hydroclimate records of nearby meteorological stations while the physical modeling technique derived the required parameters after representing the variables of interest in a geospatial database alemu et al 2020 both modeling methods were also common in the study of lake water volume dynamics through estimating lake water volume from time series lake level records lumped water budget equations for numerical models and lake bathymetry datasets for physical models the other common application areas of modeling were related to siltation and catchment soil erosion volume estimation more specifically physical modeling approaches were used to quantify the average sediment load of studied lakes and to estimate lake bottom sediment volumes through bathymetry differentiation methods the most frequent use of physical models 109 studies might indicate increasing attempts to consider spatial and temporal dimensions while measuring hydrological dynamics many of the physical and numerical models used by the reviewed studies were however universal in nature and employed without prior understanding of their compatibility with the context of the study area the use of infrequent both spatially and temporally observation data for calibration of model simulation was another critical problem observed in water balance studies the approach used to study climate variability differed depending on the temporal scale of the studies most studies concerned with the last few hundred years of climate change were conducted through time series analysis of climate data and physical modeling approaches the former is used to trace climate change through confirmatory statistical analysis of meteorological data while the latter identifies past and future changes based on different downscaled regional and global climate models the other method used in the climate change studies was paleolimnological climate analysis which was mainly employed to trace climate change on a geological time scale e g legesse et al 2002 telford et al 1999 it determined the chronology e g lamb et al 2007 accumulation rate e g sagri et al 2008 and lithological characteristics of sediments on a millennium scale time frame and associated the result with climate change observations lamb 2002 many studies about the surface and subsurface water physicochemical characteristics were conducted using analytical water sampling techniques teklu et al 2018 there were also some water quality studies conducted through mineralogical analysis of sediments in which the physicochemical characteristics of sample sediments from the lake were used as the main indicators of pollution from the catchments moges et al 2017 a few others concerned with tracing geological time scale change in the physicochemical characteristics of lake waters used an isotope based water age determination system wagner et al 2018 aquatic life studies of the lakes have mostly used a confirmatory data analysis system through making empirical observations of the interaction between the aquatic organisms characteristics and water characteristics the observations were then analyzed using inferential statistics hypothesis testing producing estimates regression analysis to verify the effect of lake water hydrological characteristics on the behavior of aquatic organisms fetahi et al 2011 lemma 2009 wood and talling 1988 confirmatory data analysis was also applied to study anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems to verify whether different anthropogenic interventions both in the catchment and the lakes and socio economic changes have had any significant impacts on lake hydrology typical examples are estimation of water abstraction impacts on lake water volume by lake water storage studies and tracing anthropogenic sources of water pollution from nearby catchments with very few exceptions e g yohannes et al 2013 many studies indicated potential impacts of certain anthropogenic interventions on lake ecosystems without explicitly stating the magnitude of such influences this is partly a reflection that most studies aimed to infer the impact of terrestrial basin areas on the aquatic system without considering both the aquatic and terrestrial components in their spatial scope this was typically exhibited in water quality and hydrobiology research where the spatial scope of most studies was restricted only to the aquatic parts of the lakes the problem was also apparent in catchment biophysical studies in which the likelihood of land cover change and land management impacts on lake hydrology were inferred from literature with no empirically observed data elias et al 2019 lemma 2003 meshesha et al 2012 the study of groundwater dynamics was mainly based on isotopic analysis geophysical analysis and ground water modeling approaches the isotope analysis approach compared the isotope composition of different water sources that contribute to the groundwater system of the basins legesse et al 2002 revealing any subsurface hydraulic links and the contribution of different water balance components to recharging or depleting the groundwater of the basin the geophysical analysis approach on the other hand was used to identify subsurface hydraulic links and groundwater flow volumes through direct measurement of groundwater flux ayenew et al 2009 molin and corti 2015 many of these studies were subjected to the problem of limited hydrologic data from poor observation networks and repetitive use of similar hydrologic parameters while estimating many variables a geospatial data analysis approach was typically employed to derive lake morphometric and catchment land cover variables it was based on the representation of lake bathymetry data in a geospatial database and then deriving the required parameters with the 3d analytical capacities of spatial analysis software in the case of catchment land cover studies geospatial approaches were used to derive multi temporal land cover information from remote sensing observations 3 5 synthesis of findings on the hydrological status of major freshwater lakes of ethiopia in table 1 we present synthesized findings related to selected lake water volume variables with a specific focus on the major rift valley lakes and lake tana the static lakes are shalla ayenew 2004 and langano alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2004 belete et al 2015 getnet et al 2014 seyoum et al 2015 which are characterized by positive water balance closure terms and a stable water volume condition with a relatively small anthropogenic intervention in their catchments the resilient lakes are abiyata chamo hawasa and tana which maintain a positive water balance closure term and a relatively stable water volume even though they are subject to intensive anthropogenic intervention and climate change factors some examples of these interventions are massive sediment load from upland watersheds abebe et al 2018 awulachew 2006a lemma 2009 new settlement and conversion of forest to agricultural land abebe et al 2018 awulachew 2006a ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 wondie 2018 and water diversions that decrease water flows into the lakes awulachew 2006a dile et al 2016 the reason the lakes can maintain a positive water balance closure term with the presence of such intensive anthropogenic intervention is however poorly documented in many studies an exception to this is lake hawasa where neo tectonism ayenew and becht 2008 ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 and climate factors ayenew and gebreegziabher 2006 belete et al 2017 explain why its water volume remained unchanged over time the declining lakes are abiyata and ziway which were characterized by a reduction of water volume and a negative water balance closure term in many of the studies the causes of the change are associated with high water abstraction and climate factors table 1 the underlying threat emanates from diversion of lake ziway s inflowing rivers for irrigation in the upper catchment which consequently reduces the volume of water flowing into the lake and eventually the water volume of the lake itself aynew 2002 meshesha et al 2012 seyoum et al 2015 the lowered water volume in lake ziway in turn brought about a reduction in the outflowing river volume that inflows towards lake abiyata belete et al 2015 seyoum et al 2015 which is thus one of the main causes of abiyata s water volume reduction water abstraction from lake abiyata for soda ash production is an added factor aynew 2002 legesse et al 2004 although it is not clearly defined which of the two factors has the greater impact on the other hand increasing evaporation due to prolonged dry periods has been reported as a common factor aggravating the reduction of water volumes of both lakes asfaw et al 2020 desta and lemma 2017 seyoum et al 2015 4 discussion 4 1 historical trend of publication records scientific inquiry and acquisition of information regarding the freshwater lakes of ethiopia date back to the beginning of the 20th century with a notable contribution from colonial expeditions and personal accounts of travelers the earliest available scientific records were from hugh scott s expedition to the then abyssinia omer cooper 1930 which presented quantitative information about selected hydrochemical characteristics of lakes of the rift valley region the detailed results of his investigation published as a series of papers in consecutive study years presented the earliest known scientific records of the freshwater fauna of ethiopia the other study of significant historical importance is that of nilsson 1940 which presented a comprehensive scientific account of the geological evolution of the lakes of the central rift valley region and lake tana with a qualitative description of their basin environments we then found hardly any published articles in the following years until 1965 talling and talling 1965 the year 1965 could be considered the beginning of a new era in the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia in terms of sustained publication the institutionalization of research activities and the widening of research themes this period marked the introduction of higher education and the establishment of research institutions in the country making possible the development of longer lasting research activities than the colonial expedition and travel account based research traditions the average number of research publications per year was still less than two but it continued without interruption with a gradually increasing volume with the exception of lake water storage studies publications started to emerge in all the other research themes the initial themes of this period the post 1965 era were water quality talling and talling 1965 and hydrobiology urban 1969 followed by paleohydrology grove and goudie 1971 and hydrogeological studies searle and gouin 1972 the number of lakes studied and the diversity of research approaches used also increased ranging from descriptive study to confirmatory analysis of water quality impacts on aquatic organisms baxter et al 1973 talling et al 1973 talling and talling 1965 however there exists an interruption in the publication record between 1974 and 1984 a period that coincided with a time of political transition from the imperial regime to a socialist military power this was known for its political instability and economic stagnation where state attention was diverted towards security and political issues mengistie 2021 which might account for the reduced number of publications during this time most significantly the country s political alignment was directed towards the then soviet bloc and its relations with the west were severely strained markakis 1981 this might have halted the involvement in the scientific endeavors of western scholars who contributed the most during the previous decades in the last 25 years the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia has advanced in more ways than ever before in terms of thematic area the number of lakes studied and the number of research studies published per year in this period the number of state owned universities grew which resulted in an increase in research involvement by domestic scholars it was also a time where strong institutional linkages were created between domestic and international research institutions the progress is also attributed to significant advances in hydrological research methods easier accessibility of hydrological data software and hardware advancements the explosion of geospatial technology and greater international linkage through internet and web based data sharing mechanisms this might also be the reason for the abrupt increase in the frequency of lake water storage studies after the 1990s awulachew 1999 in the lake water storage research theme the different morphometric characteristics of the lakes were determined abebe et al 2018 including lake areas depths volumes and overall bathymetry measurements the water balance state of most of the lakes was also estimated to a reasonable level of accuracy through a variety of numerical and physical water balance modeling approaches belete et al 2017 lake water quality levels and their usability for different human consumption purposes were also determined zinabu et al 2002 cause and effect relational analysis between catchment biophysical dynamics and lake hydrological dynamics has also started to be considered billi and caparrini 2006 understanding the long term hydrological dynamics of the lakes both qualitative and quantitative dynamics and their response to the changing trends of hydrological causal factors became the main research agenda of studies in recent decades awulachew 2006a legesse et al 2004 the historical record of publication on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia is evidence for the ongoing advancement of scientific research endeavors in the field of hydrology and lake ecosystem studies one of the observed trends is an increase in the number of variables addressed by the studies over time studies in the early period pre 1960 were limited to aquatic organism characterization and lake water physiochemical characteristics this was followed after the 1970s by lake water volume studies and water balance measurement with the causal factors affecting it variables dealing with catchment biophysical characteristics specifically land cover and climate change newly emerged after the 1990s methodological complexity also advanced with the increasing number of variables addressed by the studies in this regard articles in the early days were narrative qualitative studies based on personal observation this was followed by quantitative measurement of variables based on empirical observation of hydrological phenomena empirical observation based analysis then transformed to modeling hydrological phenomena using a variety of conceptual and hydrological models the current frontier is now causality analysis of multiple hydrological variables and simulation and prediction of hydrological phenomena 4 2 implications of variable co occurrence frequency and research methods our analysis shows that variable co occurrence frequency differs between the research categories in the lake water storage theme water balance and lake water volume analysis were largely examined in relation to land use change climate change and morphology with the majority of studies focused on climate change effects on water balance and lake water volume a potential research gap in the study of lake water volume is the impact of land cover and anthropogenic activity on lake water volume another potential research gap is in lake morphometric and siltation studies where there is a less frequent appearance of these variables with the majority of studies conducted without considering any causal factors affecting lake hydrology on the other hand in the hydrogeology research category much effort has been directed to the study of groundwater flux and mobilization of hydrochemical variables as a function of basin geomorphological characteristics other important factors that could have affected groundwater characteristics such as anthropogenic intervention climate change and land cover change were given less attention in paleoenvironmental research the focus was oriented to reconstruction of millennia scale hydrological histories of the basins but among the many environmental variables involved in the basin evolution process climate change was the only driving factor considered by the studies with very few exceptions the tradition of hydrobiology research was characterized by a single variable combination limited only to lake water hydrochemical variables and aquatic organism characteristics this was also an issue in the water quality studies where anthropogenic intervention was considered as the only source of water pollution in contrast the attention given to examining the effects of many hydrological variables such as lake morphometric characteristics lake water volume dynamics catchment biophysical changes including land cover and soil characteristics and climate change on water quality and aquatic organisms was very limited in catchment biophysical studies a research gap is indicated both in terms of the very low number of variables investigated compared to current studies in hydrological science and in the limited study of causality analysis most attention was given to situational analyses of prevailing land and water utilization patterns rather than causality analyses between different biophysical variables more specifically the impact of ongoing land cover vegetation socio economic and demographic changes on water balance and catchment erosion processes received little attention our observations about the frequency of studied variables and the way the variables were treated whether they are effect or causal variables might have implications for the state of current hydrological research beyond the specific case of hydrological research in ethiopia one of these implications relates to the repetitive use of specific cause and effect variables while conducting casualty analysis the most focused on cause and effect studies are legacy driven variables which were proved to have a well known causality relationship by the scientific literature and little attention has been given to new insights relationships and associations of variables an example is the tendency to focus only on water physico chemical characteristics while studying the factors affecting aquatic organism characteristics olkeba et al 2020 wood and talling 1988 there has been also a tendency to focus on the linear relationship of hydrological variables without considering the counter effect of a change in one variable on the other or validating if the association between variables could work in reverse order for instance there is a consideration of anthropogenic factors only as a causal variable with little attention given to the impact of hydrological factors on the anthropogenic ones desta et al 2017 getnet et al 2014 furthermore the meta analysis shows that most hydrological studies while conducting causality analysis on different hydrological variables have made limited efforts to establish new empirical relationships for example demographic changes have been put forward as evidence of anthropogenic impacts on lake ecosystems without providing measured evidence elias et al 2019 pascual ferrer et al 2014 teffera et al 2017 4 3 spatial and temporal variability measurement approaches hydrological phenomena and their causal factors change through time and space consideration of these dynamics in the research process is of fundamental importance to the reliability of a study zhang et al 2016 in this regard the reviewed papers vary considerably in terms of research strategies to consider spatial and temporal dynamics although hydrobiology and water quality studies took approximately the same approach in considering these dimensions the typical method for consideration of spatial variation was to take water and plankton samples at different locations in the lakes and determine the presence of statistically significant variation in the characteristics of the samples kibret and harrison 1989 tamire and mengistou 2013 teklu et al 2018 the results were however less informative on the spatial variation of the variables at different parts of the lake since the geographical location was rarely considered in the data analysis process this approach is also not purely experimental and the results might be subject to methodological biases since they were drawn from observations where the researcher had no mechanism to control all the dependent and independent variables for temporal change the research tradition has been to take samples at the same location at different times typically to reveal seasonal dynamics rather than tracing long term changes gebre mariam 2002 kebede and belay 1994 which remains a critical research gap both in the study of hydrobiology and water quality the absence of routine water quality and aquatic organism monitoring mechanisms in and around the lakes makes it a challenge to conduct space time analyses the typical spatial dimension considered by the hydrogeological studies consisted of taking groundwater samples at different parts of the basin and analyzing them to look for corresponding similarities in their hydrochemical characteristics the results have been used to define a hypothetical boundary for groundwater flow direction in a basin there has also been a strong tendency to represent the spatial variation of geomorphological characteristics using geospatial data sources and spatially explicit data analysis approaches le turdu et al 1999 studies which considered the temporal dimension have attempted to reveal groundwater flow dynamics by comparing radiocarbon and isotope characteristics of groundwater samples taken from recharge and destination areas of a basin e g bretzler et al 2011 in hydrogeological studies the greatest attention has been directed only to tracing the direction of groundwater flow with little focus on the estimation of groundwater volume and flow dynamics in specific geographical areas ayenew et al 2009 paleohydrological studies generally used the same strategy both in data collection and geospatial data analysis as the hydrogeological studies when considering the spatial dimension the only difference was the sample type with the former using paleoenvironmental samples instead of groundwater the result being used to analyze the spatial and temporal variation of sediment deposition rates in different parts of the studied basin benvenuti et al 2002 sagri et al 2008 the temporal dimension was addressed through estimation of sediment and water ages using carbon radiogenic stable isotope geochemistry and diatom stratigraphy techniques benvenuti et al 2013 telford et al 1999 on the other hand there were many studies which focused only on the temporal dimension relying on environmental samples from a single location or using non spatially explicit methods of data analysis in representing their result legesse et al 2002 among the research themes lake water storage studies consider the spatiotemporal dimension more frequentely than other themes the studies in this category used long term hydroclimate records for estimation of important hydrological variables ayenew 2004 vallet coulomb et al 2001 which made the majority of them consider the temporal dimension the spatial dimension was addressed through estimation of areal average climate variables deriving catchment biophysical variables ayenew 2003 getnet et al 2014 and estimation of lake morphometric variables awulachew 2006b aynew 2002 typically using a geospatial data analysis approach despite the increasing attempts to consider spatial and temporal variabilities long term lake water volume estimations still rely on point based water level records this however could affect the accurate estimation of water volume because of water level variations that result from lake morphometric changes due to sediment erosion and deposition håkanson 1982 the use of 3d based lake bathymetry datasets and spatially distributed hydrological models would overcome this problem but these methods are rarely used for water volume dynamics estimation most likely due to their large data requirements duan and bastiaanssen 2013 studies in the catchment biophysical analysis category used a similar approach to lake water storage studies in measuring spatial and temporal variations temesgen et al 2013 despite this most studies failed to present empirical evidence about the magnitude of change of many catchments biophysical variables specifically hydroclimate variables this may be because the data interpretation phase of many studies ended at a descriptive analysis stage mainly presenting long term average results without proving if statistically significant change had happened throughout their study period in addition many of the climate change studies irrespective of their use of different approaches failed to trace fine detail temporal and spatial changes as they relied on climate data from sparse weather observation networks despite this challenge recent advances in geospatial technologies and remote sensing based weather variable estimation methods are creating an opportunity for increased use of physical based climate change models however the spatial and temporal details are still very coarse when compared to the heterogeneity of many factors affecting climate variables 4 4 studies on the different lake ecosystem components the lake ecosystem is one that is intimately coupled with the land surrounding it in its drainage area thus considering the drainage basin as a unit and as a basic component in the functioning of lakes is an important research approach to address these complex relationships wetzel 2001 with the exception of the lake water storage research theme where the majority of studies included basin area as a spatial unit of study most studies failed to adopt this integration as they were conducted on only one of the two components of a lake ecosystem either the aquatic or terrestrial parts or considered them as separate entities in their data analysis this is one of the notable research gaps of the previous studies as it limits understanding of the functional relationship between aquatic and terrestrial parts of lake ecosystems as well as not identifying the root causes of lake water dynamics the issue is evident in water quality and hydrological studies where insufficient attention was given to studying the effects of catchment biophysical dynamics on water quality and aquatic ecosystems 4 5 frequency of studies in different lakes the analysis of the number of studies per lake indicates that the greatest focus was given to the rift valley lakes and lake tana with the total number of lakes studied being 27 the total number of lakes in the country has however been estimated to be more than 70 which indicates that many of them have been left unexplored by the scientific community some examples of lakes missed in the assembled studies include a series of lakes in the afar triangle region such as lakes beda liddo debado yardi and afambo and lakes in the southwest of ethiopia such as lakes mago gesi wagaan chomen and granger the most frequently investigated lakes ziway and hawasa are those with relatively higher levels of economic significance in terms of lake water usability as they are less alkaline than the others the least studied variable for most of the lakes was related to catchment biophysical conditions indicating lack of emphasis on basin based studies as well as a pattern of overlooking causal variables 4 6 synthesis of results and implication to research gaps a synthesis of previous studies findings suggests that much of the existing literature is focused on the understanding of prevailing hydrological conditions and ongoing temporal trends with less emphasis on quantifying the effect of different causal factors on the hydrological system there was clearly a consensus that the primary threats came more from anthropogenic than from natural factors in all the studies however quantitative evidence about the contribution of each factor to observed hydrological changes was lacking most of the causal claims were based on inference from previous literature and qualitative analysis of perceived causal factors ayenew 2004 ayenew and becht 2008 this makes it difficult to prioritize the different factors of change based on their effect on lake hydrology on the other hand it was found that the results of the studies specifically those which claimed the prevalence of a stable hydrological state for some lakes were not in line with the most widely held views of current lake hydrological conditions the public perception is that ecosystem degradation has reached its worst ever levels however many studies did not show how bad these impacts are and some others even claimed that the lakes are resilient rather than being degraded one of the reasons could be that the severe ecosystem degradation is a relatively recent phenomenon whereas the studies were done over the last 30 years or more the other reason could be the coarseness in the temporal and spatial scale of measurements commonly employed to detect ongoing hydrological changes which might have left undetected micro scale changes and their accumulated impacts a case in point is the use of medium and coarse resolution remote sensing products to detect catchment biophysical changes and lake morphometric dynamics yet little is known about whether changes are really occurring at these resolutions likewise there is doubt as to whether methods used to detect siltation and runoff impacts are sensitive enough to detect micro level changes some of the approaches are not spatially explicit at all while in others where the spatial dimension is considered the data models were developed at a catchment level whereas actual changes happen at a farm plot level which may be less than a hectare in size aga et al 2018 gadissa et al 2018 legesse et al 2010 thus current change detection methods may only be able to detect changes once the magnitude of the change has become large in size and reached an irreversible stage we therefore believe that an important scientific endeavor in the discipline of hydrology might be the development of research methods that can detect micro scale environmental and hydrological changes 5 conclusion in this study making use of a systematic literature review we have examined research trends listed major achievements and identified evidence based research gaps we found 231 scientific articles about the freshwater lakes of ethiopia published in peer reviewed journals between 1930 and march 2021 scientific achievements and research gaps vary considerably depending on the research theme the highest number of studies was found in lake water storage and hydrobiology research themes and the least in paleohydrology in the water quality and hydrobiology themes the research was almost entirely limited to studying only two variables namely lake hydrochemistry and aquatic organisms other important variables such as lake morphometry dynamics climate change were barely considered in the lake water storage analysis research theme the sharpest focus was on estimation of water balance with less attention to morphometric characteristics of the lakes our assessment of spatial and temporal variability indicated that many studies considered only one of the two dimensions or focused on the attributes of the phenomenon rather than its variability in terms of study area coverage the number of studies of smaller highland lakes was very limited which makes them the least known aquatic ecosystems in the country methodologically the method of information acquisition for some variables was less diverse as well as far behind contemporary hydrological research methods e g for aquatic organism and lake water hydrochemical characteristics based on these and other results we have identified major research gaps which should be prioritized in future endeavors the results reported here provide useful preliminary information that can guide the formulation of future research activities on the freshwater lakes of ethiopia further recommended review work includes a critical assessment of the findings of previous studies based on the major research themes this would add detail to the findings of the current study and reveal more explicit information about the study of freshwater lakes of ethiopia a further recommendation is to make a comparison of the results of previous studies to trace historical trends in lake ecosystems based on the chronology of studies a detailed review of the hydrological models used in these studies and their compatibility with the context of the freshwater lakes of ethiopia is another research topic we identified credit authorship contribution statement yonas getaneh

7832,study region middle and lower hanjiang river mlhr basin china study focus changes in streamflow are often due to intertwined factors like climatic variability land use change and hydraulic constructions whose relative impact is however poorly understood in this study we disentangled these effects by comparing real data and modelled scenarios of catchment behaviour modelled scenarios employ the soil and water assessment tool swat whereas the scenario comparison uses the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha new hydrological insights for the region our analyses show that 1 watershed inlet was the major factor altered the streamflow regime at the watershed outlet which pointed us to consider only the relative catchment contribution in further analyses 2 climate variability was the main driver of the net changes in natural hydrological regime which downplayed the effect of land use change on streamflow variability 3 the streamflow regulation associated to the progressive increase in reservoirs and their operation significantly altered the flow pattern causing a general decrease in average streamflow an attenuation of extreme events indicators and an alteration of the pulse pattern with more frequent but shorter pulses 4 the average water withdrawals at mlhr were estimated which were 8 03 109 m3 year overall this research provides a path to assess

regimes significantly affects human activities and the river ecosystems wang 2016a b wu et al 2013 this variability is partly natural and partly human induced due to changes in climate changes in land use e g urbanization and hydraulic constructions like dams reservoirs tonkin et al 2018 as one of the most impacting human activities dam construction has significantly altered the annual distribution

al 2005 shrestha and kawasaki 2020 wang et al 2017a with the growing designed watershed the impact analysis of cascading dams has become a pressing issue to understand the hydrological and ecological impact of dam construction as well as to improve watershed management the ability to separate and quantify the individual impacts of hydraulic engineering operation climatic change and changes in land use cover in river flow is a key prerequisite to achieve sustainable watershed management e g hydropower exploitation water resource management and environmental protection han et al 2019 for this purpose it is essential to analyze the characteristics of the river flow regime and in particular its temporal and spatial variability wrzesiński and sobkowiak 2018 river flow analysis and prediction are powerful tools for understanding the underlying processes that cause streamflow variability and informing the judicious management of freshwater resources pal and talukdar 2020 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is one of the most used methods for characterizing river regimes richter et al 1996 with several applications in the context of climate change kiesel et al 2019 wang et al

zhou et al 2020 separating the effect of multiple processes on the variability of streamflow regimes is complex because it is difficult to isolate the causes of the effects since in reality changes attributable to multiple sources e g climate land use or operation of hydraulic engineering can occur simultaneously which represents the first limitation in impact analysis of streamflow regime moreover time series analyses require long data series to obtain reliable statistics and the iha method is no exception richter et al 1996 such long term time series is often unavailable which is another set of limitations in the impact analysis of streamflow regime to separate the relative effect of multiple causes on the variability of the streamflow regime and provide long term time series data and time series analyses e g iha it is possible to resort to virtual experiments involving various model scenarios zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2018a eum et al 2017 jeong et al 2014 hydrological models can produce hydrological simulations for projected past current and future scenarios which can offer sufficient information to support an iha analysis brouziyne et al 2021 marak et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 mittal et al 2016 for example angelina et al 2015 evaluated hydrological alteration using the soil and water assessment tool swat and long term iha analysis to understand the impacts of dam construction and climatic change in a mesoscale river basin the swat model was widely used in hydrological impact analysis aghsaei et al 2020 haghighi et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 bhatta et al 2019 chen et al 2019a with the land use update and reservoir module the swat model has served as a promising tool to prove long term streamflow recording to conduct an iha analysis in land use change scenarios and dam operation bulti 2021 shrestha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 thus the combination of the swat and iha has been useful in assessing the hydrological impact however the use of model derived streamflow outputs as opposed to observed data entails several additional sources of uncertainty associated with model concepts as well as parameterization beven and freer 2001 the hanjiang river has undergone intensive alteration due to various projects in recent decades including the construction of dams reservoirs and diversions the basin area of the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river mlhr is important for agricultural production the operation of the mid line of south to north water diversion project and the construction of the cascade dam impacted water use in the mlhr kuo et al 2019 wang et al 2016a previous studies showed that climate change significantly impacted the precipitation and water resource over the whole hanjiang river basin zhou et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 qi et al 2021 li et al 2020 piao et al 2010 the intensity of land use was high and the patterns of land use were increasingly changing in the mlhr watershed li et al 2020 yu et al 2010 thus far several attempts have been made to quantify the impacts of dam construction using statistical models for example wang et al 2015 assessed the impact of the danjiangkou reservoir operation on downstream hydrological alteration and related eco hydrological conditions lu et al 2018b presented the changes in the water sediment relationship in the mlhr and analysed the driving forces li et al 2020 evaluated the long term variations in climatic variables and human activities and their effects on streamflow variations yin et al 2020 assessed the impact of multi projects on changing the flow regime with measured data during 1954 2018 nevertheless previous studies did not separate the impact of such engineering projects from human induced factors e g cascading reservoir operation or natural variability e g climate change land use change therefore the impacts of cascading reservoir projects on water resources in the mlhr remain poorly understood by comparing real data and modelled scenarios this study evaluates the hydrological impacts on the highly engineered mlhr watershed which is affected by cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change the model scenarios are simulated using the swat hydrological model while the analysis of streamflow regimes is conducted using the iha analysis the main objectives of this study are 1 to access and quantify the response of the hydrological regime impacted by climate variability and land use change in the mlhr watershed 2 to explore the interactive impact of reservoir operation dam operation on climate change and land use change in the mlhr watershed and 3 to evaluate and estimate water resource variation in the mlhr watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

yujiahu station contains the records of streamflow data since 2010 this station was not used for model calibration and validation reservoir operation data consisted of outflow data from wangfuzhou reservoir from 2000 to 2020 cuijiaying reservoir from 2010 to 2020 and xinglong from 2014 to 2020 these data recorded the operation of the reservoirs since their commence of operation and were used as input to the reservoir module in the swat model both reservoir streamflow and operation data were obtained from the hubei hydrology and water resources centre and the hydrological bureau yangtze river water resources commission 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model setup model scenarios in the mlhr watershed were simulated using the swat model the swat model is widely used in reservoir operation studies akoko et al 2021 marin et al 2020 tan et al 2020 2019 and here we briefly describe the current application the swat model was configured with arcswat2012 in the arcgis10 2 environment the mlhr watershed was divided into sub basins by applying arcswat2012 with 30 m dem data and 562 sub basins were generated each reservoir dam was defined as a sub basin outlet of the arcswat project the location of the danjiangkou reservoir was defined as the watershed inlet with streamflow data provided as input to the model the catchment area was discretized into hydrological response units hrus based on the land use soil type and slope arnold et al 2012 in the hru definition process the land use percentage soil class and slope class were set as 0 for further assessment of the impact of land use change daily meteorological data from 16 weather stations around the study area were configured as a weather input in the swat model the swat model benefits from a land use update luc module pai and saraswat 2011 that accounts for changes in land use during the simulation period this module uses an input file lup dat that links specific dates to hru data the hru data contains the updated area fractions corresponding to land use change when building these input files land use change is represented by time variable hrus in this study we used swat lut tools to update the land use which is a desktop graphical user interface for swat land use update moriasi et al 2019 land use is updated annually by selecting the update time step as yearly in phase 2 of swat lut the number of hrus with the land use of 1990 was 24 640 and the final number of hrus with the land use update was 30 106 dynamic land use changes were written to the luc input files by swat lut the swat reservoir module has four different methods for calculating the outflow volume of a reservoir by adjusting the iresco parameter and preparing the input files res swat users could activate the reservoir module about 65 km below the shayang station in the mlhr the dongjing river discharges the mlhr flood into the yangtze river fig 1 the dongjing river diversion rate is analysed and calculated using the long term ten day average flow measured at the shayang station and qianjiang station of the dongjing river fig s2 we activated the water transfer module in swat to reflect the diversion of the dongjing river streamflow 2 3 2 model verification model calibration and validation were performed using swat cup abbaspour 2013 for this purpose twenty year daily flow data during 1980 1999 were used at four stations xiangyang huangzhuang shayang and xiantao in fig 1 the yujiahu station does not have streamflow data for this period therefore it was not used the swat model parameters were calibrated with daily streamflow data from 1984 to 1993 the sequential uncertainty adjustment algorithm sufi 2 was used for the parameter sensitivity analysis with swat cup in this study simulated streamflow was used at the watershed outlets of the four hydrological stations to analyse the parameter sensitivity with the same set of parameters the periods 1980 1983 and 1994 1999 were defined for model validation the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias pbias were chosen as performance indicators of the model the coefficient of determination r 2 is 1 r 2 i q m i q m q s i q s 2 i q m i q m 2 i q s i q s 2 where q is a variable m stands for measured and s stands for simulated i is the measured i th or simulated data if there is more than one variable such as streamflow at multiple stations or multiple hydrological and environmental indices at a station the objective function abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 2 g r 2 j w j r j 2 where w j is the weight of variable j th the nash sutcliffe efficiency is defined as 3 ns 1 i q m q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 where q is a variable m stand for measured and s stand for simulated and the bar stands for average the objective function with more than one variable abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 4 g ns j w j ns j the percent bias is defined as 5 pbias 100 i 1 n q m q s i i 1 n q m i where q is a variable and m and s stand for measured and simulated respectively percent bias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations the optimal value is zero where low magnitude values indicate better simulations positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation yapo et al 1998 the objective function with more than one variable abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 6 g pbias j w j pbias j in this case four stations were used for model calibration and validation as described above the weights in eqs 2 4 and 6 were assumed to be the same for all stations 2 4 scenario design in this study we developed seven real data and modelled scenarios fig 2 table 2 to distinguish the impacts of cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change on the streamflow regime by comparing scenarios we can evaluate the multi impact of reservoir operation climate variability and land use changes the seven scenarios are described below 1 baseline scenario s0 this scenario represents the simulation of unregulated natural flow before the reservoir construction in mlhr to model this scenario we used observed data from 1980 to 1999 and calibrated the swat model in the period 1984 1993 and validated it in the rest of the year 2 climate variability scenario s01 this scenario represents the simulation of unregulated natural flow without reservoir operation and without land use change in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 to represent this scenario we took the model calibrated in s0 and applied it in the period 2000 2020 without any change other than the climate forcing 3 climate variability and land use change scenario s02 this scenario refers to the simulation of unregulated natural flow with land use change but without reservoir operation in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 this scenario differs from s01 with land use change is considered see description on updating the luc input files in section 2 3 1 in the swat model 4 actual flow conditions a1 a2 and a3 these 3 scenarios refer to the observed streamflow after damming in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 these scenarios were used to analyse the impact of the cascading reservoir by comparing actual flow data with simulated data from s02 5 damming scenario s1 this scenario refers to the simulation of the reservoir regulated flow after damming in mlhr from 2000 to 2020 this scenario differs from s02 in that it activates the reservoir module the measured daily outflow method was used in the swat reservoir module the scenario was run by setting iresco to 3 and preparing the daily reservoir outflow as an input file described in section 2 3 1 scenario s0 was the baseline scenario for the impact of climate and land use variability scenario s02 served as a baseline scenario for the impact of the reservoir operation a1 a2 and a3 were measured daily flow data from three time periods 2000 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2020 and therefore the combined effect of all sources of hydrological change the impact of the cascading reservoir operation was evaluated by comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02 in the same period scenario s1 was used to evaluate the effect of evaporation from watershed 2 5 procedure for impact analysis 2 5 1 climate extreme indices to describe the characteristics of climate extremes climate change detection and indices defined a set of indices to facilitate the analysis zhou et al 2016 based on the frequency intensity and duration of extreme events ten indices details see table s2 were adopted to portray the evolution of precipitation and temperature extremes 2 5 2 land use change transfer matrix the land use transfer matrix is a two dimensional matrix based on the relationship between changes in land cover status at different time phases of the same area zhang et al 2022 li et al 2018 by analysing the obtained transfer matrix it is possible to get two temporal phases with different land classes transforming into each other and it describes the land classes of different types of land use that change in different years as well as the area of change 7 a ij a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 a 1 n a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a nn where a ij is the percentage of land use area type i converting from type j over a period of time n is the total number of land use types and was equal to six in this study 2 5 3 iha the iha toolkit was developed to facilitate the evaluation of changes in flow regime richter et al 1996 in this study we developed seven scenarios conditions and adopted these data for iha analysis fig 2 the iha parameters used in this study are described in table s3 the iha analysis was performed using the iha7 software package version 7 1 the nature conservancy 2009 to quantify the changes in an iha parameter corresponding to different scenarios we used the degree of deviation which is expressed by the following equation xue et al 2017 8 p m e m o m o where m o is the median value for the pre impacted period and m e is the median values for the post impacted period a positive value of p indicates an increase in the median value between the two scenarios while a negative value represents decrease the degree of alteration of the iha parameters was classified into three categories 1 high alteration represented by absolute values in the range of 67 100 2 moderate alteration with absolute values in the range of 33 67 and 3 low alteration with absolute values of 0 33 richter et al 1998 2 5 4 water resource and water withdrawal estimation the annual water withdrawal in mlhr q ww m3 year was estimated using the following long term water balance equation 9 q ww q water h sed inlet q yield q awr e t where q water h sed inlet is the annual streamflow at the watershed inlet outflow of danjiangkou reservoir q yield is the annual production of water from the basin q awr is the annual streamflow at the outlet which is measured and e t is the evaporation of mlhr the simulated data from scenario s2 was used to calculate q ww potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method in the swat model to simulate the dam operation the reservoir module should be activated details of the water yield module evapotranspiration module and reservoir module can be found in the swat2009 theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 3 results 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 parameter sensitivity analysis in total 11 parameters that were considered sensitive to the hydrological process in previous studies chen et al 2019b shi et al 2017 were used to calibrate the model the sensitivity classification is listed in table 3 the results show that the most sensitive parameters are surlag surface runoff lag time gwqmn shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur esco soil evaporation compensation factor gw delay groundwater delay sol awc available soil moisture content and cn2 moisture condition curve number ii surlag is between 7 9 and 23 8 indicating that the delay in releasing surface runoff to the main channel is relatively high in the mlhr watershed the gwqmn ranges from 0 66 to 1 98 in the mlhr watershed esco is related to soil evapotranspiration whose value in the mlhr watershed is between 0 and 0 58 gw delay fluctuates within the range of 136 348 suggesting that groundwater delay is high in the mlhr watershed sol awc represent soil water saturation ranging from 0 22 to 0 74 in the mlhr watershed the cn2 value varies from 35 to 88 in the mlhr watershed in fig s3 the dotted graphs show the posterior likelihood of the sensitive parameters the selected parameter presented high likelihood aggregation except for alpha bf 3 1 2 model performance first we report the results of the model scenario s0 where the swat model was calibrated using the period 1984 1993 and validated using the periods 1980 1983 and 1994 1999 with daily streamflow in four flow measuring stations section 2 4 in the calibration period r 2 ns and pbias values ranged 0 86 0 88 0 85 0 86 and 0 9 11 1 respectively fig 3 during the validation period r 2 ns and pbias values ranged 0 81 0 84 0 81 0 83 and 2 1 5 4 respectively fig 3 for watershed evapotranspiration we compared monthly watershed evapotranspiration with the terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset in china 1982 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019a 2019b during the calibration period r2 ns and pbias were 0 83 0 77 and 5 38 respectively see fig s4 in the validation period the r2 ns and pbias values were 0 80 0 65 and 1 78 respectively see fig s4 the results of streamflow and watershed evapotranspiration indicate the satisfactory model performance 3 1 3 uncertainty analysis model uncertainty can result from model input such as climate soil and land use data model parameters model structure wang et al 2018 yang et al 2008 and the danjiangkou reservoir management and water consumption along the mlhr in swat cup the forecast uncertainty of 95 95ppu is used to express the model uncertainty abbaspour et al 2017 when comparing the 95ppu band two statistics referred to as p factor and r factor were created abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor represents the measured data well simulated by the model and r factor is an amount of the thickness of the 95ppu band during the calibration period the p factor and r factor ranged 0 85 0 99 and 0 63 1 89 respectively fig 3 in the validation period the p factor and r factor values ranged 0 88 0 96 and 0 43 1 44 respectively fig 3 3 2 impact of climate variability and land use change 3 2 1 the climate variability and land use change in mlhr 3 2 1 1 the climate variability fig 4 presents the annual seasonal and monthly changes in precipitation and temperature over two periods compared to 1980 1999 climate change manifested itself in increased precipitation and warmer temperatures between 2000 and 2020 the intra annual distribution of precipitation in the mlhr watershed became increasingly uneven with greater concentration of precipitation in the summer june july and august apart from the monthly maximum temperature in december the average temperature minimum temperature and maximum temperature in the mlhr watershed increased on annual seasonal and monthly scales time series of annual climate extreme indices is shown in fig s5 in all ten indices rx5day r95ptot and fd showed a decreasing trend while r20mm cwd cdd txx tnn fd and su tended to increase the annual change rates of rx5day r95ptot and fd were 0 1414 0 0061 and 0 5749 respectively among the increasing trend indices the highest annual change rate in the tr was 0 4317 we can observe the declining duration of extreme precipitation the increasing amount of precipitation from extreme rainfall events and the rising duration of extreme temperatures 3 2 1 2 the land use change the land use distribution of the mlhr exhibited a distinct spatial heterogeneity during 1990 2020 fig s6 we evaluated land use change in two time phases i e 1990 2000 and 2000 2020 the land use change transfer matrix was shown in fig 5 cropland was the main land use type in the mlhr watershed followed by forestland grassland construction land water area and bare land during 1990 2000 2 79 water area 2 65 of bare land and 1 41 of grassland transformed into cropland which assumed the proportion of 52 92 in 2000 about 1 65 grassland was transformed into forestland from 1990 to 2000 the transformation of the rest land use was relatively small from 1990 to 2000 compared to those mentioned above during 2000 2020 the proportions of cropland forestland and bare land decreased while the proportions of land for construction grassland and water area increased the reduction in cropland was mainly converted into construction land 4 29 the change in grassland was mainly transformed into cropland 2 05 and grassland 2 01 the transformed bare land was used mainly as a cropland 6 56 and a water area 5 38 3 2 2 monthly streamflow alteration the mlhr mainstream flow impact factor includes climate variability land use change and watershed inlet in this section we analysed the impact of these factors on the magnitude of the streamflow according to the corresponding regional catchment area of hydrological stations the simulated outflow of four reaches where the hydrological station is located fig s7 was used for analysis of results namely xiangyang yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao shayang station was not considered in the analysis impact of climate variability at the watershed inlet fig 6a in order to analyse the changes in the watershed inlet of two time periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2020 which are mainly attributed to climate variability we compared the observed streamflow discharged by danjiangkou reservoir in the two periods in terms of the magnitude of the streamflow in danjiangkou we observed that the monthly average streamflow increased from february to may and from october to december while it decreased in the other months in september and november the degree of deviation p see section 2 5 1 exceeded 33 according to the classification defined in section 2 5 1 the two months were of moderate alteration and the remaining months were of low alteration impact of climate variability on downstream stations fig 6b 6e we observed the following the impact of climate change on the four downstream stations showed a high consistency in the trend of the average monthly streamflow variation except for may and october in huangzhuang and xiantao months of moderate alteration include august and september in xiangyang 33 19 and 34 83 respectively december in yujiahu and huangzhuang 34 36 and 35 91 respectively the degree of deviation p at downstream stations showed in general a decreasing trend impact of regional climate variability on downstream stations table s4 as the initial comparison of s01 to s0 is the combined impact of watershed inlet and regional basin climate variability above analysis we then analysed the separate impact of regional basin climate variability alone we observed the following the impact of regional climate change in four stations was also highly consistent average monthly streamflow increased in june september and december in xiangyang in may august september and december in yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would neutralize the increase in the magnitude of the streamflow in the watershed in february while weaken the trend of streamflow change in the remaining months impact of land use change fig 6b 6e to isolate the impact of land use change we compared s02 with s01 we observed that change in land use reduced streamflow in most months in huangzhuang the average monthly streamflow increased by 3 53 in september compared to the impact of climate variability the degree of deviation p caused by land use change was relatively smaller within 4 therefore classified as low alteration 3 2 3 extreme streamflow alteration in this section we describe the hydrological impact on the magnitude of the extreme streamflow impact of climate variability at the watershed inlet fig 6 f in terms of extreme streamflow at the watershed inlet we observed that all indicators of extreme minimum streamflow increased while all indicators of the extreme maximum streamflow decreased the 1 day minimum 1 day maximum and 3 day maximum streamflow were of moderate alteration impact of climate variability on downstream stations fig 6 g 6 j in the four downstream stations all indicators that reflect the magnitude of the extreme streamflow had the same tendency of variation with the watershed inlet but less change only 1 day maximum streamflow at the xiangyang station reached moderate alteration 34 81 impact of regional climate variability on downstream stations table s4 to separate the impact of the climate variability of the watershed inlet in the extreme streamflow we analysed only the climatic variability of the regional basin in xiangyang 1 day maximum and 3 day maximum streamflow increased while indicators of extreme remainder streamflow decreased in yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao the 1 day maximum and the 90 day minimum streamflow increased whereas the extreme remainder streamflow indicators decreased the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of the minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the trend of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow impact of land use change in xiangyang land use change had little impact on extreme streamflow compared with watershed inlet and climate variability the degree of deviation p due to land use change was smaller which was within 1 except 1 day maximum streamflow 2 42 in yujiahu 3 day maximum 2 42 and 7 day maximum 2 53 streamflow in huangzhuang 1 day maximum 1 98 3 day maximum 2 27 and 7 day maximum 2 30 streamflow in xiantao impact in extreme water conditions we compared the extreme streamflow dates to understand the timing of annual extreme water conditions under climate variability and land use change table 5 the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum had been advanced and the 1 day maximum had been deferred in the period 2000 2020 compared to period 1980 1999 comparing s01 with s0 and s02 with s0 we observed that the change in climate variability showed the same impact trend in the four stations as the date aspect of the extreme minimum flow event for maximum extreme flow event date advanced date in xiangyang and yujiahu while delayed date in huangzhuang and xiantao the impact of land use change manifested only in the advanced date of the maximum extreme flow event in yujiahu and the deferred date of the maximum extreme flow event in huangzhuang 3 2 4 pulse and patterns of streamflow changes in this section we compare s01 and s02 with s0 to see climate variability and the impact of land use changes on streamflow pulse and patterns table 6 at the watershed inlet the low high pulse count and duration were reduced in the period 2000 2020 s01 s02 compared to the period of 1980 1999 s0 hence the daily changes in streamflow became smaller at watershed inlet climate variability decreased the low and high pulse counts in four stations the low pulse duration decreased in all four stations while high pulse duration remained the same in xiangyang and xiantao increased in yujiahu and decreased in huangzhuang land use change has had a very similar impact on the pulse of streamflow with climate change 3 3 impact of reservoir operation 3 3 1 monthly streamflow alteration in this section we analysed the impact of reservoir operation on the magnitude of the streamflow comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 respectively from one reservoir to three reservoirs and from upstream to downstream the impact of reservoir operation is as follows impact of one reservoir operation fig 7 a 7 c 7 d in terms of one reservoir operation we compared a1 with s02p1 at the xiangyang station the monthly average streamflow increased except in july at the huangzhuang station the monthly average streamflow increased except from may to august at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow decreased except in january february and september regarding one reservoir operation all p was low alteration at three stations impact of two reservoir operation fig 7 b 7 d in terms of two reservoir operation we compared a2 with s02p2 at the yujiahu station the monthly average streamflow increased except from may to october the degree of alteration in p reached a moderate alteration in january which was 35 86 at the huangzhuang station the monthly average streamflow increased except from april to october the p showed moderate alteration in january 44 94 and may 41 27 at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow increased only in january february and december the p reached 39 30 in may as moderate alteration impact of three reservoir operation fig 7 b 7 d in terms of three reservoir operation we compared a3 with s02p3 at the yujiahu station the monthly average streamflow decreased except in january the p showed moderate alteration in the months of june and august to october at the huangzhuang station the variation was the same as at the yujiahu station the p showed moderate alteration in june october and november at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow decreased in all months the p reached moderate alteration in june september and october 3 3 2 extreme streamflow alteration in this section we analyse the impact of reservoir operation on the magnitude of extreme streamflow comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 respectively from one reservoir to three reservoir and from upstream to downstream we describe the impact of reservoir operation below impact of one reservoir operation fig 7 e 7 g 7 h regarding one reservoir operation we compared a1 with s02p1 at the xiangyang station the 1 day maximum streamflow increased and reached moderate alteration at the huangzhuang and xiantao stations the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow increased and reached moderate alteration as for the minimum streamflow indicators except for all decreases in xiantao there was an increase or decrease in xiangyang and huangzhuang impact of two reservoir operation fig 7 f 7 h regarding two reservoir operation we compared a2 with s02p2 at the yujiahu station the 1 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day 90 day minimum streamflow increased the entire change in extreme streamflow indicators was low alteration at the huangzhuang station the 1 day maximum streamflow reached moderate alteration which was 54 87 at the xiantao station all extreme streamflow indicators decreased and p was low alteration impact of three reservoir operation fig 7 f 7 h regarding three reservoir operation we compared a3 with s02p3 at the yujiahu station the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day to 7 day minimum streamflow increased at the huangzhuang station the 1 day 3 day and 7 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day 3 day and 7 day minimum streamflow increased at the xiantao station the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow increased all the alteration in extreme streamflow indicators at the three stations was low impact in extreme water conditions we compared the extreme streamflow date to understand the timing of annual extreme water conditions under reservoir operation table 7 regarding one reservoir operation the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum was later at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum was advanced at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum and 1 day maximum was prior to the two reservoir operation at the yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao stations as for three reservoir operation the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum was suspended at the yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum has been advanced except for the xiantao station at both stations the magnitude of the extreme streamflow date change was more significant in the condition of two reservoir a2 with joint operation of two dams 3 3 3 pulse and patterns of streamflow changes in this section we compared a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 to assess the impact of reservoir operation on pulse and streamflow patterns table 8 at the xiangyang station the high pulse count and duration increased under one reservoir operation a1 condition at the yujiahu station the low pulse and duration decreased while the high duration increased under two reservoir operation a2 condition low pulse count and duration increased while low pulse count and duration decreased under three reservoir operation a3 condition at the xiangyang and yujiahu stations the streamflow pulse variation trend was similar the high and low pulse count tended to increase but the duration tended to decrease the amplitude of variation of the three reservoir operation was greater than that of one or two reservoir operation as for changes in water condition the absolute value of the descent and descent rate increased at both stations under a1 a2 and a3 conditions this implies that reservoir operation can intensify daily changes in streamflow 3 4 variation of water resource in this section we present the annual et loss and water production in the mlhr watershed combined with observed streamflow at the watershed inlet danjiangkou reservoir and watershed outlet xiantao station we estimate the available water resources and water withdrawal in the mlhr watershed the results are presented in fig 8 and in table s6 we observe the following the et loss water yield available water resource and water withdrawal fluctuated from 2000 to 2020 the years 2019 and 2020 reached the minimum and maximum annual et loss fig 8 which were 2 16 1010 and 2 91 1010 m3 respectively table s6 the annual average et loss was 2 61 1010 m3 in terms of water production the minimum and maximum were in 2019 and 2017 which were 7 67 1010 m3 and 1 91 1010 m3 respectively the annual average water yield was 1 30 1010 m3 regarding the available water resource the years of 2014 and 2010 reached the minimum and maximum which were 2 69 1010 m3 and 6 16 1010 m3 respectively the annual average available water resource was 4 23 1010 m3 as for water withdrawal the minimum and maximum were in 2004 and 2020 which were 3 24 109 m3 and 1 95 1010 m3 respectively the annual water withdrawal was 8 03 109 m3 after 2015 there was a clear upward trend in the percentage of water withdrawal fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological alterations on climate variability and land use change 4 1 1 climate variability in the mlhr the watershed inlet is the main factor controlling the streamflow regime hence the upstream watershed which contributes about 60 of the total watershed area dominate the effect of the changes that occurred in the mlhr region in particular the alteration in monthly streamflow and extreme streamflow at the downstream station are like those at watershed inlet except for a few months by comparing the periods 2000 2020 and 1980 1999 the impact on the monthly average streamflow showed intra year differences which declined in rainy season and increased in dry season fig 6a 6e the alteration in the monthly average streamflow of watershed inlet in non flood season october to may was greater than in the flood season table s4 danjiangkou reservoir is a multi year regulating reservoir which can release water for flood storage capacity in april and may discharge flood water to generate electricity from june to september dam water in october and release water for irrigation from november to march song et al 2018 in terms of extreme streamflow the results showed an increase in minimum streamflow and a decrease in maximum streamflow in the period 2000 2020 compared to the period 1980 1999 this may be relevant for the increase in the normal water level of danjiangkou reservoir in 2014 due to the increase of the dam height from 157 m to 170 m which led to a greater storage capacity and regulatory function we observed decreasing duration of extreme precipitation and increasing amount of precipitation from extreme rainfall events section 3 2 1 1 due to regional climate variability this might further alter the extreme streamflow behaviour pulse behaviour and change rates were significantly modified at the watershed inlet which was largely caused by the increasing trend of extreme precipitation upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir qi et al 2021 pan et al 2012 due to climate change and the rapid water release associated with hydropower generation from the danjiangkou reservoir yang et al 2020 kern et al 2012 changes in streamflow caused by climate variability were consistent with the watershed inlet fig 6a 6e regarding the impact of regional climate variability the intra year variation of monthly average streamflow in four stations was different this could be explained by the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the mlhr watershed section 3 2 1 1 in terms of extreme streamflow the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the tendency of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow table s5 the change in the watershed inlet is also influenced by climate variability which presented different trends in the watershed inlet and outlet precipitation is the most important factor among climate variables especially in dry season trends of precipitation extremes showed regional differences in the hanjiang river basin qin et al 2019 according to hao et al 2019 most of the mlhr area is homogenous in terms of extreme precipitation events which are totally different from the danjiangkou reservoir upstream annual rainfall showed an opposite trend in the mlhr compared to upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir qi et al 2021 pan et al 2012 similar results of the precipitation effects on streamflow were also observed in other studies mahmoodi et al 2021 konapala et al 2020 han et al 2019 across the entire hanjiang river basin the projected total precipitation in the future scenario shows an upward trend but intensified spatial heterogeneity in particular the upper and lower hanjiang river basin area would tend to be wetter while the middle hanjiang river basin area would experience less precipitation jin et al 2021 yu et al 2017 this uneven regional distribution of precipitation could further exacerbate the complexity of the hydrological regime in the mlhr in the future 4 1 2 land use change cropland is the main land use type in the mlhr watershed fig 5 and rice is the main crop yu et al 2018 compared to the period 1980 1999 land use change was more drastic after 2000 streamflow tended to decrease in the mlhr watershed under the impact of land use change we compared the runoff contribution rates table s7 and average runoff depth fig s8 of different lulc types in the mlhr cropland contributed the largest part of runoff followed by forestland grass land and construction land the average runoff depth of cropland was 250 2 mm ranked fifth among the six lulc types the area of cropland accounted for more than half of the mlhr watershed and nearly half of the runoff was generated by cropland from 2000 to 2020 the decrease of cropland in the mlhr watershed was the main cause of streamflow decrease in the land use change previous study has mentioned about the high intensity of land use and increasing development and utilization the mlhr yu et al 2010 demand for agricultural development can increase the demand for surface runoff in irrigation and result in lower streamflow in the growing season agricultural intensification was inferred as a dominant factor in decreasing streamflow by vicente serrano et al 2019 a similar streamflow trend caused by agricultural land was also observed by vaighan et al 2017 and sharma et al 2019 climate variability and land use change are interlinked factors that can lead to changes in the river flow regime nkhoma et al 2021 compared with climate variability the impact of land use change on the streamflow is relatively minor in the mlhr watershed we can observe that climate variability is the main regional driver of net changes in the natural hydrological regime this has also been reported in other large basins nkhoma et al 2021 truong et al 2018 fazel et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 4 2 hydrologic alterations in reservoir operation dams can change the degree timing and duration of flows especially peak flow gierszewski et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 lu et al 2018a mailhot et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 in terms of monthly streamflow conditions a1 to a3 presented highly differentiated results in the four stations operating the wangfuzhou reservoir alone condition a1 increased monthly streamflow in the most months in xiangyang however the monthly streamflow downstream from huangzhuang and xiantao condition a2 decreased by more months under the combined operation of wangfuzhou reservoir and cuijiaying reservoir the downstream change was relatively greater compared to condition a1 and a2 the change was more evident at three stations in condition a3 this may be related to the full operation of the cascading reservoirs formed by the simultaneous operation of the three reservoirs which improved the use of water resources wangfuzhou reservoir cuijiaying reservoir and xinglong reservoir are intended for different applications and this application had a dominant effect on the runoff changes caused by the reservoir operation in particular the wangfuzhou reservoir is intended for hydropower the cuijiaying reservoir is for navigation and hydropower while the xinglong reservoir is mainly for flood control zhongnan enginneering corporation limited 2015 regarding extreme streamflow the alteration in maximum streamflow in huangzhuang and xiantao was more evident although the primary function of wangfuzhou reservoir and cuijiaying reservoir is not flood control the reservoir also has a certain flood regulation capacity on the one hand this phenomenon may be caused by the underestimation of the flood during the simulation fig s9 according to the review of swat applications under hydroclimatic extremes tan et al 2020 peak flow simulation showed better performance with sub daily scale rainfall input the mlhr watershed cover a large catchment area of 6 38 104 km2 simulation with 16 weather stations and daily scale data may not be able to accurately reflect streamflow dynamic under extreme rainfall processes conversely it could also be due to the construction and operation of the cascade reservoirs which improved the regional standard of flood control and enhanced the management and application of water resources the timing of the annual extreme flow in all three periods of reservoir operation was significantly affected among these three reservoirs the cuijiaying reservoir had the greatest impact due to the larger storage capacity the pulse behaviour and change rates were significantly altered with the combined operation of the reservoir cascade the degree of alteration was different between the three time periods on the one hand the primary purpose of the reservoir can result in different impacts the distinct impact of flood control dominated and hydropower dominated reservoirs from iha indicators such as low pulse counts and multi day minimum flow has also been reported by other studies gierszewski et al 2020 lu et al 2018a on the other hand several important tributaries such as the tangbai river and the man river are located between the reservoir and the stations which also imposed changes in the streamflow and altered flow regime previous study showed that dam construction would significantly alter the count and duration of flow pulses zheng et al 2019 the result of this study showed a trend towards an increase in counts but a reduction in duration under reservoir operation the counter regulatory effect of dams on upstream flow such as the impact of the xinglong reservoir at the huangzhuang station was observed in this study and reported in other regions ali et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 as the absolute value of change caused by reservoir operation was greater than climate change and land use change table s4 s5 the result further proved that dams usually play a dominant control over streamflow overcoming other factors han et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 from the results summarized in section 3 2 we can conclude that climate variability was the main reason for maximum streamflow in wet season such as floods and low runoff in dry season at the mlhr similar results were also reported in other basins chai et al 2019 hecht et al 2019 the cascading reservoir operation at the mlhr could further alert the effects of climate change and promote water use the adjustment effect of reservoir operation on the effect of climate change was also reported in the south fork boise river and the lancang mekong river basin benjankar et al 2018 wang et al 2017a from a global viewpoint boulange et al 2021 reported that dams can counteract the risk of climate impact floods previous studies have shown that the combined effect of reservoir operation dam construction and climate change can significantly alter river flow variability sanyal et al 2021 hoang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 mittal et al 2016 we also verified the dominant role of cascading reservoirs in coping with the effects of climatic variability 4 3 limitations and future work various sources of uncertainties can impact the simulated streamflow in the mlhr there are mainstream inlet gates and tributaries for agricultural use in the mlhr whose impact could not be separated due to insufficient observed data despite the agreement between simulation and observation in mainstream of the mlhr the performance of the model can be further improved with more data from reservoir operation and water withdrawal in the future there is an inter basin water transfer project implemented in 2014 called changjiang hanjiang water transfer project zhou et al 2017 which transfers water from the yangtze river to the mlhr downstream of the xinglong reservoir as there were no observed data this effect was not considered in this study furthermore there is uncertainty in converting lulc to a non real condition to separate the effect of human activities and climate change on the streamflow dey and mishra 2017 with more monitoring data in the future model simulation can improve our understanding of the interactive impact of human activities and climate change 5 conclusion to investigate the effects of cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change on the streamflow regime in the mlhr a scenario comparison approach based on the swat model and iha was introduced the calibration and validation results confirmed that the swat model can serve as an appropriate tool to simulate streamflow in the mlhr 1 the watershed inlet is the main factor controlling the streamflow regime in the mlhr climate variability is the main regional driver of net changes to the natural hydrological regime in the mlhr our results showed that monthly streamflow declined increased in rainy dry season we also found that minimum streamflow increased and maximum streamflow decreased the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the tendency of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow 2 compared to climate variability the impact of land use change on streamflow was relatively small in the mlhr watershed streamflow tended to decrease under the impact of land use change we found that the decrease of cropland in the mlhr watershed was the main cause of streamflow decrease in the land use change 3 cascade dams significantly regulated water in all seasons and controlled the flow pattern the operation of the cascade reservoir in the mlhr could further alert the effects of climate change and promote the use of water our results showed that the alteration of monthly streamflow was more evident in the operation of three reservoirs compared to the operation of one and two reservoirs the alteration degree p was of low alteration in three stations under one reservoir operation with the operation of the cascade reservoirs there was an increase in p reaching moderate alteration we also found that the effects of cascading reservoir operation on extreme streamflow varied significantly in different stations huangzhuang station had the most evident alteration among the four stations the timing of the annual extreme flow in all three periods of reservoir operation was significantly affected 4 the et loss water yield available water resource and water withdrawal in the mlhr watershed fluctuated during 2000 2020 we found that the annual average et loss was 2 61 1010 m3 the annual average water yield was 1 30 1010 m3 the annual average available water resource was 4 23 1010 m3 and the annual water withdrawal was 8 03 109 m3 after 2015 there was a clear increase trend in the percentage of water withdrawal in this study the comparison approach enabled us to distinguish the impacts of the cascading reservoir operation on the streamflow regime of climate variability and land use change this study should improve the understanding of the hydrological impacts of human activities in the cascading reservoir and land use change in the mlhr under climate change funding sources this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41877531 the national

7832,study region middle and lower hanjiang river mlhr basin china study focus changes in streamflow are often due to intertwined factors like climatic variability land use change and hydraulic constructions whose relative impact is however poorly understood in this study we disentangled these effects by comparing real data and modelled scenarios of catchment behaviour modelled scenarios employ the soil and water assessment tool swat whereas the scenario comparison uses the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha new hydrological insights for the region our analyses show that 1 watershed inlet was the major factor altered the streamflow regime at the watershed outlet which pointed us to consider only the relative catchment contribution in further analyses 2 climate variability was the main driver of the net changes in natural hydrological regime which downplayed the effect of land use change on streamflow variability 3 the streamflow regulation associated to the progressive increase in reservoirs and their operation significantly altered the flow pattern causing a general decrease in average streamflow an attenuation of extreme events indicators and an alteration of the pulse pattern with more frequent but shorter pulses 4 the average water withdrawals at mlhr were estimated which were 8 03 109 m3 year overall this research provides a path to assess

purpose it is essential to analyze the characteristics of the river flow regime and in particular its temporal and spatial variability wrzesiński and sobkowiak 2018 river flow analysis and prediction are powerful tools for understanding the underlying processes that cause streamflow variability and informing the judicious management of freshwater resources pal and talukdar 2020 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha is one of the most used methods for characterizing river regimes richter et al 1996 with several applications in the context of climate change kiesel et al 2019 wang et al

zhou et al 2020 separating the effect of multiple processes on the variability of streamflow regimes is complex because it is difficult to isolate the causes of the effects since in reality changes attributable to multiple sources e g climate land use or operation of hydraulic engineering can occur simultaneously which represents the first limitation in impact analysis of streamflow regime moreover time series analyses require long data series to obtain reliable statistics and the iha method is no exception richter et al 1996 such long term time series is often unavailable which is another set of limitations in the impact analysis of streamflow regime to separate the relative effect of multiple causes on the variability of the streamflow regime and provide long term time series data and time series analyses e g iha it is possible to resort to virtual experiments involving various model scenarios zhang et al 2020 lu et al 2018a eum et al 2017 jeong et al 2014 hydrological models can produce hydrological simulations for projected past current and future scenarios which can offer sufficient information to support an iha analysis brouziyne et al 2021 marak et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 mittal et al 2016 for example angelina et al 2015 evaluated hydrological alteration using the soil and water assessment tool swat and long term iha analysis to understand the impacts of dam construction and climatic change in a mesoscale river basin the swat model was widely used in hydrological impact analysis aghsaei et al 2020 haghighi et al 2020 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 bhatta et al 2019 chen et al 2019a with the land use update and reservoir module the swat model has served as a promising tool to prove long term streamflow recording to conduct an iha analysis in land use change scenarios and dam operation bulti 2021 shrestha et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 thus the combination of the swat and iha has been useful in assessing the hydrological impact however the use of model derived streamflow outputs as opposed to observed data entails several additional sources of uncertainty associated with model concepts as well as parameterization beven and freer 2001 the hanjiang river has undergone intensive alteration due to various projects in recent decades including the construction of dams reservoirs and diversions the basin area of the middle and lower reaches of the hanjiang river mlhr is important for agricultural production the operation of the mid line of south to north water diversion project and the construction of the cascade dam impacted water use in the mlhr kuo et al 2019 wang et al 2016a previous studies showed that climate change significantly impacted the precipitation and water resource over the whole hanjiang river basin zhou et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 qi et al 2021 li et al 2020 piao et al 2010 the intensity of land use was high and the patterns of land use were increasingly changing in the mlhr watershed li et al 2020 yu et al 2010 thus far several attempts have been made to quantify the impacts of dam construction using statistical models for example wang et al 2015 assessed the impact of the danjiangkou reservoir operation on downstream hydrological alteration and related eco hydrological conditions lu et al 2018b presented the changes in the water sediment relationship in the mlhr and analysed the driving forces li et al 2020 evaluated the long term variations in climatic variables and human activities and their effects on streamflow variations yin et al 2020 assessed the impact of multi projects on changing the flow regime with measured data during 1954 2018 nevertheless previous studies did not separate the impact of such engineering projects from human induced factors e g cascading reservoir operation or natural variability e g climate change land use change therefore the impacts of cascading reservoir projects on water resources in the mlhr remain poorly understood by comparing real data and modelled scenarios this study evaluates the hydrological impacts on the highly engineered mlhr watershed which is affected by cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change the model scenarios are simulated using the swat hydrological model while the analysis of streamflow regimes is conducted using the iha analysis the main objectives of this study are 1 to access and quantify the response of the hydrological regime impacted by climate variability and land use change in the mlhr watershed 2 to explore the interactive impact of reservoir operation dam operation on climate change and land use change in the mlhr watershed and 3 to evaluate and estimate water resource variation in the mlhr watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hanjiang river located in central china between 106 114 e and 30 34 n is the largest branch of the yangtze river with a length of 1577 km and a catchment area of 15 9 104 km2 the headwater region of the danjiangkou reservoir is considered here as the upper basin the danjiangkou reservoir was built in 1973 since then it has been used to regulate the inflow of the mlhr fig 1 shows the mlhr watershed its mainstream begins at the danjiangkou reservoir and merges with the yangtze river in wuhan hubei province in china in fig 1 the yellow area represents the mlhr study area hence the lower part of the hanjiang river basin with a watershed inlet at the location of danjiangkou reservoir the pentagons represent the locations of the seven reservoirs red means the dam was operational brown means the dam was under construction the black quadrats stand for the locations of the 5 selected hydrological stations the green triangles stand for the locations of the 15 selected weather stations the sum of the mlhr is 652 km long and covers a catchment area of 6 38 104 km2 which is about 40 of the total area of the hanjiang river basin a set of seven cascading reservoirs are built or planned at the mlhr danjiangkou wangfuzhou cuijiaying and xinglong are operational while yakou xinji and nianpanshan are still under construction fig 1 table 1 the mlhr is the main water source to meet industrial and domestic use in 19 municipalities cities districts as well as an irrigation source for 15 irrigation districts along the river daily outflow data from the danjiangkou reservoir was used as input to the watershed inlet five mainstream measurement stations i e xiangyang yujiahu huangzhuang shayang and xiantao were used in our simulation fig 1 the landform types in the mlhr watershed are mainly low mountains hills valleys and plains the mlhr watershed belongs to the subtropical monsoon region with abundant rainfall and warm climate the basin average daily temperature in summer is 26 c and 0 c in winter the basin average rainfall range in the region is 700 1300 mm yr the rainy season is from june to october november to may is the dry season the range of watershed elevation is 5 3002 m fig s1a the main land use types in the mlhr watershed are cropland forest land and grassland fig s1b rice wheat and corn are the main crops grown in the mlhr watershed 2 2 data sources and pre processing in this study we obtained some meteorological data of the study area during 1978 2020 a total period of 43 years from the china meteorological administration the meteorological data consisted of daily rainfall data maximum minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and humidity these data were used as climatic forcing in the swat model to evaluate the impact of climate variability meteorological data were divided into two periods i e 1978 1999 and 1998 2020 the first two years of each period were used for swat model warm up the landscape data included the digital elevation model dem 30 m resolution land use map 30 m resolution and the soil map 1 1000 000 the dem data were derived from the chinese academy of sciences data mirror http www resdc cn the land use data were downloaded from the resource and environment science and data centre https www resdc cn the soil data were obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences http www issas cas cn the landscape data were used to generate watersheds as well as to the calculate hydrological response units hrus in the swat model for this purpose the land use data were classified into 12 types table s1 to consider the land use change six land use images were used at different years i e 1990 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 of the study period streamflow data were measured at 4 stations along the main river namely xiangyang huangzhuang shayang and xiantao stations fig 1 the period prior to the reservoir construction i e 1980 1999 was used for model calibration and validation the yujiahu station contains the records of streamflow data since 2010 this station was not used for model calibration and validation reservoir operation data consisted of outflow data from wangfuzhou reservoir from 2000 to 2020 cuijiaying reservoir from 2010 to 2020 and xinglong from 2014 to 2020 these data recorded the operation of the reservoirs since their commence of operation and were used as input to the reservoir module in the swat model both reservoir streamflow and operation data were obtained from the hubei hydrology and water resources centre and the hydrological bureau yangtze river water resources commission 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model setup model scenarios in the mlhr watershed were simulated using the swat model the swat model is widely used in reservoir operation studies akoko et al 2021 marin et al 2020 tan et al 2020 2019 and here we briefly describe the current application the swat model was configured with arcswat2012 in the arcgis10 2 environment the mlhr watershed was divided into sub basins by applying arcswat2012 with 30 m dem data and 562 sub basins were generated each reservoir dam was defined as a sub basin outlet of the arcswat project the location of the danjiangkou reservoir was defined as the watershed inlet with streamflow data provided as input to the model the catchment area was discretized into hydrological response units hrus based on the land use soil type and slope arnold et al 2012 in the hru definition process the land use percentage soil class and slope class were set as 0 for further assessment of the impact of land use change daily meteorological data from 16 weather stations around the study area were configured as a weather input in the swat model the swat model benefits from a land use update luc module pai and saraswat 2011 that accounts for changes in land use during the simulation period this module uses an input file lup dat that links specific dates to hru data the hru data contains the updated area fractions corresponding to land use change when building these input files land use change is represented by time variable hrus in this study we used swat lut tools to update the land use which is a desktop graphical user interface for swat land use update moriasi et al 2019 land use is updated annually by selecting the update time step as yearly in phase 2 of swat lut the number of hrus with the land use of 1990 was 24 640 and the final number of hrus with the land use update was 30 106 dynamic land use changes were written to the luc input files by swat lut the swat reservoir module has four different methods for calculating the outflow volume of a reservoir by adjusting the iresco parameter and preparing the input files res swat users could activate the reservoir module about 65 km below the shayang station in the mlhr the dongjing river discharges the mlhr flood into the yangtze river fig 1 the dongjing river diversion rate is analysed and calculated using the long term ten day average flow measured at the shayang station and qianjiang station of the dongjing river fig s2 we activated the water transfer module in swat to reflect the diversion of the dongjing river streamflow 2 3 2 model verification model calibration and validation were performed using swat cup abbaspour 2013 for this purpose twenty year daily flow data during 1980 1999 were used at four stations xiangyang huangzhuang shayang and xiantao in fig 1 the yujiahu station does not have streamflow data for this period therefore it was not used the swat model parameters were calibrated with daily streamflow data from 1984 to 1993 the sequential uncertainty adjustment algorithm sufi 2 was used for the parameter sensitivity analysis with swat cup in this study simulated streamflow was used at the watershed outlets of the four hydrological stations to analyse the parameter sensitivity with the same set of parameters the periods 1980 1983 and 1994 1999 were defined for model validation the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias pbias were chosen as performance indicators of the model the coefficient of determination r 2 is 1 r 2 i q m i q m q s i q s 2 i q m i q m 2 i q s i q s 2 where q is a variable m stands for measured and s stands for simulated i is the measured i th or simulated data if there is more than one variable such as streamflow at multiple stations or multiple hydrological and environmental indices at a station the objective function abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 2 g r 2 j w j r j 2 where w j is the weight of variable j th the nash sutcliffe efficiency is defined as 3 ns 1 i q m q s i 2 i q m i q m 2 where q is a variable m stand for measured and s stand for simulated and the bar stands for average the objective function with more than one variable abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 4 g ns j w j ns j the percent bias is defined as 5 pbias 100 i 1 n q m q s i i 1 n q m i where q is a variable and m and s stand for measured and simulated respectively percent bias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than the observations the optimal value is zero where low magnitude values indicate better simulations positive values indicate model underestimation and negative values indicate model overestimation yapo et al 1998 the objective function with more than one variable abbaspour et al 2017 is defined as 6 g pbias j w j pbias j in this case four stations were used for model calibration and validation as described above the weights in eqs 2 4 and 6 were assumed to be the same for all stations 2 4 scenario design in this study we developed seven real data and modelled scenarios fig 2 table 2 to distinguish the impacts of cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change on the streamflow regime by comparing scenarios we can evaluate the multi impact of reservoir operation climate variability and land use changes the seven scenarios are described below 1 baseline scenario s0 this scenario represents the simulation of unregulated natural flow before the reservoir construction in mlhr to model this scenario we used observed data from 1980 to 1999 and calibrated the swat model in the period 1984 1993 and validated it in the rest of the year 2 climate variability scenario s01 this scenario represents the simulation of unregulated natural flow without reservoir operation and without land use change in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 to represent this scenario we took the model calibrated in s0 and applied it in the period 2000 2020 without any change other than the climate forcing 3 climate variability and land use change scenario s02 this scenario refers to the simulation of unregulated natural flow with land use change but without reservoir operation in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 this scenario differs from s01 with land use change is considered see description on updating the luc input files in section 2 3 1 in the swat model 4 actual flow conditions a1 a2 and a3 these 3 scenarios refer to the observed streamflow after damming in the mlhr from 2000 to 2020 these scenarios were used to analyse the impact of the cascading reservoir by comparing actual flow data with simulated data from s02 5 damming scenario s1 this scenario refers to the simulation of the reservoir regulated flow after damming in mlhr from 2000 to 2020 this scenario differs from s02 in that it activates the reservoir module the measured daily outflow method was used in the swat reservoir module the scenario was run by setting iresco to 3 and preparing the daily reservoir outflow as an input file described in section 2 3 1 scenario s0 was the baseline scenario for the impact of climate and land use variability scenario s02 served as a baseline scenario for the impact of the reservoir operation a1 a2 and a3 were measured daily flow data from three time periods 2000 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2020 and therefore the combined effect of all sources of hydrological change the impact of the cascading reservoir operation was evaluated by comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02 in the same period scenario s1 was used to evaluate the effect of evaporation from watershed 2 5 procedure for impact analysis 2 5 1 climate extreme indices to describe the characteristics of climate extremes climate change detection and indices defined a set of indices to facilitate the analysis zhou et al 2016 based on the frequency intensity and duration of extreme events ten indices details see table s2 were adopted to portray the evolution of precipitation and temperature extremes 2 5 2 land use change transfer matrix the land use transfer matrix is a two dimensional matrix based on the relationship between changes in land cover status at different time phases of the same area zhang et al 2022 li et al 2018 by analysing the obtained transfer matrix it is possible to get two temporal phases with different land classes transforming into each other and it describes the land classes of different types of land use that change in different years as well as the area of change 7 a ij a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 a 1 n a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a nn where a ij is the percentage of land use area type i converting from type j over a period of time n is the total number of land use types and was equal to six in this study 2 5 3 iha the iha toolkit was developed to facilitate the evaluation of changes in flow regime richter et al 1996 in this study we developed seven scenarios conditions and adopted these data for iha analysis fig 2 the iha parameters used in this study are described in table s3 the iha analysis was performed using the iha7 software package version 7 1 the nature conservancy 2009 to quantify the changes in an iha parameter corresponding to different scenarios we used the degree of deviation which is expressed by the following equation xue et al 2017 8 p m e m o m o where m o is the median value for the pre impacted period and m e is the median values for the post impacted period a positive value of p indicates an increase in the median value between the two scenarios while a negative value represents decrease the degree of alteration of the iha parameters was classified into three categories 1 high alteration represented by absolute values in the range of 67 100 2 moderate alteration with absolute values in the range of 33 67 and 3 low alteration with absolute values of 0 33 richter et al 1998 2 5 4 water resource and water withdrawal estimation the annual water

reservoir module should be activated details of the water yield module evapotranspiration module and reservoir module can be found in the swat2009 theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 3 results 3 1 model performance 3 1 1 parameter sensitivity analysis in total 11 parameters that were considered sensitive to the hydrological process in previous studies chen et al 2019b shi et al 2017 were used to calibrate the model the sensitivity classification is listed in table 3 the results show that the most sensitive parameters are surlag surface runoff lag time gwqmn shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur esco soil evaporation compensation factor gw delay groundwater delay sol awc available soil moisture content and cn2 moisture condition curve number ii surlag is between 7 9 and 23 8 indicating that the delay in releasing surface runoff to the main channel is relatively high in the mlhr watershed the gwqmn ranges from 0 66 to 1 98 in the mlhr watershed esco is related to soil evapotranspiration whose value in the mlhr watershed is between 0 and 0 58 gw delay fluctuates within the range of 136 348 suggesting that groundwater delay is high in the mlhr watershed sol awc represent soil water saturation ranging from 0 22 to 0 74 in the mlhr watershed the cn2 value varies from 35 to 88 in the mlhr watershed in fig s3 the dotted graphs show the posterior likelihood of the sensitive parameters the selected parameter presented high likelihood aggregation except for alpha bf 3 1 2 model performance first we report the results of the model scenario s0 where the swat model was calibrated using the period 1984 1993 and validated using the periods 1980 1983 and 1994 1999 with daily streamflow in four flow measuring stations section 2 4 in the calibration period r 2 ns and pbias values ranged 0 86 0 88 0 85 0 86 and 0 9 11 1 respectively fig 3 during the validation period r 2 ns and pbias values ranged 0 81 0 84 0 81 0 83 and 2 1 5 4 respectively fig 3 for watershed evapotranspiration we compared monthly watershed evapotranspiration with the terrestrial evapotranspiration dataset in china 1982 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019a 2019b during the calibration period r2 ns and pbias were 0 83 0 77 and 5 38 respectively see fig s4 in the validation period the r2 ns and pbias values were 0 80 0 65 and 1 78 respectively see fig s4 the results of streamflow and watershed evapotranspiration indicate the satisfactory model performance 3 1 3 uncertainty analysis model uncertainty can result from model input such as climate soil and land use data model parameters model structure wang et al 2018 yang et al 2008 and the danjiangkou reservoir management and water consumption along the mlhr in swat cup the forecast uncertainty of 95 95ppu is used to express the model uncertainty abbaspour et al 2017 when comparing the 95ppu band two statistics referred to as p factor and r factor were created abbaspour et al 2015 the p factor represents the measured data well simulated by the model and r factor is an amount of the thickness of the 95ppu band during the calibration period the p factor and r factor ranged 0 85 0 99 and 0 63 1 89 respectively fig 3 in the validation period the p factor and r factor values ranged 0 88 0 96 and 0 43 1 44 respectively fig 3 3 2 impact of climate variability and land use change 3 2 1 the climate variability and land use change in mlhr 3 2 1 1 the climate variability fig 4 presents the annual seasonal and monthly changes in precipitation and temperature over two periods compared to 1980 1999 climate change manifested itself in increased precipitation and warmer temperatures between 2000 and 2020 the intra annual distribution of precipitation in the mlhr watershed became increasingly uneven with greater concentration of precipitation in the summer june july and august apart from the monthly maximum temperature in december the average temperature minimum temperature and maximum temperature in the mlhr watershed increased on annual seasonal and monthly scales time series of annual climate extreme indices is shown in fig s5 in all ten indices rx5day r95ptot and fd showed a decreasing trend while r20mm cwd cdd txx tnn fd and su tended to increase the annual change rates of rx5day r95ptot and fd were 0 1414 0 0061 and 0 5749 respectively among the increasing trend indices the highest annual change rate in the tr was 0 4317 we can observe the declining duration of extreme precipitation the increasing amount of precipitation from extreme rainfall events and the rising duration of extreme temperatures 3 2 1 2 the land use change the land use distribution of the mlhr exhibited a distinct spatial heterogeneity during 1990 2020 fig s6 we evaluated land use change in two time phases i e 1990 2000 and 2000 2020 the land use change transfer matrix was shown in fig 5 cropland was the main land use type in the mlhr watershed followed by forestland grassland construction land water area and bare land during 1990 2000 2 79 water area 2 65 of bare land and 1 41 of grassland transformed into cropland which assumed the proportion of 52 92 in 2000 about 1 65 grassland was transformed into forestland from 1990 to 2000 the transformation of the rest land use was relatively small from 1990 to 2000 compared to those mentioned above during 2000 2020 the proportions of cropland forestland and bare land decreased while the proportions of land for construction grassland and water area increased the reduction in cropland was mainly converted into construction land 4 29 the change in grassland was mainly transformed into cropland 2 05 and grassland 2 01 the transformed bare land was used mainly as a cropland 6 56 and a water area 5 38 3 2 2 monthly streamflow alteration the mlhr mainstream flow impact factor includes climate variability land use change and watershed inlet in this section we analysed the impact of these factors on the magnitude of the streamflow according to the corresponding regional catchment area of hydrological stations the simulated outflow of four reaches where the hydrological station is located fig s7 was used for analysis of results namely xiangyang yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao shayang station was not considered in the analysis impact of climate variability at the watershed inlet fig 6a in order to analyse the changes in the watershed inlet of two time periods 1980 1999 and 2000 2020 which are mainly attributed to climate variability we compared the observed streamflow discharged by danjiangkou reservoir in the two periods in terms of the magnitude of the streamflow in danjiangkou we observed that the monthly average streamflow increased from february to may and from october to december while it decreased in the other months in september and november the degree of deviation p see section 2 5 1 exceeded 33 according to the classification defined in section 2 5 1 the two months were of moderate alteration and the remaining months were of low alteration impact of climate variability on downstream stations fig 6b 6e we observed the following the impact of climate change on the four downstream stations showed a high consistency in the trend of the average monthly streamflow variation except for may and october in huangzhuang and xiantao months of moderate alteration include august and september in xiangyang 33 19 and 34 83 respectively december in yujiahu and huangzhuang 34 36 and 35 91 respectively the degree of deviation p at downstream stations showed in general a decreasing trend impact of regional climate variability on downstream stations table s4 as the initial comparison of s01 to s0 is the combined impact of watershed inlet and regional basin climate variability above analysis we then analysed the separate impact of regional basin climate variability alone we observed the following the impact of regional climate change in four stations was also highly consistent average monthly streamflow increased in june september and december in xiangyang in may august september and december in yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would neutralize the increase in the magnitude of the streamflow in the watershed in february while weaken the trend of streamflow change in the remaining months impact of land use change fig 6b 6e to isolate the impact of land use change we compared s02 with s01 we observed that change in land use reduced streamflow in most months in huangzhuang the average monthly streamflow increased by 3 53 in september compared to the impact of climate variability the degree of deviation p caused by land use change was relatively smaller within 4 therefore classified as low alteration 3 2 3 extreme streamflow alteration in this section we describe the hydrological impact on the magnitude of the extreme streamflow impact of climate variability at the watershed inlet fig 6 f in terms of extreme streamflow at the watershed inlet we observed that all indicators of extreme minimum streamflow increased while all indicators of the extreme maximum streamflow decreased the 1 day minimum 1 day maximum and 3 day maximum streamflow were of moderate alteration impact of climate variability on downstream stations fig 6 g 6 j in the four downstream stations all indicators that reflect the magnitude of the extreme streamflow had the same tendency of variation with the watershed inlet but less change only 1 day maximum streamflow at the xiangyang station reached moderate alteration 34 81 impact of regional climate variability on downstream stations table s4 to separate the impact of the climate variability of the watershed inlet in the extreme streamflow we analysed only the climatic variability of the regional basin in xiangyang 1 day maximum and 3 day maximum streamflow increased while indicators of extreme remainder streamflow decreased in yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao the 1 day maximum and the 90 day minimum streamflow increased whereas the extreme remainder streamflow indicators decreased the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of the minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the trend of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow impact of land use change in xiangyang land use change had little impact on extreme streamflow compared with watershed inlet and climate variability the degree of deviation p due to land use change was smaller which was within 1 except 1 day maximum streamflow 2 42 in yujiahu 3 day maximum 2 42 and 7 day maximum 2 53 streamflow in huangzhuang 1 day maximum 1 98 3 day maximum 2 27 and 7 day maximum 2 30 streamflow in xiantao impact in extreme water conditions we compared the extreme streamflow dates to understand the timing of annual extreme water conditions under climate variability and land use change table 5 the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum had been advanced and the 1 day maximum had been deferred in the period 2000 2020 compared to period 1980 1999 comparing s01 with s0 and s02 with s0 we observed that the change in climate variability showed the same impact trend in the four stations as the date aspect of the extreme minimum flow event for maximum extreme flow event date advanced date in xiangyang and yujiahu while delayed date in huangzhuang and xiantao the impact of land use change manifested only in the advanced date of the maximum extreme flow event in yujiahu and the deferred date of the maximum extreme flow event in huangzhuang 3 2 4 pulse and patterns of streamflow changes in this section we compare s01 and s02 with s0 to see climate variability and the impact of land use changes on streamflow pulse and patterns table 6 at the watershed inlet the low high pulse count and duration were reduced in the period 2000 2020 s01 s02 compared to the period of 1980 1999 s0 hence the daily changes in streamflow became smaller at watershed inlet climate variability decreased the low and high pulse counts in four stations the low pulse duration decreased in all four stations while high pulse duration remained the same in xiangyang and xiantao increased in yujiahu and decreased in huangzhuang land use change has had a very similar impact on the pulse of streamflow with climate change 3 3 impact of reservoir operation 3 3 1 monthly streamflow alteration in this section we analysed the impact of reservoir operation on the magnitude of the streamflow comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 respectively from one reservoir to three reservoirs and from upstream to downstream the impact of reservoir operation is as follows impact of one reservoir operation fig 7 a 7 c 7 d in terms of one reservoir operation we compared a1 with s02p1 at the xiangyang station the monthly average streamflow increased except in july at the huangzhuang station the monthly average streamflow increased except from may to august at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow decreased except in january february and september regarding one reservoir operation all p was low alteration at three stations impact of two reservoir operation fig 7 b 7 d in terms of two reservoir operation we compared a2 with s02p2 at the yujiahu station the monthly average streamflow increased except from may to october the degree of alteration in p reached a moderate alteration in january which was 35 86 at the huangzhuang station the monthly average streamflow increased except from april to october the p showed moderate alteration in january 44 94 and may 41 27 at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow increased only in january february and december the p reached 39 30 in may as moderate alteration impact of three reservoir operation fig 7 b 7 d in terms of three reservoir operation we compared a3 with s02p3 at the yujiahu station the monthly average streamflow decreased except in january the p showed moderate alteration in the months of june and august to october at the huangzhuang station the variation was the same as at the yujiahu station the p showed moderate alteration in june october and november at the xiantao station the monthly average streamflow decreased in all months the p reached moderate alteration in june september and october 3 3 2 extreme streamflow alteration in this section we analyse the impact of reservoir operation on the magnitude of extreme streamflow comparing a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 respectively from one reservoir to three reservoir and from upstream to downstream we describe the impact of reservoir operation below impact of one reservoir operation fig 7 e 7 g 7 h regarding one reservoir operation we compared a1 with s02p1 at the xiangyang station the 1 day maximum streamflow increased and reached moderate alteration at the huangzhuang and xiantao stations the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow increased and reached moderate alteration as for the minimum streamflow indicators except for all decreases in xiantao there was an increase or decrease in xiangyang and huangzhuang impact of two reservoir operation fig 7 f 7 h regarding two reservoir operation we compared a2 with s02p2 at the yujiahu station the 1 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day 90 day minimum streamflow increased the entire change in extreme streamflow indicators was low alteration at the huangzhuang station the 1 day maximum streamflow reached moderate alteration which was 54 87 at the xiantao station all extreme streamflow indicators decreased and p was low alteration impact of three reservoir operation fig 7 f 7 h regarding three reservoir operation we compared a3 with s02p3 at the yujiahu station the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day to 7 day minimum streamflow increased at the huangzhuang station the 1 day 3 day and 7 day maximum streamflow and the 1 day 3 day and 7 day minimum streamflow increased at the xiantao station the 1 day and 3 day maximum streamflow increased all the alteration in extreme streamflow indicators at the three stations was low impact in extreme water conditions we compared the extreme streamflow date to understand the timing of annual extreme water conditions under reservoir operation table 7 regarding one reservoir operation the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum was later at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum was advanced at the xiangyang huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum and 1 day maximum was prior to the two reservoir operation at the yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao stations as for three reservoir operation the julian date of the annual 1 day minimum was suspended at the yujiahu huangzhuang and xiantao stations the julian date of the annual 1 day maximum has been advanced except for the xiantao station at both stations the magnitude of the extreme streamflow date change was more significant in the condition of two reservoir a2 with joint operation of two dams 3 3 3 pulse and patterns of streamflow changes in this section we compared a1 a2 and a3 with s02p1 s02p2 and s02p3 to assess the impact of reservoir operation on pulse and streamflow patterns table 8 at the xiangyang station the high pulse count and duration increased under one reservoir operation a1 condition at the yujiahu station the low pulse and duration decreased while the high duration increased under two reservoir operation a2 condition low pulse count and duration increased while low pulse count and duration decreased under three reservoir operation a3 condition at the xiangyang and yujiahu stations the streamflow pulse variation trend was similar the high and low pulse count tended to increase but the duration tended to decrease the amplitude of variation of the three reservoir operation was greater than that of one or two reservoir operation as for changes in water condition the absolute value of the descent and descent rate increased at both stations under a1 a2 and a3 conditions this implies that reservoir operation can intensify daily changes in streamflow 3 4 variation of water resource in this section we present the annual et loss and water production in the mlhr watershed combined with observed streamflow at the watershed inlet danjiangkou reservoir and watershed outlet xiantao station we estimate the available water resources and water withdrawal in the mlhr watershed the results are presented in fig 8 and in table s6 we observe the following the et loss water yield available water resource and water withdrawal fluctuated from 2000 to 2020 the years 2019 and 2020 reached the minimum and maximum annual et loss fig 8 which were 2 16 1010 and 2 91 1010 m3 respectively table s6 the annual average et loss was 2 61 1010 m3 in terms of water production the minimum and maximum were in 2019 and 2017 which were 7 67 1010 m3 and 1 91 1010 m3 respectively the annual average water yield was 1 30 1010 m3 regarding the available water resource the years of 2014 and 2010 reached the minimum and maximum which were 2 69 1010 m3 and 6 16 1010 m3 respectively the annual average available water resource was 4 23 1010 m3 as for water withdrawal the minimum and maximum were in 2004 and 2020 which were 3 24 109 m3 and 1 95 1010 m3 respectively the annual water withdrawal was 8 03 109 m3 after 2015 there was a clear upward trend in the percentage of water withdrawal fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological alterations on climate variability and land use change 4 1 1 climate variability in the mlhr the watershed inlet is the main factor controlling the streamflow regime hence the upstream watershed which contributes about 60 of the total watershed area dominate the effect of the changes that occurred in the mlhr region in particular the alteration in monthly streamflow and extreme streamflow at the downstream station are like those at watershed inlet except for a few months by comparing the periods 2000 2020 and 1980 1999 the impact on the monthly average streamflow showed intra year differences which declined in rainy season and increased in dry season fig 6a 6e the alteration in the monthly average streamflow of watershed inlet in non flood season october to may was greater than in the flood season table s4 danjiangkou reservoir is a multi year regulating reservoir which can release water for flood storage capacity in april and may discharge flood water to generate electricity from june to september dam water in october and release water for irrigation from november to march song et al 2018 in terms of extreme streamflow the results showed an increase in minimum streamflow and a decrease in maximum streamflow in the period 2000 2020 compared to the period 1980 1999 this may be relevant for the increase in the normal water level of danjiangkou reservoir in 2014 due to the increase of the dam height from 157 m to 170 m which led to a greater storage capacity and regulatory function we observed decreasing duration of extreme precipitation and increasing amount of precipitation from extreme rainfall events section 3 2 1 1 due to regional climate variability this might further alter the extreme streamflow behaviour pulse behaviour and change rates were significantly modified at the watershed inlet which was largely caused by the increasing trend of extreme precipitation upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir qi et al 2021 pan et al 2012 due to climate change and the rapid water release associated with hydropower generation from the danjiangkou reservoir yang et al 2020 kern et al 2012 changes in streamflow caused by climate variability were consistent with the watershed inlet fig 6a 6e regarding the impact of regional climate variability the intra year variation of monthly average streamflow in four stations was different this could be explained by the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the mlhr watershed section 3 2 1 1 in terms of extreme streamflow the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the tendency of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow table s5 the change in the watershed inlet is also influenced by climate variability which presented different trends in the watershed inlet and outlet precipitation is the most important factor among climate variables especially in dry season trends of precipitation extremes showed regional differences in the hanjiang river basin qin et al 2019 according to hao et al 2019 most of the mlhr area is homogenous in terms of extreme precipitation events which are totally different from the danjiangkou reservoir upstream annual rainfall showed an opposite trend in the mlhr compared to upstream of the danjiangkou reservoir qi et al 2021 pan et al 2012 similar results of the precipitation effects on streamflow were also observed in other studies mahmoodi et al 2021 konapala et al 2020 han et al 2019 across the entire hanjiang river basin the projected total precipitation in the future scenario shows an upward trend but intensified spatial heterogeneity in particular the upper and lower hanjiang river basin area would tend to be wetter while the middle hanjiang river basin area would experience less precipitation jin et al 2021 yu et al 2017 this uneven regional distribution of precipitation could further exacerbate the complexity of the hydrological regime in the mlhr in the future 4 1 2 land use change cropland is the main land use type in the mlhr watershed fig 5 and rice is the main crop yu et al 2018 compared to the period 1980 1999 land use change was more drastic after 2000 streamflow tended to decrease in the mlhr watershed under the impact of land use change we compared the runoff contribution rates table s7 and average runoff depth fig s8 of different lulc types in the mlhr cropland contributed the largest part of runoff followed by forestland grass land and construction land the average runoff depth of cropland was 250 2 mm ranked fifth among the six lulc types the area of cropland accounted for more than half of the mlhr watershed and nearly half of the runoff was generated by cropland from 2000 to 2020 the decrease of cropland in the mlhr watershed was the main cause of streamflow decrease in the land use change previous study has mentioned about the high intensity of land use and increasing development and utilization the mlhr yu et al 2010 demand for agricultural development can increase the demand for surface runoff in irrigation and result in lower streamflow in the growing season agricultural intensification was inferred as a dominant factor in decreasing streamflow by vicente serrano et al 2019 a similar streamflow trend caused by agricultural land was also observed by vaighan et al 2017 and sharma et al 2019 climate variability and land use change are interlinked factors that can lead to changes in the river flow regime nkhoma et al 2021 compared with climate variability the impact of land use change on the streamflow is relatively minor in the mlhr watershed we can observe that climate variability is the main regional driver of net changes in the natural hydrological regime this has also been reported in other large basins nkhoma et al 2021 truong et al 2018 fazel et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 4 2 hydrologic alterations in reservoir operation dams can change the degree timing and duration of flows especially peak flow gierszewski et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 lu et al 2018a mailhot et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 in terms of monthly streamflow conditions a1 to a3 presented highly differentiated results in the four stations operating the wangfuzhou reservoir alone condition a1 increased monthly streamflow in the most months in xiangyang however the monthly streamflow downstream from huangzhuang and xiantao condition a2 decreased by more months under the combined operation of wangfuzhou reservoir and cuijiaying reservoir the downstream change was relatively greater compared to condition a1 and a2 the change was more evident at three stations in condition a3 this may be related to the full operation of the cascading reservoirs formed by the simultaneous operation of the three reservoirs which improved the use of water resources wangfuzhou reservoir cuijiaying reservoir and xinglong reservoir are intended for different applications and this application had a dominant effect on the runoff changes caused by the reservoir operation in particular the wangfuzhou reservoir is intended for hydropower the cuijiaying reservoir is for navigation and hydropower while the xinglong reservoir is mainly for flood control zhongnan enginneering corporation limited 2015 regarding extreme streamflow the alteration in maximum streamflow in huangzhuang and xiantao was more evident although the primary function of wangfuzhou reservoir and cuijiaying reservoir is not flood control the reservoir also has a certain flood regulation capacity on the one hand this phenomenon may be caused by the underestimation of the flood during the simulation fig s9 according to the review of swat applications under hydroclimatic extremes tan et al 2020 peak flow simulation showed better performance with sub daily scale rainfall input the mlhr watershed cover a large catchment area of 6 38 104 km2 simulation with 16 weather stations and daily scale data may not be able to accurately reflect streamflow dynamic under extreme rainfall processes conversely it could also be due to the construction and operation of the cascade reservoirs which improved the regional standard of flood control and enhanced the management and application of water resources the timing of the annual extreme flow in all three periods of reservoir operation was significantly affected among these three reservoirs the cuijiaying reservoir had the greatest impact due to the larger storage capacity the pulse behaviour and change rates were significantly altered with the combined operation of the reservoir cascade the degree of alteration was different between the three time periods on the one hand the primary purpose of the reservoir can result in different impacts the distinct impact of flood control dominated and hydropower dominated reservoirs from iha indicators such as low pulse counts and multi day minimum flow has also been reported by other studies gierszewski et al 2020 lu et al 2018a on the other hand several important tributaries such as the tangbai river and the man river are located between the reservoir and the stations which also imposed changes in the streamflow and altered flow regime previous study showed that dam construction would significantly alter the count and duration of flow pulses zheng et al 2019 the result of this study showed a trend towards an increase in counts but a reduction in duration under reservoir operation the counter regulatory effect of dams on upstream flow such as the impact of the xinglong reservoir at the huangzhuang station was observed in this study and reported in other regions ali et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 as the absolute value of change caused by reservoir operation was greater than climate change and land use change table s4 s5 the result further proved that dams usually play a dominant control over streamflow overcoming other factors han et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 from the results summarized in section 3 2 we can conclude that climate variability was the main reason for maximum streamflow in wet season such as floods and low runoff in dry season at the mlhr similar results were also reported in other basins chai et al 2019 hecht et al 2019 the cascading reservoir operation at the mlhr could further alert the effects of climate change and promote water use the adjustment effect of reservoir operation on the effect of climate change was also reported in the south fork boise river and the lancang mekong river basin benjankar et al 2018 wang et al 2017a from a global viewpoint boulange et al 2021 reported that dams can counteract the risk of climate impact floods previous studies have shown that the combined effect of reservoir operation dam construction and climate change can significantly alter river flow variability sanyal et al 2021 hoang et al 2019 yang et al 2019 mittal et al 2016 we also verified the dominant role of cascading reservoirs in coping with the effects of climatic variability 4 3 limitations and future work various sources of uncertainties can impact the simulated streamflow in the mlhr there are mainstream inlet gates and tributaries for agricultural use in the mlhr whose impact could not be separated due to insufficient observed data despite the agreement between simulation and observation in mainstream of the mlhr the performance of the model can be further improved with more data from reservoir operation and water withdrawal in the future there is an inter basin water transfer project implemented in 2014 called changjiang hanjiang water transfer project zhou et al 2017 which transfers water from the yangtze river to the mlhr downstream of the xinglong reservoir as there were no observed data this effect was not considered in this study furthermore there is uncertainty in converting lulc to a non real condition to separate the effect of human activities and climate change on the streamflow dey and mishra 2017 with more monitoring data in the future model simulation can improve our understanding of the interactive impact of human activities and climate change 5 conclusion to investigate the effects of cascading reservoir operation climate variability and land use change on the streamflow regime in the mlhr a scenario comparison approach based on the swat model and iha was introduced the calibration and validation results confirmed that the swat model can serve as an appropriate tool to simulate streamflow in the mlhr 1 the watershed inlet is the main factor controlling the streamflow regime in the mlhr climate variability is the main regional driver of net changes to the natural hydrological regime in the mlhr our results showed that monthly streamflow declined increased in rainy dry season we also found that minimum streamflow increased and maximum streamflow decreased the impact of climate variability in the regional basin would weaken the increase in the magnitude of minimum streamflow at the watershed inlet and weaken the tendency of decreasing the short term maximum streamflow 2 compared to climate variability the impact of land use change on streamflow was relatively small in the mlhr watershed streamflow tended to decrease under the impact of land use change we found that the decrease of cropland in the mlhr watershed was the main cause of streamflow decrease in the land use change 3 cascade dams significantly regulated water in all seasons and controlled the flow pattern the operation of the cascade reservoir in the mlhr could further alert the effects of climate change and promote the use of water our results showed that the alteration of monthly streamflow was more evident in the operation of three reservoirs compared to the operation of one and two reservoirs the alteration degree p was of low alteration in three stations under one reservoir operation with the operation of the cascade reservoirs there was an increase in p reaching moderate alteration we also found that the effects of cascading reservoir operation on extreme streamflow varied significantly in different stations huangzhuang station had the most evident alteration among the four stations the timing of the annual extreme flow in all three periods of reservoir operation was significantly affected 4 the et loss water yield available water resource and water withdrawal in the mlhr watershed fluctuated during 2000 2020 we found that the annual average et loss was 2 61 1010 m3 the annual average water yield was 1 30 1010 m3 the annual average available water resource was 4 23 1010 m3 and the annual water withdrawal was 8 03 109 m3 after 2015 there was a clear increase trend in the percentage of water withdrawal in this study the comparison approach enabled us to distinguish the impacts of the cascading reservoir operation on the streamflow regime of climate variability and land use change this study should improve the understanding of the hydrological impacts of human activities in the cascading reservoir and land use change in the mlhr under climate change funding sources this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 41877531 the national

7833,study region the aure valley in the french pyrenees study focus this study applies a bottom up framework for assessing water management vulnerability in terms of hydropower production environmental regulations and reservoir storage management by integrating the sensitivity the management metrics with the participation of stakeholders and the exposure of the water system the hydrological model gr6j cemaneige is implemented to simulate the management metrics in the study region the sensitivity of management metrics to climate change is investigated by comparing simulation results under current climate conditions and under perturbed climate series results are demonstrated with response surfaces which are overlaid with the predefined thresholds of management metrics the thresholds help identifying climate conditions that are critical for water management plausible climate change pathways are displayed on the response surfaces to assess the probability of critical conditions new hydrological insights for the region results show that annual hydropower production is mostly vulnerable to future drier conditions environmental metrics are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes while the current policy render the low flow management less susceptible to risks reservoir storage management is found to be extremely sensitive to temperature increase that induces an earlier snowmelt although downstream water use is less vulnerable to climate change even under a high greenhouse gases emissions scenario more intense water competition among stakeholders could be foreseen corresponding adaptation actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability graphical abstract keywords water resource management climate change bottom up approach

are of great importance for ecosystems and human society water use barnett et al 2005 viviroli et al 2011 immerzeel et al 2019 water in these mountains is stored as snowpack or glacier in the cold season and melts in the warm season to naturally sustain low flows however climate change significantly impacts the snow accumulation melting patterns thus altering hydrological regimes and

continues to increase under three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 while precipitation changes were not clear due to model uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity

irrigation is the leading consumptive use of water in downstream areas for maize cropping in southern france and wheat and barley cropping in northern spain irrigation management is threatened by a decreasing water availability and an increasing water demand due to climate change e g lópez moreno et al 2008a majone et al 2012 lópez moreno et al 2014 senthilkumar et al 2015 caubel et al 2018 haro monteagudo et al 2020 investigated the largest irrigation system of europe in the spanish pyrenees under climate change scenarios and showed that a decrease of available water for summer irrigation similar results are found for the yesa reservoir in the spanish pyrenees with reduced water inflow from the upper basin and an earlier spring snow melt which accounts for the limited water availability to meet the irrigation demand in summer lópez moreno et al 2014 besides the increasing water demand that could be attributed to increased crop evapotranspiration by warming climate and enlarged cropland is challenging water management for irrigation lópez moreno et al 2008a majone et al 2012 senthilkumar et al 2015 caubel et al 2018 regarding hydropower generation hendrickx and sauquet 2013 developed a simplified hydropower reservoir management model based on dynamic programming to simulate dam operations in the ariège river basin in the french pyrenees results demonstrated that hydropower generation in winter is projected to decrease due to a reduced annual inflow and an earlier snow melt if reservoir operations remain unchanged the management of other water provisioning services such as drinking water could also be considerably affected with less water yield and more sediment retention in the reservoirs e g bangash et al 2013 the flood events in the pyrenean regions are complex within both meteorological and hydrological processes while climate change is likely to impair flood control as snowmelt contributes to amplifying the flooding duration instead of triggering the events e g garcía ruiz et al 2011 pino et al 2016 morán tejeda et al 2019 furthermore the overall reduced water resource brings about intensive water competition rendering water management rather challenging in the pyrenees given the adverse impact of climate change on pyrenean water resources and water management adaptation strategies are thus highlighted and a comprehensive assessment under climate change is fundamental to adaptation design in general the top down and bottom up approaches are two main frameworks to assess water resource and management under climate change typically the top down approach projects future climate under different emission scenarios by using global climate models gcms whose outputs are downscaled to match regional spatio temporal scales and projections are then forced into an integrated water resource system model to compare with current system performance e g schaefli 2015 vidal et al 2016 however the top down approach is reported to cascade uncertainty through the modelling chain and fails to testing more extreme climate change scenarios wilby and dessai 2010 brown and wilby 2012 the alternative bottom up approach shifts attention to assessing the system vulnerability to a wide range of scenarios generated by either parametric or stochastic perturbation of historical climate drivers this approach is flexible and advantageous in identifying which climatic variables the system is sensitive to culley et al 2016 several frameworks based on the bottom up approach have been proposed in the literature such as scenario neutral e g prudhomme et al 2010 sauquet et al 2019 decision scaling e g brown et al 2012 ray et al 2020 and robust decision making e g lempert et al 2006 kasprzyk et al 2013 the scenario neutral sn approach distinguishes from the others in leaving decision processes to the decision maker prudhomme et al 2015 prudhomme et al 2010 suggested that the sn approach can be combined with the top down approach by placing climate change projections at a later stage to inform future risk this approach has been applied to climate change assessment for natural flow sensitivity

present the vulnerability of water management in the pyrenees under climate change and to propose several adaptation strategies taking the example of the aure valley where water resources are mainly used for hydropower generation downstream water use irrigation drinking water and industrial use and low flow support this study makes several contributions to the current literature first methodologically we have used the management metrics that are based on the stakeholders experience for water uses and on the mandatory legislation for the environment identifying management metrics together with stakeholders is beneficial in developing adaptation strategies that have practical significance second in terms of local climate change impact studies this paper constitutes the first bottom up analysis of water management under climate change in the pyrenees the analysis provides complementary insights into water management vulnerability in the pyrenean region the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area section 3 explores the data and methods involved in analysing water management vulnerability results and discussions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 study area water resources in the pyrenees plays an important role in addressing the issue of water shortage during summer in the south of france known as the gascogne region see the left top map in fig 1 a this intensive agriculture region in the lannemezan plateau does not benefit from mountainous snowmelt because it is separated from the pyrenees leenhardt et al 2004a b an artificial channel the neste canal not shown in the map connects the gascogne region with a pyrenean valley the aure valley at sarrancolin to provide stable water supply therefore the aure valley upstream of sarrancolin is selected as a representative example of complexity with competing water uses the aure valley is located in the centre of the french pyrenees fig 1 a shows the topographic characteristics of the aure valley including the four corresponding sub basins the sub basins sb1 3 upstream the reservoirs oule orédon caillaouas and pouchergues and the intermediate catchment sb4 between the outlets of the reservoirs and sarrancolin the influence of westerly winds which carry moist air from the atlantic ocean is less effective in the aure valley than further west due to the blocking of the massifs ingrand 1961 in addition southern heat penetrates through the border ridge particularly affecting the upper valley and snowmelt dominates spring flows table 1 summarizes the physiographic and hydro climatic characteristics for the study area the major water use in the valley is hydropower generation décamps 1967 two main hydroelectricity producers in the valley are the shem company 1 1 société hydro electrique du midi www shem fr is a french electricity producing company a subsidiary of engie group that manages the several reservoirs in orange in fig 1 b of the valley and edf 2 2 electricité de france www edf fr is a french electric utility company that manages the westernmost part of the valley including the cap de long aubert and aumar reservoirs in fig 1 b natural water flow to the aure valley is partly diverted the westernmost part is transferred outside the valley and is thus not considered in this study water in the oule and orédon reservoirs generates hydropower in the eget plant while water in caillaouas and pouchergues reservoirs generates hydropower through a cascade of plants the louron system shown in fig 1 b note that the drainage area upstream the pouchergues reservoir includes two parts and water in the left part water intake from the aygne tortes lake is transferred into the pouchergues reservoir in the right part besides water resource in sb4 also contributes to plants downstream lassoula e g tramezaygues as shown in fig 1 b the management of the four reservoirs is made on an annual basis the annual operation process starts from the beginning of april till the end of march of the next year in addition to hydropower generation the water system in the valley is oriented to provide at most 48 mm 3 of water for uses irrigation drinking water industrial use and ecological flows in the gascogne region the mandatory environmental legislation furthermore requires that the river flow at sarrancolin where water extraction takes place should be larger than 4 m 3 s if not maintained either more water out of the reservoirs in the aure valley or less water abstraction at sarrancolin for downstream use will be conducted to simplify the study case the two hypotheses are 1 sb4 is seen as near natural due to the comparatively small regulation storage of the reservoirs in this sub basin 2 the caillaouas and the pouchergues reservoirs can be considered as a single one because they are jointly managed 3 data and methods the vulnerability assessment of water resource and management in the pyrenean aure valley under climate change is conducted by applying the sn framework prudhomme et al 2010 a schematic flowchart of the overall analytic framework is given in fig 2 the sn framework evaluates vulnerability by comparing plausible climate projections to the predefined thresholds of water management metrics based on the knowledge of system sensitivity to the changes of climatic drivers prudhomme et al 2013a b to implement the sensitivity analysis of water management the responses of the water system s performance indicators are assessed through a spectrum of perturbed climate scenarios generated from the baseline climate given this the water resource system in the aure valley is simulated by a rainfall runoff model the management metrics with their associated thresholds are designed through participatory meetings among stakeholders including shem to investigate water management vulnerability details of the key steps that involves data models and the sn framework are provided in the following subsections 3 1 climatic drivers 3 1 1 baseline climate safran reanalyses the near surface meteorological reanalysis safran piragua that focuses on the pyrenees is used in this study for driving the hydrological modelling this dataset is a high resolution 2 5 km 2 5 km surface reanalysis based on the safran algorithm obtained by merging the safran france reanalysis product vidal et al 2010 and the safran spain reanalysis product quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 it provides daily climate information of air temperature and precipitation the potential evapotranspiration information is calculated from the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 catchment scale climatic data of the study area is computed with a weighted mean of all cells intersected by the catchment surface the safran piragua dataset is available from 09 1979 to 08 2014 the safran france dataset is also used when the calibration period of hydrological modelling is not overlapped with the safran piragua dataset see e g table 3 the safran france dataset is available from 08 1958 to 07 2018 3 1 2 snow product the gap filled modis modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer https modis gsfc nasa gov is an important instrument embedded in the terra and aqua satellites to measure the dynamics in earth s processes such as snow cover vegetation index and land surface temperature daily snow cover products are adopted in this study to calibrate the hydrological model however the missing snow cover observations from satellites due to the coverage of clouds make it difficult to acquire a full temporal description on the study area gascoin et al 2015 developed a cloud free snow cover product in the pyrenees based on the modis products and a gap filling algorithm the accuracy of the gap filled modis products was validated against in situ snow observations and landsat data in the pyrenees range the resolution of this gap filled snow product is consistent with the original modis snow product 0 5 km 0 5 km the dynamics of catchment scale snow cover can thus be computed with a weighted mean of all contributive cells to the catchment surface time series of snow cover area sca were derived from the modis data over the period from 09 2000 to 04 2018 3 1 3 climate change projections climate projections considered here originate from a subset of 6 cmip5 gcms as shown in table 2 and previously selected for assessing future water resource in spain run under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 cedex mapama 2017 these projections have been previously downscaled with an analogue downscaling method to generate daily total precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature over a 5 km 5 km grid for spain and the pyrenees within the climpy project amblar francés et al 2017 amblar francés et al 2020 the climpy projections have been here further refined in order to match both the higher spatial resolution and the multiple variables of the safran piragua surface reanalysis to this aim a multi site and multi variable analogue resampling method has been set up following the approach proposed by clemins et al 2019 results are therefore daily gridded projections over the safran piragua grid with all corresponding variables including precipitation and temperature required for the hydrological models for 6 gcms run under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios for the whole 1961 2100 period here these projections are used to calculate the climate change trajectories under both rcps for time slices from 1980s to 2090s total 12 time slices and each time slice referring a period of 20 years e g 1980s the period of 1971 1990 the benchmark period is from 1979 to 2014 so as to be in line with safran piragua 3 2 naturalized inflow river flow in the aure valley is highly influenced due to the intensive development of hydropower ingrand 1961 décamps 1967 a study was conducted by falgon 2014 to reconstruct natural inflows upstream the reservoirs sb1 3 in the aure valley applying a water balance approach the principle of this approach is to sum up all exports for water use and to subtract all imports from other basins thus the naturalized inflow in sb4 is the observed river discharge at sarrancolin minus the observed outflows upstream the reservoirs the naturalized inflows is at daily time step and the data length is from 01 2001 to 12 2018 for sb1 sb3 and sb4 however the data length for sb2 is from 07 2014 to 12 2018 3 3 hydrological modelling the conceptual lumped rainfall runoff model gr6j developed to improve low flow simulation based on the extensively used gr4j model perrin et al 2003 for french basins was adopted to simulate the daily inflow into the reservoirs of the water system pushpalatha et al 2011 the gr6j model was largely applied in studies including reconstruction of low flow events e g caillouet et al 2017 climate change projections e g givati et al 2019 and streamflow forecasts e g crochemore et al 2016 the gr6j model can thus be coupled with a semi distributed snow accounting routine cemaneige that exploits snow information for five attitudinal layers of equal area valéry et al 2014a b recent developments have improved the performance of snow cover simulation by using modis observations riboust et al 2018 the cemaneige module takes account of the snow accumulation and melting hysteresis between sca snow cover area and swe snow water equivalent which is the dynamic lag between the two states of snow the gr6j hydrological model has six parameters to calibrate while the cemaneige module has four parameters to calibrate the coupled gr6j cemaneige model should be calibrated to the two benchmark observations naturalized inflow and sca from the gap filled modis product the calibration process is illustrated as follows first a root square transformation on runoff is chosen to reduce the bias towards high or low flows garcia et al 2017 second the kge criterion was used to assess the model performance kling et al 2012 and its formulation is presented below 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient β the percentage bias and γ the ratio of the coefficient of variation between simulation and observation third an objective function f that involves the two observations should be optimized and its formulation is presented below where a is the weighting coefficient for runoff q calibration b i the weighting coefficient for s c a i calibration of elevation zone i we follow here riboust et al 2018 who concluded that 75 weighting on runoff with 5 on each elevation zone gives a satisfactory compromise for the overall model performance the calibrated hydrological model will be run under baseline and perturbed climate over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 to simulate water resource conditions in the sn framework as shown in fig 2 3 4 the sn framework for water management 3 4 1 the sn concept contrary to the traditional top down approach the sn framework investigates water management issues under climate change by underlining the sensitivity of water systems to changes the vulnerability analysis in the sn framework depends on three concepts the sensitivity the exposure and the performance metric of the water system prudhomme et al 2010 2013a b brown and wilby 2012 sauquet et al 2019 sensitivity is the response of the water system to changes and section 3 4 2 presents how the sensitivity domain is calculated exposure is the climatic changes to which the water system could be exposed and section 3 1 3 details the regional climate projections used in this study the performance metric is the relevant management indicator to characterize the system and its adaptive capacity threshold beyond which the system performs unsatisfactorily or cannot withstand the impact of climate change section 3 4 3 presents the performance metrics associated with water management for this study as such by understanding the sensitivity and the plausible exposure of the water system a vulnerability assessment that compares changes to the predefined management metrics can be provided 3 4 2 sensitivity domain three steps are involved to produce the sensitivity domain the generation of perturbed climate scenarios the response simulation and the response plotting perturbed climate scenarios can be generated either by parametric methods e g culley et al 2016 sauquet et al 2019 or stochastic methods e g guo et al 2017 here the historical climatic data from the safran piragua over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 is perturbed by the delta change method based on the single harmonic function prudhomme et al 2010 the sensitivity domain of the water system to climate change is quantified from the key climatic variables which are precipitation and temperature the detailed calculation steps are provided in the supplementary material finally a set of 75 precipitation and 35 temperature scenarios has been generated and combined see fig 3 resulting in a total of 2625 precipitation and temperature perturbation combinations used to define the climate sensitivity domain the colour spectrum in fig 3 a indicates that annual change of precipitation ranges from 720 to 400 mm and the annual change of temperature ranges from 0 5 to 9 5 c in fig 3 b the subsequent step is the response simulation that involves forcing the 2625 scenarios into the calibrated hydrological model to simulate the response of the water system to changes following fig 2 the final step is the response plotting that employs the 2d response surface to illustrate the sensitivity of the water system to changes in precipitation and temperature additional analysis is necessary to identify the climate variables i e seasonal annual precipitation changes and seasonal annual precipitation changes by which the water system is mostly influenced the climate variables with the largest influence on the water system are chosen as the axes for the response surfaces precipitation changes as x axis and temperature changes as y axis following sauquet et al 2019 regression analysis between the response simulation results and the climate variables is applied to determine the most appropriate axes for the response plotting the climate variables with the highest correlation to the response simulation results are the most relevant axes 3 4 3 water management metrics this section presents the management relevant metrics that can be characterized by hydrological modelling in this study three water management metrics are chosen based on workshops with local stakeholders in terms of hydropower production ecological flow management and reservoir refill management 1 annual inflow volume qa for hydropower system production 2 seasonal failure days to meet the need of mandatory ecological flow doe at sarrancolin as well as the timing of failure tdoe the first day of the year when the failure appears 3 seasonal duration of no snow cover area nsa for system eget and louron as well as the timing of no snow cover area tnsa the first day of the year when there is no snow cover water resource in the system eget and louron is managed by shem for hydropower production the energy market in france is mostly nuclear hydropower mixed nuclear plants provide base load and hydropower is generated to meet peak demands the electricity price in the market fluctuates depending on the weather and other external factors such as gas price based on the experience of the water managers from shem the eget system is cost effective when the annual water inflow into the reservoirs ranges from 28 2 to 41 6 mm 3 for eget 21 9 to 28 2 mm 3 for lassoula besides there is a water contract for downstream water supply irrigation drinking water and industrial water use extracted from the four reservoirs with at most 48 mm 3 each year according to shem the necessary water volume for shem to be cost effective shows an increasing tendency towards the maximum values therefore we consider the worst market scenario which is 41 6 mm 3 for the eget plant and 28 2 mm 3 for the lassoula plant and the highest scenario of downstream water demand which is 48 mm 3 as the thresholds for hydropower production in the vulnerability assessment the worst market scenario needs the highest annual water inflow which implies that water value is low in the energy market and that shem has to produce more energy release more water to achieve the cost effectiveness the doe requirement indicates that water flow at sarrancolin should be larger than 4 m 3 s while this rule can be violated for 90 days over the low flow period summer and early autumn months thus the threshold value for doe is the value of 90 days and those for tdoe are the beginning of low flow period july to october we concentrate the environmental management over the july to october period because it is a critical period with potentially environmental management issues and the downstream water demand extracted at sarrancolin is intensive in this period the use of snow information is meant to test if the current refill strategy is still reliable under climate change as the storage management of reservoirs is based on how snow changes the metrics of the duration and timing when there is no snow cover in the two systems are used to inform the risk of reservoir storage management under climate change however there is no specifically predefined metric for the duration of no snow cover we used here the concept of time of emergence climate conditions under which significant changes in the distribution of mean nsa time series emerge from that of current climate state can be used as the threshold of nsa to imply the necessity of changing reservoir refill strategy in this study the kolmogorov smirnov ks test is conducted to quantitatively compare the probability distribution functions of the time series of mean nsa under one perturbed climate scenario and these under the baseline climate scenario the ks test gives a decision value true or false for the null hypothesis that the time series of mean nsa from the perturbed climate scenario are sampled from the same distribution of these under the baseline climate scenario in this study the null hypothesis is rejected at 95 confidence level p value smaller than 0 05 as such time series of mean nsa under total 2625 perturbed climate scenarios are compared with the baseline climate scenario to determine under which climate conditions the significant changes in the distribution of mean nsa occur for both eget and lassoula systems thus the occurrences of the significant changes are used as the thresholds for the management metric nsa of the eget and lassoula systems similar application of the ks test to investigate the impact of climate change on water resource can be found in the literature e g gaetani et al 2020 muelchi et al 2021 in terms of the thresholds of tnsa the beginning dates of reservoir refill months are based on the current management experience from shem april to june for the eget system and april to july for the lassoula system 4 results 4 1 hydrological model performance the hydrological model gr6j cemaneige was applied to simulate water resource in the water system of the aure valley the outputs including daily q and sca changes are evaluated with the kge criterion kling et al 2012 by comparing to naturalized inflow and observed sca derived from the modis images respectively table 3 shows the kge values for the four studied basins and the results indicate that the model performs satisfactorily with all kge values of q and sca above 0 7 the performance of the gr6j cemaneige model in reproducing seasonal dynamics is illustrated in fig 4 with simulated discharges compared to naturalized discharges and simulated median sca patterns compared to observed median sca patterns the simulated q follows the variability of the naturalized inflow and can capture the high peaks and low flow spells especially the recession limbs during summer period are well fitted however the hydrological model tends to underestimate spring flow and to overestimate winter flow for sb1 4 note that the hydrological model has a lower performance for sb2 partly due to the short record of naturalized inflow the module cemaneige can well reproduce the seasonality of snow cover changes in the five elevation bands fig 4 as well as the accumulation phase of snow and relatively tardy melting processes besides higher attitudinal elevation band shows longer snow cover duration as expected however the snow melting process simulation is less efficient than the snow accumulation process given the simple characteristics of the empirical degree day model in representing snow thermal state changes riboust et al 2018 sca variations for sb1 4 are well simulated with a high performance in high elevation bands and a moderate performance in median elevation bands this can be attributed to the high variability of snow cover in moderate elevation bands which is difficult to represent in the model finally the water management metrics are calculated based on both simulated q and sca and then compared to the observed ones as shown in table 4 the management metrics qa nsa and tnsa are calculated for sb1 3 to investigate the accuracy of the model in reproducing hydropower indices and snow changes for reservoir refill the management metrics doe and tdoe are computed for the sarrancolin catchment to show the accuracy of the model in reproducing environmental indices the simulated natural discharge of the sarrancolin catchment is the sum of the simulated discharges of sb1 4 the simulations of management metrics are generally satisfactory however the simulations of doe and tdoe can be questioned since there is no naturalized discharge available at sarrancolin note that few days with flow under the mandatory ecological requirement are simulated by the model here an incomplete estimate is given by the sum of naturalized discharges for the drainage area of sb1 sb3 and sb4 which stands for 98 of the sarrancolin catchment for the period from 01 2001 to 08 2014 the calculated observed doe and tdoe metrics for this incomplete estimate are 0 1 days and 03 oct respectively these results are consistent with simulations for the period from 01 2001 to 08 2014 the simulated tdoe under both 2001 2014 and 1979 2014 periods 02 oct and 20 sep respectively have a difference of less than two weeks but locate in the early autumn which is rather acceptable if we consider climate variability under current climate condition based on these considerations and because low flows are globally well reproduced we can trust the simulation results of doe and tdoe moreover management metric simulation of sb2 returns lower performance due to its lower quality of naturalized inflow table 5 summarizes the reference values of these management metrics for the water systems in the aure valley under baseline climate these values are calculated with the safran piragua dataset over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 to represent the current management performance 4 2 water management sensitivity analysis water management metrics qa nsa and tnsa for the eget and lassoula systems doe and tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are generated through the calibrated gr6j cemaneige model forced with the total 2625 perturbed climate scenarios as described in section 3 4 2 the calculated 2625 values of each management metric are classified into groups and each group incorporates several perturbed climate scenarios at least 5 that gather the close precipitation and temperature values as such the classified groups can be localized in the response surface space with average precipitation and temperature changes of the scenarios in the groups the classified groups are symbolized as circles with colour gradient indicating the average management metric values and with size indicating the standard deviation sd of the scenarios in the groups fig 5 displays the 2d response surfaces developed for water management metrics and associated study area concerning the mean value changes of the response surfaces the management metrics degrade when climate conditions are warmer and drier the values of sd display a patchier pattern for both nsa and tnsa than other metrics large values of sd may reveal transition zones of the hydrological regime and high sensitivity to the way changes see section 3 4 2 are distributed within the year the response surfaces of qa for the eget and lassoula systems are generated over the whole year period to investigate the annual water volume that is potential for hydropower production the response surfaces of doe and tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are generated over july to october period when environmental flow management is usually menaced by low water availability and high irrigation water demand downstream the response surfaces of nsa and tnsa for the eget and lassoula systems are generated for december to august period that incorporates the actual reservoir refill management timing from the beginning of april to the end of july besides based on the regression analysis the most appropriate axes of the response surfaces of nsa and tnsa are winter spring december to may precipitation changes as x axis and spring march to may temperature changes as y axis this also suggests that winter spring precipitation and spring temperature dominate the snowmelt process from fig 5 qa for both eget and lassoula systems are more sensitive to precipitation changes and qa decreases with the decrease of precipitation it is also notable that qa of the eget system is slightly responsive to temperature because the increase in pet associated with temperature increase can compensate the increase in precipitation and thus qa of the eget system is decreased in contrast the lassoula system does not clearly show this character this can be explained by the different land cover types of the two hydropower systems the eget system that includes sb1 and sb2 is covered with forest and meadow active evapotranspiration processes while the lassoula system that only includes sb3 is covered with bare rocks no water demand from vegetation as such the evapotranspiration is more intensive in the eget system where vegetation cover is developed which results in a higher temperature sensitivity of qa in the eget system than the lassoula system fig 5 shows that doe and its associated tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes in july to october period doe becomes longer while tdoe becomes earlier with the increase of temperature and the decrease of precipitation as the sarrancolin catchment is covered by vegetation mainly forest in the most part an increase in temperature leads to higher evapotranspiration and thus less water availability during july to october period the effect of reducing precipitation by around 100 mm for both doe and tdoe is close to the effect of increasing temperature by around 10 to 12 c in regard to nsa and tnsa for the two hydropower systems the contrasting sensitivity to temperature changes is highlighted in fig 5 the values of nsa becomes longer and tnsa becomes earlier with the increase of temperature when the increase of temperature is relatively limited less than 3 c the precipitation changes in the winter spring period also have an impact on these metrics however when the temperature increase exceeds 3 to 4 c the impact of precipitation on both nsa and tnsa metrics is no more obvious and changes in these two metrics are predominantly controlled by temperature change for example the effect of increasing temperature by 1 to 2 c for the eget system is close to the effect of reducing precipitation by 300 mm the high sensitivity of pyrenean snow to temperature changes is also reported in other studies e g lópez moreno et al 2008b 2012 2017 lópez moreno et al 2017 explained that the snow state in the pyrenees is warm and thick and thus a slight increase in temperature could trigger snowmelt 4 3 water management vulnerability assessment figs 6 7 and 8 display the vulnerability of water management of the study area under climate change in regard to hydropower production environmental management and reservoir refill respectively based on the knowledge of the water management sensitivity to climate change threshold lines for each management metric that indicate the limit of the water system s satisfactory performance and climate change pathways that indicate future climate trajectories are overlaid on the sensitivity domain to assess the vulnerability climate change trajectories are presented as line linked squares for the time slices from 1980s to 2090s the mean climate driver changes are the central points ribbon squares give an insight of uncertainty on climate minimum changes are right bottom points while maximum changes are left top points of the ribbon squares hydropower management in fig 6 is generally more difficult given the future warmer and drier conditions in the eget system the current performance of value 53 3 mm 3 is not warranted anymore in most cases when annual precipitation decreases by 100 mm the threshold of 41 6 mm 3 that is the necessary water volume for hydropower production in the scenario of the lowest energy price in the market could be guaranteed under rcp 4 5 however the eget system would not be cost effective after the middle of the century under rcp 8 5 compared with the eget system the lassoula system is more vulnerable due to its threshold 28 2 mm 3 that is relatively close to the reference value 29 7 mm 3 the lassoula system would not be cost effective in most climate change scenarios of two rcps as for the total hydropower production of the two systems the current performance of value 82 9 mm 3 would not be warranted anymore under two rcps and the cost effectiveness of value 69 8 mm 3 would not be achieved under rcp 8 5 besides water demand of the downstream gascogne region which is 48 mm 3 at most could be guaranteed for most of the climate change scenarios under two rcps the demand of 48 mm 3 could not be meet if considering the conservative attitude of water managers for hydropower especially in the climate change scenarios under rcp 8 5 the vulnerability of environmental management metrics doe and tdoe during july to october period is shown in fig 7 the climate change pathways under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 are heading towards warmer and drier july to october period the current performance for both metrics would not be warranted when july to october precipitation decreases by 50 mm or july to october temperature increases by 3 c the number of doe failure days should stay below the 90 day threshold for rcp 4 5 while the threshold could be violated at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 besides the timing of doe failure is earlier under both rcps with more extreme condition for rcp 8 5 particularly at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the timing of doe failure date could occur in july when the downstream gascogne region might demand water for summer irrigation this causes water competition as either less water abstraction for irrigation or more reservoir release should be conducted to keep river flow at sarrancolin larger than 4 m 3 s nsa and tnsa are shown in fig 8 to assess the vulnerability of the current refill strategy in the response surface of nsa for the eget system the empirical distribution of nsa deviates from the current one when temperature increases by 1 c in spring and precipitation decreases of around 30 mm in the winter spring period in the lassoula system significant changes appear when temperature increases by 1 c in spring and precipitation decreases of around 60 mm in the winter spring period the duration of nsa for both systems for december to august period becomes longer under climate change trajectories of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the thresholds considered here for both systems cannot withstand most climate change projections which indicates the high vulnerability of current refill strategy to climate change and thus suggests urgent adaptation actions from the two response surfaces of tnsa tnsa for december to august period will be earlier for both systems in the worst conditions rcp 8 5 no more contribution from snow melting could be expected after may and june for eget and lassoula respectively making the target of a maximum of storage around the current dates uncertain more precisely in the current reservoir management there is a specific period dedicated to reservoir storage that is based on snow melting duration and timing april to june for the eget system and april to july for the lassoula system once the reservoirs are refilled future water uses for downstream in summer and hydropower in winter can be satisfied however the duration of nsa is longer and the timing of tnsa is earlier for both systems under climate change which implies that the contribution from snow melt to reservoir refill is shorter and the end of snow melt is earlier as such the current reservoir storage management should be adapted with the snow changes 5 discussion 5 1 contribution to bottom up studies assessing the performance of water management remains a critical challenge in the bottom up approach in another word the central question can be expressed as what is the threshold or the boundary of water management that shifts from acceptable to unacceptable the answer to this question is barely known in the hydrological community an acceptable water management activity can be related to the satisfaction of profitable safe and ecological requirements the thresholds mostly used in the literature are system performance indices such as the rrv reliability resilience and vulnerability metrics and the robustness index see applications of water supply reliability and robustness whateley et al 2014 brown et al 2012 giuliani and castelletti 2016 argued that different definitions of the system performance indices could lead to different decision making consequences some studies used the benchmarks under current climate as the thresholds to inform future management risks e g prudhomme et al 2015 broderick et al 2019 the application on the management metrics that are used by stakeholders for water management remains rare in the literature in this study we used the management metrics hydropower cost effectiveness metric qa environmental regulation metrics doe and tdoe and reservoir refill metrics nsa and tnsa centred on the stakeholders interest to investigate their vulnerability under climate change these management metrics can be simulated by hydrological modelling under current and perturbed climate conditions the thresholds of these management metrics were identified during the workshops with stakeholders the direct use of the management metric and the associated thresholds interests stakeholders in the participation of adaptation designing i e stakeholders are more familiar with these metrics than hydrologists and alternative adaptation actions that potentially change the thresholds can be tested within the vulnerability assessment see section 5 3 5 2 contribution to pyrenean studies this paper implements the first trial of the bottom up approach alternative to the traditional top down approach for the climate change impact assessment in the pyrenean region by taking the central aure valley as an example water management vulnerability in the valley in terms of hydropower qa environmental regulations doe and tdoe and reservoir refill nsa and tnsa are investigated by integrating the sensitivity of water management metrics to perturbed climate scenarios to the predefined thresholds of current management capacity and to the plausible exposure of future climate change projections previous studies applied the top down approach and demonstrated that climate change could severely impact water resource and management in the pyrenees by generating discrete snap shots of future time slices for comparison with the current state e g haro monteagudo et al 2020 however how the pyrenean water systems respond to climate change and at what degree of climate change the performance of water systems shifts from acceptable to unacceptable cannot be fully addressed by the top down approach understanding the response of pyrenean water systems to changes is critical for water managers to design mitigation and adaptation strategies the sensitivity of these three management components is studied for different temporal scales as seasonal meteorological attributes show different importance for management issues the sensitivity of qa for the selected eget and lassoula systems is studied for the whole annual scale annual precipitation was found to be a key meteorological driver for qa and consequently for hydropower production the higher sensitivity to temperature for the eget system reveals that land cover types in this catchment induces more intensive pet when temperature increases which then reduces the water availability for hydropower production still annual precipitation changes dominate the hydropower management in the two systems with moderate impact from annual temperature changes by combining the predefined threshold and plausible climate change pathways the vulnerability of hydropower can be perceived that the lassoula system is more vulnerable highlighting the need for short term actions to reduce vulnerability both doe and tdoe metrics of the sarrancolin catchment are studied for the july to october period when river flow is low and downstream irrigation demand is intensive the two metrics are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes as the sarrancolin catchment has a large soil moisture content given the warmer and drier tendency of climate change the current doe threshold of 90 days is sufficient for most climate change scenarios before the end of the century it is notable that water competition in this period should be dealt with caution as for the metrics nsa and tnsa of the two hydropower systems the study is focused on the december to august period that includes recharge and spring melting processes a higher sensitivity of both nsa and tnsa to temperature changes is observed compared to the other metrics a warmer climate will induce an earlier snowmelt whatever precipitation changes more liquid precipitation as a result of temperature increase instead of solid precipitation would flash into the reservoirs which may endanger the reservoir safety and cause water spills and losses for future use current reservoir refill strategy should be adapted to climate change the sensitivity and vulnerability analyses in the aure valley are a powerful visual aid for identifying water management problems in general hydropower production and reservoir refill are the most vulnerable management indices among the study area particularly for the lassoula system that incorporates the caillaouas and pouchergues reservoirs however the large storage volume of the caillaouas reservoir could mitigate the effect of earlier and more flashy inflow as such dedicated actions should be implemented to adapt to climate change 5 3 potential mitigation and adaptation actions on the premise of the vulnerability assessment of water management in the aure valley mitigation and adaptation actions can be adopted from two sides to reduce climate change risk water supply and demand sides jointly and independently considering the drier projections in the aure valley increasing reservoir storage is not the best move let alone the intensive investment and the concern of environment maran et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 poff et al 2015 on the contrary on the water demand side modernization of irrigation method e g sprinkler or drip irrigation system crop promotion for less water requirement and changes in crop calendars are efficient in adapting to climate change especially for the mediterranean area e g malek and verburg 2017 galindo et al 2018 harmanny and malek 2019 given the high vulnerability of hydropower production under climate change we test the adaptation strategy of increasing the current water energy transfer coefficients for the eget and lassoula systems that can be realized by increasing the turbine efficiency the current turbine efficiency values for both systems around 85 are tested to increase by 10 less water is thus needed to achieve the cost effectiveness for both systems correspondingly the thresholds of qa for both systems are reduced by a factor of 1 10 37 8 mm 3 for the eget system and 25 6 mm 3 for the lassoula system as illustrated in fig 9 the eget system can achieve the cost effectiveness in the worst market scenario till the 2060s under rcp 8 5 by this strategy compared with the original timing of the 2050s under rcp 8 5 however this strategy is more effective for the lassoula system because it enables to achieve the cost effectiveness in the worst market scenario for most climate change scenarios under rcp 4 5 and till the 2050s under the rcp 8 5 compared with the original high vulnerability to most climate change scenarios under both rcps this example illustrates how the sn framework can be used to test adaptation strategies and other actions that eventually decrease the thresholds of qa for both systems should be considered besides shifting the hydropower production from winter for heating to summer for cooling to align several water uses hydropower irrigation and environmental regulations is possible to reduce water competition in the aure valley pereira cardenal et al 2014 the original refill management that starts from april and ends in july for the two hydropower systems seems too late and too long in the face of warmer climate as such reservoir refill strategies might be changed with an earlier start and a more flexible duration increasing the reservoir spillway capacity should also be considered so as to avoid the extreme high inflow events into the reservoirs that endanger reservoir safety in particular given the small storage volume of the pouchergues reservoir and large storage volume of the caillaouas reservoir increasing the capacity of water transfer from the pouchergues to the caillaouas reservoir could mitigate water loss from spillway release however these changes should be scrutinized with caution as managers might be conservative in changes 5 4 limitations and future works this study simplifies the water management processes and thus it is important to acknowledge the limitations that are likely to induce biases in the analysis future works focusing on these limitations will help to improve the understanding of water management vulnerability in the study area firstly uncertainty is partially examined here the study focuses on climate related uncertainty exploring a broad range of climate conditions the uncertainty of water management metrics to climate change is displayed by the sd values in the response surfaces with larger sd values indicating high dispersion in values for the specified changes parts of the uncertainty are due to natural processes that are not perfectly taken into account by the models for example the snow melting process simulation is less efficient than the snow accumulation process see the sca regimes of fig 4 this results from the choice of the empirical degree day model cemaneige and the difficulties in representing snow thermal state changes riboust et al 2018 although the gr6j cemaneige model has shown satisfying performance different hydrological models show significant variations in water resource estimation e g vidal et al 2016 besides a hydrological model calibrated under current climate may not perform robustly for perturbed climate scenarios due to parameter non stationarity e g westra et al 2014 guo et al 2017 these variations would propagate to the sensitivity domain which may induce biases in the vulnerability assessment broderick et al 2019 a physically based hydrological model that explicitly simulates complex hydrological processes could be beneficial to deepen the understanding of the sensitivity to climate change therefore a multi model method that involves structurally or conceptually different hydrological models can provide valuable insights in the uncertainty quantification secondly the term vulnerability for water management in this study is not presented as a specially defined index but in a manner of description traditionally vulnerability is used to characterize the performance of water systems in terms of the severity of their failure and the mathematical definition is given in hashimoto et al 1982 some studies have examined the vulnerability of water management by calculating the water deficit to meet the total demand e g sandoval solis et al 2011 loucks and van beek 2017 haro monteagudo et al 2020 furthermore vulnerability in the bottom up framework is derived as the proportion of exposure simulations that fail below the critical threshold in sauquet et al 2019 not computed here or the combination of the three components that includes sensitivity exposure and threshold e g mastrandrea et al 2010 prudhomme et al 2013a b in the water management context the evaluation of management performance is sometimes qualitative e g reservoir refill and problematic to be simplified as an index therefore vulnerability in this study is given by subjective description with the participation of regional water stakeholders thirdly downstream water demand is assumed to be the maximum water allocation portion which is 48 mm 3 for irrigation drinking water and industrial use and to remain constant under all the scenarios investigated in the historical experience of downstream water demand the maximal value is actually reached for years 2005 47 mm 3 2006 48 mm 3 2007 48 mm 3 and 2011 48 mm 3 as such a possible adaptation strategy may suggest to increase maximum water allocation portion by making new water contracts between shem and downstream water users besides scenarios of land use and water use changes are worth being included in the sensitivity analysis previous studies highlighted land use and land cover changes mostly the forest regeneration due to warming effect in the pyrenees could yield less water availability by more intensive pet of vegetation e g lópez moreno et al 2011 morán tejeda et al 2014 buendia et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2019 finally the generation of perturbed climate scenarios is based on the delta change method that parametrically perturbs daily historical climate data with monthly change factors this method applied here for reasons of simplicity straightforward to apply has well known limitations e g not suitable for extreme events however the delta change approach was considered relevant to address the vulnerability of a system sensitive to changes in water resources alternatives to the parametric method are stochastic methods such as weather generators e g culley et al 2019 steinschneider et al 2019 in addition the climate perturbation is limited to precipitation and temperature in this study although precipitation and temperature mean changes are the main drivers in water management the investigation of other variables such as pet guo et al 2017 precipitation variability poff et al 2015 and water demand foti et al 2014 could also impact the performance of water systems 6 conclusion water resource and management in the pyrenees under climate change remains a continuous regional issue in this study we illustrated a bottom up approach to analyse the vulnerability of pyrenean water management under climate change with an example of the central aure valley to achieve this we firstly developed a hydrological model gr6j cemaneige calibrated to the naturalized inflow and observed snow cover derived from satellite images and the simulation results point to satisfactory water resource and management estimation the next step is to apply the delta change method a parametric method to perturb historical climate conditions the current and perturbed climate series are finally forced into the calibrated hydrological model to simulate potential changes of water management metrics for sensitivity analysis changes in water management metrics hydropower production environmental regulations and reservoir refill management are demonstrated by the 2d response surface in answer to precipitation and temperature changes which is visually practical in identifying the sensitivity of water management to climatic variables response surfaces overlaid with performance threshold isolines and plausible climate change pathways are essential for the exploration of key vulnerability our findings confirm the high sensitivity of water management in the aure valley to seasonal annual changes in precipitation and temperature by integrating the exposure and the performance metrics of water systems in the aure valley the vulnerability of water management under climate change can be assessed the results in the study can be summarized as follows annual hydropower production is mostly dominated by changes in annual precipitation and secondary by changes in annual temperature particularly the lassoula hydropower system is vulnerable to future drier climate conditions as the production threshold cannot be maintained under most future climate change projections the environmental regulations for the sarrancolin catchment are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes in summer and early autumn environmental management is less vulnerable to climate change while the timing of environmental water requirement would induce an intensive water competition among irrigation and hydropower reservoir refill management is extremely sensitive to changes in temperature for the winter spring summer period the earlier snowmelt induces water loss and reservoir safety issues if the refill strategy remains unchanged on the basis of these vulnerability analyses corresponding adaptation and mitigation actions can be designed to manage climate change risks non structural measures can be suggested which target the efficient use of water especially in the irrigation domain other actions such as increasing hydropower plant efficiency and increasing water transfer capacity for more flexible reservoir management could be also appreciated in mitigating hydropower losses given the earlier snowmelt reservoir refill strategy should be correspondingly adjusted accompanied with the increase of spillway capacity for the reservoir safety although there are some limitations this study demonstrated valuable insights on the impact of climate change on water resource and management by firstly applying a bottom up framework in the pyrenean region future works such as testing other hydrological models with different structure for uncertainty quantification generating perturbed climate scenarios with more extreme events testing water management stress to other climate variables or socio economic changes could advance the understanding in water management vulnerability this framework is applicable to other pyrenean regions for vulnerability assessment and adaptation design under climate change credit

7833,study region the aure valley in the french pyrenees study focus this study applies a bottom up framework for assessing water management vulnerability in terms of hydropower production environmental regulations and reservoir storage management by integrating the sensitivity the management metrics with the participation of stakeholders and the exposure of the water system the hydrological model gr6j cemaneige is implemented to simulate the management metrics in the study region the sensitivity of management metrics to climate change is investigated by comparing simulation results under current climate conditions and under perturbed climate series results are demonstrated with response surfaces which are overlaid with the predefined thresholds of management metrics the thresholds help identifying climate conditions that are critical for water management plausible climate change pathways are displayed on the response surfaces to assess the probability of critical conditions new hydrological insights for the region results show that annual hydropower production is mostly vulnerable to future drier conditions environmental metrics are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes while the current policy render the low flow management less susceptible to risks reservoir storage management is found to be extremely sensitive to temperature increase that induces an earlier snowmelt although downstream water use is less vulnerable to climate change even under a high greenhouse gases emissions scenario more intense water competition among stakeholders could be foreseen corresponding adaptation actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability graphical abstract keywords water resource management climate change bottom up approach

continues to increase under three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 while precipitation changes were not clear due to model uncertainty and spatial heterogeneity

irrigation is the leading consumptive use of water in downstream areas for maize cropping in southern france and wheat and barley cropping in northern spain irrigation management is threatened by a decreasing water availability and an increasing water demand due to climate change e g lópez moreno et al 2008a majone et al 2012 lópez moreno et al 2014 senthilkumar et al 2015 caubel et al 2018 haro monteagudo et al 2020 investigated the largest irrigation system of europe in the spanish pyrenees under climate change scenarios and showed that a decrease of available water for summer irrigation similar results are found for the yesa reservoir in the spanish pyrenees with reduced water inflow from the upper basin and an earlier spring snow melt which accounts for the limited water availability to meet the irrigation demand in summer lópez moreno et al 2014 besides the increasing water demand that could be attributed to increased crop evapotranspiration by warming climate and enlarged cropland is challenging water management for irrigation lópez moreno et al 2008a majone et al 2012 senthilkumar et al 2015 caubel et al 2018 regarding hydropower generation hendrickx and sauquet 2013 developed a simplified hydropower reservoir management model based on dynamic programming to simulate dam operations in the ariège river basin in the french pyrenees results demonstrated that hydropower generation in winter is projected to decrease due to a reduced annual inflow and an earlier snow melt if reservoir operations remain unchanged the management of other water provisioning services such as drinking water could also be considerably affected with less water yield and more sediment retention in the reservoirs e g bangash et al 2013 the flood events in the pyrenean regions are complex within both meteorological and hydrological processes while climate change is likely to impair flood control as snowmelt contributes to amplifying the flooding duration instead of triggering the events e g garcía ruiz et al 2011 pino et al 2016 morán tejeda et al 2019 furthermore the overall reduced water resource brings about intensive water competition rendering water management rather challenging in the pyrenees given the adverse impact of climate change on pyrenean water resources and water management adaptation strategies are thus highlighted and a comprehensive assessment under climate change is fundamental to adaptation design in general the top down and bottom up approaches are two main frameworks to assess water resource and management under climate change typically the top down approach projects future climate under different emission scenarios by using global climate models gcms whose outputs are downscaled to match regional spatio temporal scales and projections are then forced into an integrated water resource system model to compare with current system performance e g schaefli 2015 vidal et al 2016 however the top down approach is reported to cascade uncertainty through the modelling chain and fails to testing more extreme climate change scenarios wilby and dessai 2010 brown and wilby 2012 the alternative bottom up approach shifts attention to assessing the system vulnerability to a wide range of scenarios generated by either parametric or stochastic perturbation of historical climate drivers this approach is flexible and advantageous in identifying which climatic variables the system is sensitive to culley et al 2016 several frameworks based on the bottom up approach have been proposed in the literature such as scenario neutral e g prudhomme et al 2010 sauquet et al 2019 decision scaling e g brown et al 2012 ray et al 2020 and robust decision making e g lempert et al 2006 kasprzyk et al 2013 the scenario neutral sn approach distinguishes from the others in leaving decision processes to the decision maker prudhomme et al 2015 prudhomme et al 2010 suggested that the sn approach can be combined with the top down approach by placing climate change projections at a later stage to inform future risk this approach has been applied to climate change assessment for natural flow sensitivity

present the vulnerability of water management in the pyrenees under climate change and to propose several adaptation strategies taking the example of the aure valley where water resources are mainly used for hydropower generation downstream water use irrigation drinking water and industrial use and low flow support this study makes several contributions to the current literature first methodologically we have used the management metrics that are based on the stakeholders experience for water uses and on the mandatory legislation for the environment identifying management metrics together with stakeholders is beneficial in developing adaptation strategies that have practical significance second in terms of local climate change impact studies this paper constitutes the first bottom up analysis of water management under climate change in the pyrenees the analysis provides complementary insights into water management vulnerability in the pyrenean region the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area section 3 explores the data and methods involved in analysing water management vulnerability results and discussions are given in sections 4 and 5 respectively conclusions are finally drawn in section 6 2 study area water resources in the pyrenees plays an important role in addressing the issue of water shortage during summer in the south of france known as the gascogne region see the left top map in fig 1 a this intensive agriculture region in the lannemezan plateau does not benefit from mountainous snowmelt because it is separated from the pyrenees leenhardt et al 2004a b an artificial channel the neste canal not shown in the map connects the gascogne region with a pyrenean valley the aure valley at sarrancolin to provide stable water supply therefore the aure valley upstream of sarrancolin is selected as a representative example of complexity with competing water uses the aure valley is located in the centre of the french pyrenees fig 1 a shows the topographic characteristics of the aure valley including the four corresponding sub basins the sub basins sb1 3 upstream the reservoirs oule orédon caillaouas and pouchergues and the intermediate catchment sb4 between the outlets of the reservoirs and sarrancolin the influence of westerly winds which carry moist air from the atlantic ocean is less effective in the aure valley than further west due to the blocking of the massifs ingrand 1961 in addition southern heat penetrates through the border ridge particularly affecting the upper valley and snowmelt dominates spring flows table 1 summarizes the physiographic and hydro climatic characteristics for the study area the major water use in the valley is hydropower generation décamps 1967 two main hydroelectricity producers in the valley are the shem company 1 1 société hydro electrique du midi www shem fr is a french electricity producing company a subsidiary of engie group that manages the several reservoirs in orange in fig 1 b of the valley and edf 2 2 electricité de france www edf fr is a french electric utility company that manages the westernmost part of the valley including the cap de long aubert and aumar reservoirs in fig 1 b natural water flow to the aure valley is partly diverted the westernmost part is transferred outside the valley and is thus not considered in this study water in the oule and orédon reservoirs generates hydropower in the eget plant while water in caillaouas and pouchergues reservoirs generates hydropower through a cascade of plants the louron system shown in fig 1 b note that the drainage area upstream the pouchergues reservoir includes two parts and water in the left part water intake from the aygne tortes lake is transferred into the pouchergues reservoir in the right part besides water resource in sb4 also contributes to plants downstream lassoula e g tramezaygues as shown in fig 1 b the management of the four reservoirs is made on an annual basis the annual operation process starts from the beginning of april till the end of march of the next year in addition to hydropower generation the water system in the valley is oriented to provide at most 48 mm 3 of water for uses irrigation drinking water industrial use and ecological flows in the gascogne region the mandatory environmental legislation furthermore requires that the river flow at sarrancolin where water extraction takes place should be larger than 4 m 3 s if not maintained either more water out of the reservoirs in the aure valley or less water abstraction at sarrancolin for downstream use will be conducted to simplify the study case the two hypotheses are 1 sb4 is seen as near natural due to the comparatively small regulation storage of the reservoirs in this sub basin 2 the caillaouas and the pouchergues reservoirs can be considered as a single one because they are jointly managed 3 data and methods the vulnerability assessment of water resource and management in the pyrenean aure valley under climate change is conducted by applying the sn framework prudhomme et al 2010 a schematic flowchart of the overall analytic framework is given in fig 2 the sn framework evaluates vulnerability by comparing plausible climate projections to the predefined thresholds of water management metrics based on the knowledge of system sensitivity to the changes of climatic drivers prudhomme et al 2013a b to implement the sensitivity analysis of water management the responses of the water system s performance indicators are assessed through a spectrum of perturbed climate scenarios generated from the baseline climate given this the water resource system in the aure valley is simulated by a rainfall runoff model the management metrics with their associated thresholds are designed through participatory meetings among stakeholders including shem to investigate water management vulnerability details of the key steps that involves data models and the sn framework are provided in the following subsections 3 1 climatic drivers 3 1 1 baseline climate safran reanalyses the near surface meteorological reanalysis safran piragua that focuses on the pyrenees is used in this study for driving the hydrological modelling this dataset is a high resolution 2 5 km 2 5 km surface reanalysis based on the safran algorithm obtained by merging the safran france reanalysis product vidal et al 2010 and the safran spain reanalysis product quintana seguí et al 2016 2017 it provides daily climate information of air temperature and precipitation the potential evapotranspiration information is calculated from the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 catchment scale climatic data of the study area is computed with a weighted mean of all cells intersected by the catchment surface the safran piragua dataset is available from 09 1979 to 08 2014 the safran france dataset is also used when the calibration period of hydrological modelling is not overlapped with the safran piragua dataset see e g table 3 the safran france dataset is available from 08 1958 to 07 2018 3 1 2 snow product the gap filled modis modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer https modis gsfc nasa gov is an important instrument embedded in the terra and aqua satellites to measure the dynamics in earth s processes such as snow cover vegetation index and land surface temperature daily snow cover products are adopted in this study to calibrate the hydrological model however the missing snow cover observations from satellites due to the coverage of clouds make it difficult to acquire a full temporal description on the study area gascoin et al 2015 developed a cloud free snow cover product in the pyrenees based on the modis products and a gap filling algorithm the accuracy of the gap filled modis products was validated against in situ snow observations and landsat data in the pyrenees range the resolution of this gap filled snow product is consistent with the original modis snow product 0 5 km 0 5 km the dynamics of catchment scale snow cover can thus be computed with a weighted mean of all contributive cells to the catchment surface time series of snow cover area sca were derived from the modis data over the period from 09 2000 to 04 2018 3 1 3 climate change projections climate projections considered here originate from a subset of 6 cmip5 gcms as shown in table 2 and previously selected for assessing future water resource in spain run under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 cedex mapama 2017 these projections have been previously downscaled with an analogue downscaling method to generate daily total precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature over a 5 km 5 km grid for spain and the pyrenees within the climpy project amblar francés et al 2017 amblar francés et al 2020 the climpy projections have been here further refined in order to match both the higher spatial resolution and the multiple variables of the safran piragua surface reanalysis to this aim a multi site and multi variable analogue resampling method has been set up following the approach proposed by clemins et al 2019 results are therefore daily gridded projections over the safran piragua grid with all corresponding variables including precipitation and temperature required for the hydrological models for 6 gcms run under both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emissions scenarios for the whole 1961 2100 period here these projections are used to calculate the climate change trajectories under both rcps for time slices from 1980s to 2090s total 12 time slices and each time slice referring a period of 20 years e g 1980s the period of 1971 1990 the benchmark period is from 1979 to 2014 so as to be in line with safran piragua 3 2 naturalized inflow river flow in the aure valley is highly influenced due to the intensive development of hydropower ingrand 1961 décamps 1967 a study was conducted by falgon 2014 to reconstruct natural inflows upstream the reservoirs sb1 3 in the aure valley applying a water balance approach the principle of this approach is to sum up all exports for water use and to subtract all imports from other basins thus the naturalized inflow in sb4 is the observed river discharge at sarrancolin minus the observed outflows upstream the reservoirs the naturalized inflows is at daily time step and the data length is from 01 2001 to 12 2018 for sb1 sb3 and sb4 however the data length for sb2 is from 07 2014 to 12 2018 3 3 hydrological modelling the conceptual lumped rainfall runoff model gr6j developed to improve low flow simulation based on the extensively used gr4j model perrin et al 2003 for french basins was adopted to simulate the daily inflow into the reservoirs of the water system pushpalatha et al 2011 the gr6j model was largely applied in studies including reconstruction of low flow events e g caillouet et al 2017 climate change projections e g givati et al 2019 and streamflow forecasts e g crochemore et al 2016 the gr6j model can thus be coupled with a semi distributed snow accounting routine cemaneige that exploits snow information for five attitudinal layers of equal area valéry et al 2014a b recent developments have improved the performance of snow cover simulation by using modis observations riboust et al 2018 the cemaneige module takes account of the snow accumulation and melting hysteresis between sca snow cover area and swe snow water equivalent which is the dynamic lag between the two states of snow the gr6j hydrological model has six parameters to calibrate while the cemaneige module has four parameters to calibrate the coupled gr6j cemaneige model should be calibrated to the two benchmark observations naturalized inflow and sca from the gap filled modis product the calibration process is illustrated as follows first a root square transformation on runoff is chosen to reduce the bias towards high or low flows garcia et al 2017 second the kge criterion was used to assess the model performance kling et al 2012 and its formulation is presented below 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient β the percentage bias and γ the ratio of the coefficient of variation between simulation and observation third an objective function f that involves the two observations should be optimized and its formulation is presented below where a is the weighting coefficient for runoff q calibration b i the weighting coefficient for s c a i calibration of elevation zone i we follow here riboust et al 2018 who concluded that 75 weighting on runoff with 5 on each elevation zone gives a satisfactory compromise for the overall model performance the calibrated hydrological model will be run under baseline and perturbed climate over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 to simulate water resource conditions in the sn framework as shown in fig 2 3 4 the sn framework for water management 3 4 1 the sn concept contrary to the traditional top down approach the sn framework investigates water management issues under climate change by underlining the sensitivity of water systems to changes the vulnerability analysis in the sn framework depends on three concepts the sensitivity the exposure and the performance metric of the water system prudhomme et al 2010 2013a b brown and wilby 2012 sauquet et al 2019 sensitivity is the response of the water system to changes and section 3 4 2 presents how the sensitivity domain is calculated exposure is the climatic changes to which the water system could be exposed and section 3 1 3 details the regional climate projections used in this study the performance metric is the relevant management indicator to characterize the system and its adaptive capacity threshold beyond which the system performs unsatisfactorily or cannot withstand the impact of climate change section 3 4 3 presents the performance metrics associated with water management for this study as such by understanding the sensitivity and the plausible exposure of the water system a vulnerability assessment that compares changes to the predefined management metrics can be provided 3 4 2 sensitivity domain three steps are involved to produce the sensitivity domain the generation of perturbed climate scenarios the response simulation and the response plotting perturbed climate scenarios can be generated either by parametric methods e g culley et al 2016 sauquet et al 2019 or stochastic methods e g guo et al 2017 here the historical climatic data from the safran piragua over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 is perturbed by the delta change method based on the single harmonic function prudhomme et al 2010 the sensitivity domain of the water system to climate change is quantified from the key climatic variables which are precipitation and temperature the detailed calculation steps are provided in the supplementary material finally a set of 75 precipitation and 35 temperature scenarios has been generated and combined see fig 3 resulting in a total of 2625 precipitation and temperature perturbation combinations used to define the climate sensitivity domain the colour spectrum in fig 3 a indicates that annual change of precipitation ranges from 720 to 400 mm and the annual change of temperature ranges from 0 5 to 9 5 c in fig 3 b the subsequent step is the response simulation that involves forcing the 2625 scenarios into the calibrated hydrological model to simulate the response of the water system to changes following fig 2 the final step is the response plotting that employs the 2d response surface to illustrate the sensitivity of the water system to changes in precipitation and temperature additional analysis is necessary to identify the climate variables i e seasonal annual precipitation changes and seasonal annual precipitation changes by which the water system is mostly influenced the climate variables with the largest influence on the water system are chosen as the axes for the response surfaces precipitation changes as x axis and temperature changes as y axis following sauquet et al 2019 regression analysis between the response simulation results and the climate variables is applied to determine the most appropriate axes for the response plotting the climate variables with the highest correlation to the response simulation results are the most relevant axes 3 4 3 water management metrics this section presents the management relevant metrics that can be characterized by hydrological modelling in this study three water management metrics are chosen based on workshops with local stakeholders in terms of hydropower production ecological flow management and reservoir refill management 1 annual inflow volume qa for hydropower system production 2 seasonal failure days to meet the need of mandatory ecological flow doe at sarrancolin as well as the timing of failure tdoe the first day of the year when the failure appears 3 seasonal duration of no snow cover area nsa for system eget and louron as well as the timing of no snow cover area tnsa the first day of the year when there is no snow cover water resource in the system eget and louron is managed by shem for hydropower production the energy market in france is mostly nuclear hydropower mixed nuclear plants provide base load and hydropower is generated to meet peak demands the electricity price in the market fluctuates depending on the weather and other external factors such as gas price based on the experience of the water managers from shem the eget system is cost effective when the annual water inflow into the reservoirs ranges from 28 2 to 41 6 mm 3 for eget 21 9 to 28 2 mm 3 for lassoula besides there is a water contract for downstream water supply irrigation drinking water and industrial water use extracted from the four reservoirs with at most 48 mm 3 each year according to shem the necessary water volume for shem to be cost effective shows an increasing tendency towards the maximum values therefore we consider the worst market scenario which is 41 6 mm 3 for the eget plant and 28 2 mm 3 for the lassoula plant and the highest scenario of downstream water demand which is 48 mm 3 as the thresholds for hydropower production in the vulnerability assessment the worst market scenario needs the highest annual water inflow which implies that water value is low in the energy market and that shem has to produce more energy release more water to achieve the cost effectiveness the doe requirement indicates that water flow at sarrancolin should be larger than 4 m 3 s while this rule can be violated for 90 days over the low flow period summer and early autumn months thus the threshold value for doe is the value of 90 days and those for tdoe are the beginning of low flow period july to october we concentrate the environmental management over the july to october period because it is a critical period with potentially environmental management issues and the downstream water demand extracted at sarrancolin is intensive in this period the use of snow information is meant to test if the current refill strategy is still reliable under climate change as the storage management of reservoirs is based on how snow changes the metrics of the duration and timing when there is no snow cover in the two systems are used to inform the risk of reservoir storage management under climate change however there is no specifically predefined metric for the duration of no snow cover we used here the concept of time of emergence climate conditions under which significant changes in the distribution of mean nsa time series emerge from that of current climate state can be used as the threshold of nsa to imply the necessity of changing reservoir refill strategy in this study the kolmogorov smirnov ks test is conducted to quantitatively compare the probability distribution functions of the time series of mean nsa under one perturbed climate scenario and these under the baseline climate scenario the ks test gives a decision value true or false for the null hypothesis that the time series of mean nsa from the perturbed climate scenario are sampled from the same distribution of these under the baseline climate scenario in this study the null hypothesis is rejected at 95 confidence level p value smaller than 0 05 as such time series of mean nsa under total 2625 perturbed climate scenarios are compared with the baseline climate scenario to determine under which climate conditions the significant changes in the distribution of mean nsa occur for both eget and lassoula systems thus the occurrences of the significant changes are used as the thresholds for the management metric nsa of the eget and lassoula systems similar application of the ks test to investigate the impact of climate change on water resource can be found in the literature e g gaetani et al 2020 muelchi et al 2021 in terms of the thresholds of tnsa the beginning dates of reservoir refill months are based on the current management experience from shem april to june for the eget system and april to july for the lassoula system 4 results 4 1 hydrological model performance the hydrological model gr6j cemaneige was applied to simulate water resource in the water system of the aure valley the outputs including daily q and sca changes are evaluated with the kge criterion kling et al 2012 by comparing to naturalized inflow and observed sca derived from the modis images respectively table 3 shows the kge values for the four studied basins and the results indicate that the model performs satisfactorily with all kge values of q and sca above 0 7 the performance of the gr6j cemaneige model in reproducing seasonal dynamics is illustrated in fig 4 with simulated discharges compared to naturalized discharges and simulated median sca patterns compared to observed median sca patterns the simulated q follows the variability of the naturalized inflow and can capture the high peaks and low flow spells especially the recession limbs during summer period are well fitted however the hydrological model tends to underestimate spring flow and to overestimate winter flow for sb1 4 note that the hydrological model has a lower performance for sb2 partly due to the short record of naturalized inflow the module cemaneige can well reproduce the seasonality of snow cover changes in the five elevation bands fig 4 as well as the accumulation phase of snow and relatively tardy melting processes besides higher attitudinal elevation band shows longer snow cover duration as expected however the snow melting process simulation is less efficient than the snow accumulation process given the simple characteristics of the empirical degree day model in representing snow thermal state changes riboust et al 2018 sca variations for sb1 4 are well simulated with a high performance in high elevation bands and a moderate performance in median elevation bands this can be attributed to the high variability of snow cover in moderate elevation bands which is difficult to represent in the model finally the water management metrics are calculated based on both simulated q and sca and then compared to the observed ones as shown in table 4 the management metrics qa nsa and tnsa are calculated for sb1 3 to investigate the accuracy of the model in reproducing hydropower indices and snow changes for reservoir refill the management metrics doe and tdoe are computed for the sarrancolin catchment to show the accuracy of the model in reproducing environmental indices the simulated natural discharge of the sarrancolin catchment is the sum of the simulated discharges of sb1 4 the simulations of management metrics are generally satisfactory however the simulations of doe and tdoe can be questioned since there is no naturalized discharge available at sarrancolin note that few days with flow under the mandatory ecological requirement are simulated by the model here an incomplete estimate is given by the sum of naturalized discharges for the drainage area of sb1 sb3 and sb4 which stands for 98 of the sarrancolin catchment for the period from 01 2001 to 08 2014 the calculated observed doe and tdoe metrics for this incomplete estimate are 0 1 days and 03 oct respectively these results are consistent with simulations for the period from 01 2001 to 08 2014 the simulated tdoe under both 2001 2014 and 1979 2014 periods 02 oct and 20 sep respectively have a difference of less than two weeks but locate in the early autumn which is rather acceptable if we consider climate variability under current climate condition based on these considerations and because low flows are globally well reproduced we can trust the simulation results of doe and tdoe moreover management metric simulation of sb2 returns lower performance due to its lower quality of naturalized inflow table 5 summarizes the reference values of these management metrics for the water systems in the aure valley under baseline climate these values are calculated with the safran piragua dataset over the period from 09 1979 to 08 2014 to represent the current management performance 4 2 water management sensitivity analysis water management metrics qa nsa and tnsa for the eget and lassoula systems doe and tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are generated through the calibrated gr6j cemaneige model forced with the total 2625 perturbed climate scenarios as described in section 3 4 2 the calculated 2625 values of each management metric are classified into groups and each group incorporates several perturbed climate scenarios at least 5 that gather the close precipitation and temperature values as such the classified groups can be localized in the response surface space with average precipitation and temperature changes of the scenarios in the groups the classified groups are symbolized as circles with colour gradient indicating the average management metric values and with size indicating the standard deviation sd of the scenarios in the groups fig 5 displays the 2d response surfaces developed for water management metrics and associated study area concerning the mean value changes of the response surfaces the management metrics degrade when climate conditions are warmer and drier the values of sd display a patchier pattern for both nsa and tnsa than other metrics large values of sd may reveal transition zones of the hydrological regime and high sensitivity to the way changes see section 3 4 2 are distributed within the year the response surfaces of qa for the eget and lassoula systems are generated over the whole year period to investigate the annual water volume that is potential for hydropower production the response surfaces of doe and tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are generated over july to october period when environmental flow management is usually menaced by low water availability and high irrigation water demand downstream the response surfaces of nsa and tnsa for the eget and lassoula systems are generated for december to august period that incorporates the actual reservoir refill management timing from the beginning of april to the end of july besides based on the regression analysis the most appropriate axes of the response surfaces of nsa and tnsa are winter spring december to may precipitation changes as x axis and spring march to may temperature changes as y axis this also suggests that winter spring precipitation and spring temperature dominate the snowmelt process from fig 5 qa for both eget and lassoula systems are more sensitive to precipitation changes and qa decreases with the decrease of precipitation it is also notable that qa of the eget system is slightly responsive to temperature because the increase in pet associated with temperature increase can compensate the increase in precipitation and thus qa of the eget system is decreased in contrast the lassoula system does not clearly show this character this can be explained by the different land cover types of the two hydropower systems the eget system that includes sb1 and sb2 is covered with forest and meadow active evapotranspiration processes while the lassoula system that only includes sb3 is covered with bare rocks no water demand from vegetation as such the evapotranspiration is more intensive in the eget system where vegetation cover is developed which results in a higher temperature sensitivity of qa in the eget system than the lassoula system fig 5 shows that doe and its associated tdoe for the sarrancolin catchment are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes in july to october period doe becomes longer while tdoe becomes earlier with the increase of temperature and the decrease of precipitation as the sarrancolin catchment is covered by vegetation mainly forest in the most part an increase in temperature leads to higher evapotranspiration and thus less water availability during july to october period the effect of reducing precipitation by around 100 mm for both doe and tdoe is close to the effect of increasing temperature by around 10 to 12 c in regard to nsa and tnsa for the two hydropower systems the contrasting sensitivity to temperature changes is highlighted in fig 5 the values of nsa becomes longer and tnsa becomes earlier with the increase of temperature when the increase of temperature is relatively limited less than 3 c the precipitation changes in the winter spring period also have an impact on these metrics however when the temperature increase exceeds 3 to 4 c the impact of precipitation on both nsa and tnsa metrics is no more obvious and changes in these two metrics are predominantly controlled by temperature change for example the effect of increasing temperature by 1 to 2 c for the eget system is close to the effect of reducing precipitation by 300 mm the high sensitivity of pyrenean snow to temperature changes is also reported in other studies e g lópez moreno et al 2008b 2012 2017 lópez moreno et al 2017 explained that the snow state in the pyrenees is warm and thick and thus a slight increase in temperature could trigger snowmelt 4 3 water management vulnerability assessment figs 6 7 and 8 display the vulnerability of water management of the study area under climate change in regard to hydropower production environmental management and reservoir refill respectively based on the knowledge of the water management sensitivity to climate change threshold lines for each management metric that indicate the limit of the water system s satisfactory performance and climate change pathways that indicate future climate trajectories are overlaid on the sensitivity domain to assess the vulnerability climate change trajectories are presented as line linked squares for the time slices from 1980s to 2090s the mean climate driver changes are the central points ribbon squares give an insight of uncertainty on climate minimum changes are right bottom points while maximum changes are left top points of the ribbon squares hydropower management in fig 6 is generally more difficult given the future warmer and drier conditions in the eget system the current performance of value 53 3 mm 3 is not warranted anymore in most cases when annual precipitation decreases by 100 mm the threshold of 41 6 mm 3 that is the necessary water volume for hydropower production in the scenario of the lowest energy price in the market could be guaranteed under rcp 4 5 however the eget system would not be cost effective after the middle of the century under rcp 8 5 compared with the eget system the lassoula system is more vulnerable due to its threshold 28 2 mm 3 that is relatively close to the reference value 29 7 mm 3 the lassoula system would not be cost effective in most climate change scenarios of two rcps as for the total hydropower production of the two systems the current performance of value 82 9 mm 3 would not be warranted anymore under two rcps and the cost effectiveness of value 69 8 mm 3 would not be achieved under rcp 8 5 besides water demand of the downstream gascogne region which is 48 mm 3 at most could be guaranteed for most of the climate change scenarios under two rcps the demand of 48 mm 3 could not be meet if considering the conservative attitude of water managers for hydropower especially in the climate change scenarios under rcp 8 5 the vulnerability of environmental management metrics doe and tdoe during july to october period is shown in fig 7 the climate change pathways under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 are heading towards warmer and drier july to october period the current performance for both metrics would not be warranted when july to october precipitation decreases by 50 mm or july to october temperature increases by 3 c the number of doe failure days should stay below the 90 day threshold for rcp 4 5 while the threshold could be violated at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 besides the timing of doe failure is earlier under both rcps with more extreme condition for rcp 8 5 particularly at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the timing of doe failure date could occur in july when the downstream gascogne region might demand water for summer irrigation this causes water competition as either less water abstraction for irrigation or more reservoir release should be conducted to keep river flow at sarrancolin larger than 4 m 3 s nsa and tnsa are shown in fig 8 to assess the vulnerability of the current refill strategy in the response surface of nsa for the eget system the empirical distribution of nsa deviates from the current one when temperature increases by 1 c in spring and precipitation decreases of around 30 mm in the winter spring period in the lassoula system significant changes appear when temperature increases by 1 c in spring and precipitation decreases of around 60 mm in the winter spring period the duration of nsa for both systems for december to august period becomes longer under climate change trajectories of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the thresholds considered here for both systems cannot withstand most climate change projections which indicates the high vulnerability of current refill strategy to climate change and thus suggests urgent adaptation actions from the two response surfaces of tnsa tnsa for december to august period will be earlier for both systems in the worst conditions rcp 8 5 no more contribution from snow melting could be expected after may and june for eget and lassoula respectively making the target of a maximum of storage around the current dates uncertain more precisely in the current reservoir management there is a specific period dedicated to reservoir storage that is based on snow melting duration and timing april to june for the eget system and april to july for the lassoula system once the reservoirs are refilled future water uses for downstream in summer and hydropower in winter can be satisfied however the duration of nsa is longer and the timing of tnsa is earlier for both systems under climate change which implies that the contribution from snow melt to reservoir refill is shorter and the end of snow melt is earlier as such the current reservoir storage management should be adapted with the snow changes 5 discussion 5 1 contribution to bottom up studies assessing the performance of water management remains a critical challenge in the bottom up approach in another word the central question can be expressed as what is the threshold or the boundary of water management that shifts from acceptable to unacceptable the answer to this question is barely known in the hydrological community an acceptable water management activity can be related to the satisfaction of profitable safe and ecological requirements the thresholds mostly used in the literature are system performance indices such as the rrv reliability resilience and vulnerability metrics and the robustness index see applications of water supply reliability and robustness whateley et al 2014 brown et al 2012 giuliani and castelletti 2016 argued that different definitions of the system performance indices could lead to different decision making consequences some studies used the benchmarks under current climate as the thresholds to inform future management risks e g prudhomme et al 2015 broderick et al 2019 the application on the management metrics that are used by stakeholders for water management remains rare in the literature in this study we used the management metrics hydropower cost effectiveness metric qa environmental regulation metrics doe and tdoe and reservoir refill metrics nsa and tnsa centred on the stakeholders interest to investigate their vulnerability under climate change these management metrics can be simulated by hydrological modelling under current and perturbed climate conditions the thresholds of these management metrics were identified during the workshops with stakeholders the direct use of the management metric and the associated thresholds interests stakeholders in the participation of adaptation designing i e stakeholders are more familiar with these metrics than hydrologists and alternative adaptation actions that potentially change the thresholds can be tested within the vulnerability assessment see section 5 3 5 2 contribution to pyrenean studies this paper implements the first trial of the bottom up approach alternative to the traditional top down approach for the climate change impact assessment in the pyrenean region by taking the central aure valley as an example water management vulnerability in the valley in terms of hydropower qa environmental regulations doe and tdoe and reservoir refill nsa and tnsa are investigated by integrating the sensitivity of water management metrics to perturbed climate scenarios to the predefined thresholds of current management capacity and to the plausible exposure of future climate change projections previous studies applied the top down approach and demonstrated that climate change could severely impact water resource and management in the pyrenees by generating discrete snap shots of future time slices for comparison with the current state e g haro monteagudo et al 2020 however how the pyrenean water systems respond to climate change and at what degree of climate change the performance of water systems shifts from acceptable to unacceptable cannot be fully addressed by the top down approach understanding the response of pyrenean water systems to changes is critical for water managers to design mitigation and adaptation strategies the sensitivity of these three management components is studied for different temporal scales as seasonal meteorological attributes show different importance for management issues the sensitivity of qa for the selected eget and lassoula systems is studied for the whole annual scale annual precipitation was found to be a key meteorological driver for qa and consequently for hydropower production the higher sensitivity to temperature for the eget system reveals that land cover types in this catchment induces more intensive pet when temperature increases which then reduces the water availability for hydropower production still annual precipitation changes dominate the hydropower management in the two systems with moderate impact from annual temperature changes by combining the predefined threshold and plausible climate change pathways the vulnerability of hydropower can be perceived that the lassoula system is more vulnerable highlighting the need for short term actions to reduce vulnerability both doe and tdoe metrics of the sarrancolin catchment are studied for the july to october period when river flow is low and downstream irrigation demand is intensive the two metrics are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes as the sarrancolin catchment has a large soil moisture content given the warmer and drier tendency of climate change the current doe threshold of 90 days is sufficient for most climate change scenarios before the end of the century it is notable that water competition in this period should be dealt with caution as for the metrics nsa and tnsa of the two hydropower systems the study is focused on the december to august period that includes recharge and spring melting processes a higher sensitivity of both nsa and tnsa to temperature changes is observed compared to the other metrics a warmer climate will induce an earlier snowmelt whatever precipitation changes more liquid precipitation as a result of temperature increase instead of solid precipitation would flash into the reservoirs which may endanger the reservoir safety and cause water spills and losses for future use current reservoir refill strategy should be adapted to climate change the sensitivity and vulnerability analyses in the aure valley are a powerful visual aid for identifying water management problems in general hydropower production and reservoir refill are the most vulnerable management indices among the study area particularly for the lassoula system that incorporates the caillaouas and pouchergues reservoirs however the large storage volume of the caillaouas reservoir could mitigate the effect of earlier and more flashy inflow as such dedicated actions should be implemented to adapt to climate change 5 3 potential mitigation and adaptation actions on the premise of the vulnerability assessment of water management in the aure valley mitigation and adaptation actions can be adopted from two sides to reduce climate change risk water supply and demand sides jointly and independently considering the drier projections in the aure valley increasing reservoir storage is not the best move let alone the intensive investment and the concern of environment maran et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 poff et al 2015 on the contrary on the water demand side modernization of irrigation method e g sprinkler or drip irrigation system crop promotion for less water requirement and changes in crop calendars are efficient in adapting to climate change especially for the mediterranean area e g malek and verburg 2017 galindo et al 2018 harmanny and malek 2019 given the high vulnerability of hydropower production under climate change we test the adaptation strategy of increasing the current water energy transfer coefficients for the eget and lassoula systems that can be realized by increasing the turbine efficiency the current turbine efficiency values for both systems around 85 are tested to increase by 10 less water is thus needed to achieve the cost effectiveness for both systems correspondingly the thresholds of qa for both systems are reduced by a factor of 1 10 37 8 mm 3 for the eget system and 25 6 mm 3 for the lassoula system as illustrated in fig 9 the eget system can achieve the cost effectiveness in the worst market scenario till the 2060s under rcp 8 5 by this strategy compared with the original timing of the 2050s under rcp 8 5 however this strategy is more effective for the lassoula system because it enables to achieve the cost effectiveness in the worst market scenario for most climate change scenarios under rcp 4 5 and till the 2050s under the rcp 8 5 compared with the original high vulnerability to most climate change scenarios under both rcps this example illustrates how the sn framework can be used to test adaptation strategies and other actions that eventually decrease the thresholds of qa for both systems should be considered besides shifting the hydropower production from winter for heating to summer for cooling to align several water uses hydropower irrigation and environmental regulations is possible to reduce water competition in the aure valley pereira cardenal et al 2014 the original refill management that starts from april and ends in july for the two hydropower systems seems too late and too long in the face of warmer climate as such reservoir refill strategies might be changed with an earlier start and a more flexible duration increasing the reservoir spillway capacity should also be considered so as to avoid the extreme high inflow events into the reservoirs that endanger reservoir safety in particular given the small storage volume of the pouchergues reservoir and large storage volume of the caillaouas reservoir increasing the capacity of water transfer from the pouchergues to the caillaouas reservoir could mitigate water loss from spillway release however these changes should be scrutinized with caution as managers might be conservative in changes 5 4 limitations and future works this study simplifies the water management processes and thus it is important to acknowledge the limitations that are likely to induce biases in the analysis future works focusing on these limitations will help to improve the understanding of water management vulnerability in the study area firstly uncertainty is partially examined here the study focuses on climate related uncertainty exploring a broad range of climate conditions the uncertainty of water management metrics to climate change is displayed by the sd values in the response surfaces with larger sd values indicating high dispersion in values for the specified changes parts of the uncertainty are due to natural processes that are not perfectly taken into account by the models for example the snow melting process simulation is less efficient than the snow accumulation process see the sca regimes of fig 4 this results from the choice of the empirical degree day model cemaneige and the difficulties in representing snow thermal state changes riboust et al 2018 although the gr6j cemaneige model has shown satisfying performance different hydrological models show significant variations in water resource estimation e g vidal et al 2016 besides a hydrological model calibrated under current climate may not perform robustly for perturbed climate scenarios due to parameter non stationarity e g westra et al 2014 guo et al 2017 these variations would propagate to the sensitivity domain which may induce biases in the vulnerability assessment broderick et al 2019 a physically based hydrological model that explicitly simulates complex hydrological processes could be beneficial to deepen the understanding of the sensitivity to climate change therefore a multi model method that involves structurally or conceptually different hydrological models can provide valuable insights in the uncertainty quantification secondly the term vulnerability for water management in this study is not presented as a specially defined index but in a manner of description traditionally vulnerability is used to characterize the performance of water systems in terms of the severity of their failure and the mathematical definition is given in hashimoto et al 1982 some studies have examined the vulnerability of water management by calculating the water deficit to meet the total demand e g sandoval solis et al 2011 loucks and van beek 2017 haro monteagudo et al 2020 furthermore vulnerability in the bottom up framework is derived as the proportion of exposure simulations that fail below the critical threshold in sauquet et al 2019 not computed here or the combination of the three components that includes sensitivity exposure and threshold e g mastrandrea et al 2010 prudhomme et al 2013a b in the water management context the evaluation of management performance is sometimes qualitative e g reservoir refill and problematic to be simplified as an index therefore vulnerability in this study is given by subjective description with the participation of regional water stakeholders thirdly downstream water demand is assumed to be the maximum water allocation portion which is 48 mm 3 for irrigation drinking water and industrial use and to remain constant under all the scenarios investigated in the historical experience of downstream water demand the maximal value is actually reached for years 2005 47 mm 3 2006 48 mm 3 2007 48 mm 3 and 2011 48 mm 3 as such a possible adaptation strategy may suggest to increase maximum water allocation portion by making new water contracts between shem and downstream water users besides scenarios of land use and water use changes are worth being included in the sensitivity analysis previous studies highlighted land use and land cover changes mostly the forest regeneration due to warming effect in the pyrenees could yield less water availability by more intensive pet of vegetation e g lópez moreno et al 2011 morán tejeda et al 2014 buendia et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2019 finally the generation of perturbed climate scenarios is based on the delta change method that parametrically perturbs daily historical climate data with monthly change factors this method applied here for reasons of simplicity straightforward to apply has well known limitations e g not suitable for extreme events however the delta change approach was considered relevant to address the vulnerability of a system sensitive to changes in water resources alternatives to the parametric method are stochastic methods such as weather generators e g culley et al 2019 steinschneider et al 2019 in addition the climate perturbation is limited to precipitation and temperature in this study although precipitation and temperature mean changes are the main drivers in water management the investigation of other variables such as pet guo et al 2017 precipitation variability poff et al 2015 and water demand foti et al 2014 could also impact the performance of water systems 6 conclusion water resource and management in the pyrenees under climate change remains a continuous regional issue in this study we illustrated a bottom up approach to analyse the vulnerability of pyrenean water management under climate change with an example of the central aure valley to achieve this we firstly developed a hydrological model gr6j cemaneige calibrated to the naturalized inflow and observed snow cover derived from satellite images and the simulation results point to satisfactory water resource and management estimation the next step is to apply the delta change method a parametric method to perturb historical climate conditions the current and perturbed climate series are finally forced into the calibrated hydrological model to simulate potential changes of water management metrics for sensitivity analysis changes in water management metrics hydropower production environmental regulations and reservoir refill management are demonstrated by the 2d response surface in answer to precipitation and temperature changes which is visually practical in identifying the sensitivity of water management to climatic variables response surfaces overlaid with performance threshold isolines and plausible climate change pathways are essential for the exploration of key vulnerability our findings confirm the high sensitivity of water management in the aure valley to seasonal annual changes in precipitation and temperature by integrating the exposure and the performance metrics of water systems in the aure valley the vulnerability of water management under climate change can be assessed the results in the study can be summarized as follows annual hydropower production is mostly dominated by changes in annual precipitation and secondary by changes in annual temperature particularly the lassoula hydropower system is vulnerable to future drier climate conditions as the production threshold cannot be maintained under most future climate change projections the environmental regulations for the sarrancolin catchment are sensitive to both precipitation and temperature changes in summer and early autumn environmental management is less vulnerable to climate change while the timing of environmental water requirement would induce an intensive water competition among irrigation and hydropower reservoir refill management is extremely sensitive to changes in temperature for the winter spring summer period the earlier snowmelt induces water loss and reservoir safety issues if the refill strategy remains unchanged on the basis of these vulnerability analyses corresponding adaptation and mitigation actions can be designed to manage climate change risks non structural measures can be suggested which target the efficient use of water especially in the irrigation domain other actions such as increasing hydropower plant efficiency and increasing water transfer capacity for more flexible reservoir management could be also appreciated in mitigating hydropower losses given the earlier snowmelt reservoir refill strategy should be correspondingly adjusted accompanied with the increase of spillway capacity for the reservoir safety although there are some limitations this study demonstrated valuable insights on the impact of climate change on water resource and management by firstly applying a bottom up framework in the pyrenean region future works such as testing other hydrological models with different structure for uncertainty quantification generating perturbed climate scenarios with more extreme events testing water management stress to other climate variables or socio economic changes could advance the understanding in water management vulnerability this framework is applicable to other pyrenean regions for vulnerability assessment and adaptation design under climate change credit

7834,study region sierra nevada de santa marta snsm region of colombia study focus this research was conducted as a case study to generate relevant quantitative information to support cacao farmer decision making processes concerning water management in the snsm it involved the development and evaluation of a spatial dataset of precipitation and temperature integration of digital soil mapping with a modification of the thornthwaite and mather water balance model and finally an assessment of water sufficiency for cacao production we elaborated site specific and spatially distributed analyses to generate information that will be shared with technicians who assist cacao growers in the snsm new hydrological insights for the region under the climate conditions for the analysis period 1989 2018 rainfall was not enough to prevent cacao yield losses for 10 out of the 27 farms evaluated the location of farms in two departments with contrasting climate conditions showed the importance of spatial analysis of water availability when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers the results revealed that farms facing less frequent water stress are characterized by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures soils that contain more organic matter and are located at higher elevations with steeper slopes temporally water stress is highest in the months february august with special interest in march april as the dry season ends and july august just before the peak rainy season graphical abstract ga1 abbreviations snsm sierra nevada de santa marta keywords water storage agriculture water balance farmers data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction cacao theobroma cacao l probably originated in south america being spread to central america where it has been cropped for around 1500 years motamayor et al 2002 while cacao production in colombia has a long history it was only recently introduced as a commercial crop in the sierra nevada de santa marta snsm region on the north coast of the country as a substitute for illicit crops after the implementation of plan colombia in 2000 which is a strategy of the u s and colombian governments for fighting drug trafficking dnp 2006 the cacao for peace cfp program funded by the u s agency for international development usaid and executed by the foreign agricultural service of the united states department of agriculture usda fas has supported local cacao farmers as part of its goal to improve the cacao value chain in colombia through cooperative research technical assistance and extension education usda 2016 cacao is extremely susceptible to water availability and therefore drought is a significant stress factor for its growth development and production medrano et al 2015 found that cacao is highly prone to water stress early in its development however water requirements at this stage have not been clearly defined oppong et al 1999 found in a multi year trial that seedlings planted during the first three months of the rainy season improved their survival rate after the dry season by 20 in comparison with those planted in the last month rainy season onset is also the most important environmental factor in triggering flowering which is critical for production of cacao pods and beans adjaloo et al 2012 carr and lockwood 2011 climate change and variability especially changes in temperature and water availability in the dry season also impact cacao significantly schroth et al 2016 this is reflected in the yield reductions of up to 89 due to the severe droughts caused by el niño southern oscillation enso gateau rey et al 2018 despite the relevance of water in cacao cropping systems farmers in developing countries normally do not have enough information concerning cacao water use and water sufficiency to make decisions about potentially implementing management practices to reduce water shortages the goal of this case study is to generate relevant quantitative information to support cacao farmer decision making processes concerning water management with a focus on the snsm region of colombia but being applicable to other regions with similar geographical and data conditions it assesses cacao water use and its critical soil water thresholds in farms as well as mapping the spatial variability of soil water in the region the specific objectives of this research are to 1 develop and evaluate a spatial dataset of precipitation and temperature 2 assess soils and relevant soil properties through digital soil mapping 3 quantify the long term monthly water balance across the region and 4 assess water sufficiency for cacao production and specifically for the target farms strategic information and results obtained through this research will be shared with farmers and local technicians who provide assistance in the study area understanding cacao water requirements and knowing when to provide supplemental water to meet its critical needs can help to increase cacao production in the region and lead to better more reliable incomes for farmers as this research is conducted with the support of the cfp project it will contribute toward capacity building for cacao farmers project partners related ministries and institutions to meet the nation s long term goal to increase quality cacao production land use sustainability and natural resources conservation and long term food security in colombia for future generations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this research takes place along the northern coast of colombia in an area that encompasses 1610 km2 of la guajira and magdalena departments fig 1 this area is limited in the south by the snsm mountains in the north by the caribbean sea in the west by a national protective forest reserve and in the east by the tapias river the region contains nine national natural parks and is surrounded by two more among them the renowned tayrona park in the northwest two strong relief types can be differentiated a mountainous region located in the south and southwest with elevation ranging from 250 to 2849 m above sea level m a s l and a low region where wide plains predominate with an elevation range from 0 to 250 m a s l average annual precipitation ranges spatially from 1300 to 4100 mm with minimum temperatures from 4 to 21 c and maximum temperatures from 14 to 33 c this area experiences a bimodal rainfall behavior with a long dry period from december to april and a longer rainy season subdivided by a slight reduction in rains in july a water balance assessment was developed for 27 cfp assisted cacao farms located in the study area see fig 1 10 in the department of la guajira and 17 in the department of magdalena see table s1 in the supplementary material for their general characteristics la guajira registers the lowest annual rainfall in the country varying spatially from 300 to 1500 mm while in magdalena precipitation ranges from 1000 to more than 2500 mm ideam 2015 study farms are located on both flat plains and mountainous relief with steep slopes two communal organizations of cacao producers are present in the region both groups focus on low income producers that on average have one hectare of cacao in production most of these producers do not have irrigation systems and the majority of cacao systems are produced in combination with crops that provide shade to cacao including banana citrus and woody trees agronomic practices are implemented with expertise from the cfp which has been helping cacao growers for many years to improve yields 2 2 climate data weather data for a 30 year climate period from january 1 1989 to december 31 2018 were provided by the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam by its spanish name stations within a buffer distance of 15 km of the study area were selected resulting in 14 stations with daily precipitation data and seven with daily maximum and minimum temperature data that were subject to quality control and analyzed for data sufficiency 2 2 1 quality control qc data were cleaned to remove values out of range statistical outliers repetitive measurements during five days and measurements that changed excessively between two consecutive days following the procedures of esquivel et al 2018 minimum and maximum threshold values allowed for each variable were defined based on historic records 1981 2010 disaggregated by departments published on the colombia climatological atlas ideam 2015 the precipitation range was defined as 0 200 mm day the minimum temperature range as 0 35 c and the maximum temperature range as 10 45 c forty five degrees celsius is the historic maximum temperature reported for colombia outliers defined as values greater than a multiplier 20 for precipitation 5 for temperature of the interquartile range iqr were deleted these multipliers were chosen to reflect the variability of the weather being higher for precipitation than for temperature repetitive or frequent values during five consecutive days and values that changed by ten degrees celsius or more between two consecutive days were also removed in this process any value that failed any of the abovementioned checks was removed from the series and replaced with na examples of cleaned datasets for two stations are provided in fig s1 supplementary material the resulting time series were analyzed in terms of missing values to determine which stations to use in the analysis the mean percentage of missing values for minimum and maximum temperatures was almost 60 while for precipitation it was 27 due to the low density of stations in the study area stations with percentages of missing data up to 43 3 for precipitation and 67 7 for temperature were kept two stations for temperature and two more for precipitation were discarded based on their missing value percentages for the analysis period see figs s2 s4 supplementary material table 1 presents the final selection of stations 10 for precipitation and 5 for temperature that passed the quality checking process and were used in further analysis one station parque tayrona was discarded for precipitation but kept for temperature 2 2 2 data gap filling gaps in the daily weather data were filled using the nearest neighbor algorithm bounded by elevation moraes et al 2022 this algorithm replaces missing values of a station with values from neighboring stations within an elevation restriction thus preventing the use of a closer station from a very different altitude two elevation restrictions station elevations within 500 m and 1000 m were used for temperature and precipitation respectively these values were determined based on elevation change with respect to climate within the study area where larger changes in temperature than in precipitation were identified in cases when a missing value could not be replaced from any of the nearest stations meeting the elevation restriction a gap filling iterative function was implemented to replace null values with mean daily values for the month calculated for the assessed station the function checks other years for the same month until finding a non null replacement value 2 2 3 generation of monthly climatic surfaces after the data filling was completed the gap filled data was aggregated to a monthly time step this time scale was chosen as cacao is a perennial crop with a long term life cycle of up to 40 years hernandez et al 1989 köhler et al 2009 which implies that water demand is less temporally varying than it is with annual or transitory crops monthly surfaces were generated for each year through spatial interpolations at 1 km of resolution approx 30 arc seconds of monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures this resolution was selected for consistency with widely used high spatial resolution climate datasets such as worldclim hijmans et al 2005 navarro racines et al 2020 also stated that this resolution allows for capturing climate patterns in climate data interpolations for this purpose the thin plate spline smoothing method was used from anusplin version 4 4 which in turn uses elevation as a covariate hutchinson and de hoog 1985 it was implemented a second order spline interpolation and consequently created synthetic stations based on the gauging stations within the interpolation area see fig 2 adding five stations for each variable the resulting synthetic stations contain the same time series as the reference gauging stations and were created in locations with similar elevation and climate to theirs fig 2 for this a digital elevation model dem and the multi year annual precipitation and mean temperature isohyets of colombia for the period 1981 2010 ideam 2017a b were used this process was carried out as the spline order required at least 10 stations per variable for its correct functioning in total 15 stations were used for precipitation and 10 for temperature to carry out the interpolation process the dem originally produced at 30 m was resampled at a final spatial resolution of 1 km by using the bilinear resampling method to evaluate the performance of the interpolation algorithm k fold cross validation fushiki 2011 was executed using 75 of data for training 25 for testing and defining k 25 folds number of iterations the resulting errors from interpolations were assessed by using the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse cross validation results are presented in the supplementary material section s1 2 based on the calculated r2 values the iterations whose medians were greater than the 90th percentile of all medians were identified and considered as the best iterations their corresponding surfaces were then averaged by month resulting in the final surfaces of the interpolation process values of the time series climate characterization were restricted to the value ranges thresholds defined for the quality control process final surfaces were then clipped with the limit of the study area and projected to the local coordinate reference system magna sirgas colombia bogota which was used for all spatial information considered in this study finally those surfaces were also aggregated and plotted on a multi year monthly basis 2 3 digital soil mapping dsm 2 3 1 soil data soils were sampled at twenty seven farms and three non farm locations fig 1 resulting in seventy three auger sites and a set of ten full pedon descriptions seven of them at the farms sampling sites were selected based on representative soil units and landscapes of the study area being the non farm locations chosen for full pedon descriptions to cover the remaining soil units libohova et al 2020 in total 415 samples were taken through soil horizons down to depths of up to 2 m or until reaching the unconsolidated material in which the soil is formed effective soil depth esd refers to physical restrictions such as high stoniness compacted soil horizons or unweathered parent materials table s1 in the supplementary material shows the esd at each sampling location within a farm soil properties such as texture sand clay and silt and organic matter om were determined in the laboratory for every sample using the methods of bouyoucos 1936 and walkley and black 1934 respectively available water content awc was calculated by the difference between field capacity 33 kpa and wilting point 1500 kpa for all locations based on the pedotransfer functions ptf that in turn use sand clay and om as input for characterizing hydrological soil properties saxton and rawls 2006 an equal area spline function using the gsif r package hengl 2020 was applied to transform measured data into specific depth layers odgers et al 2012 four layers were defined for this research based on cacao root interactions with soils and the maximum depth reached in the field sampling 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm the first defined layer 0 20 cm depth h1 includes the most active fine cacao root system which is essential in water and nutrient absorption arévalo gardini et al 2017 argüello et al 2019 the second layer 20 60 cm depth h2 contains up to 80 of roots in cacao plantations asmamaw et al 2017 de almeida and valle 2007 finally since cacao roots can reach depths up to 1 5 2 m carr and lockwood 2011 two subsequent layers 60 100 cm h3 100 200 cm h4 were also considered at these last two depths the cacao root system is dominated by the taproot which is mainly in charge of anchoring the plant and from which other secondary roots sprout in the search for water and nutrients rajab et al 2018 2 3 2 soil properties prediction soil texture esd and awc are important inputs for the water balance model thus spatial distributions of the esd cm soil texture sand silt and clay in and awc for all soil depths h1 h4 were mapped at 30 m of spatial resolution using a digital soil mapping dsm approach based on random forest dsm predicts the spatial distribution of soil properties based on soil forming factors described by pendleton and jenny 1945 by combining field and laboratory data with a variety of environmental variables in a mathematical model ma et al 2019 mcbratney et al 2003 minasny and mcbratney 2016 moore et al 1993 zhu 1997 zhu et al 2001 random forest is a machine learning method widely used in dsm that predicts soil properties from a large collection of non correlated decision trees breiman 2001 which are created from the spatial relationship between soil data and environmental variables the following environmental variables at 30 m of spatial resolution were implemented as predictors in the dsm modeling dem

cover lulc was generated by ideam with the corine land cover clc classification system cec 1993 adapted for colombia at a scale of 1 100 000 for 2017 the study area is composed of 30 lulc classes where cacao farms represent 0 02 38 4 ha of the total extent these 27 cacao crop farms were inserted imposed on the lulc map as a class named cacao the classes in both spanish original and english other referenced parameters i e kc p and cn which will be explained later in section 2 5 and their sources as well as the corresponding areas are shown in table s3 supplementary material 2 5 water balance model the water balance was developed for the entire region by calculating surface runoff and effective precipitation evapotranspiration and percolation as described below 2 5 1 surface runoff calculation surface runoff was estimated using the soil conservation service curve number cn method usda scs 1986 for this the hydrologic soil group hsg for each soil type was determined based on the texture of the first layer h1 using the usda scs 1986 procedure and the software saga gis soils classified as hsg a have the smallest runoff potential while soils with hsg d have the greatest the cn2 average condition values for all the classes of the lulc map were assigned based on multiple references see table s3 supplementary material the raw cn2 raster was calculated by executing the tool pick of arcgis for desktop using the calculated hsgs and the cn2s associated with the lulc classes that were rasterized at the same resolution of the dem 30 m this tool picks a value from a specific raster based on a value of another one i e position raster in this case hsg so it resulted in the association of the corresponding cn2 value according to the hsg cns are theoretically estimated for flat conditions neitsch et al 2011 or plot slopes 5 so cn2 for slopes greater than 5 were adjusted according to the procedure of huang et al 2006 cn2 values were not adjusted for antecedent moisture conditions based on current recommendations in hawkins et al 2019 to calculate runoff daily precipitation values were first allocated to thiessen polygons created for the stations used in the generation of the climatic surfaces fig 2 by using these polygons and with the slope adjusted cn2 raster the runoff was calculated for each day of the series finally the resulting daily runoff surfaces were aggregated on a monthly basis which served as an input to the water balance calculation 2 5 2 potential evapotranspiration there are multiple methods used worldwide to calculate potential evapotranspiration based on weather variables such as temperature sunshine wind speed solar radiation and humidity the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 has been implemented in areas with limited weather information demonstrating reasonable results allen et al 1998 which makes it useful for the estimation of water balances in such locations droogers and allen 2002 modified the standard equation of hargreaves by including monthly rainfall as one of its components and concluded that with this modification it is more appropriate for use in areas with limited data availability of weather information than methods with higher data requirements like penman monteith for its implementation solar radiation was calculated with equations 21 25 of the food and agriculture organization fao 56 crop evapotranspiration guide allen et al 1998 2 5 3 actual evapotranspiration the crop evapotranspiration etc of land uses covers in the study area was determined based on potential evapotranspiration etp estimates and a crop factor kc kc values were assigned to all the classes of the lulc map based on literature values see table s3 supplementary material and the resulting layer was rasterized the kc value assigned to the cacao farms 1 05 is for a mixed cacao system with total canopy cover allen et al 1998 in consequence the etc of the farms should be close to that of a system with tall trees carr and lockwood 2011 in dry months etc was reduced based on the calculated water stress to determine the actual evapotranspiration eta the depletion fraction p of the water holding capacity represents the moisture that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in etc occurs allen et al 1998 siebert and döll 2010 according to allen et al 1998 a value of 0 3 for p can be assigned to a cacao crop which defines it as sensitive to water stress as stated by raes 2002 for other non cacao crops a value of 0 5 was used allen et al 1998 while for non vegetated lulc classes a value of 0 was assigned table s3 a water stress coefficient ks was calculated based on soil moisture and etc was reduced when the soil water storage s was below the threshold defined by p no reduction was applied to etc ks 1 when s was at or above that threshold level 2 5 4 water balance calculation the water balance was based on the modification by ulmen 2000 of the widely used thornthwaite and mather water balance model thornthwaite and mather 1955 following the scheme shown in fig 3 the starting value of s was assumed as 90 of the water holding capacity whc following suggestions of ulmen 2000 whc was determined based on the available water content awc and the effective soil depth esd resulting from the digital soil mapping effective precipitation peff is the remaining precipitation p after being reduced by surface runoff months were defined as dry etc peff or wet etc peff this model assumes that initial conditions are wet water content is close to whc so the water balance was set to start in november a month after the wettest month in the study area october also the first year 1989 was used as the initial warm up year of the water balance 2 6 water sufficiency for cacao production 2 6 1 previous studies of effects of water deficit on cacao yields zuidema et al 2005 found in a modeling study of 30 locations in 10 countries that rainfall of the two driest months and annual solar radiation could explain 70 of cacao yield variations and that yield reductions up to 50 could occur when rain is below 50 mm for two months in an experiment implemented in indonesia schwendenmann et al 2010 found similar yield reductions 45 when a severe drought period occurred during the initial stage of fruiting they also noticed that slight drought levels during that stage decreased yield by 10 while cacao yield is severely reduced by drought cacao trees have been shown to maintain minimal physiological activities to survive and to suppress totally or partially their reproductive stage adjaloo et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 moser et al 2010 köhler et al 2010 moser et al 2010 and schwendenmann et al 2010 studied cacao water stress through physiological responses cacao productivity and their related soil moisture levels they found that there are significant soil water thresholds that affect cacao yield and therefore can be considered to determine the water needs of a cropping system that would support increased productivity 2 6 2 soil water thresholds understanding and determining critical soil water thresholds of the cacao crop is of high relevance not only for the study area but also for other places where cacao cropping systems exist the definition of these thresholds can provide a basis for understanding when a cacao system is likely facing water stress accordingly these thresholds were determined based on the calculation of the relative extractable soil water rew granier et al 1999 schwendenmann et al 2010 rew i s i s min s max s min where si is the soil water storage at month i mm and smin and smax are the long term minimum and maximum values of s mm water stress can occur in cacao crops when the rew value is below 0 4 which can entail a yield reduction of up to 10 granier et al 1999 schwendenmann et al 2010 rew values of 0 1 or less imply that cacao trees do not continue producing biomass that is they stop their vegetative growth and could be at the threshold of withering generating yield reductions of up to 45 in the system granier et al 1999 moser et al 2010 schwendenmann et al 2010 thus the lower and upper soil water thresholds for cacao were defined as rew 0 1 and rew 0 4 respectively the values of soil water storage s for those rew values were determined for each location in the study area and the difference for each month between the si and s at each threshold was calculated to determine if the location was experiencing water stress negative differences represent the supplemental soil water content in mm that would need to be added through the implementation of management practices such as irrigation to maintain a healthy cacao crop 3 results 3 1 climate dataset the results of the climate data processing and interpolation were 1 the cleaned and gap filled time series for each station and variable and 2 the interpolated maps of precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures for each month these results are available online at valencia et al 2022 climate varies spatially especially from the lowlands of the northeast to the high elevations of the southwest as an overview of the resulting climatic surfaces fig 4 shows the average annual precipitation and temperature extremes with the corresponding stations used for their generation rain is higher 4100 mm year in the southwest region where the highest elevations predominate and where the lowest temperatures occur 5 ºc the highest temperatures 33 ºc and the lowest rains 1300 mm year are in the lower altitudes especially in the northeast la guajira department temporal climate patterns in fig 5 illustrate that rainfall presents a bimodal behavior with predominant peaks in may and october the dry season from december to april is critical for water availability for cacao temperature is quite consistent throughout the year with slightly warmer temperatures from june to august in february the month with the lowest precipitation average rainfall ranges across the region from 8 to 42 mm month minimum temperature from 4 to 21 ºc and maximum temperature from 14 to 33 ºc in october the month with the highest precipitation average rainfall varies spatially between 290 and 471 mm month minimum temperature between 6 and 23 ºc and maximum temperature between 13 and 33 ºc 3 2 digital soil mapping dsm descriptive statistics of regional soil properties such as effective soil depth esd soil texture sand silt and clay organic matter and estimations of field capacity wilting point and available water content awc are summarized in table 2 loamy soil textures predominate in all layers h1 h4 followed by clay loam sandy loam and sandy clay loam mean values of sand silt and clay remain similar through all depths while the mean organic matter value is higher for shallower soils due to the higher accumulation of this property in the first centimeters of the soil than deeper in the soil profile this is attributed to more biological activity and a greater presence of litter vegetation residuals and root systems in the topsoil layer together these properties result in a slightly higher capacity of the soil at h1 to hold water at tensions of 1500 kpa wp and 33 kpa fc and a greater mean value of awc at this depth regarding esd a predominance of moderate 50 100 cm and deep 100 150 cm soils was identified at sampled locations while shallow 50 cm and very deep 150 cm soils were not common see table s1 in the supplementary material the spatial distribution of awc predicted for each soil depth used in this study h1 to h4 is presented in fig 6 higher values of awc at depths h1 and h4 were predicted in the northern plains likely due to the presence of soils derived from sedimentary rocks which are characterized by high organic matter contents and finer soil textures finer soil textures promote soil aggregation om protection and soil moisture augustin and cihacek 2016 xie et al 2021 yang et al 2016 enhancing thus the water holding capacity and plant water availability of the soil higher values of awc at depths h2 and h3 were predicted in the soils formed mainly from metamorphic and igneous rocks located in mountainous landscapes characterized by higher om and fine textures contents spatial distributions of soil texture at depth h1 and esd as well as soil sampling data and other soil property maps can be visualized at the cacao for peace gis platform https arcg is 1hmgrl 3 3 water balance assessment the long term 30 years annual water balance developed for the study area determined that the average annual rainfall of 2041 mm is distributed as 234 mm of surface runoff 11 of rainfall 831 mm of evapotranspiration 41 of rainfall and 987 mm of percolation 48 of rainfall as no streamflow measurements were available for the study area for validation of the water balance results the gscd global streamflow characteristics dataset beck et al 2015 2013 at a spatial resolution of 0 125 degree approx 13 5 km at the equator was used as an approximate quantitative assessment that is appropriate for ungauged catchments to evaluate the simulated values the water yield runoff percolation ratio of the developed water balance 59 8 compared well with that provided by gscd 60 3 for the study area this small difference in values allowed us to conclude that in general terms the model used in this research correctly balances water long term for the study area and can be used our evapotranspiration estimates also compared well to values from the literature for cacao computed eta of the 27 cacao farms from our water balance model ranged between 776 and 1130 mm year with a mean value of 968 mm year these results were found to be similar to those reported by radersma and de ridder 1996 who provided a range of annual eta for cacao between 878 and 1074 mm where the lower number was for cacao under drought stress the spatially averaged monthly water balance for the region is presented in fig 7 and complete monthly results are in table s4 supplementary material during dry months january to march eta was greater than rainfall meaning that evaporative demand of plants is drawn from soil moisture and that there is an increased potential for water stress at the end of this dry season 3 4 water sufficiency for cacao the method developed allowed the evaluation of the spatial distribution of soil water availability and its relationship to the critical thresholds for cacao on a monthly basis fig 8 the maps identify locations in the region where cacao is more or less susceptible to water stress based principally on climate and soil analysis of the resulting climate datasets shows that those farms 10 out of 27 located in the department of la guajira are more vulnerable to water shortage and therefore their corresponding cacao systems are likely to experience water stress more frequently most of the cacao farms would require supplemental water to not fall below the upper critical threshold where cacao drought stress can occur see top left map in fig 8 the supplemental water demand is larger for those farms located on the east side of the study area with an average monthly demand of up to 50 mm in february for this month multi year average monthly soil water storage for none of the 27 cacao farms fell below the lower critical threshold 10 for the month with the highest precipitation october the average monthly soil water storage exceeds both critical thresholds for the entire study area which indicates that the cacao farms do not need supplemental water during this month and do not experience drought stress however this analysis is based on long term average surfaces for the study area and therefore extreme values or critical moments during the 30 years of water balance modeling could be smoothed or hidden for this reason specific analyses by farm were performed considering the whole time series which allowed us to make comparisons among farms and identify the critical times of the year for cacao in the study area the percentage of all months over the 30 year simulation period that the soil water storage was below both critical thresholds is shown in fig 9 for each of the 27 farms ranked by the percentage below the lower 10 critical threshold when soil water storage is below the upper critical threshold the cacao crop starts experiencing drought stress and when it is below the lower critical threshold it no longer produces biomass stops all vegetative growth and is at the limit of withering and permanent damage farms located on the left side of the chart mostly located in the department of magdalena experience less water stress than those on the right which are mostly in the department of la guajira both critical thresholds should be analyzed together to have a realistic outlook of the potential for water stress at a farm as the crop is suffering from drought impacts while below the upper critical threshold but in danger of permanent damage when below the lower critical threshold for example farms f56 and f9 both in the la guajira department experience nearly the same percentage of months below the upper critical threshold 33 and 34 respectively but f9 is below the lower critical threshold for 5 of all months while f56 is never below the lower critical threshold this indicates that both farms suffer from drought a similar amount of time but that drought conditions are more severe at f9 correlation between the percentage of months that soil water storage was below either of the critical soil water thresholds for the 30 years of analysis and variables describing location soil and climate of individual farms were evaluated to identify potential predictors of farms that suffer more from water scarcity see table s1 and fig s6 in the supplementary material for the corresponding scatter plots variables such as annual precipitation longitude organic matter and mean temperature are statistically significant and highly correlated to the threshold percentages table 3 while elevation and slope were found to be less strongly correlated other variables such as latitude effective soil depth and soil texture sand clay and silt were not statistically significant in summary farms facing less frequent water stress conditions for cacao production are characterized by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures are located more to the west at higher elevations present greater slopes and their soils contain higher organic matter which facilitates soil water retention and consequently increases soil moisture although these farms are in a steep relief their dense coverage of associated shading trees and litter are efficient in controlling runoff the approaches and methods used in this research allowed for the discrimination of farms in terms of water sufficiency even when they are in close spatially proximity for example three farms f40 f39 and f38 were very close to each other spatially approx 250 m apart but were found to have very different water balance characteristics f40 experiences considerably less water stress than farms f38 and f39 see fig 9 and table s1 in the supplementary material farm f40 is at a higher elevation 358 m a s l with less soil clay content 22 and a higher infiltration capacity hsg b and cn2 69 in contrast to f38 and f39 279 and 315 m a s l respectively clay 26 hsg c and cn2 79 furthermore as revealed through the soil sampling campaign f40 presented a denser coverage of associated shading trees 3 5 individual farm assessments the tool developed as part of this research can produce summaries of water availability and stress level for each of the farms to illustrate this point two farms have been selected for additional discussion farm f0 located in the la guajira department is an example of a farm showing significant water stress as its soil water storage was below the upper critical threshold 65 of the time and below the lower critical threshold 20 of all months see fig 9 meanwhile farm f29 located in the magdalena department experienced almost no water stress with soil water storage below the upper critical threshold only 2 of the time and never below the lower critical threshold as examples of the specific analyses that were carried out for each farm the water balance in terms of soil water storage for both average conditions and extreme climatic years together with the soil water thresholds relevant to cacao are presented in fig 10 for these two contrasting farms soil water storage at farm 0 peaks in october and november along with annual average rainfall but by december soil storage has already begun to drop with the end of the rainy season storage is below the upper critical threshold for february march and april with soil moisture storage reaching a minimum in april even as the new rainy season gets started farm soil moisture storage does not recover and exceeds the upper critical threshold until august and september when the second wetter part of the rainy season begins this farm is highly dependent on the timing of the start of the wet season and on the quantity of rainfall delivered it is a location that would benefit significantly from irrigation to reduce the impacts of drought farm 29 on the other hand hardly experiences any water stress in most years storage falls below the upper critical thresholds only 17 of the time in march and only 7 of the time in april this farm has never come close to falling below the lower threshold the need for irrigation at this farm is small future farms placed in similar locations would likely not need supplemental irrigation 4 discussion the new climate dataset described here which includes spatially varying precipitation and temperature provides an improved basis for analyzing water sufficiency in the study region the 1 km spatial resolution used for the interpolation of climate surfaces allowed us to capture the weather variations of the study region that could be lost at lower resolutions particularly in mountainous landscapes existing climate datasets such as the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 or the global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2019 are either at coarser resolution or do not focus on this region the newly developed region specific digital soil maps also provide advantages over currently available global digital soil maps e g soilgrids hengl et al 2017 since they were developed with more consistent samples at a greater scale of detail using a sampling scheme developed to characterize the local soil characteristics for model training the use of these new datasets together with the modified thornthwaite and mather model to calculate a spatially varying monthly water balance provides an improved method for determining water sufficiency for cacao production in the region existing studies either focused on general climate variables such as precipitation and temperature without explicitly calculating a water balance e g singh et al 2021 or calculated the water balance at the plot scale without a broader spatial analysis köhler et al 2014 2010 comparison to thresholds for cacao yield reductions used in previous research showed that the location of farms needs to be carefully considered when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers granier et al 1999 and schwendenmann et al 2010 found that yield reductions of up to 10 could be expected when soil moisture falls below the upper threshold a situation that occurred regularly especially in the eastern part of the study area without the application of supplemental water however soil moisture below the lower threshold was rare this is important because if water storage drops below this threshold it can lead to yield reductions of up to 45 granier et al 1999 moser et al 2010 schwendenmann et al 2010 and means that the trees could be at the limit of withering extended periods below the lower critical threshold could result in die off in the cacao plantation this study like others found that precipitation is a key factor for cacao throughout its development as this crop is highly prone to drought adjaloo et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 temperature also impacts cacao considerably as also shown by schroth et al 2016 especially in extremely dry periods where reductions in yields have been observed gateau rey et al 2018 key soil properties identified in this research as well as in previous research include soil organic matter and soil water retention capacity gusli et al 2020 niether et al 2017 although this study used spatial data products generated from local climate and soil information and well validated modeling approaches there are limitations the weather stations from which the climate data were generated are at a low density and the time series at several stations contained numerous gaps soil sampling sites were selected within farms assisted by the cfp project with the exception of the three non farm locations and natural parks were excluded as cacao production is not allowed there the total number of sites and samples were limited due to the resources available for the cfp project however the locations of the sampling sites were selected considering their representativeness in terms of soils and landscapes both at the farm and regional levels a point of great importance in digital soil mapping there are errors and uncertainties in the resulting digital soil maps due to errors in sampling sampling density the quality of the covariates used and the techniques or algorithms used for the mapping process each of these datasets and their associated uncertainties were combined in the water balance model to produce estimates of water availability at a monthly time scale leading to further uncertainty in the results there is also a lack of independent data for validation of the modeling results however the methods employed passed the validation checks that we were able to conduct and serve as a model for how the water sufficiency of cacao plantations could be used by other researchers in areas with similar levels of data scarcity for future analysis limitations with the soil mapping could be reduced by doing more sampling if more funding were available in field validation can be implemented by comparing each farm s characterization based on soil moisture measures with the results obtained in this research further work could also include validating the assumptions and results with local technicians whose experience with cacao management and onsite knowledge of the study farms could help to confirm whether the modeled properties of the farms are representative of the real conditions in the region 5 conclusions despite the scarcity of weather stations within and around the study area and the high occurrence of missing data interpolated surfaces of precipitation and temperature were developed for quantifying water scarcity for cacao production similarly testing of the digital soil mapping validated the fundamental inputs for the implementation of site specific and spatially distributed water balance which was consistent with a long term water balance from a global dataset for the study area evapotranspiration estimates also compared well to values from the literature for cacao the spatially distributed water balance allowed us to assess water sufficiency for cacao in the snsm showing that under the climate conditions for the analysis period 1989 2018 rainfall was not enough to prevent cacao yield losses for 10 out of the 27 farms evaluated this suggests that supplemental water would need to be provided or alternative management practices implemented to increase soil water content and thus reduce cacao yield losses and avoid its withering the location of farms in two different departments la guajira and magdalena with contrasting climate conditions needs to be carefully considered when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers farms facing less severe water stress conditions for cacao production are characterized on average by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures and are located in the west of the study region at higher elevations with steeper slopes and soils that contain more organic matter which increases soil water retention temporally attention should be focused on the months between february and august when the region transitions from the dry season into the first part of the wet season water management is most important in march april as the dry season gives way to the new rainy season and july august just before the wettest part of the rainy season results obtained through this case study will be shared with technicians who assist cacao growers in the snsm as the methods followed in this case study are applicable to other cacao regions this can help to increase cacao production worldwide and lead to better more reliable incomes for farmers credit authorship contribution statement valencia jefferson

7834,study region sierra nevada de santa marta snsm region of colombia study focus this research was conducted as a case study to generate relevant quantitative information to support cacao farmer decision making processes concerning water management in the snsm it involved the development and evaluation of a spatial dataset of precipitation and temperature integration of digital soil mapping with a modification of the thornthwaite and mather water balance model and finally an assessment of water sufficiency for cacao production we elaborated site specific and spatially distributed analyses to generate information that will be shared with technicians who assist cacao growers in the snsm new hydrological insights for the region under the climate conditions for the analysis period 1989 2018 rainfall was not enough to prevent cacao yield losses for 10 out of the 27 farms evaluated the location of farms in two departments with contrasting climate conditions showed the importance of spatial analysis of water availability when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers the results revealed that farms facing less frequent water stress are characterized by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures soils that contain more organic matter and are located at higher elevations with steeper slopes temporally water stress is highest in the months february august

central america where it has been cropped for around 1500 years motamayor et al 2002 while cacao production in colombia has a long history it was only recently introduced as a commercial crop in the sierra nevada de santa marta snsm region on the north coast of the country as a substitute for illicit crops after the implementation of plan colombia in 2000 which is a strategy of the u s and colombian governments for fighting drug trafficking dnp 2006 the cacao for peace cfp program funded by the u s agency for international development usaid and executed by the foreign agricultural service of the united states department of agriculture usda fas has supported local cacao farmers as part of its goal to improve the cacao value chain in colombia through cooperative research technical assistance and extension education usda 2016 cacao is extremely susceptible to water availability and therefore drought is a significant stress factor for its growth development and production medrano et al 2015 found that cacao is highly prone to water stress early in its development however water requirements at this stage have not been clearly defined oppong et al 1999 found in a multi year trial that seedlings planted during the first three months of the rainy season improved their survival rate after the dry season by 20 in comparison with those planted in the last month rainy season onset is also the most important environmental factor in triggering flowering which is critical for production of cacao pods and beans adjaloo et al 2012 carr and lockwood 2011 climate change and variability especially changes in temperature and water availability in the dry season also impact cacao significantly schroth et al 2016 this is reflected in the yield reductions of up to 89 due to the severe droughts caused by el niño southern oscillation enso gateau rey et al 2018 despite the relevance of water in cacao cropping systems farmers in developing countries normally do not have enough information concerning cacao water use and water sufficiency to make decisions about potentially implementing management practices to reduce water shortages the goal of this case study is to generate relevant quantitative information to support cacao farmer decision making processes concerning water management with a focus on the snsm region of colombia but being applicable to other regions with similar geographical and data conditions it assesses cacao water use and its critical soil water thresholds in farms as well as mapping the spatial variability of soil water in the region the specific objectives of this research are to 1 develop and evaluate a spatial dataset of precipitation and temperature 2 assess soils and relevant soil properties through digital soil mapping 3 quantify the long term monthly water balance across the region and 4 assess water sufficiency for cacao production and specifically for the target farms strategic information and results obtained through this research will be shared with farmers and local technicians who provide assistance in the study area understanding cacao water requirements and knowing when to provide supplemental water to meet its critical needs can help to increase cacao production in the region and lead to better more reliable incomes for farmers as this research is conducted with the support of the cfp project it will contribute toward capacity building for cacao farmers project partners related ministries and institutions to meet the nation s long term goal to increase quality cacao production land use sustainability and natural resources conservation and long term food security in colombia for future generations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this research takes place along the northern coast of colombia in an area that encompasses 1610 km2 of la guajira and magdalena departments fig 1 this area is limited in the south by the snsm mountains in the north by the caribbean sea in the west by a national protective forest reserve and in the east by the tapias river the region contains nine national natural parks and is surrounded by two more among them the renowned tayrona park in the northwest two strong relief types can be differentiated a mountainous region located in the south and southwest with elevation ranging from 250 to 2849 m above sea level m a s l and a low region where wide plains predominate with an elevation range from 0 to 250 m a s l average annual precipitation ranges spatially from 1300 to 4100 mm with minimum temperatures from 4 to 21 c and maximum temperatures from 14 to 33 c this area experiences a bimodal rainfall behavior with a long dry period from december to april and a longer rainy season subdivided by a slight reduction in rains in july a water balance assessment was developed for 27 cfp assisted cacao farms located in the study area see fig 1 10 in the department of la guajira and 17 in the department of magdalena see table s1 in the supplementary material for their general characteristics la guajira registers the lowest annual rainfall in the country varying spatially from 300 to 1500 mm while in magdalena precipitation ranges from 1000 to more than 2500 mm ideam 2015 study farms are located on both flat plains and mountainous relief with steep slopes two communal organizations of cacao producers are present in the region both groups focus on low income producers that on average have one hectare of cacao in production most of these producers do not have irrigation systems and the majority of cacao systems are produced in combination with crops that provide shade to cacao including banana citrus and woody trees agronomic practices are implemented with expertise from the cfp which has been helping cacao growers for many years to improve yields 2 2 climate data weather data for a 30 year climate period from january 1 1989 to december 31 2018 were provided by the institute of hydrology meteorology and environmental studies ideam by its spanish name stations within a buffer distance of 15 km of the study area were selected resulting in 14 stations with daily precipitation data and seven with daily maximum and minimum temperature data that were subject to quality control and analyzed for data sufficiency 2 2 1 quality control qc data were cleaned to remove values out of range statistical outliers repetitive measurements during five days and measurements that changed excessively between two consecutive days following the procedures of esquivel et al 2018 minimum and maximum threshold values allowed for each variable were defined based on historic records 1981 2010 disaggregated by departments published on the colombia climatological atlas ideam 2015 the precipitation range was defined as 0 200 mm day the minimum temperature range as 0 35 c and the maximum temperature range as 10 45 c forty five degrees celsius is the historic maximum temperature reported for colombia outliers defined as values greater than a multiplier 20 for precipitation 5 for temperature of the interquartile range iqr were deleted these multipliers were chosen to reflect the variability of the weather being higher for precipitation than for temperature repetitive or frequent values during five consecutive days and values that changed by ten degrees celsius or more between two consecutive days were also removed in this process any value that failed any of the abovementioned checks was removed from the series and replaced with na examples of cleaned datasets for two stations are provided in fig s1 supplementary material the resulting time series were analyzed in terms of missing values to determine which stations to use in the analysis the mean percentage of missing values for minimum and maximum temperatures was almost 60 while for precipitation it was 27 due to the low density of stations in the study area stations with percentages of missing data up to 43 3 for precipitation and 67 7 for temperature were kept two stations for temperature and two more for precipitation were discarded based on their missing value percentages for the analysis period see figs s2 s4 supplementary material table 1 presents the final selection of stations 10 for precipitation and 5 for temperature that passed the quality checking process and were used in further analysis one station parque tayrona was discarded for precipitation but kept for temperature 2 2 2 data gap filling gaps in the daily weather data were filled using the nearest neighbor algorithm bounded by elevation moraes et al 2022 this algorithm replaces missing values of a station with values from neighboring stations within an elevation restriction thus preventing the use of a closer station from a very different altitude two elevation restrictions station elevations within 500 m and 1000 m were used for temperature and precipitation respectively these values were determined based on elevation change with respect to climate within the study area where larger changes in temperature than in precipitation were identified in cases when a missing value could not be replaced from any of the nearest stations meeting the elevation restriction a gap filling iterative function was implemented to replace null values with mean daily values for the month calculated for the assessed station the function checks other years for the same month until finding a non null replacement value 2 2 3 generation of monthly climatic surfaces after the data filling was completed the gap filled data was aggregated to a monthly time step this time scale was chosen as cacao is a perennial crop with a long term life cycle of up to 40 years hernandez et al 1989 köhler et al 2009 which implies that water demand is less temporally varying than it is with annual or transitory crops monthly surfaces were generated for each year through spatial interpolations at 1 km of resolution approx 30 arc seconds of monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures this resolution was selected for consistency with widely used high spatial resolution climate datasets such as worldclim hijmans et al 2005 navarro racines et al 2020 also stated that this resolution allows for capturing climate patterns in climate data interpolations for this purpose the thin plate spline smoothing method was used from anusplin version 4 4 which in turn uses elevation as a covariate hutchinson and de hoog 1985 it was implemented a second order spline interpolation and consequently created synthetic stations based on the gauging stations within the interpolation area see fig 2 adding five stations for each variable the resulting synthetic stations contain the same time series as the reference gauging stations and were created in locations with similar elevation and climate to theirs fig 2 for this a digital elevation model dem and the multi year annual precipitation and mean temperature isohyets of colombia for the period 1981 2010 ideam 2017a b were used this process was carried out as the spline order required at least 10 stations per variable for its correct functioning in total 15 stations were used for precipitation and 10 for temperature to carry out the interpolation process the dem originally produced at 30 m was resampled at a final spatial resolution of 1 km by using the bilinear resampling method to evaluate the performance of the interpolation algorithm k fold cross validation fushiki 2011 was executed using 75 of data for training 25 for testing and defining k 25 folds number of iterations the resulting errors from interpolations were assessed by using the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse cross validation results are presented in the supplementary material section s1 2 based on the calculated r2 values the iterations whose medians were greater than the 90th percentile of all medians were identified and considered as the best iterations their corresponding surfaces were then averaged by month resulting in the final surfaces of the interpolation process values of the time series climate characterization were restricted to the value ranges thresholds defined for the quality control process final surfaces were then clipped with the limit of the study area and projected to the local coordinate reference system magna sirgas colombia bogota which was used for all spatial information considered in this study finally those surfaces were also aggregated and plotted on a multi year monthly basis 2 3 digital soil mapping dsm 2 3 1 soil data soils were sampled at twenty seven farms and three non farm locations fig 1 resulting in seventy three auger sites and a set of ten full pedon descriptions seven of them at the farms sampling sites were selected based on representative soil units and landscapes of the study area being the non farm locations chosen for full pedon descriptions to cover the remaining soil units libohova et al 2020 in total 415 samples were taken through soil horizons down to depths of up to 2 m or until reaching the unconsolidated material in which the soil is formed effective soil depth esd refers to physical restrictions such as high stoniness compacted soil horizons or unweathered parent materials table s1 in the supplementary material shows the esd at each sampling location within a farm soil properties such as texture sand clay and silt and organic matter om were determined in the laboratory for every sample using the methods of bouyoucos 1936 and walkley and black 1934 respectively available water content awc was calculated by the difference between field capacity 33 kpa and wilting point 1500 kpa for all locations based on the pedotransfer functions ptf that in turn use sand clay and om as input for characterizing hydrological soil properties saxton and rawls 2006 an equal area spline function using the gsif r package hengl 2020 was applied to transform measured data into specific depth layers odgers et al 2012 four layers were defined for this research based on cacao root interactions with soils and the maximum depth reached in the field sampling 0 20 cm 20 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm the first defined layer 0 20 cm depth h1 includes the most active fine cacao root system which is essential in water and nutrient absorption arévalo gardini et al 2017 argüello et al 2019 the second layer 20 60 cm depth h2 contains up to 80 of roots in cacao plantations asmamaw et al 2017 de almeida and valle 2007 finally since cacao roots can reach depths up to 1 5 2 m carr and lockwood 2011 two subsequent layers 60 100 cm h3 100 200 cm h4 were also considered at these last two depths the cacao root system is dominated by the taproot which is mainly in charge of anchoring the plant and from which other secondary roots sprout in the search for water and nutrients rajab et al 2018 2 3 2 soil properties prediction soil texture esd and awc are important inputs for the water balance model thus spatial distributions of the esd cm soil texture sand silt and clay in and awc for all soil depths h1 h4 were mapped at 30 m of spatial resolution using a digital soil mapping dsm approach based on random forest dsm predicts the spatial distribution of soil properties based on soil forming factors described by pendleton and jenny 1945 by combining field and laboratory data with a variety of environmental variables in a mathematical model ma et al 2019 mcbratney et al 2003 minasny and mcbratney 2016 moore et al 1993 zhu 1997 zhu et al 2001 random forest is a machine learning method widely used in dsm that predicts soil properties from a large collection of non correlated decision trees breiman 2001 which are created from the spatial relationship between soil data and environmental variables the following environmental variables at 30 m of spatial resolution were implemented as predictors in the dsm modeling dem

cover lulc was generated by ideam with the corine land cover clc classification system cec 1993 adapted for colombia at a scale of 1 100 000 for 2017 the study area is composed of 30 lulc classes where cacao farms represent 0 02 38 4 ha of the total extent these 27 cacao crop farms were inserted imposed on the lulc map as a class named cacao the classes in both spanish original and english other referenced parameters i e kc p and cn which will be explained later in section 2 5 and their sources as well as the corresponding areas are shown in table s3 supplementary material 2 5 water balance model the water balance was developed for the entire region by calculating surface runoff and effective precipitation evapotranspiration and percolation as described below 2 5 1 surface runoff calculation surface runoff was estimated using the soil conservation service curve number cn method usda scs 1986 for this the hydrologic soil group hsg for each soil type was determined based on the texture of the first layer h1 using the usda scs 1986 procedure and the software saga gis soils classified as hsg a have the smallest runoff potential while soils with hsg d have the greatest the cn2 average condition values for all the classes of the lulc map were assigned based on multiple references see table s3 supplementary material the raw cn2 raster was calculated by executing the tool pick of arcgis for desktop using the calculated hsgs and the cn2s associated with the lulc classes that were rasterized at the same resolution of the dem 30 m this tool picks a value from a specific raster based on a value of another one i e position raster in this case hsg so it resulted in the association of the corresponding cn2 value according to the hsg cns are theoretically estimated for flat conditions neitsch et al 2011 or plot slopes 5 so cn2 for slopes greater than 5 were adjusted according to the procedure of huang et al 2006 cn2 values were not adjusted for antecedent moisture conditions based on current recommendations in hawkins et al 2019 to calculate runoff daily precipitation values were first allocated to thiessen polygons created for the stations used in the generation of the climatic surfaces fig 2 by using these polygons and with the slope adjusted cn2 raster the runoff was calculated for each day of the series finally the resulting daily runoff surfaces were aggregated on a monthly basis which served as an input to the water balance calculation 2 5 2 potential evapotranspiration there are multiple methods used worldwide to calculate potential evapotranspiration based on weather variables such as temperature sunshine wind speed solar radiation and humidity the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 has been implemented in areas with limited weather information demonstrating reasonable results allen et al 1998 which makes it useful for the estimation of water balances in such locations droogers and allen 2002 modified the standard equation of hargreaves by including monthly rainfall as one of its components and concluded that with this modification it is more appropriate for use in areas with limited data availability of weather information than methods with higher data requirements like penman monteith for its implementation solar radiation was calculated with equations 21 25 of the food and agriculture organization fao 56 crop evapotranspiration guide allen et al 1998 2 5 3 actual evapotranspiration the crop evapotranspiration etc of land uses covers in the study area was determined based on potential evapotranspiration etp estimates and a crop factor kc kc values were assigned to all the classes of the lulc map based on literature values see table s3 supplementary material and the resulting layer was rasterized the kc value assigned to the cacao farms 1 05 is for a mixed cacao system with total canopy cover allen et al 1998 in consequence the etc of the farms should be close to that of a system with tall trees carr and lockwood 2011 in dry months etc was reduced based on the calculated water stress to determine the actual evapotranspiration eta the depletion fraction p of the water holding capacity represents the moisture that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in etc occurs allen et al 1998 siebert and döll 2010 according to allen et al 1998 a value of 0 3 for p can be assigned to a cacao crop which defines it as sensitive to water stress as stated by raes 2002 for other non cacao crops a value of 0 5 was used allen et al 1998 while for non vegetated lulc classes a value of 0 was assigned table s3 a water stress coefficient ks was calculated based on soil moisture and etc was reduced when the soil water storage s was below the threshold defined by p no reduction was applied to etc ks 1 when s was at or above that threshold level 2 5 4 water balance calculation the water balance was based on the modification by ulmen 2000 of the widely used thornthwaite and mather water balance model thornthwaite and mather 1955 following the scheme shown in fig 3 the starting value of s was assumed as 90 of the water holding capacity whc following suggestions of ulmen 2000 whc was determined based on the available water content awc and the effective soil depth esd resulting from the digital soil mapping effective precipitation peff is the remaining precipitation p after being reduced by surface runoff months were defined as dry etc peff or wet etc peff this model assumes that initial conditions are wet water content is close to whc so the water balance was set to start in november a month after the wettest month in the study area october also the first year 1989 was used as the initial warm up year of the water balance 2 6 water sufficiency for cacao production 2 6 1 previous studies of effects of water deficit on cacao yields zuidema et al 2005 found in a modeling study of 30 locations in 10 countries that rainfall of the two driest months and annual solar radiation could explain 70 of cacao yield variations and that yield reductions up to 50 could occur when rain is below 50 mm for two months in an experiment implemented in indonesia schwendenmann et al 2010 found similar yield reductions 45 when a severe drought period occurred during the initial stage of fruiting they also noticed that slight drought levels during that stage decreased yield by 10 while cacao yield is severely reduced by drought cacao trees have been shown to maintain minimal physiological activities to survive and to suppress totally or partially their reproductive stage adjaloo et al 2012 de almeida et al 2016 moser et al 2010 köhler et al 2010 moser et al 2010 and schwendenmann et al 2010 studied cacao water stress through physiological responses cacao productivity and their related soil moisture levels they found that there are significant soil water thresholds that affect cacao yield and therefore can be considered to determine the water needs of a cropping system that would support increased productivity 2 6 2 soil water thresholds understanding and determining critical soil water thresholds of the cacao crop is of high relevance not only for the study area but also for other places where cacao cropping systems exist the definition of these thresholds can provide a basis for understanding when a cacao system is likely facing water stress accordingly these thresholds were determined based on the calculation of the relative extractable soil water rew granier et al 1999 schwendenmann et al 2010 rew i s i s min s max s min where si is the soil water storage at month i mm and smin and smax are the long term minimum and maximum values of s mm water stress can occur in cacao crops when the rew value is below 0 4 which can entail a yield reduction of up to 10 granier et al 1999 schwendenmann et al 2010 rew values of 0 1 or less imply that cacao trees do not continue producing biomass that is they stop their vegetative growth and could be at the threshold of withering generating yield reductions of up to 45 in the system granier et al 1999 moser et al 2010 schwendenmann et al 2010 thus the lower and upper soil water thresholds for cacao were defined as rew 0 1 and rew 0 4 respectively the values of soil water storage s for those rew values were determined for each location in the study area and the difference for each month between the si and s at each threshold was calculated to determine if the location was experiencing water stress negative differences represent the supplemental soil water content in mm that would need to be added through the implementation of management practices such as irrigation to maintain a healthy cacao crop 3 results 3 1 climate dataset the results of the climate data processing and interpolation were 1 the cleaned and gap filled time series for each station and variable and 2 the interpolated maps of precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures for each month these results are available online at valencia et al 2022 climate varies spatially especially from the lowlands of the northeast to the high elevations of the southwest as an overview of the resulting climatic surfaces fig 4 shows the average annual precipitation and temperature extremes with the corresponding stations used for their generation rain is higher 4100 mm year in the southwest region where the highest elevations predominate and where the lowest temperatures occur 5 ºc the highest temperatures 33 ºc and the lowest rains 1300 mm year are in the lower altitudes especially in the northeast la guajira department temporal climate patterns in fig 5 illustrate that rainfall presents a bimodal behavior with predominant peaks in may and october the dry season from december to april is critical for water availability for cacao temperature is quite consistent throughout the year with slightly warmer temperatures from june to august in february the month with the lowest precipitation average rainfall ranges across the region from 8 to 42 mm month minimum temperature from 4 to 21 ºc and maximum temperature from 14 to 33 ºc in october the month with the highest precipitation average rainfall varies spatially between 290 and 471 mm month minimum temperature between 6 and 23 ºc and maximum temperature between 13 and 33 ºc 3 2 digital soil mapping dsm descriptive statistics of regional soil properties such as effective soil depth esd soil texture sand silt and clay organic matter and estimations of field capacity wilting point and available water content awc are summarized in table 2 loamy soil textures predominate in all layers h1 h4 followed by clay loam sandy loam and sandy clay loam mean values of sand silt and clay remain similar through all depths while the mean organic matter value is higher for shallower soils due to the higher accumulation of this property in the first centimeters of the soil than deeper in the soil profile this is attributed to more biological activity and a greater presence of litter vegetation residuals and root systems in the topsoil layer together these properties result in a slightly higher capacity of the soil at h1 to hold water at tensions of 1500 kpa wp and 33 kpa fc and a greater mean value of awc at this depth regarding esd a predominance of moderate 50 100 cm and deep 100 150 cm soils was identified at sampled locations while shallow 50 cm and very deep 150 cm soils were not common see table s1 in the supplementary material the spatial distribution of awc predicted for each soil depth used in this study h1 to h4 is presented in fig 6 higher values of awc at depths h1 and h4 were predicted in the northern plains likely due to the presence of soils derived from sedimentary rocks which are characterized by high organic matter contents and finer soil textures finer soil textures promote soil aggregation om protection and soil moisture augustin and cihacek 2016 xie et al 2021 yang et al 2016 enhancing thus the water holding capacity and plant water availability of the soil higher values of awc at depths h2 and h3 were predicted in the soils formed mainly from metamorphic and igneous rocks located in mountainous landscapes characterized by higher om and fine textures contents spatial distributions of soil texture at depth h1 and esd as well as soil sampling data and other soil property maps can be visualized at the cacao for peace gis platform https arcg is 1hmgrl 3 3 water balance assessment the long term 30 years annual water balance developed for the study area determined that the average annual rainfall of 2041 mm is distributed as 234 mm of surface runoff 11 of rainfall 831 mm of evapotranspiration 41 of rainfall and 987 mm of percolation 48 of rainfall as no streamflow measurements were available for the study area for validation of the water balance results the gscd global streamflow characteristics dataset beck et al 2015 2013 at a spatial resolution of 0 125 degree approx 13 5 km at the equator was used as an approximate quantitative assessment that is appropriate for ungauged catchments to evaluate the simulated values the water yield runoff percolation ratio of the developed water balance 59 8 compared well with that provided by gscd 60 3 for the study area this small difference in values allowed us to conclude that in general terms the model used in this research correctly balances water long term for the study area and can be used our evapotranspiration estimates also compared well to values from the literature for cacao computed eta of the 27 cacao farms from our water balance model ranged between 776 and 1130 mm year with a mean value of 968 mm year these results were found to be similar to those reported by radersma and de ridder 1996 who provided a range of annual eta for cacao between 878 and 1074 mm where the lower number was for cacao under drought stress the spatially averaged monthly water balance for the region is presented in fig 7 and complete monthly results are in table s4 supplementary material during dry months january to march eta was greater than rainfall meaning that evaporative demand of plants is drawn from soil moisture and that there is an increased potential for water stress at the end of this dry season 3 4 water sufficiency for cacao the method developed allowed the evaluation of the spatial distribution of soil water availability and its relationship to the critical thresholds for cacao on a monthly basis fig 8 the maps identify locations in the region where cacao is more or less susceptible to water stress based principally on climate and soil analysis of the resulting climate datasets shows that those farms 10 out of 27 located in the department of la guajira are more vulnerable to water shortage and therefore their corresponding cacao systems are likely to experience water stress more frequently most of the cacao farms would require supplemental water to not fall below the upper critical threshold where cacao drought stress can occur see top left map in fig 8 the supplemental water demand is larger for those farms located on the east side of the study area with an average monthly demand of up to 50 mm in february for this month multi year average monthly soil water storage for none of the 27 cacao farms fell below the lower critical threshold 10 for the month with the highest precipitation october the average monthly soil water storage exceeds both critical thresholds for the entire study area which indicates that the cacao farms do not need supplemental water during this month and do not experience drought stress however this analysis is based on long term average surfaces for the study area and therefore extreme values or critical moments during the 30 years of water balance modeling could be smoothed or hidden for this reason specific analyses by farm were performed considering the whole time series which allowed us to make comparisons among farms and identify the critical times of the year for cacao in the study area the percentage of all months over the 30 year simulation period that the soil water storage was below both critical thresholds is shown in fig 9 for each of the 27 farms ranked by the percentage below the lower 10 critical threshold when soil water storage is below the upper critical threshold the cacao crop starts experiencing drought stress and when it is below the lower critical threshold it no longer produces biomass stops all vegetative growth and is at the limit of withering and permanent damage farms located on the left side of the chart mostly located in the department of magdalena experience less water stress than those on the right which are mostly in the department of la guajira both critical thresholds should be analyzed together to have a realistic outlook of the potential for water stress at a farm as the crop is suffering from drought impacts while below the upper critical threshold but in danger of permanent damage when below the lower critical threshold for example farms f56 and f9 both in the la guajira department experience nearly the same percentage of months below the upper critical threshold 33 and 34 respectively but f9 is below the lower critical threshold for 5 of all months while f56 is never below the lower critical threshold this indicates that both farms suffer from drought a similar amount of time but that drought conditions are more severe at f9 correlation between the percentage of months that soil water storage was below either of the critical soil water thresholds for the 30 years of analysis and variables describing location soil and climate of individual farms were evaluated to identify potential predictors of farms that suffer more from water scarcity see table s1 and fig s6 in the supplementary material for the corresponding scatter plots variables such as annual precipitation longitude organic matter and mean temperature are statistically significant and highly correlated to the threshold percentages table 3 while elevation and slope were found to be less strongly correlated other variables such as latitude effective soil depth and soil texture sand clay and silt were not statistically significant in summary farms facing less frequent water stress conditions for cacao production are characterized by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures are located more to the west at higher elevations present greater slopes and their soils contain higher organic matter which facilitates soil water retention and consequently increases soil moisture although these farms are in a steep relief their dense coverage of associated shading trees and litter are efficient in controlling runoff the approaches and methods used in this research allowed for the discrimination of farms in terms of water sufficiency even when they are in close spatially proximity for example three farms f40 f39 and f38 were very close to each other spatially approx 250 m apart but were found to have very different water balance characteristics f40 experiences considerably less water stress than farms f38 and f39 see fig 9 and table s1 in the supplementary material farm f40 is at a higher elevation 358 m a s l with less soil clay content 22 and a higher infiltration capacity hsg b and cn2 69 in contrast to f38 and f39 279 and 315 m a s l respectively clay 26 hsg c and cn2 79 furthermore as revealed through the soil sampling campaign f40 presented a denser coverage of associated shading trees 3 5 individual farm assessments the tool developed as part of this research can produce summaries of water availability and stress level for each of the farms to illustrate this point two farms have been selected for additional discussion farm f0 located in the la guajira department is an example of a farm showing significant water stress as its soil water storage was below the upper critical threshold 65 of the time and below the lower critical threshold 20 of all months see fig 9 meanwhile farm f29 located in the magdalena department experienced almost no water stress with soil water storage below the upper critical threshold only 2 of the time and never below the lower critical threshold as examples of the specific analyses that were carried out for each farm the water balance in terms of soil water storage for both average conditions and extreme climatic years together with the soil water thresholds relevant to cacao are presented in fig 10 for these two contrasting farms soil water storage at farm 0 peaks in october and november along with annual average rainfall but by december soil storage has already begun to drop with the end of the rainy season storage is below the upper critical threshold for february march and april with soil moisture storage reaching a minimum in april even as the new rainy season gets started farm soil moisture storage does not recover and exceeds the upper critical threshold until august and september when the second wetter part of the rainy season begins this farm is highly dependent on the timing of the start of the wet season and on the quantity of rainfall delivered it is a location that would benefit significantly from irrigation to reduce the impacts of drought farm 29 on the other hand hardly experiences any water stress in most years storage falls below the upper critical thresholds only 17 of the time in march and only 7 of the time in april this farm has never come close to falling below the lower threshold the need for irrigation at this farm is small future farms placed in similar locations would likely not need supplemental irrigation 4 discussion the new climate dataset described here which includes spatially varying precipitation and temperature provides an improved basis for analyzing water sufficiency in the study region the 1 km spatial resolution used for the interpolation of climate surfaces allowed us to capture the weather variations of the study region that could be lost at lower resolutions particularly in mountainous landscapes existing climate datasets such as the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps funk et al 2014 or the global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2019 are either at coarser resolution or do not focus on this region the newly developed region specific digital soil maps also provide advantages over currently available global digital soil maps e g soilgrids hengl et al 2017 since they were developed with more consistent samples at a greater scale of detail using a sampling scheme developed to characterize the local soil characteristics for model training the use of these new datasets together with the modified thornthwaite and mather model to calculate a spatially varying monthly water balance provides an improved method for determining water sufficiency for cacao production in the region existing studies either focused on general climate variables such as precipitation and temperature without explicitly calculating a water balance e g singh et al 2021 or calculated the water balance at the plot scale without a broader spatial analysis köhler et al 2014 2010 comparison to thresholds for cacao yield reductions used in previous research showed that the location of farms needs to be carefully considered when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers granier et al 1999 and schwendenmann et al 2010 found that yield reductions of up to 10 could be expected when soil moisture falls below the upper threshold a situation that occurred regularly especially in the eastern part of the study area without the application of supplemental water however soil moisture below the lower threshold was rare this is important because if water storage drops below this threshold it can lead to yield reductions of up to 45 granier et al 1999 moser et al 2010 schwendenmann et al 2010 and means that the trees could be at the limit of withering extended periods below the lower critical threshold could result in die off in the cacao plantation this study like others found that precipitation is a key factor for cacao throughout its development as this crop is highly prone to drought adjaloo et al 2012 medrano et al 2015 temperature also impacts cacao considerably as also shown by schroth et al 2016 especially in extremely dry periods where reductions in yields have been observed gateau rey et al 2018 key soil properties identified in this research as well as in previous research include soil organic matter and soil water retention capacity gusli et al 2020 niether et al 2017 although this study used spatial data products generated from local climate and soil information and well validated modeling approaches there are limitations the weather stations from which the climate data were generated are at a low density and the time series at several stations contained numerous gaps soil sampling sites were selected within farms assisted by the cfp project with the exception of the three non farm locations and natural parks were excluded as cacao production is not allowed there the total number of sites and samples were limited due to the resources available for the cfp project however the locations of the sampling sites were selected considering their representativeness in terms of soils and landscapes both at the farm and regional levels a point of great importance in digital soil mapping there are errors and uncertainties in the resulting digital soil maps due to errors in sampling sampling density the quality of the covariates used and the techniques or algorithms used for the mapping process each of these datasets and their associated uncertainties were combined in the water balance model to produce estimates of water availability at a monthly time scale leading to further uncertainty in the results there is also a lack of independent data for validation of the modeling results however the methods employed passed the validation checks that we were able to conduct and serve as a model for how the water sufficiency of cacao plantations could be used by other researchers in areas with similar levels of data scarcity for future analysis limitations with the soil mapping could be reduced by doing more sampling if more funding were available in field validation can be implemented by comparing each farm s characterization based on soil moisture measures with the results obtained in this research further work could also include validating the assumptions and results with local technicians whose experience with cacao management and onsite knowledge of the study farms could help to confirm whether the modeled properties of the farms are representative of the real conditions in the region 5 conclusions despite the scarcity of weather stations within and around the study area and the high occurrence of missing data interpolated surfaces of precipitation and temperature were developed for quantifying water scarcity for cacao production similarly testing of the digital soil mapping validated the fundamental inputs for the implementation of site specific and spatially distributed water balance which was consistent with a long term water balance from a global dataset for the study area evapotranspiration estimates also compared well to values from the literature for cacao the spatially distributed water balance allowed us to assess water sufficiency for cacao in the snsm showing that under the climate conditions for the analysis period 1989 2018 rainfall was not enough to prevent cacao yield losses for 10 out of the 27 farms evaluated this suggests that supplemental water would need to be provided or alternative management practices implemented to increase soil water content and thus reduce cacao yield losses and avoid its withering the location of farms in two different departments la guajira and magdalena with contrasting climate conditions needs to be carefully considered when providing recommendations of management practices to cacao growers farms facing less severe water stress conditions for cacao production are characterized on average by higher rainfalls and lower temperatures and are located in the west of the study region at higher elevations with steeper slopes and soils that contain more organic matter which increases soil water retention temporally attention should be focused on the months between february and august when the region transitions from the dry season into the first part of the wet season water management is most important in march april as the dry season gives way to the new rainy season and july august just before the wettest part of the rainy season results obtained through this case study will be shared with technicians who assist cacao growers in the snsm as the methods followed in this case study are applicable to other cacao regions this can help to increase cacao production worldwide and lead to better more reliable incomes for farmers credit authorship contribution statement valencia jefferson
