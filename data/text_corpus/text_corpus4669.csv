23345,by traveling inside a gas cavity a supercavitating vehicle can reduce hydrodynamic drag increase speed and minimize power consumption the main challenge for controlling a supercavitating vehicle is a nonlinear force that arises when the vehicle back end pierces the cavity this force referred to as planing leads to oscillatory motion and instability in an effort to develop robust control technologies for supercavitating vehicles we developed and tested a control methodology for a small scale system capable of freely rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel we constructed a low order nonlinear model of the longitudinal vehicle motion that is based on experimental observations and physical principles by using this model we developed a controller design method that delivers a proof of performance in the face of nonlinear and uncertain planing forces experiments with the vehicle prototype in the water tunnel suggest that the proposed control technique ensured higher performance when the uncertain planing dynamics are considered in the control synthesis keywords supercavitating vehicle vehicle modeling nonlinear systems robust control experimental validation 1 introduction supercavitation is a developed form of cavitation in which a large gas cavity is created behind an object that moves with respect to a fluid an underwater vehicle surrounded by a gas cavity referred to as supercavity exhibits a decrease in contact area with the fluid a reduction of skin friction drag and ultimately an increase in speed j m s inc the attainable speeds and power efficiency of supercavitating vehicles open new possibilities for high speed transportation ocean exploration and defense however traveling inside a supercavity brings new challenges to the development of robust control systems for these vehicles when the vehicle is fully enveloped by the supercavity only the nose of the vehicle cavitator and fins are wetted when the vehicle back end pierces the supercavity and immerses into the fluid a large slapping force is suddenly created this force referred to as planing can cause oscillatory motion and instability developing control strategies that guarantee stability and performance in the presence of planing is a challenge because low order vehicle models typically used for control design do not accurately capture the complex planing physics several strategies have been proposed for the control of the benchmark vehicle model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 the investigations in mao and wang dzielski and kurdila 2003 balas et al 2006 vanek et al 2007 mao and wang use nonlinear inversion sliding mode control and linear parameter varying lpv techniques to control the dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle traveling at a fixed axial speed these strategies rely on idealized low order models of the supercavity to estimate planing forces and schedule the controllers the control strategy presented in lin et al 2010 use sector bounds to characterize the planing force and validate the absolute stability of the controller and vehicle mathematical model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 to validate proposed control systems considering the inaccuracy in the planing models numerical simulations have been used mao and wang balas et al 2006 mao and wang a limitation of using numerical simulations is that they do not provide a proof of stability and performance in all possible scenarios in an effort to address this limitation we developed and tested a robust control framework for a small scale supercavitating vehicle capable of rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel in particular we derived a low order model of the vehicle dynamics that includes modeling uncertainty developed tools for the synthesis of robust controllers based on the uncertainty vehicle model and validated the controllers in the high speed water tunnel the proposed strategy is suitable for reference tracking does not require real time measurements of planing and could be extended to design control systems for large scale vehicles this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the vector notation and coordinate transformations used throughout the paper as well as a brief introduction to supercavitation in section 3 we describe the small scale vehicle and experimental facilities used for mathematical modeling and control testing the mathematical model of the small scale vehicle is developed in section 4 in section 5 we describe the control synthesis tools developed for the experimental vehicle results of testing the proposed control laws with the experimental vehicle prototype in a high speed water tunnel are presented in section 6 in section 7 we present the limitations of this study conclusions and future directions are presented in section 8 2 preliminaries 2 1 vector notation and transformations the vector notation described as follows is used throughout this paper to characterize the vehicle and supercavity motion a vector representing the position of a point or a coordinate frame b with respect to a coordinate frame a is denoted by p a b a x b a z b with angles positive from z a b to x a b the position of point f with respect to frame a given its position relative to frame b and the relative position between frames p a b is given by the following homogeneous transformation craig 2005 p a f 1 r b a p a b 0 1 p b f 1 t b a γ b a p a b p ˆ b f where r b a is a rotation transformation based on angle γ b a measured between b and a the derivative of a position vector p b f with respect to time and relative to b is given by v b f b d p b f t d t the velocity of f relative to b but expressed with respect to a is v a f b b a r v b f b when the velocity of f relative to b is expressed with respect to the inertial frame e we use v f b v e f b the velocity of f relative to e and expressed with respect to e is denoted by v e b e v f additionally the velocity of a frame b relative to e but expressed with respect to b is v b b v b b e e b r v e b 2 2 supercavitation the cavitation number defined as σ def 2 p p c ρ v c f 2 is a parameter that describes supercavitation p is the pressure outside the supercavity p c is the pressure inside the supercavity ρ is the fluid density and v c f is the relative speed between the cavitator center of pressure c p and the fluid by decreasing σ the likelihood of developing supercavitation increases the cavitation number can be lowered and supercavitation achieved by either increasing v c f or by decreasing the difference p p c in open waters supercavitation is naturally achieved when σ 0 1 approximately when supercavitation is naturally achieved p c is the vapor pressure injecting air behind the cavitator increases p c and allows for the formation of ventilated supercavities at low speeds ventilated supercavitation can be used to form supercavities until reaching natural supercavitation at higher speeds and for experimentation in water tunnels the supercavity dimension is a function of σ blockage and the gravitational acceleration g as σ decreases the supercavity length and diameter increase when supercavitation experiments are conducted in a high speed water tunnel the supercavity can exhibit a decrease in its diameter and an increase in its length due to the presence of the tunnel walls blockage a supercavity can also exhibit asymmetric shapes due to gravity and in water tunnels due to its relative position with the tunnel walls the effect of gravity on the supercavity asymmetry is negligible when v c f g d c with d c being the cavitator diameter 3 experimental methods 3 1 facilities experiments presented in this paper were carried out in the high speed water tunnel located at the university of minnesota st anthony falls laboratory safl this tunnel is a recirculating closed circuit facility capable of regulating absolute pressures and achieving velocities up to 20 m s its test section is 0 19 m width by 0 19 m height by 1 m long kawakami and arndt 2011 the supercavitating scale vehicle shown in fig 1 was used for both vehicle modeling and controller validation this vehicle was equipped with a ventilation system that enabled the formation of supercavities at speeds above 3 m s the test vehicle consisted of a cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 148 mm length with an interchangeable disk cavitator and two interchangeable lateral fins two servo actuators located inside the vehicle deflected the cavitator and fins the maximum deflections of the fins and cavitator were 20 deg and 15 deg respectively the vehicle s weight was 1 kg the water speed upstream from the cavitator was calibrated via a laser doppler velocimetry system based on this calibration we adjusted the water speed for modeling and control experiments the water velocity vector upstream from the cavitator is perpenticular to the gravity vector an oscillating foil gust generator was used to perturb the flow and study the supercavity dynamics by perturbing the flow we varied the cavitator attack angle and thereby displaced the supercavity upwards and downwards when the supercavity displacements due to gust oscillations were large we were able to generate planing and characterize planing forces applied at the vehicle back end 3 2 modeling we constrained the vehicle motion to characterize the supercavity kinematics as well as the forces at the cavitator fins and planing regions the back end of the scale vehicle was attached to a force and torque transducer that was in turn attached to the tunnel through a strut this force transducer was used to quantify how forces changed due to variations in planing immersion as well as cavitator and fin deflections a high speed camera recorded videos of the supercavity kinematics and the interaction between the vehicle body and supercavity to accurately capture the supercavity dynamics we recorded videos of the water tunnel experiments at 1000 frames per second the videos were synchronized with a data acquisition and control computer via a light emitter diode led that was turned on when the experiments started by perturbing the supercavity via the gust generator oscillations we characterized how variations in the cavitator attack angle altered the supercavity kinematics this characterization helped us validate mathematical models of the supercavity kinematics supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2018 04 060 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article video video we were able to characterize planing forces by using estimates of the vehicle back end immersion these estimates were obtained via customized image segmentation algorithms 9 shapiro and stockman 2001 applied to the video recordings in particular we measured the planing height h and angle α p see fig 2 by varying the gust generator angle we could change the planing immersion but not the planing angle to change the planing angle we adjusted the orientation of the vehicle body with respect to the flow forces at the cavitator and fins were characterized by deflecting the cavitator and fin surfaces and measuring the resulting forces 3 3 controller testing for controller testing we used an experimental setup different to that used for modeling in the control validation setup the small scale vehicle was attached to a lateral shaft to enable free rotation about the vehicle s pitch axis whereas in the modeling setup the vehicle was fixed to a strut in the back end and was not able to rotate fig 3 depicts the control validation platform the rotation angle is equal to the vehicle attack angle this angle was measured using a rotary encoder of 1024 pulses per revolution by translating the rotary shaft along the slit plate the vehicle center of rotation and dynamics were adjusted typically the center of rotation was set as far as possible from the planing region so that planing could generate the largest possible destabilizing torques the control algorithms were implemented in a real time data acquisition and control computer daqc running matlab simulink 2015a and real time windows target rtwt with a sampling rate of 100 samples per sec the daqc commanded the cavitator and fin deflections based on the commands computed by the control law the total delay in the closed loop interconnection attributed to the data acquisition card operating system simulink software and actuators was 3 samples 30 ms a limitation of the control platform is that the rotational shaft pierced the supercavity leading to a wake and lateral planing fig 4 illustrates the lateral planing regions in the control validation experiments we removed the fin located downstream from the rotary shaft to minimize vibrations generated by the interaction between the rotary shaft s wake and the fin thus in the control validation setup only the fin located in the opposite side of the shaft along the vehicle s lateral axis was used note that the vibrations mentioned above would not occur in a vehicle traveling undersea as the rotary shaft would not be attached to the vehicle the major undesirable effect of lateral planing was that it damped out accelerations created during the switching between non planing and planing conditions this damping downplays the destabilizing effect that switching has on the vehicle dynamics moreover lateral planing is a complex phenomenon that is challenging to measure and characterize with low order mathematical models as those we seek to develop in this paper it is important to highlight that despite the presence of lateral planing and its damping effect instability and oscillatory motion were observed in the vehicle open loop dynamics fig 5 demonstrate how a step input to the fin deflection led to planing and thereafter oscillatory motion 4 modeling in this section we present a low dimensional model of the longitudinal motion of the small scale vehicle that is capable of rotating about its pitch axis in the high speed water tunnel at the st anthony falls laboratory based on the low order dynamics an uncertainty model of the vehicle motion was developed this uncertainty model was the basis for the control strategies presented in section 5 4 1 coordinate frames and angles the coordinate frames used to characterize the vehicle dynamics are shown in fig 6 the body frame b x ˆ b y ˆ b z ˆ b is attached to the center of rotation x ˆ b is tied to the body s centerline the pitch angle θ is measured between the horizon and x ˆ b note that for our pitching vehicle θ α the cavitator frame is c x ˆ c y ˆ c z ˆ c x ˆ c is normal to the cavitator surface and forms an angle δ c with x ˆ b referred to as cavitator deflection the velocity of the cavitator relative to the fluid v c f forms an angle α c with x ˆ c referred to as cavitator angle of attack the distance between the cavitator center of pressure c p and b is denoted by l c the fin frame is f x ˆ f y ˆ f z ˆ f x ˆ f forms an angle δ f with x ˆ b δ f is referred to as fin deflection the velocity of the fin relative to the fluid v f f forms an angle α f with x ˆ f referred to as fin angle of attack the distance between the fin c p and b is denoted by l f the length of the vehicle from the cavitator c p to the back end is l the distance from b to the vehicle back end is l p l l c 4 2 forces the gravitational forces expressed in the body frame are f b g x m g sin θ and f b g z m g cos θ the forces at the cavitator are f b x c 1 2 ρ v c f 2 a c c d c cos α c cos δ c f b z c 1 2 ρ v c f 2 a c c d c cos α c sin δ c where ρ is the fluid density a c is the cavitator surface area c d c is the cavitator drag force coefficient escobar et al 2014 formulas based on thin airfoil theory bertin and smith 1998 were used to describe the forces generated by the wetted portions of the fins the fin forces expressed in the body frame are f b x f 1 2 ρ v f f 2 a f a f d 0 a f d α f 2 cos α f δ f a f l α f sin α f δ f f b z f 1 2 ρ v f f 2 a f a

the fin into the fluid c f is the fin chord a r 2 b f c f is the aspect ratio as defined in kermeen 1960 b f is a fraction of the total fin height b f the above force models provided acceptable accuracy when comparing to experimental data escobar 2015 for attack angles α f 15 deg planing forces were modeled following the study in waid and kermeen 1957 the planing forces expressed in the body frame are given by f b x p 1 2 ρ v p f 2 d c y l 2 c p x f b z p 1 2 ρ v p f 2 d c y l 2 c p z c p x and c p z are the coefficients of force along x ˆ b and z ˆ b respectively v p f is the velocity of the planing center of pressure c p with respect to the fluid velocity vector dcyl is the vehicle body diameter in the back end d c y l in the water tunnel this velocity vector is perpendicular to the gravitational acceleration and v p f is equal to the speed of the planning c p in the inertial frame only c p z is described as follows because it is the component that contributes to the vehicle pitching motion the value of c p z as a function of the immersion derived from the experiments described in section 3 2 is presented in fig 7 a linear model accurately predicted the relationship between the normalized immersion height h d c y l and the coefficient of planing force c p z at three different planing angles α p 15 21 and 26 deg the linear model is given by c p z a p z α p h d c y l given that c p z is dominated by h we simplified the low order vehicle model by assuming that the planing angle was constant α p 21 ḋeg the model we used for the planing coefficient c p z depends on the planing immersion only it neglects the effects on the planing force of the relative vehicle supercavity velocities and accelerations and collision of the vehicle body with the fluid vanek 2008 paryshev 2006 we neglected these effects to minimize model complexity and because the effect of the vehicle colliding with the fluid was reduced by lateral planing in our vehicle prototype 4 3 supercavity the supercavity model we constructed was based on the models proposed by waid 1957 and logvinovich we developed this model using images from videos recorded during experiments in which the fins were not attached to the vehicle prototype to characterize the geometrical asymmetries of the supercavity associated with gravity and the wall effects blockage we used two different semi ellipses for the top and bottom traces of the supercavity the position p j j x j z j of a point along the upper j 1 or lower j 2 trace of the supercavity is 1 z j 1 j b j 1 x j a j a j 2 1 η the transversal section of the supercavity is assumed circular the points describing the supercavity are defined with respect to the supercavity frame j x ˆ j z ˆ j whose origin coincides with the cavitator edge where the flow separates x ˆ j is parallel to the velocity of the cavitator relative to the fluid v c f parameters a j and b j were measured using photos of the supercavity and η 1 8 was set following 17 note that these parameters depend on the cavitation number tunnel dimensions and gravitational acceleration fig 8 illustrates the parameters of the supercavity semi elliptical model control oriented models of a supercavitating vehicle seldom include the effect of cavitator attack angle α c on the supercavity dynamics however this variable is critical to understand how to actively control the vehicle dynamics logvinovich logvinovich logvinovich pointed out that a non zero lift force at the cavitator perpendicular to v c f results in a displacement of the supercavity along z ˆ j this displacement is given by δ z j x j 1 2 π c c d a c α c f δ z j x j f δ z j x j 0 x j 1 r c b j 1 ξ a j a j 2 1 η 2 d ξ where r c is the cavitator radius given a j b j and η it is possible to numerically compute f δ z j x j for different values of x j we approximated this function as f δ z j x j f δ z j 2 a j 2 a j x j κ 0 j x j the numerical solution of f δ z j x j and its approximation are presented in fig 9 a low order description of the displacement of the supercavity is therefore given by δ z j x j 1 2 π c c d a c κ 0 j α c x j κ j α c x j and the position of a point along the supercavity that includes the effect of α c is given by 2 p j j x j z j κ j α c x j when the vehicle and its cavitator move in the tunnel the position of points i 1 2 n across the supercavity traces j

locations where the cavitator creates the supercavity sections at time τ i the unitary orthonormal vectors x ˆ i j z ˆ i j define frames i j with x ˆ i j being parallel to v c f τ i the 2 n points

experiment briefly described as follows the scale vehicle as well as its cavitator were constrained in the tunnel while the gust generator was oscillating at f g 10 hz with an oscillating angle given by α g t 6 sin 2 π f g t the gust oscillations resulted in variations of the cavitator attack angle that were assumed to have the form α c t 6 sin 2 π f g t ψ here ψ 1 45 rad captures the spatial separation between the oscillating foil and the cavitator estimated to be approx 9 5 cm with a water speed of 4 08 m s gust oscillations were used to vary the cavitator attack angle instead of the cavitator itself because the gust oscillator could produce larger attack angles at higher angular speeds than the cavitator actuator in this experiment the cavitator had zero velocity with respect to the inertial frame e implying that v c f only depended on the fluid motion since the cavitator did not move relative to e the frames i j are always located at the cavitator edges the supercavity dynamics were simulated using the estimated cavitator attack angle α c t as input and the supercavity traces as outputs fig 10 shows images of the supercavity at different times during the experiment and the mathematical model overlaid a supplementary video that illustrates how the mathematical model characterizes the supercavity kinematics can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2018 04 060 the results from this experiment provide evidence that the supercavity model is capable of estimating realistic flow conditions in the water tunnel 4 4 planing immersion the immersion of the vehicle back end into the fluid needed to estimate planing forces is approximated by h t c h λ t with c h being a correction factor used to characterize how the supercavity was deformed when it was pierced by the vehicle back end a value of c h 2 matched the observations from the experiments λ t is the immersion computed via the relative position between the supercavity and vehicle assuming the supercavity is not deformed when it is pierced by the vehicle s body computing h with the correction factor may introduce modeling errors these modeling errors were considered within the uncertainty vehicle model presented in section 4 7 4 5 vehicle dynamics the vehicle dynamics are described by the following differential equations 4 i y y q l c f b z c l f f b z f l p f b z p l g f b z g m δ 5 α θ q i y y is the vehicle moment of inertia about the rotary axis y ˆ b the vehicle attack angle denoted by α is the angle between the water velocity vector and x ˆ b m δ is the moment generated by the

coincides with the rotary axis and negative otherwise adjusting the location of the rotary axis changes l c l f l p and l g when l p reaches its largest value planing generates the largest moment the velocities and attack angles at the cavitator and fins needed to compute the forces in these control surfaces are v b c f u 0 cos α u 0 sin α l c q α c tan 1 u 0 sin α l c q u 0 cos α δ c v b f f u 0 cos α u 0 sin α l f q α f tan 1 u 0 sin α l f q u 0 cos α δ f 4 6 low order dynamics a low order mathematical model of the vehicle was derived about an equilibrium axial speed the planing immersion was estimated by considering only the section of the supercavity at the vehicle back end which is where planing occurs the planing force was characterized using a dead zone operator when the vehicle is inside the supercavity in the dead zone the planing force is zero this force becomes nonzero when the vehicle pierces the supercavity the simplified equations of motion for the vehicle are considered about α q 0 0 for this equilibrium point a trim condition is given by 0 5 ρ u 0 2 a f a f l δ f 0 m δ l g m g l c ρ u 0 2 a c c c d δ c 0 an approximation of the vehicle dynamics about

assumed symmetric and the following approximations are made a a 1 a 2 2 b b 1 b 2 2 and κ κ 1 κ 2 2 this assumption was made because at trim we deflected the cavitator to center the supercavity back section with respect to the vehicle body the immersion λ t is thus given by 7 λ t φ 0 z t z t ε if z t ε z t ε if z t ε 0 otherwise 8 z t e z s t e z b t 9 ε d c y l 2 d c 2 b 1 l a a 2 1 η 10 z e s c

sections z e s t and z e b t and the dead zone region ε a schematic of the vehicle model that includes the body and supercavity dynamics is shown in fig 11b the position of the supercavity section at the back end is delayed by δ t l u 0 this time delay is due to the dependence of the supercavity geometry on previous cavitator states in our low rder vehicle model this delay is approximated by a

2 1 η δ α and δ q are difficult to estimate and can change from one experiment to another therefore we used system identification techniques ljung 2012 to construct a numerical model of the vehicle in the tunnel while a and b δ were estimated using system identification b λ c s d s and c b were computed based on the planing and supercavity models sections 4 2 and 4 3 the numerical description of the pitching vehicle dynamics is presented in the appendix 4 7 uncertainty neglecting the effect of changes in the planing angle α p on the planing force and the simplistic approach to compute the planing immersion h are the main sources of modeling uncertainty we identified to account for variations in the planing forces due to changes in α p the planing coefficient a p z t was treated as an uncertain parameter that lies in a p z a p z t a p z where a p z and a p z are upper and lower bounds of a p z these bounds were derived from the maximum and minimum values of α observed during vehicle maneuvers it is important to note that a p z t is a time varying parameter because α p t varies as a function of time to account for modeling uncertainty in the estimation of h t parameter c h was assumed as an uncertain time varying parameter that belongs to the interval c h c h t c h the uncertain terms a p z and c h are always multiplying each other in the vehicle model given by equation 6 and are only present in matrix b λ therefore we combined the uncertainty of these terms and used the following condition 13 a p z c h a p z t c h t a p z c h another source of uncertainty is the mismatch between the supercavity mathematical model derived with the fins detached form the vehicle and actual supercavity shape when the fins were attached although this model mismatch was not considered in our uncertainty model we argue that this mismatch can be covered within the uncertainty associated with the immersion height h t since λ t enters b λ and multiplies all elements in which the factor a p z c h appears we can move the uncertainty out of b λ and put it into the dead zone operator the uncertainty of the vehicle dynamics described by condition 13 is equivalent to a dead zone operator with variable slope described by 14 φ z t t m z t z t ε if z t ε m z t z t ε if z t ε 0 otherwise 15 m z t a p z c h a p z c h 1 16 a p z a p z c h c h the dead zone φ z t t with time varying slope is represented by the blue region in fig 12 the output and input of the dead zone are bounded by λ t λ d c y l c h and z t z λ ε these bounds were set because the maximum possible planing immersion is equal to the vehicle body diameter d c y l an outer approximation of the uncertainty set given by expressions 14 16 is used to simplify the stability analysis and control synthesis this outer approximation superset represented by the gray area in fig 12 is described by 17 λ t φ z t φ φ φ r z t 0 r 1 ε z the sector bound φ z t allows for variations in not only the slope of the dead zone but also in the supercavity size ε furthermore the sector φ z t includes the effect of lateral planing described in section 3 3 note that the immersion due to lateral planing is greater than zero when z 0 and smaller than zero when z 0 although the sector constraint conveniently includes several sources of uncertainty it introduces conservativeness into the control synthesis methods we propose using this uncertainty model the study in lin et al 2010 has also used sector bounds to characterize planing force models and assess the control and absolute stability of the vehicle mathematical model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 4 8 actuator dynamics the actuation dynamics of the cavitator and fins are described by 18 x a c t a a c x a c t b a c δ r t 19 δ t c

for robust controller synthesis the controllers obtained via these synthesis tools are suitable for tracking disturbance rejection and minimization of actuation energy additionally these controllers are linear time invariant do not require information of the immersion λ and are robust to uncertain planing forces 5 1 model we assume that an lti multi input multi output controller k is connected to the vehicle dynamics as in fig 13 the generalized plant p is the interconnection of the vehicle and actuator dynamics g as well as dynamic weights used for control design u ℝ n u and y ℝ n y are the input to and output of the plant the generalized disturbance d ℝ n d consists of measurement noise disturbances and reference commands e ℝ n e is the generalized error used for performance assessment

the ℒ 2 to ℒ 2 induced gain from input disturbances to output errors note that the system under consideration is not an lti system it is the interconnection of an lti system and a time varying nonlinear uncertainty element therefore we use an ℒ 2 to ℒ 2 induced gain to measure system performance consider a nonlinear system described by expressions 20 and 21 if there is a function v x 0 x 0 that satisfies 22 v x t γ 2 d t t d t e t t e t then the induced ℒ 2 gain of the system is not greater than γ boyd et al 1994 p 91 by considering a quadratic lyapunov function v x x t p x with p 0 and

section 3 3 by using the method described in section 5 and h synthesis balas et al 2007 the control objectives include tracking attack angle reference commands r respecting actuation limits and filtering high frequency vibrations the control design was performed in continuous time but the controllers were converted to discrete time for implementation in the real time system a schematic of the interconnection used to design both controllers is presented in fig 14 transfer function g includes both the vehicle dynamics g ˆ and the pade approximation makila and partington 1999 of the delay δ t associated with the effect of the cavitator on the supercavity δ δ c δ f are the surface deflections d is the time delay of the open loop interconnection caused by the electronics control computer and operating system this delay is represented by a first order pade approximation whose input is the measured attack angle and output is α m a c t is the actuation dynamics of the cavitator and fins whose inputs are the cavitator and fin commands u δ c r δ f r and whose outputs are the surface deflections δ we assumed the actuators exhibit negligible rate saturation because their bandwidth exceeded that of the vehicle dynamics inside the supercavity and because the actuation commands were penalized in the control design described below we used lti transfer function weights w r w n w u and w e to specify the performance of the closed loop system these weights shaped the input output behavior of the system across frequency w n accentuated the amplitude of noise n at high frequency w r specified that reference r has higher energy at low frequency the measured tracking error y is fed to the controller and is the only output in the design framework that should be affected by the delay as it is equal to the band limited reference and the attack angle measured via the rotary encoder the actual non delayed tracking error is passed through w e a low pass filter specifying the need for tracking at low frequency the output of w e is the normalized tracking error e α note that e α does not need to be constructed with the delayed attack angle measurement because the quantity to be minimized is the band limited error constructed with the actual vehicle attack angle and the reference command w u limites the energy of controller commands u at frequencies beyond the actuator bandwidth this penalization minimizes actuation commands at high frequency and thereby rate saturation but is not a guarantee that rate saturation is not going to occur numerical representations of the weights we selected are presented in the appendix the main objective of the controllers we designed was to minimize the induced ℒ 2 from d r n to e e α e u in the h control design the nonlinear uncertain element φ and related signals λ and z were neglected therefore the resulting controller denoted by k did not consider planing in contrast the controller designed using the sector constrained approach presented in section 5 3 and denoted by k s c did consider the uncertain planing forces characterized by φ by comparing k s c with k we evaluated the benefit of having a description of planing in the control synthesis the numerical values of controller parameters for k s c with k are presented in the appendix we evaluated the theoretical stability and performance of controller k using the analysis method described in section 5 2 by using this method we could not conclude that the full nonlinear uncertain system with k has a finite gain globally implying that either a quadratic lyapunov function cannot be used to prove the existence of a finite gain or the system is input output unstable no finite gain the existence of k s c automatically proved that the closed loop system model has a finite gain globally and the system is input output stable the upper bound of the induced ℒ 2 norm of the nonlinear uncertain closed loop system with this controller is γ 1 15 6 experimental results the experimental vehicle described in section 3 1 was used to test k and k s c in realistic flow conditions both controllers were subject to the same water tunnel speed and attack angle commands r step up and step down commands between 2 and 4 deg were applied to the reference signal r when the vehicle approached 4 deg planing emerged in both controller setups the system responses in four instances of the experiment are illustrated in fig 15 the top plot shows the reference r and corresponding attack angle measurements for both controllers note that the responses with k s c are displaced 4 deg for proper visualization both controllers performed similarly in the linear region when the vehicle was inside the supercavity and was subject to lateral planing only however when the vehicle attack angle approached 4 deg and planing became more significant k s c outperformed k oscillations exhibited by the vehicle when it was controlled by k were not present when controlled by k s c note that because of the presence of lateral planing we cannot determine the exact time at which planing starts having a considerable effect on the vehicle dynamics the mid plot of fig 15 shows the cavitator deflections commanded by both controllers k s c demanded larger cavitator deflections δ c r than k to deflect the supercavity and thereby minimize planing immersion this occurred because the gain across frequency from y to δ c r is significantly larger in k s c than in k the bottom plot illustrates the fin deflections k tried to meet its control objectives by mostly actuating the fin deflection this occurred because k was designed with a vehicle model that did not consider planing and the ability of the cavitator to displace the supercavity the results of this experiment suggest that considering planing in the control design contributes to a better performance in practice and using cavitator actuation to deflect the supercavity is relevant to improve system robustness 7 study limitations lateral planing induced by the rotary shaft of the vehicle prototype attenuated the destabilizing effect of planing forces on the vehicle dynamics limiting our ability to test controllers subject to more challenging switching dynamics than those observed in the experiments presented in this study this lateral planing also limited our ability to accurately characterize the planing dynamics for example determining when the major effect of planing occurred another factor that could affect the accuracy of the vehicle model derived in this study was the mismatch between the supercavity planing model obtained when the vehicle was attached from its back end with the fins unmounted and the experiments in which the vehicle was capable of rotating about a lateral shaft with a fin mounted by resolving these technical limitations researchers may be able to conduct controller validation experiments that more closely resemble the dynamics of a vehicle traveling undersea 8 conclusions and future directions this paper highlights the benefit of using small scale experiments to create mathematical models and validate control strategies for a supercavitating vehicle prototype we showed that a small scale supercavitating vehicle capable of rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel can be modeled by an lti system in feedback with a dead zone operator to characterize the inaccuracy in modeling planing forces we used a quadratic constraint in which a dead zone of variable slope was contained by using the uncertain mathematical model of the vehicle nonlinear dynamics we developed control synthesis tools that allowed us to design lti output feedback controllers with a proof of stability and performance we showed that these controllers were capable of effectively driving the nonlinear vehicle motion subjected to uncertain planing forces robust control approaches for the six degrees of freedom vehicle traveling at variable speeds with constraints such as actuator saturation are still an open problem as the vehicle increases its size the delayed effect of the cavitator on the supercavity becomes more critical for the vehicle stability and control design approaches need to consider this time delay for example by evaluating the stability of the vehicle using time delay systems theory nguyen et al abed nguyen et al abed the problem becomes more complicated as the vehicle accelerates and decelerates because the time delay in this case varies over time an approach to address the problem of varying vehicle speed is to use the linear parameter varying lpv framework apkarian et al 1995 wu 1995 wu et al 1995 wang et al seiler pfifer and seiler to address the control problem of multiple nonlinearities and

23345,by traveling inside a gas cavity a supercavitating vehicle can reduce hydrodynamic drag increase speed and minimize power consumption the main challenge for controlling a supercavitating vehicle is a nonlinear force that arises when the vehicle back end pierces the cavity this force referred to as planing leads to oscillatory motion and instability in an effort to develop robust control technologies for supercavitating vehicles we developed and tested a control methodology for a small scale system capable of freely rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel we constructed a low order nonlinear model of the longitudinal vehicle motion that is based on experimental observations and physical principles by using this model we developed a controller design method that delivers a proof of performance in the face of nonlinear and uncertain planing forces experiments with the vehicle prototype in the water tunnel suggest that the proposed control technique ensured higher performance when the uncertain planing dynamics are considered in the control synthesis keywords supercavitating vehicle vehicle modeling nonlinear systems robust control experimental validation 1 introduction supercavitation is a developed form of cavitation in which a large gas cavity is created behind an object that moves with respect to a fluid an underwater vehicle surrounded by a gas cavity referred to as supercavity exhibits a decrease in contact area with the fluid a reduction of skin friction drag and ultimately an increase in speed j m s inc the attainable speeds and power efficiency of supercavitating vehicles open new possibilities for high speed transportation ocean exploration and defense however traveling inside a supercavity brings new challenges to the development of robust control systems for these vehicles when the vehicle is fully enveloped by the supercavity only the nose of the vehicle cavitator and fins are wetted when the vehicle back end pierces the supercavity and immerses into the fluid a large slapping force is suddenly created this force referred to as planing can cause oscillatory motion and instability developing control strategies that guarantee stability and performance in the presence of planing is a challenge because low order vehicle models typically used for control design do not accurately capture the complex planing physics several strategies have been proposed for the control of the benchmark vehicle model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 the investigations in mao and wang dzielski and kurdila 2003 balas et al 2006 vanek et al 2007 mao and wang use nonlinear inversion sliding mode control and linear parameter varying lpv techniques to control the dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle traveling at a fixed axial speed these strategies rely on idealized low order models of the supercavity to estimate planing forces and schedule the controllers the control strategy presented in lin et al 2010 use sector bounds to characterize the planing force and validate the absolute stability of the controller and vehicle mathematical model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 to validate proposed control systems considering the inaccuracy in the planing models numerical simulations have been used mao and wang balas et al 2006 mao and wang a limitation of using numerical simulations is that they do not provide a proof of stability and performance in all possible scenarios in an effort to address this limitation we developed and tested a robust control framework for a small scale supercavitating vehicle capable of rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel in particular we derived a low order model of the vehicle dynamics that includes modeling uncertainty developed tools for the synthesis of robust controllers based on the uncertainty vehicle model and validated the controllers in the high speed water tunnel the proposed strategy is suitable for reference tracking does not require real time measurements of planing and could be extended to design control systems for large scale vehicles this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the vector notation and coordinate transformations used throughout the paper as well as a brief introduction to supercavitation in section 3 we describe the small scale vehicle and experimental facilities used for mathematical modeling and control testing the mathematical model of the small scale vehicle is developed in section 4 in section 5 we describe the control synthesis tools developed for the experimental vehicle results of testing the proposed control laws with the experimental vehicle prototype in a high speed water tunnel are presented in section 6 in section 7 we present the limitations of this study conclusions and future directions are presented in section 8 2 preliminaries 2 1 vector notation and transformations the vector notation described as follows is used throughout this paper to characterize the vehicle and supercavity motion a vector representing the position of a point or a coordinate frame b with respect to a coordinate frame a is denoted by p a b a x b a z b with angles positive from z a b to x a b the position of point f with respect to frame a given its position relative to frame b and the relative position between frames p a b is given by the following homogeneous transformation craig 2005 p a f 1 r b a p a b 0 1 p b f 1 t b a γ b a p a b p ˆ b f where r b a is a rotation transformation based on angle γ b a measured between b and a the derivative of a position vector p b f with respect to time and relative to b is given by v b f b d p b f t d t the velocity of f relative to b but expressed with respect to a is v a f b b a r v b f b when the velocity of f relative to b is expressed with respect to the inertial frame e we use v f b v e f b the velocity of f relative to e and expressed with respect to e is denoted by v e b e v f additionally the velocity of a frame b relative to e but expressed with respect to b is v b b v b b e e b r v e b 2 2 supercavitation the cavitation number defined as σ def 2 p p c ρ v c f 2 is a parameter that describes supercavitation p is the pressure outside the supercavity p c is the pressure inside the supercavity ρ is the fluid density and v c f is the relative speed between the cavitator center of pressure c p and the fluid by decreasing σ the likelihood of developing supercavitation increases the cavitation number can be lowered and supercavitation achieved by either increasing v c f or by decreasing the difference p p c in open waters supercavitation is naturally achieved when σ 0 1 approximately when supercavitation is naturally achieved p c is the vapor pressure injecting air behind the cavitator increases p c and allows for the formation of ventilated supercavities at low speeds ventilated supercavitation can be used to form supercavities until reaching natural supercavitation at higher speeds and for experimentation in water tunnels the supercavity dimension is a function of σ blockage and the gravitational acceleration g as σ decreases the supercavity length and diameter increase when supercavitation experiments are conducted in a high speed water tunnel the supercavity can exhibit a decrease in its diameter and an increase in its length due to the presence of the tunnel walls blockage a supercavity can also exhibit asymmetric shapes due to gravity and in water tunnels due to its relative position with the tunnel walls the effect of gravity on the supercavity asymmetry is negligible when v c f g d c with d c being the cavitator diameter 3 experimental methods 3 1 facilities experiments presented in this paper were carried out in the high speed water tunnel located at the university of minnesota st anthony falls laboratory safl this tunnel is a recirculating closed circuit facility capable of regulating absolute pressures and achieving velocities up to 20 m s its test section is 0 19 m width by 0 19 m height by 1 m long kawakami and arndt 2011 the supercavitating scale vehicle shown in fig 1 was used for both vehicle modeling and controller validation this vehicle was equipped with a ventilation system that enabled the formation of supercavities at speeds above 3 m s the test vehicle consisted of a cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 148 mm length with an interchangeable disk cavitator and two interchangeable lateral fins two servo actuators located inside the vehicle deflected the cavitator and fins the maximum deflections of the fins and cavitator were 20 deg and 15 deg respectively the vehicle s weight was 1 kg the water speed upstream from the cavitator was calibrated via a laser doppler velocimetry system based on this calibration we adjusted the water speed for modeling and control experiments the water velocity vector upstream from the cavitator is perpenticular to the gravity vector an oscillating foil gust generator was used to perturb the flow and study the supercavity dynamics by perturbing the flow we varied the cavitator attack angle and thereby displaced the supercavity upwards and downwards when the supercavity displacements due to gust oscillations were large we were able to generate planing and characterize planing forces applied at the vehicle back end 3 2 modeling we constrained the vehicle motion to characterize the supercavity kinematics as well as the forces at the cavitator fins and planing regions the back end of the scale vehicle was attached to a force and torque transducer that was in turn attached to the tunnel through a strut this force transducer was used to quantify how forces changed due to variations in planing immersion as well as cavitator and fin deflections a high speed camera recorded videos of the supercavity kinematics and the interaction between the vehicle body and supercavity to accurately capture the supercavity dynamics we recorded videos of the water tunnel experiments at 1000 frames per second the videos were synchronized with a data acquisition and control computer via a light emitter diode led that was turned on when the experiments started by perturbing the supercavity via the gust generator oscillations we characterized how variations in the cavitator attack angle altered the supercavity kinematics this characterization helped us validate mathematical models of the supercavity kinematics supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2018 04 060 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article video video we were able to characterize planing forces by using estimates of the vehicle back end immersion these estimates were obtained via customized image segmentation algorithms 9 shapiro and stockman 2001 applied to the video recordings in particular we measured the planing height h and angle α p see fig 2 by varying the gust generator angle we could change the planing immersion but not the planing angle to change the planing angle we adjusted the orientation of the vehicle body with respect to the flow forces at the cavitator and fins were characterized by deflecting the cavitator and fin surfaces and measuring the resulting forces 3 3 controller testing for controller testing we used an experimental setup different to that used for modeling in the control validation setup the small scale vehicle was attached to a lateral shaft to enable free rotation about the vehicle s pitch axis whereas in the modeling setup the vehicle was fixed to a strut in the back end and was not able to rotate fig 3 depicts the control validation platform the rotation angle is equal to the vehicle attack angle this angle was measured using a rotary encoder of 1024 pulses per revolution by translating the rotary shaft along the slit plate the vehicle center of rotation and dynamics were adjusted typically the center of rotation was set as far as possible from the planing region so that planing could generate the largest possible destabilizing torques the control algorithms were implemented in a real time data acquisition and control computer daqc running matlab simulink 2015a and real time windows target rtwt with a sampling rate of 100 samples per sec the daqc commanded the cavitator and fin deflections based on the commands computed by the control law the total delay in the closed loop interconnection attributed to the data acquisition card operating system simulink software and actuators was 3 samples 30 ms a limitation of the control platform is that the rotational shaft pierced the supercavity leading to a wake and lateral planing fig 4 illustrates the lateral planing regions in the control validation experiments we removed the fin located downstream from the rotary shaft to minimize vibrations generated by the interaction between the rotary shaft s wake and the fin thus in the control validation setup only the fin located in the opposite side of the shaft along the vehicle s lateral axis was used note that the vibrations mentioned above would not occur in a vehicle traveling undersea as the rotary shaft would not be attached to the vehicle the major undesirable effect of lateral planing was that it damped out accelerations created during the switching between non planing and planing conditions this damping downplays the destabilizing effect that switching has on the vehicle dynamics moreover lateral planing is a complex phenomenon that is challenging to measure and characterize with low order mathematical models as those we seek to develop in this paper it is important to highlight that despite the presence of lateral planing and its damping effect instability and oscillatory motion were observed in the vehicle open loop dynamics fig 5 demonstrate how a step input to the fin deflection led to planing and thereafter oscillatory motion 4 modeling in this section we present a low dimensional model of the longitudinal motion of the small scale vehicle that is capable of rotating about its pitch axis in the high speed water tunnel at the st anthony falls laboratory based on the low order dynamics an uncertainty model of the vehicle motion was developed this uncertainty model was the basis for the control strategies presented in section 5 4 1 coordinate frames and angles the coordinate frames used to characterize the vehicle dynamics are shown in fig 6 the body frame b x ˆ b y ˆ b z ˆ b is attached to the center

the planing center of pressure c p with respect to the fluid velocity vector dcyl is the vehicle body diameter in the back end d c y l in the water tunnel this velocity vector is perpendicular to the gravitational acceleration and v p f is equal to the speed of the planning c p in the inertial frame only c p z is described as follows because it is the component that contributes to the vehicle pitching motion the value of c p z as a function of the immersion derived from the experiments described in section 3 2 is presented in fig 7 a linear model accurately predicted the relationship

l given that c p z is dominated by h we simplified the low order vehicle model by assuming that the planing angle was constant α p 21 ḋeg the model we used for the planing coefficient c p z depends on the planing immersion only it neglects the effects on the planing force of the relative vehicle supercavity velocities and accelerations and collision of the vehicle body with the fluid vanek 2008 paryshev 2006 we neglected these effects to minimize model complexity and because the effect of the vehicle colliding with the fluid was reduced by lateral planing in our vehicle prototype 4 3 supercavity the supercavity model we constructed was based on the models proposed by waid 1957 and logvinovich we developed this model using images from videos recorded during experiments in which the fins were not attached to the vehicle prototype to characterize the geometrical asymmetries of the supercavity associated with gravity and the wall effects blockage we used two different semi ellipses for the top and bottom traces of the supercavity the position p j j x j z j of a point along the upper j 1 or lower j 2 trace of the supercavity is 1 z j 1 j b j 1 x j a j a j 2 1 η the transversal section of the supercavity is assumed circular the points describing the supercavity are defined with respect to the supercavity frame j x ˆ j z ˆ j whose origin coincides with the cavitator edge where the flow separates x ˆ j is parallel to the velocity of the cavitator relative to the fluid v c f parameters a j and b j were measured using photos of the supercavity and η 1 8 was set following 17 note that these parameters depend on the cavitation number tunnel dimensions and gravitational acceleration fig 8 illustrates the parameters of the supercavity semi elliptical model control oriented models of a supercavitating vehicle seldom include the effect of cavitator attack angle α c on the supercavity dynamics however this variable is critical to understand how to actively control the vehicle dynamics logvinovich logvinovich logvinovich pointed out that a non zero lift force at the cavitator perpendicular to v c f results in a displacement of the supercavity along z ˆ j this displacement is given by δ z j x j 1 2 π c c d a c α c f δ z j x j f δ z j x j 0 x j 1 r c b j 1 ξ a j a j 2 1 η 2 d ξ where r c is the cavitator radius given a j b j and η it is possible to

experiment briefly described as follows the scale vehicle as well as its cavitator were constrained in the tunnel while the gust generator was oscillating at f g 10 hz with an oscillating angle given by α g t 6 sin 2 π f g t the gust oscillations resulted in variations of the cavitator attack angle that were assumed to have the form α c t 6 sin 2 π f g t ψ here ψ 1 45 rad captures the spatial separation between the oscillating foil and the cavitator estimated to be approx 9 5 cm with a water speed of 4 08 m s gust oscillations were used to vary the cavitator attack angle instead of the cavitator itself because the gust oscillator could produce larger attack angles at higher angular speeds than the cavitator actuator in this experiment the cavitator had zero velocity with respect to the inertial frame e implying that v c f only depended on the fluid motion since the cavitator did not move relative to e the frames i j are always located at the cavitator edges the supercavity dynamics were simulated using the estimated cavitator attack angle α c t as input and the supercavity traces as outputs fig 10 shows images of the supercavity at different times during the experiment

vehicle back end into the fluid needed to estimate planing forces is approximated by h t c h λ t with c h being a correction factor used to characterize how the supercavity was deformed when it was pierced by the vehicle back end a value of c h 2 matched the observations from the experiments λ t is the immersion computed via the relative position between the supercavity and vehicle assuming the supercavity is not deformed when it is pierced by the vehicle s body computing h with the correction factor may introduce modeling errors these modeling errors were considered within the uncertainty

velocities and attack angles at the cavitator and fins needed to compute the forces in these control surfaces are v b c f u 0 cos α u 0 sin α l c q α c tan 1 u 0 sin α l c q u 0 cos α δ c v b f f u 0 cos α u 0 sin α l f q α f tan 1 u 0 sin α l f q u 0 cos α δ f 4 6 low order dynamics a low order mathematical model of the vehicle was derived about an equilibrium axial speed the planing immersion was estimated by considering only the section of the supercavity at the vehicle back end which is where planing occurs the planing force was characterized using a dead zone operator when the vehicle is inside the supercavity in the dead zone the planing force is zero this force becomes nonzero when the vehicle pierces the supercavity the simplified equations of motion for the vehicle are considered about α q 0 0 for this equilibrium point a trim condition is given by 0 5 ρ u 0 2 a f a f l δ f 0 m δ l g m g l c ρ u 0 2 a c c c d δ c 0 an approximation of the vehicle dynamics about

assumed symmetric and the following approximations are made a a 1 a 2 2 b b 1 b 2 2 and κ κ 1 κ 2 2 this assumption was made because at trim we deflected the cavitator to center the supercavity back section with respect to the vehicle body the immersion λ t is thus given by 7 λ t φ 0 z t z t ε if z t ε z t ε if z t ε 0 otherwise 8 z t e z s t e z b t 9 ε d c y l 2 d c 2 b 1 l a a 2 1 η 10 z e s c

sections z e s t and z e b t and the dead zone region ε a schematic of the vehicle model that includes the body and supercavity dynamics is shown in fig 11b the position of the supercavity section at the back end is delayed by δ t l u 0 this time delay is due to the dependence of the supercavity geometry on previous cavitator states in our low rder vehicle model this delay is approximated by a

2 1 η δ α and δ q are difficult to estimate and can change from one experiment to another therefore we used system identification techniques ljung 2012 to construct a numerical model of the vehicle in the tunnel while a and b δ were estimated using system identification b λ c s d s and c b were computed based on the planing and supercavity models sections 4 2 and 4 3 the numerical description of the pitching vehicle dynamics is presented in the appendix 4 7 uncertainty neglecting the effect of changes in the planing angle α p on the planing force and the simplistic approach to compute the planing immersion h are the main sources of modeling uncertainty we identified to account for variations in the planing forces due to changes in α p the planing coefficient a p z t was treated as an uncertain parameter that lies in a p z a p z t a p z where a p z and a p z are upper and lower bounds of a p z these bounds were derived from the maximum and minimum values of α observed during vehicle maneuvers it is important to note that a p z t is a time varying parameter because α p t varies as a function of time to account for modeling uncertainty in the estimation of h t parameter c h was assumed as an uncertain time varying parameter that belongs to the interval c h c h t c h the uncertain terms a p z and c h are always multiplying each other in the vehicle model given by equation 6 and are only present in matrix b λ therefore we combined the uncertainty of these terms and used the following condition 13 a p z c h a p z t c h t a p z c h another source of uncertainty is the mismatch between the supercavity mathematical model derived with the fins detached form the vehicle and actual supercavity shape when the fins were attached although this model mismatch was not considered in our uncertainty model we argue that this mismatch can be covered within the uncertainty associated with the immersion height h t since λ t enters b λ and multiplies all elements in which the factor a p z c h appears we can move the uncertainty out of b λ and put it into the dead zone operator the uncertainty of the vehicle dynamics described by condition 13 is equivalent to a dead zone operator with variable slope described by 14 φ z t t m z t z t ε if z t ε m z t z t ε if z t ε 0 otherwise 15 m z t a p z c h a p z c h 1 16 a p z a p z c h c h the dead zone φ z t t with time varying slope is represented by the blue region in fig 12 the output and input of the dead zone are bounded by λ t λ d c y l c h and z t z λ ε these bounds were set because the maximum possible planing immersion is equal to the vehicle body diameter d c y l an outer approximation of the uncertainty set given by expressions 14 16 is used to simplify the stability analysis and control synthesis this outer approximation superset represented by the gray area in fig 12 is described by 17 λ t φ z t φ φ φ r z t 0 r 1 ε z the sector bound φ z t allows for variations in not only the slope of the dead zone but also in the supercavity size ε furthermore the sector φ z t includes the effect of lateral planing described in section 3 3 note that the immersion due to lateral planing is greater than zero when z 0 and smaller than zero when z 0 although the sector constraint conveniently includes several sources of uncertainty it introduces conservativeness into the control synthesis methods we propose using this uncertainty model the study in lin et al 2010 has also used sector bounds to characterize planing force models and assess the control and absolute stability of the vehicle mathematical model presented in dzielski and kurdila 2003 4 8 actuator dynamics the actuation dynamics of the cavitator and fins are described by 18 x a c t a a c x a c t b a c δ r t 19 δ t c

for robust controller synthesis the controllers obtained via these synthesis tools are suitable for tracking disturbance rejection and minimization of actuation energy additionally these controllers are linear time invariant do not require information of the immersion λ and are robust to uncertain planing forces 5 1 model we assume that an lti multi input multi output controller k is connected to

the ℒ 2 to ℒ 2 induced gain from input disturbances to output errors note that the system under consideration is not an lti system it is the interconnection of an lti system and a time varying nonlinear uncertainty element therefore we use an ℒ 2 to ℒ 2 induced gain to measure system performance consider a nonlinear system described by expressions 20 and 21 if there is a function v x 0 x 0 that satisfies 22 v x t γ 2 d t t d t e t t e t then the induced ℒ 2 gain of the system is not greater than γ boyd et al 1994 p 91 by considering a quadratic lyapunov function v x x t p x with p 0 and

however since τ is a scalar we can search over τ to find an optimal value for γ given r s τ and γ from the optimization problem 26 we can reconstruct the controller data to obtain these data we follow the controller reconstruction for the lmi based h synthesis 23 first we select full rank matrices m n r n n such that m n t i r s then we compute p as p i n n s 0 n n n t r i n n m t 0 n n 1 finally the controller parameters are obtained by solving a feasibility problem based on the inequality 23 see 23 for details 5 4 control design two controllers were designed for the test vehicle described in section 3 3 by using the method described in section 5 and h synthesis balas et al 2007 the control objectives include tracking attack angle reference commands r respecting actuation limits and filtering high frequency vibrations the control design was performed in continuous time but the controllers were converted to discrete time for implementation in the real time system a schematic of the interconnection used to design both controllers is presented in fig 14 transfer function g includes both the vehicle dynamics g ˆ and the pade approximation makila and partington 1999 of the delay δ t associated with the effect of the cavitator on the supercavity δ δ c δ f are the surface deflections d is the time delay of the open loop interconnection caused by the electronics control computer and operating system this delay is represented by a first order pade approximation whose input is the measured attack angle and output is α m a c t is the actuation dynamics of the cavitator and fins whose inputs are the cavitator and fin commands u δ c r δ f r and whose outputs are the surface deflections δ we assumed the actuators exhibit negligible rate saturation because their bandwidth exceeded that of the vehicle dynamics inside the supercavity and because the actuation commands were penalized in the control design described below we used lti transfer function weights w r w n w u and w e to specify the performance of the closed loop system these weights shaped the input output behavior of the system across frequency w n accentuated the amplitude of noise n at high frequency w r specified that reference r has higher energy at low frequency the measured tracking error y is fed to the controller and is the only output in the design framework that should be affected by the delay as it is equal to the band limited reference and the attack angle measured via the rotary encoder the actual non delayed tracking error is passed through w e a low pass filter specifying the need for tracking at low frequency the output of w e is the normalized tracking error e α note that e α does not need to be constructed with the delayed attack angle measurement because the quantity to be minimized is the band limited error constructed with the actual vehicle attack angle and the reference command w u limites the energy of controller commands u at frequencies beyond the actuator bandwidth this penalization minimizes actuation commands at high frequency and thereby rate saturation but is not a guarantee that rate saturation is not going to occur numerical representations of the weights we selected are presented in the appendix the main objective of the controllers we designed was to minimize the induced ℒ 2 from d r n to e e α e u in the h control design the nonlinear uncertain element φ and related signals λ and z were neglected therefore the resulting controller denoted by k did not consider planing in contrast the controller designed using the sector constrained approach presented in section 5 3 and denoted by k s c did consider the uncertain planing forces characterized by φ by comparing k s c with k we evaluated the benefit of having a description of planing in the control synthesis the numerical values of controller parameters for k s c with k are presented in the appendix we evaluated the theoretical stability and performance of controller k using the analysis method described in section 5 2 by using this method we could not conclude that the full nonlinear uncertain system with k has a finite gain globally implying that either a quadratic lyapunov function cannot be used to prove the existence of a finite gain or the system is input output unstable no finite gain the existence of k s c automatically proved that the closed loop system model has a finite gain globally and the system is input output stable the upper bound of the induced ℒ 2 norm of the nonlinear uncertain closed loop system with this controller is γ 1 15 6 experimental results the experimental vehicle described in section 3 1 was used to test k and k s c in realistic flow conditions both controllers were subject to the same water tunnel speed and attack angle commands r step up and step down commands between 2 and 4 deg were applied to the reference signal r when the vehicle approached 4 deg planing emerged in both controller setups the system responses in four instances of the experiment are illustrated in fig 15 the top plot shows the reference r and corresponding attack angle measurements for both controllers note that the responses with k s c are displaced 4 deg for proper visualization both controllers performed similarly in the linear region when the vehicle was inside the supercavity and was subject to lateral planing only however when the vehicle attack angle approached 4 deg and planing became more significant k s c outperformed k oscillations exhibited by the vehicle when it was controlled by k were not present when controlled by k s c note that because of the presence of lateral planing we cannot determine the exact time at which planing starts having a considerable effect on the vehicle dynamics the mid plot of fig 15 shows the cavitator deflections commanded by both controllers k s c demanded larger cavitator deflections δ c r than k to deflect the supercavity and thereby minimize planing immersion this occurred because the gain across frequency from y to δ c r is significantly larger in k s c than in k the bottom plot illustrates the fin deflections k tried to meet its control objectives by mostly actuating the fin deflection this occurred because k was designed with a vehicle model that did not consider planing and the ability of the cavitator to displace the supercavity the results of this experiment suggest that considering planing in the control design contributes to a better performance in practice and using cavitator actuation to deflect the supercavity is relevant to improve system robustness 7 study limitations lateral planing induced by the rotary shaft of the vehicle prototype attenuated the destabilizing effect of planing forces on the vehicle dynamics limiting our ability to test controllers subject to more challenging switching dynamics than those observed in the experiments presented in this study this lateral planing also limited our ability to accurately characterize the planing dynamics for example determining when the major effect of planing occurred another factor that could affect the accuracy of the vehicle model derived in this study was the mismatch between the supercavity planing model obtained when the vehicle was attached from its back end with the fins unmounted and the experiments in which the vehicle was capable of rotating about a lateral shaft with a fin mounted by resolving these technical limitations researchers may be able to conduct controller validation experiments that more closely resemble the dynamics of a vehicle traveling undersea 8 conclusions and future directions this paper highlights the benefit of using small scale experiments to create mathematical models and validate control strategies for a supercavitating vehicle prototype we showed that a small scale supercavitating vehicle capable of rotating about its pitch axis in a high speed water tunnel can be modeled by an lti system in feedback with a dead zone operator to characterize the inaccuracy in modeling planing forces we used a quadratic constraint in which a dead zone of variable slope was contained by using the uncertain mathematical model of the vehicle nonlinear dynamics we developed control synthesis tools that allowed us to design lti output feedback controllers with a proof of stability and performance we showed that these controllers were capable of effectively driving the nonlinear vehicle motion subjected to uncertain planing forces robust control approaches for the six degrees of freedom vehicle traveling at variable speeds with constraints such as actuator saturation are still an open problem as the vehicle increases its size the delayed effect of the cavitator on the supercavity becomes more critical for the vehicle stability and control design approaches need to consider this time delay for example by evaluating the stability of the vehicle using time delay systems theory nguyen et al abed nguyen et al abed the problem becomes more complicated as the vehicle accelerates and decelerates because the time delay in this case varies over time an approach to address the problem of varying vehicle speed is to use the linear parameter varying lpv framework apkarian et al 1995 wu 1995 wu et al 1995 wang et al seiler pfifer and seiler to address the control problem of multiple nonlinearities and

23346,a new coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion in regular waves this wavelet network is composed of discrete wavelet basis functions whose structure and parameters are adjusted online based on a sliding data window coarse tuning refers to changing the structure of the wavelet network and fine tuning refers to only changing the coefficients of the wavelet network in every sliding data window the givens rotation method is first used to finely tune the wavelet network then the orthogonal least squares algorithm and the error reduction ratio criterion will be used to coarsely tune the wavelet network if the fine tuning network does not satisfy the relevant conditions for model validation this process guarantees that the method can establish not only the model of the weakly nonlinear motion but also the model of the strongly nonlinear motion in this way a concise prediction model of ship roll motion is obtained this network exploits the attractive features of wavelet and the fitting capability of conventional neural network the prediction results show that the modeling method is feasible and it provides an effective tool for online predicting ship roll motion keywords ship roll motion online prediction wavelet network coarse and fine tuning sliding data window 1 introduction ship motion prediction is important for ship safety and efficient operation however ship motion at sea is a complex nonlinear and time varying system and it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model for ship motion due to the environmental disturbances such as wind waves and current fossen 2011 of all the motion modes the roll motion is the most crucial one since it is directly related to ship safety and operating performance the prediction of ship roll motion is vital for the motion compensation which may prevent crash of cargo in cargo transfer improve the landing safety of aircrafts on carrier and the fire accuracy of the ship borne weapon systems khan et al 2005 2006 a lot of researches on ship motion prediction have been carried out by using various methods the classic methods using time series autoregression ar model autoregressive moving average arma model and so on belong to linear analysis methods which are not accurate enough for predicting the nonlinear ship motion kalman filtering method is another commonly used method to use this method however the state equation of ship motion must be known which limits its practical application in some cases to represent the nonlinear and time varying ship motion neural networks have been used for the time series prediction of ship motion khan et al 2004 2005 li et al 2017a 2017b neural network has been also implemented in ship roll stabilization control yin et al 2014 support vector machine svm has also been used to identify the parameters of nonlinear ship roll motion hou and zou 2015 2016 neural network trained by singular value decomposition has been used for the real time prediction of ship motions khan et al 2016 theoretically neural networks can approximate any nonlinear function with arbitrary accuracy kecman 2001 for this reason this intelligent technology is widely used in the modeling and prediction of ship motions lainiotis et al 1993 faller et al 1997 haddara and xu 1998 haddara and wang 1999 moreira and guedes soares 2003 zhang and zou 2013 in this paper a new coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network cft fgwn is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion based on a sliding data window the idea of using wavelets in neural networks was first introduced by zhang and benveniste 1992 the wavelet network not only preserves most of the advantages of the conventional neural network but also inherits the advantages of wavelet wavelets have the property of localization in both the time space and the frequency space the wavelet network usually converges fast especially for modeling strongly nonlinear systems billings and wei used fixed grid wavelet networks for nonlinear system identification in 2005 billings and wei 2005 this type of wavelet networks stems from the discrete wavelet transform whose activation functions are some discrete wavelet functions the other type of wavelet networks is adaptive wavelet networks which stems from the continuous wavelet transform adaptive wavelet networks and wavelet decomposition have been used for short term ship motion prediction masi et al 2012 wang et al 2012 in the fixed grid wavelet networks the scale and translation parameters of the wavelet activation functions are determined in advance and only the outer weights are unknown these unknown weights can be easily obtained by least squares approach this is not the same as the conventional neural networks which are usually trained by gradient type algorithms most of gradient type algorithms are sensitive to the initial conditions and the trained network usually converges on local optimum the fixed grid wavelet network can be viewed as a linear regression model which avoids local optimum and converges quickly billings 2013 there has been considerable interest in the implementation of wavelet networks cao et al 1995 chen et al 2006 wei and billings 2004 2006 wei et al 2006 on the basis of the fixed grid wavelet network this paper proposes a cft fgwn whose structure and parameters are adjusted online as the sliding data window moves the modeling method based on wavelet network has the ability to represent the strongly nonlinear ship roll motion and it is robust to noise and has high computational efficiency wei and billings 2004 the approximating method of wavelet basis functions outperforms many other fitting methods which is shown to be asymptotically near optimal and attains excellent convergence rate billings 2013 in the present study the cft fgwn in conjunction with a sliding data window is used to establish the wavelet network model of ship roll motion in regular waves first the library of wavelet candidate terms needs to be determined this library contains a lot of discrete wavelet terms spectral analysis and prior knowledge are used to determine which wavelet terms should be included in this library but the library is usually redundant the redundant terms must be eliminated the forward orthogonal least squares ols algorithm and the error reduction ratio err criterion are efficient model term detection approaches chen et al 1989 1991 according to the err criterion the most important term is selected first and then the less important terms are added one by one until the constructed model could give a good description of the system therefore the obtained model is usually concise the simplest model of fitting the data is also the most plausible abu mostafa et al 2012 but there is no need to find the important terms in every sliding data window when the sliding data window moves to the next instant the model in which only the parameters of the selected wavelet terms are adjusted may fit the data very well which is called fine tuning the coarse tuning is necessary to find important wavelet terms and compute the corresponding coefficients whose computing cost is higher than the fine tuning initially coarse tuning is used to obtain the wavelet network model of the system when the sliding data window receives a new pair of data givens rotation method is firstly used to finely tune the wavelet network model ling 1991 luo and billings 1995a luo et al 1996 then the coarse tuning will be implemented if the fine tuning wavelet network model does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation as the sliding data window continues to move the above screening process will be repeated because the modeling method adds a fine tuning process and the fine tuning algorithm can establish a good dynamic model when the system changes slowly the amount of computation will be reduced if fine tuning is useless coarse tuning will be triggered hence the online modeling method can not only change the structure of model but also change the coefficients of model which is different from many other online forecasting methods such as kalman filtering method that can only modulate the coefficients through the above modeling process the cft fgwn prediction model of ship roll motion can be obtained the prediction results based on the simulation data and experimental data show that the cft fgwn modeling method is feasible 2 a coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network this section gives a brief introduction to the fixed grid wavelet networks and describes how to construct a cft fgwn in the following the one dimensional function f x l 2 r is taken as an example and two dimensional wavelets are used to illustrate the related concepts 2 1 wavelet networks according to the wavelet theory there are two schemes for decomposing a one dimensional function f x l 2 r zhang et al 1995 namely 1 f x j k f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z 2 f x k f φ j 0 k φ j 0 k x j j 0 k f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z where represents the inner product in l 2 r j represents the resolution or scale parameter in the decomposition and k represents the translation parameter z is the set of all integers ψ and φ are the mother wavelet and father wavelet respectively j 0 is an arbitrary integer representing the coarsest resolution the above two expressions are the theoretical basis of constructing wavelet network in the actual function decomposition the infinite decomposition of f x is unnecessary and impossible it is reasonable and feasible to represent a function using a finite decomposition of the expressions 1 or 2 at an appropriate accuracy in the case of expression 1 a function f x l 2 r can be decomposed into the following form 3 f x j j 0 j max k k j f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z where j max is the finest resolution k j j j 0 j 0 1 j m a x are the subsets of z which are related to the resolution level j for all compactly supported wavelets and for most rapidly attenuating wavelets eq 3 for the finite wavelet decompositions is the basis for constructing a fixed grid wavelet network which is shown in fig 1 as with the conventional neural network the wavelet function can be regarded as the activation function of neural network different types of wavelets can construct different wavelet network although the above results are for the one dimensional case the relevant concept can be extended to high dimensional case one common approach is to treat a wavelet function as a radial basis function for example a d dimensional mexican hat wavelet ψ d r d r can be constructed by 4 ψ d x ψ d x 1 x 2 x d d x 2 exp x 2 2 where x 2 x t x i 1 d x i 2 in this study the radial mexican hat wavelet function is used to construct the relevant wavelet network another popular way is to construct high dimensional wavelet with the tensor product more details can be found in billings and wei 2005 2 2 structure of the fixed grid wavelet networks based on the above analysis and the theory of analysis of variance anova expansions the multivariate function f x t can be decomposed into a number of wavelet functional components billings and wei 2005 chen 1993 friedman 1991 5 f x t f x 1 t x 2 t x n t f 0 i 1 n f i x i t 1 i j n f i j x i t x j t 1 i 1 i m n f i 1 i 2 i m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t e t f 0 i 1 n j j 0 j max k 1 k j c j k 1 ψ j k 1 x i t 1 i j n j j 0 j max k 1 k j k 2 k j c j k 1 k 2 ψ j k 1 k 2 2 x i t x j t 1 i 1 i m n j j 0 j max k 1 k j k m k j c j k 1 k m ψ j k 1 k m m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t e t where f 0 is a constant component representing the intrinsic varying trend f i f i j are the univariate function bivariate function etc e t is the noise which is immeasurable and unpredictable from all linear and nonlinear combinations of inputs ψ j k 1 k m m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t is an m dimensional wavelet basis function which can be generated from a wavelet radial basis function as in eq 4 of course many other kinds of functions such as polynomials fourier basis and other basis functions can also be used to represent these functional components with the excellent nonlinear fitting ability wavelet modeling method is superior to many other fitting methods chui 2014 it has been shown that a small number of wavelet basis functions can easily capture the nonlinear dynamics of system billings and coca 1999 zhang 1994 this feature has also been demonstrated in this paper here a wonderful description of ship roll motion can be given by only a few wavelet basis functions the function expression in eq 5 can be regarded as the structure of fixed grid wavelet network the advantage of this function expression is that it can clearly indicate which input variables contribute greatly to the system output and which input variables contribute little to the system output this is not the same as conventional neural networks which can only express the contribution of all the input variables to the system output and cannot directly describe the contributions of different input variables although the number of functional components grows exponentially with the number of input variables the fixed grid wavelet network containing the components less than or equal to trivariate functional components can often give an excellent description of f x t for many high dimensional problems li et al 2001 wei and billings 2004 in this paper the representation of anova expansions containing the components only up to bivariate wavelet functional components can give a satisfactory description of ship roll motion when the functional components are properly selected 2 3 determining the library of candidate wavelet terms this part discusses how to determine the parameters j and k j in eq 5 the range of parameters j and k j determines the library of candidate wavelet terms assume that both the input and the output of a nonlinear system are normalized into 0 1 let ψ be a mother wavelet function that is compactly supported on s 1 s 2 it is easy to know that the range of k j is s 2 1 2 j s 1 1 for a given resolution level j most of wavelets are not compactly supported but attenuate rapidly using this feature the wavelet can be cut off at some point to become a compactly supported one therefore the compactly supported one and two dimensional mexican hat wavelets can be constructed by billings and wei 2005 wei and billings 2004 6 ψ 1 x 1 x 2 e 1 2 x 2 x s 1 4 4 0 otherwise 7 ψ 2 x 2 x 2 e 1 2 x 2 x s 2 4 4 4 4 0 otherwise taking mother mexican hat wavelet as an example for a given resolution level j the range of k j should satisfy 3 k j 2 j 3 because of 2 j k j 4 and 0 x 1 therefore as long as j is known the range of k j is known in the present study the frequency characteristics of wavelet are used to determine the range of j wavelet basis functions have the property of localization in both time space and frequency space and generally the frequency range of ship roll motion does not change too much in a relatively short period of time therefore the ship roll motion spectrum plays a guiding role in determining the range of j as an example the time frequency diagram of the 1000 normalized roll angle samples obtained from the simulation see section 4 1 and the related mexican hat wavelets are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 obviously when j is equal to 0 1 2 the spectrum of related wavelet can cover the frequency range of ship roll motion indicating that the range of j is sufficient if the candidate library is not large enough to represent this nonlinear system j could be extended to 3 as long as the spectrum of the training samples is known the range of j can be known to some extent wavelet network is like an ideal filter and can suppress noise effectively by limiting its frequency band because of this advantage wavelet network can avoid the overfitting caused by the noise zhang 2007 according to the above analysis the library of candidate wavelet terms can be determined if the library is lack of the representation ability the ability can be improved by adding other functional components but this will also increase the search time and the computing cost therefore the appropriate library is the best not the larger the better 2 4 the coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network the cft fgwn can adjust its structure and parameters online based on a sliding data window the coarse tuning refers to searching the significant terms and may change the structure of the fixed grid wavelet network this process can choose different significant terms and the ols algorithm and the err criterion are used to implement it the fine tuning changes only the coefficients of the significant terms but not the structure of the wavelet network the givens rotation algorithm is used to compute the coefficients the fine tuning avoids searching the significant terms in the library of wavelet terms in every sliding data window ferreira and ruano 2009 thus the computational complexity is lower than the coarse tuning in every sliding data window the fine tuning algorithm is first used to adjust the weighting coefficients of the wavelet network and then the coarse tuning algorithm will be used if the wavelet network does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation when the sliding data window moves to the next instant the above coarse and fine tuning process will be repeated due to the added fine tuning process the method significantly reduces the computational time the flow chart for online prediction of ship roll motion based on cft fgwn is shown in fig 4 and the coarse and fine tuning algorithms will be described in the next section 3 online structure detection and parameter tuning 3 1 online structure detection the ols algorithm and the err criterion are applied to online structure detection structure detection is to select the significant wavelet functional components in the sliding data window the sliding data window is regarded as an observer of nonlinear system dynamics the movement of the sliding data window means that the window accepts the latest data and removes the oldest data it can be expressed by the following formula 8 w s d x t n 1 y t n 1 x t y t where w s d is the sliding data window n is the window width t is the current instant x and y are the input vector and the output vector respectively the data of the sliding data window change over time t a adaptive sliding data window for ship motion prediction have been proposed by yin et al 2013 2017 according to the err criterion the most significant terms are first reserved and then the less significant terms are added one by one until the selected terms can give a good representation of the system the established prediction model changes with the sliding data window thus it is a prediction model of variable structure this method can capture the dynamics of a time varying system and it is suitable for establishing the model of the time varying ship roll motion in the sliding data window assume that there are m candidate wavelet functional components related to the wavelet network the wavelet network can be expressed in a linear model structure 9 y t i 1 m θ i ϕ i x t e t t 1 2 n where θ i are the unknown parameters to be estimated ϕ i are the functional components constructed by wavelet functions e t is the modeling error after a series of transformations and the orthogonal triangular decomposition eq 9 can be rewritten in a matrix form 10 y t q t r t θ t ξ t q t g t ξ t where y t y 1 y 2 y n t q t is an n m matrix with orthogonal columns q 1 t q 2 t q m t r t is an m m unit upper triangular matrix θ t is an m dimensional vector with components θ i ξ t is an n dimensional error vector g t r t θ t g 1 t g 2 t g m t t is an auxiliary parameter vector then e r r i caused by q i t can be defined as 11 e r r i g i t 2 q i t q i t y t y t 100 y t q i t 2 y t y t q i t q i t 100 i 1 2 m this equation provides a simple and effective criterion for evaluating the importance of model terms the greater the e r r i the more significant the corresponding term more details can refer to the relevant literature chen et al 1989 wei and billings 2004 wei et al 2004 especially for high dimensional systems the model 9 may contain a lot of functional components in reality most of the components are redundant and insignificant which should be removed from the model the e r r i provide a good evaluation criterion to choose which components should be reserved in the model billings et al 1988 korenberg et al 1988 chen et al 1989 1991 this approach has been widely used in nonlinear system identification chen et al 1999 billings 2013 yin et al 2013 but for online modeling and prediction there is no need to use the ols algorithm and the err criterion to select the significant components in every sliding data window especially when the system is a slow time varying system a satisfactory model may be obtained by only changing the coefficients of the significant components the following part describes how to change the coefficients of the model components 3 2 parameter tuning after performing the online structure detection at the instant t assume that there are m t significant components in the wavelet model eq 10 can be rewritten as 12 y n 1 t q n m t t r m t m t t θ m t 1 t ξ n 1 t multiplying both sides of eq 12 by q n m t t t the following equation is obtained 13 v m t 1 t r m t m t t θ m t 1 t q n m t t t ξ n 1 t where v m t 1 t q n m t t t y n 1 t obviously the column vectors of the matrix r m t m t t are linearly independent the estimation of θ m t 1 t is easily achieved by solving the equation θ ˆ m t 1 t r m t m t 1 t v m t 1 t when the sliding data window moves to the next instant ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 and the output y t 1 will be obtained combining the obtained two vectors with the two matrices r m t m t t and v m t 1 t gives an augmented matrix a 14 a r m t m t t v m t 1 t ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 y t 1 the augmented matrix can be decomposed orthogonally in a recursive manner based on the givens rotation algorithm see appendix 15 r m t m t t v m t 1 t ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 y t 1 givens rotation r m t m t t 1 v m t 1 t 1 o 1 ξ t 1 r m t m t t 1 v m t 1 t 1 o 1 o 2 where o 1 and o 2 are the corresponding zero matrixes ξ t 1 denotes the error at the instant t 1 through this process the matrixes r m t m t t and v m t 1 t are updated to r m t m t t 1 and v m t 1 t 1 and the estimation of θ m t 1 t 1 is θ ˆ m t 1 t 1 r m t m t 1 t 1 v m t 1 t 1 the parameters of the model terms can be tuned in an iterative manner a detailed description is given in luo et al 1996 according to the above analysis it can be seen that the fine tuning only changes the coefficients without changing the structure of the model when the sliding data window accepts a new pair of data the recursive process can adjust the coefficients of the significant components it does not need to select the significant wavelet components in every sliding data window which reduces the computing cost 4 prediction results and analysis this section presents the simulation results of ship roll motion prediction based on the cft fgwn model in order to verify the validity of the proposed method the cft fgwn is trained by ship roll motion data in regular waves with different characteristics the first part is based on the simulation data and the second part is based on the experimental data from the david taylor model basin laboratory all algorithms are coded in the m files which are executed in matlab r2016b environment under windows7 64bit operating system with intel core i5 3230 cpu and 8 00 gb memory ram both examples show that the cft fgwn can provide a good performance for online prediction of ship roll motion 4 1 prediction result based on simulation data the roll motion of a ship in regular waves can be described by a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the form bhattacharyya 1978 malta et al 2010 16 i x x j x x ϕ d 1 ϕ d 2 ϕ ϕ c 0 ϕ m w where ϕ is the roll angel rad i x x is the moment of inertia kg m2 j x x is the added moment of inertia kg m2 d 1 and d 2 are the linear and nonlinear damping coefficients respectively c 0 is the linear restoring coefficient m w is the wave exciting moment n m after the normalization of the second order term the second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation can be written as hou and zou 2015 17 ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 ϕ ϕ c ϕ u t where u t m w i x x j x x f r cos ω t f i sin ω t eq 17 is used for simulation the related coefficients of the equation are given in table 1 hou and zou 2015 according to the discretization of eq 17 it follows 18 ϕ k f ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 u k 1 where k stands for the k th sampling instant under the initial conditions ϕ ϕ 0 a fourth order runge kutta algorithm is used to solve this equation with the integral step size δ t 0 1 and 2000 samples are obtained a total of 1000 samples are acquired by taking one every two the first thing to do is the data normalization the sampled roll data ϕ k for k 1 2 1000 must be normalized into 0 1 and the normalized result is shown in fig 5 the 1000 samples are divided into two parts three fifths of the data is used for training the fixed grid wavelet network and the remaining data are used for testing the model if the differential equation of the relevant physical model is not known the variable selection algorithm will be a good choice wei et al 2004 as with gray box modeling useful information is extracted from prior knowledge according to the cft fgwn modeling process an identified model is given as 19 ϕ k θ 1 ψ 0 4 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 2 ψ 0 1 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 3 ψ 0 1 1 ϕ k 1 where θ 1 37 8115 θ 2 0 8267 and θ 3 0 4076 the identified model output is inversely normalized to get the original system output the result of one step ahead prediction is shown in fig 6 where the first 600 samples are the training data the rest are the test data the root mean square error rmse of the wavelet network over the test data set is 0 0148 the rmse is defined as 20 r m s e i 1 n ϕ i ϕ ˆ i 2 n where n is the number of simples ϕ i and ϕ ˆ i are the simulation data and the predicted data by the wavelet network model respectively the result of the linear model ar 2 is also presented in fig 6 for comparison and the identified model is given as 21 ϕ k 0 8385 ϕ k 1 1 7848 ϕ k 2 it is obvious that the prediction effect of the wavelet model is better than that of the ar model in the same order furthermore even in the same order different wavelet models can be obtained according to different training conditions while the ar model is fixed therefore the nonlinear autoregression nar modeling method based on the fixed grid wavelet network has better flexibility for modeling than the linear ar modeling method the 30 steps ahead prediction results obtained by using the wavelet model and the ar 2 model are compared in fig 7 as it can be seen the 30 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is much higher than that of the ar 2 model the first about 10 data prediction of the wavelet model is good after that the prediction performance degrades due to the accumulation of data errors while the prediction performance of the ar 2 model is bad the results of 15 steps ahead prediction of the wavelet model at different instants are shown in fig 8 as it can be seen the first about 7 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is acceptable in general the error accumulation will result in larger and larger prediction errors obviously the fixed grid wavelet network provides an excellent representation for the input output data set as can be seen from eq 19 the wavelet network model does not directly contain information on the wave excitation therefore it is not necessary to know the specific information of waves for the prediction of ship roll motion this is an essential advantage since the wave information is usually hard to measure in the open sea as long as the previous state of ship roll motion is known a suitable nar predicting model can be established actually the wave information is contained in the data of ship roll motion which are used for modeling hence this modeling method does not need the measured wave information according to the above analysis ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 is most important and it is sufficient to express the roll kinematic characteristics thus the initial fixed grid wavelet network can be selected as 22 ϕ k f ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 i 1 2 f i x i k 1 i j 2 f i j x i k x j k ε k where x i k ϕ k i i 1 2 there are only univariate and bivariate functional components in the present study the one and two dimensional mexican hat radial wavelet networks are used to fit f i and f i j respectively the coarsest resolutions are set as j 1 j 2 0 and the finest resolutions are set as j m a x 1 3 j m a x 2 2 the width of the sliding data window is 598 since there are 2 output time delay lags the cft fgwn first adjusts the coefficients of model terms and then the structure of the fixed grid wavelet network will be adjusted if the relevant conditions for model validation are not met here the conditions for model validation are set as i e r r i 0 99 or r m s e t r a i n i n g 0 2 these two parameters are obtained by error and try the cft fgwn is changing online based on the sliding data window this change is illustrated by fig 9 it can be clearly seen that the number of model terms changes as the sliding data window moves here the ship roll motion can be characterized very well by only 2 or 3 significant wavelet terms which also illustrates the strong nonlinear representation ability of wavelet the computational time of the modeling method is given in table 2 where ct fgwn represents that this modeling method only includes the coarse tuning process the computational time of cft fgwn is much less than that of ct fgwn obviously this modeling method improves the computational efficiency 4 2 prediction result based on experimental data in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method the test data of ship roll motion of an onr tumblehome vessel model lin and kuang 2008 are also used for validation the wave steepness is 0 0565 the wave length is 7 8675 m and the wave height is 2 845 m the principle particulars of the vessel model are given in table 3 sanada et al 2013 there are 186 samples which are shown in fig 10 together with those after normalization the first 150 samples are used as the training data set and the rest are used as the testing data set because the output time delay lag is 2 the width of the sliding data window is 148 according to the above analysis the spectrum is wide enough for the experimental data when j equal to 0 1 and 2 the coarsest resolutions are set as j 1 j 2 0 and the finest resolutions are set as j m a x 1 3 j m a x 2 2 the identified model is given as 23 ϕ k θ 1 ψ 0 4 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 2 ψ 0 1 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 3 ψ 2 7 2 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 4 ψ 1 4 3 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 where θ 1 71 6544 θ 2 0 8289 θ 3 2 6065 and θ 4 216 7303 the prediction results of the fixed grid wavelet network in comparison with those obtained by the linear ar 2 modeling method are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the rmse of the one step ahead prediction is 0 4675 and the prediction accuracy is very high the accuracy of the 30 steps ahead prediction is acceptable for about the first 10 data and after that the error increases sharply because of the accumulation of data errors here the conditions for model validation are set as i e r r i 0 99 or r m s e t r a i n i n g 0 72 by error and try as can be seen from the prediction results without knowing the wave information the nar modeling method can give a better description of ship roll motion than the linear ar 2 modeling method the results of the 10 steps ahead prediction at different instants are shown in fig 13 as it can be seen the 10 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is satisfactory through the sliding data window this method can be used to online predict ship roll motion the structure of cft fgwn changing with the sliding data window is depicted in fig 14 it shows that the proposed method can be used to predict the time varying ship roll motion due to the excellent nonlinear representation ability of wavelet the model of ship roll motion can be well represented by only 3 or 4 wavelet terms the computational time of the modeling method is given in table 4 the computational time of cft fgwn is also less than that of ct fgwn which illustrates that this modeling method improves the computational efficiency it is shown that the prediction results based on the experimental data are better than those based on the simulation data the reason is that the magnitude of the simulation data is smaller than that of the experimental data the identified model based on the simulation data is more sensitive to errors 5 conclusions a coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network cft fgwn in conjunction with a sliding data window is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion in regular waves the establishment of this wavelet network is divided into coarse and fine tuning processes in every sliding data window the cft fgwn first uses the fine tuning algorithm to change the coefficients of significant terms and then uses the coarse tuning algorithm to change the structure of the wavelet network if the cft fgwn model does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation this modeling method does not need to search the significant terms in every sliding data window because of the fine tuning process which improves the computational efficiency the prediction results using the simulation data and experimental data of ship roll motion show that the one step ahead prediction performance is excellent and the multi steps ahead prediction performance is acceptable in about half a period of roll motion especially the modeling method does not need to know the wave information as a nonlinear autoregressive modeling method it can give a good description of ship roll motion in regular waves this modeling method can be applied in online establishing the nonlinear time varying model of ship dynamic systems since the structure of the wavelet network can change with the sliding data window it is concise because of the coarse algorithm the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of ship roll motion can be captured by using only several wavelet terms which also confirms the strong nonlinear representation ability of wavelet on the other hand if the system requires more than trivariate functional components for modeling the nonlinear dynamics the number of candidate wavelet terms will grow rapidly and it will cost more computational time in the further study this modeling method is to be expanded to the prediction of ship motion in irregular waves in order to enhance its value for practical application acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the national natural science

23346,a new coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion in regular waves this wavelet network is composed of discrete wavelet basis functions whose structure and parameters are adjusted online based on a sliding data window coarse tuning refers to changing the structure of the wavelet network and fine tuning refers to only changing the coefficients of the wavelet network in every sliding data window the givens rotation method is first used to finely tune the wavelet network then the orthogonal least squares algorithm and the error reduction ratio criterion will be used to coarsely tune the wavelet network if the fine tuning network does not satisfy the relevant conditions for model validation this process guarantees that the method can establish not only the model of the weakly nonlinear motion but also the model of the strongly nonlinear motion in this way a concise prediction model of ship roll motion is obtained this network exploits the attractive features of wavelet and the fitting capability of conventional neural network the prediction results show that the modeling method is feasible and it provides an effective tool for online predicting ship roll motion keywords ship roll motion online prediction wavelet network coarse and fine tuning sliding data window 1 introduction ship motion prediction is important for ship safety and efficient operation however ship motion at sea is a complex nonlinear and time varying system and it is very difficult to establish a precise mathematical model for ship motion due to the environmental disturbances such as wind waves and current fossen 2011 of all the motion modes the roll motion is the most crucial one since it is directly related to ship safety and operating performance the prediction of ship roll motion is vital for the motion compensation which may prevent crash of cargo in cargo transfer improve the landing safety of aircrafts on carrier and the fire accuracy of the ship borne weapon systems khan et al 2005 2006 a lot of researches on ship motion prediction have been carried out by using various methods the classic methods using time series autoregression ar model autoregressive moving average arma model and so on belong to linear analysis methods which are not accurate enough for predicting the nonlinear ship motion kalman filtering method is another commonly used method to use this method however the state equation of ship motion must be known which limits its practical application in some cases to represent the nonlinear and time varying ship motion neural networks have been used for the time series prediction of ship motion khan et al 2004 2005 li et al 2017a 2017b neural network has been also implemented in ship roll stabilization control yin et al 2014 support vector machine svm has also been used to identify the parameters of nonlinear ship roll motion hou and zou 2015 2016 neural network trained by singular value decomposition has been used for the real time prediction of ship motions khan et al 2016 theoretically neural networks can approximate any nonlinear function with arbitrary accuracy kecman 2001 for this reason this intelligent technology is widely used in the modeling and prediction of ship motions lainiotis et al 1993 faller et al 1997 haddara and xu 1998 haddara and wang 1999 moreira and guedes soares 2003 zhang and zou 2013 in this paper a new coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network cft fgwn is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion based on a sliding data window the idea of using wavelets in neural networks was first introduced by zhang and benveniste 1992 the wavelet network not only preserves most of the advantages of the conventional neural network but also inherits the advantages of wavelet wavelets have the property of localization in both the time space and the frequency space the wavelet network usually converges fast especially for modeling strongly nonlinear systems billings and wei used fixed grid wavelet networks for nonlinear system identification in 2005 billings and wei 2005 this type of wavelet networks stems from the discrete wavelet transform whose activation functions are some discrete wavelet functions the other type of wavelet networks is adaptive wavelet networks which stems from the continuous wavelet transform adaptive wavelet networks and wavelet decomposition have been used for short term ship motion prediction masi et al 2012 wang et al 2012 in the fixed grid wavelet networks the scale and translation parameters of the wavelet activation functions are determined in advance and only the outer weights are unknown these unknown weights can be easily obtained by least squares approach this is not the same as the conventional neural networks which are usually trained by gradient type algorithms most of gradient type algorithms are sensitive to the initial conditions and the trained network usually converges on local optimum the fixed grid wavelet network can be viewed as a linear regression model which avoids local optimum and converges quickly billings 2013 there has been considerable interest in the implementation of wavelet networks cao et al 1995 chen et al 2006 wei and billings 2004 2006 wei et al 2006 on the basis of the fixed grid wavelet network this paper proposes a cft fgwn whose structure and parameters are adjusted online as the sliding data window moves the modeling method based on wavelet network has the ability to represent the strongly nonlinear ship roll motion and it is robust to noise and has high computational efficiency wei and billings 2004 the approximating method of wavelet basis functions outperforms many other fitting methods which is shown to be asymptotically near optimal and attains excellent convergence rate billings 2013 in the present study the cft fgwn in conjunction with a sliding data window is used to establish the wavelet network model of ship roll motion in regular waves first the library of wavelet candidate terms needs to be determined this library contains a lot of discrete wavelet terms spectral analysis and prior knowledge are used to determine which wavelet terms should be included in this library but the library is usually redundant the redundant terms must be eliminated the forward orthogonal least squares ols algorithm and the error reduction ratio err criterion are efficient model term detection approaches chen et al 1989 1991 according to the err criterion the most important term is selected first and then the less important terms are added one by one until the constructed model could give a good description of the system therefore the obtained model is usually concise the simplest model of fitting the data is also the most plausible abu mostafa et al 2012 but there is no need to find the important terms in every sliding data window when the sliding data window moves to the next instant the model in which only the parameters of the selected wavelet terms are adjusted may fit the data very well which is called fine tuning the coarse tuning is necessary to find important wavelet terms and compute the corresponding coefficients whose computing cost is higher than the fine tuning initially coarse tuning is used to obtain the wavelet network model of the system when the sliding data window receives a new pair of data givens rotation method is firstly used to finely tune the wavelet network model ling 1991 luo and billings 1995a luo et al 1996 then the coarse tuning will be implemented if the fine tuning wavelet network model does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation as the sliding data window continues to move the above screening process will be repeated because the modeling method adds a fine tuning process and the fine tuning algorithm can establish a good dynamic model when the system changes slowly the amount of computation will be reduced if fine tuning is useless coarse tuning will be triggered hence the online modeling method can not only change the structure of model but also change the coefficients of model which is different from many other online forecasting methods such as kalman filtering method that can only modulate the coefficients through the above modeling process the cft fgwn prediction model of ship roll motion can be obtained the prediction results based on the simulation data and experimental data show that the cft fgwn modeling method is feasible 2 a coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network this section gives a brief introduction to the fixed grid wavelet networks and describes how to construct a cft fgwn in the following the one dimensional function f x l 2 r is taken as an example and two dimensional wavelets are used to illustrate the related concepts 2 1 wavelet networks according to the wavelet theory there are two schemes for decomposing a one dimensional function f x l 2 r zhang et al 1995 namely 1 f x j k f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z 2 f x k f φ j 0 k φ j 0 k x j j 0 k f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z where represents the inner product in l 2 r j represents the resolution or scale parameter in the decomposition and k represents the translation parameter z is the set of all integers ψ and φ are the mother wavelet and father wavelet respectively j 0 is an arbitrary integer representing the coarsest resolution the above two expressions are the theoretical basis of constructing wavelet network in the actual function decomposition the infinite decomposition of f x is unnecessary and impossible it is reasonable and feasible to represent a function using a finite decomposition of the expressions 1 or 2 at an appropriate accuracy in the case of expression 1 a function f x l 2 r can be decomposed into the following form 3 f x j j 0 j max k k j f ψ j k ψ j k x j k z where j max is the finest resolution k j j j 0 j 0 1 j m a x are the subsets of z which are related to the resolution level j for all compactly supported wavelets and for most rapidly attenuating wavelets eq 3 for the finite wavelet decompositions is the basis for constructing a fixed grid wavelet network which is shown in fig 1 as with the conventional neural network the wavelet function can be regarded as the activation function of neural network different types of wavelets can construct different wavelet network although the above results are for the one dimensional case the relevant concept can be extended to high dimensional case one common approach is to treat a wavelet function as a radial basis function for example a d dimensional mexican hat wavelet ψ d r d r can be constructed by 4 ψ d x ψ d x 1 x 2 x d d x 2 exp x 2 2 where x 2 x t x i 1 d x i 2 in this study the radial mexican hat wavelet function is used to construct the relevant wavelet network another popular way is to construct high dimensional wavelet with the tensor product more details can be found in billings and wei 2005 2 2 structure of the fixed grid wavelet networks based on the above analysis and the theory of analysis of variance anova expansions the multivariate function f x t can be decomposed into a number of wavelet functional components billings and wei 2005 chen 1993 friedman 1991 5 f x t f x 1 t x 2 t x n t f 0 i 1 n f i x i t 1 i j n f i j x i t x j t 1 i 1 i m n f i 1 i 2 i m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t e t f 0 i 1 n j j 0 j max k 1 k j c j k 1 ψ j k 1 x i t 1 i j n j j 0 j max k 1 k j k 2 k j c j k 1 k 2 ψ j k 1 k 2 2 x i t x j t 1 i 1 i m n j j 0 j max k 1 k j k m k j c j k 1 k m ψ j k 1 k m m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t e t where f 0 is a constant component representing the intrinsic varying trend f i f i j are the univariate function bivariate function etc e t is the noise which is immeasurable and unpredictable from all linear and nonlinear combinations of inputs ψ j k 1 k m m x i 1 t x i 2 t x i m t is an m dimensional wavelet basis function which can be generated from a wavelet radial basis function as in eq 4 of course many other kinds of functions such as polynomials fourier basis and other basis functions can also be used to represent these functional components with the excellent nonlinear fitting ability wavelet modeling method is superior to many other fitting methods chui 2014 it has been shown that a small number of wavelet basis functions can easily capture the nonlinear dynamics of system billings and coca 1999 zhang 1994 this feature has also been demonstrated in this paper here a wonderful description of ship roll motion can be given by only a few wavelet basis functions the function expression in eq 5 can be regarded as the structure of fixed grid wavelet network the advantage of this function expression is that it can clearly indicate which input variables contribute greatly to the system output and which input variables contribute little to the system output this is not the same as conventional neural networks which can only express the contribution of all the input variables to the system output and cannot directly describe the contributions of different input variables although the number of functional components grows exponentially with the number of input variables the fixed grid wavelet network containing the components less than or equal to trivariate functional components can often give an excellent description of f x t for many high dimensional problems li et al 2001 wei and billings 2004 in this paper the representation of anova expansions containing the components only up to bivariate wavelet functional components can give a satisfactory description of ship roll motion when the functional components are properly selected 2 3 determining the library of candidate wavelet terms this part discusses how to determine the parameters j and k j in eq 5 the range of parameters j and k j determines the library of candidate wavelet terms assume that both the input and the output of a nonlinear system are normalized into 0 1 let ψ be a mother wavelet function that is compactly supported on s 1 s 2 it is easy to know that the range of k j is s 2 1 2 j s 1 1 for a given resolution level j most of wavelets are not compactly supported but attenuate rapidly using this feature the wavelet can be cut off at some point to become a compactly supported one therefore the compactly supported one and two dimensional mexican hat wavelets can be constructed by billings and wei 2005 wei and billings 2004 6 ψ 1 x 1 x 2 e 1 2 x 2 x s 1 4 4 0 otherwise 7 ψ 2 x 2 x 2 e 1 2 x 2 x s 2 4 4 4 4 0 otherwise taking mother mexican hat wavelet as an example for a given resolution level j the range of k j should satisfy 3 k j 2 j 3 because of 2 j k j 4 and 0 x 1 therefore as long as j is known the range of k j is known in the present study the frequency characteristics of wavelet are used to determine the range of j wavelet basis functions have the property of localization in both time space and frequency space and generally the frequency range of ship roll motion does not change too much in a relatively short period of time therefore the ship roll motion spectrum plays a guiding role in determining the range of j as an example the time frequency diagram of the 1000 normalized roll angle samples obtained from the simulation see section 4 1 and the related mexican hat wavelets are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 obviously when j is equal to 0 1 2 the spectrum of related wavelet can cover the frequency range of ship roll motion indicating that the range of j is sufficient if the candidate library is not large enough to represent this nonlinear system j could be extended to 3 as long as the spectrum of the training samples is known the range of j can be known to some extent wavelet network is like an ideal filter and can suppress noise effectively by limiting its frequency band because of this advantage wavelet network can avoid the overfitting caused by the noise zhang 2007 according to the above analysis the library of candidate wavelet terms can be determined if the library is lack of the representation ability the ability can be improved by adding other functional components but this will also increase the search time and the computing cost therefore the appropriate library is the best not the larger the better 2 4 the coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network the cft fgwn can adjust its structure and parameters online based on a sliding data window the coarse tuning refers to searching the significant terms and may change the structure of the fixed grid wavelet network this process can choose different significant terms and the ols algorithm and the err criterion are used to implement it the fine tuning changes only the coefficients of the significant terms but not the structure of the wavelet network the givens rotation algorithm is used to compute the coefficients the fine tuning avoids searching the significant terms in the library of wavelet terms in every sliding data window ferreira and ruano 2009 thus the computational complexity is lower than the coarse tuning in every sliding data window the fine tuning algorithm is first used to adjust the weighting coefficients of the wavelet network and then the coarse tuning algorithm will be used if the wavelet network does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation when the sliding data window moves to the next instant the above coarse and fine tuning process will be repeated due to the added fine tuning process the method significantly reduces the computational time the flow chart for online prediction of ship roll motion based on cft fgwn is shown in fig 4 and the coarse and fine tuning algorithms will be described in the next section 3 online structure detection and parameter tuning 3 1 online structure detection the ols algorithm and the err criterion are applied to online structure detection structure detection is to select the significant wavelet functional components in the sliding data window the sliding data window is regarded as an observer of nonlinear system dynamics the movement of the sliding data window means that the window accepts the latest data and removes the oldest data it can be expressed by the following formula 8 w s d x t n 1 y t n 1 x t y t where w s d is the sliding data window n is the window width t is the current instant x and y are the input vector and the output vector respectively the data of the sliding data window change over time t a adaptive sliding data window for ship motion prediction have been proposed by yin et al 2013 2017 according to the err criterion the most significant terms are first reserved and then the less significant terms are added one by one until the selected terms can give a good representation of the system the established prediction model changes with the sliding data window thus it is a prediction model of variable structure this method can capture the dynamics of a time varying system and it is suitable for establishing the model of the time varying ship roll motion in the sliding data window assume that there are m candidate wavelet functional components related to the wavelet network the wavelet network can be expressed in a linear model structure 9 y t i 1 m θ i ϕ i x t e t t 1 2 n where θ i are the unknown parameters to be estimated ϕ i are the functional components constructed by wavelet functions e t is the modeling error after a series of transformations and the orthogonal triangular decomposition eq 9 can be rewritten in a matrix form 10 y t q t r t θ t ξ t q t g t ξ t where y t y 1 y 2 y n t q t is an n m matrix with orthogonal columns q 1 t q 2 t q m t r t is an m m unit upper triangular matrix θ t is an m dimensional vector with components θ i ξ t is an n dimensional error vector g t r t θ t g 1 t g 2 t g m t t is an auxiliary parameter vector then e r r i caused by q i t can be defined as 11 e r r i g i t 2 q i t q i t y t y t 100 y t q i t 2 y t y t q i t q i t 100 i 1 2 m this equation provides a simple and effective criterion for evaluating the importance of model terms the greater the e r r i the more significant the corresponding term more details can refer to the relevant literature chen et al 1989 wei and billings 2004 wei et al 2004 especially for high dimensional systems the model 9 may contain a lot of functional components in reality most of the components are redundant and insignificant which should be removed from the model the e r r i provide a good evaluation criterion to choose which components should be reserved in the model billings et al 1988 korenberg et al 1988 chen et al 1989 1991 this approach has been widely used in nonlinear system identification chen et al 1999 billings 2013 yin et al 2013 but for online modeling and prediction there is no need to use the ols algorithm and the err criterion to select the significant components in every sliding data window especially when the system is a slow time varying system a satisfactory model may be obtained by only changing the coefficients of the significant components the following part describes how to change the coefficients of the model components 3 2 parameter tuning after performing the online structure detection at the instant t assume that there are m t significant components in the wavelet model eq 10 can be rewritten as 12 y n 1 t q n m t t r m t m t t θ m t 1 t ξ n 1 t multiplying both sides of eq 12 by q n m t t t the following equation is obtained 13 v m t 1 t r m t m t t θ m t 1 t q n m t t t ξ n 1 t where v m t 1 t q n m t t t y n 1 t obviously the column vectors of the matrix r m t m t t are linearly independent the estimation of θ m t 1 t is easily achieved by solving the equation θ ˆ m t 1 t r m t m t 1 t v m t 1 t when the sliding data window moves to the next instant ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 and the output y t 1 will be obtained combining the obtained two vectors with the two matrices r m t m t t and v m t 1 t gives an augmented matrix a 14 a r m t m t t v m t 1 t ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 y t 1 the augmented matrix can be decomposed orthogonally in a recursive manner based on the givens rotation algorithm see appendix 15 r m t m t t v m t 1 t ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ m t t 1 y t 1 givens rotation r m t m t t 1 v m t 1 t 1 o 1 ξ t 1 r m t m t t 1 v m t 1 t 1 o 1 o 2 where o 1 and o 2 are the corresponding zero matrixes ξ t 1 denotes the error at the instant t 1 through this process the matrixes r m t m t t and v m t 1 t are updated to r m t m t t 1 and v m t 1 t 1 and the estimation of θ m t 1 t 1 is θ ˆ m t 1 t 1 r m t m t 1 t 1 v m t 1 t 1 the parameters of the model terms can be tuned in an iterative manner a detailed description is given in luo et al 1996 according to the above analysis it can be seen that the fine tuning only changes the coefficients without changing the structure of the model when the sliding data window accepts a new pair of data the recursive process can adjust the coefficients of the significant components it does not need to select the significant wavelet components in every sliding data window which reduces the computing cost 4 prediction results and analysis this section presents the simulation results of ship roll motion prediction based on the cft fgwn model in order to verify the validity of the proposed method the cft fgwn is trained by ship roll motion data in regular waves with different characteristics the first part is based on the simulation data and the second part is based on the experimental data from the david taylor model basin laboratory all algorithms are coded in the m files which are executed in matlab r2016b environment under windows7 64bit operating system with intel core i5 3230 cpu and 8 00 gb memory ram both examples show that the cft fgwn can provide a good performance for online prediction of ship roll motion 4 1 prediction result based on simulation data the roll motion of a ship in regular waves can be described by a second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the form bhattacharyya 1978 malta et al 2010 16 i x x j x x ϕ d 1 ϕ d 2 ϕ ϕ c 0 ϕ m w where ϕ is the roll

coefficient m w is the wave exciting moment n m after the normalization of the second order term the second order nonlinear ordinary differential equation can be written as hou and zou 2015 17 ϕ p 1 ϕ p 2 ϕ ϕ c ϕ u t where u t m w i x x j x x f r cos ω t f i sin ω t eq 17 is used for simulation the related coefficients of the equation are given in table 1 hou and zou 2015 according to the discretization of eq 17 it follows 18 ϕ k f ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 u k 1 where k stands for the k th sampling instant under the initial conditions ϕ ϕ 0 a fourth order runge kutta algorithm is used to solve this equation with the integral step size δ t 0 1 and 2000 samples are obtained a total of 1000 samples are acquired by taking one every two the first thing to do is the data normalization the sampled roll data ϕ k for k 1 2 1000 must be normalized into 0 1 and the normalized result is shown in fig 5 the 1000 samples are divided into two parts three fifths of the data is used for training the fixed grid wavelet network and the remaining data are used for testing the model if the differential equation of the relevant physical model is not known the variable selection algorithm will be a good choice wei et al 2004 as with gray box modeling useful information is extracted from prior knowledge according to the cft fgwn modeling process an identified model is given as 19 ϕ k θ 1 ψ 0 4 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 2 ψ 0 1 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 3 ψ 0 1 1 ϕ k 1 where θ 1 37 8115 θ 2 0 8267 and θ 3 0 4076 the identified model output is inversely normalized to get the original system output the result of one step ahead prediction is shown in fig 6 where the first 600 samples are the training data the rest are the test data the root mean square error rmse of the wavelet network over the test data set is 0 0148 the rmse is defined as 20 r m s e i 1 n ϕ i ϕ ˆ i 2 n where n is the number of simples ϕ i and ϕ ˆ i are the simulation data and the predicted data by the wavelet network model respectively the result of the linear model ar 2 is also presented in fig 6 for comparison and the identified model is given as 21 ϕ k 0 8385 ϕ k 1 1 7848 ϕ k 2 it is obvious that the prediction effect of the wavelet model is better than that of the ar model in the same order furthermore even in the same order different wavelet models can be obtained according to different training conditions while the ar model is fixed therefore the nonlinear autoregression nar modeling method based on the fixed grid wavelet network has better flexibility for modeling than the linear ar modeling method the 30 steps ahead prediction results obtained by using the wavelet model and the ar 2 model are compared in fig 7 as it can be seen the 30 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is much higher than that of the ar 2 model the first about 10 data prediction of the wavelet model is good after that the prediction performance degrades due to the accumulation of data errors while the prediction performance of the ar 2 model is bad the results of 15 steps ahead prediction of the wavelet model at different instants are shown in fig 8 as it can be seen the first about 7 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is acceptable in general the error accumulation will result in larger and larger prediction errors obviously the fixed grid wavelet network provides an excellent representation for the input output data set as can be seen from eq 19 the wavelet network model does not directly contain information on the wave excitation therefore it is not necessary to know the specific information of waves for the prediction of ship roll motion this is an essential advantage since the wave information is usually hard to measure in the open sea as long as the previous state of ship roll motion is known a suitable nar predicting model can be established actually the wave information is contained in the data of ship roll motion which are used for modeling hence this modeling method does not need the measured wave information according to the above analysis ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 is most important and it is sufficient to express the roll kinematic characteristics thus the initial fixed grid wavelet network can be selected as 22 ϕ k f ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 i 1 2 f i x i k 1 i j 2 f i j x i k x j k ε k where x i k ϕ k i i 1 2 there are only univariate and bivariate functional components in the present study the one and two dimensional mexican hat radial wavelet networks are used to fit f i and f i j respectively the coarsest resolutions are set as j 1 j 2 0 and the finest resolutions are set as j m a x 1 3 j m a x 2 2 the width of the sliding data window is 598 since there are 2 output time delay lags the cft fgwn first adjusts the coefficients of model terms and then the structure of the fixed grid wavelet network will be adjusted if the relevant conditions for model validation are not met here the conditions for model validation are set as i e r r i 0 99 or r m s e t r a i n i n g 0 2 these two parameters are obtained by error and try the cft fgwn is changing online based on the sliding data window this change is illustrated by fig 9 it can be clearly seen that the number of model terms changes as the sliding data window moves here the ship roll motion can be characterized very well by only 2 or 3 significant wavelet terms which also illustrates the strong nonlinear representation ability of wavelet the computational time of the modeling method is given in table 2 where ct fgwn represents that this modeling method only includes the coarse tuning process the computational time of cft fgwn is much less than that of ct fgwn obviously this modeling method improves the computational efficiency 4 2 prediction result based on experimental data in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method the test data of ship roll motion of an onr tumblehome vessel model lin and kuang 2008 are also used for validation the wave steepness is 0 0565 the wave length is 7 8675 m and the wave height is 2 845 m the principle particulars of the vessel model are given in table 3 sanada et al 2013 there are 186 samples which are shown in fig 10 together with those after normalization the first 150 samples are used as the training data set and the rest are used as the testing data set because the output time delay lag is 2 the width of the sliding data window is 148 according to the above analysis the spectrum is wide enough for the experimental data when j equal to 0 1 and 2 the coarsest resolutions are set as j 1 j 2 0 and the finest resolutions are set as j m a x 1 3 j m a x 2 2 the identified model is given as 23 ϕ k θ 1 ψ 0 4 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 2 ψ 0 1 1 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 3 ψ 2 7 2 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 θ 4 ψ 1 4 3 2 ϕ k 1 ϕ k 2 where θ 1 71 6544 θ 2 0 8289 θ 3 2 6065 and θ 4 216 7303 the prediction results of the fixed grid wavelet network in comparison with those obtained by the linear ar 2 modeling method are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the rmse of the one step ahead prediction is 0 4675 and the prediction accuracy is very high the accuracy of the 30 steps ahead prediction is acceptable for about the first 10 data and after that the error increases sharply because of the accumulation of data errors here the conditions for model validation are set as i e r r i 0 99 or r m s e t r a i n i n g 0 72 by error and try as can be seen from the prediction results without knowing the wave information the nar modeling method can give a better description of ship roll motion than the linear ar 2 modeling method the results of the 10 steps ahead prediction at different instants are shown in fig 13 as it can be seen the 10 steps ahead prediction performance of the wavelet model is satisfactory through the sliding data window this method can be used to online predict ship roll motion the structure of cft fgwn changing with the sliding data window is depicted in fig 14 it shows that the proposed method can be used to predict the time varying ship roll motion due to the excellent nonlinear representation ability of wavelet the model of ship roll motion can be well represented by only 3 or 4 wavelet terms the computational time of the modeling method is given in table 4 the computational time of cft fgwn is also less than that of ct fgwn which illustrates that this modeling method improves the computational efficiency it is shown that the prediction results based on the experimental data are better than those based on the simulation data the reason is that the magnitude of the simulation data is smaller than that of the experimental data the identified model based on the simulation data is more sensitive to errors 5 conclusions a coarse and fine tuning fixed grid wavelet network cft fgwn in conjunction with a sliding data window is proposed for online predicting ship roll motion in regular waves the establishment of this wavelet network is divided into coarse and fine tuning processes in every sliding data window the cft fgwn first uses the fine tuning algorithm to change the coefficients of significant terms and then uses the coarse tuning algorithm to change the structure of the wavelet network if the cft fgwn model does not meet the relevant conditions for model validation this modeling method does not need to search the significant terms in every sliding data window because of the fine tuning process which improves the computational efficiency the prediction results using the simulation data and experimental data of ship roll motion show that the one step ahead prediction performance is excellent and the multi steps ahead prediction performance is acceptable in about half a period of roll motion especially the modeling method does not need to know the wave information as a nonlinear autoregressive modeling method it can give a good description of ship roll motion in regular waves this modeling method can be applied in online establishing the nonlinear time varying model of ship dynamic systems since the structure of the wavelet network can change with the sliding data window it is concise because of the coarse algorithm the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of ship roll motion can be captured by using only several wavelet terms which also confirms the strong nonlinear representation ability of wavelet on the other hand if the system requires more than trivariate functional components for modeling the nonlinear dynamics the number of candidate wavelet terms will grow rapidly and it will cost more computational time in the further study this modeling method is to be expanded to the prediction of ship motion in irregular waves in order to enhance its value for practical application acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the national natural science

23347,free vibration characteristics of a flexible non rectangular bottom of a fluid filled rectangular tank are investigated using a semi analytical technique element free galerkin method efg based on moving kriging mk shape functions is used along with the mindlin plate theory to model the flexible plate two different types of non rectangular structural domains viz skew and trapezoidal configurations are considered in the present study the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the effect of surface waves is ignored potential flow theory is assumed and the velocity potential is used to calculate the kinetic energy of the fluid the results obtained are first validated with available solutions in the literature for elastic rectangular plates in contact with the fluid thereafter the effects of various structural and fluid domain parameters on natural frequencies of thin isotropic and laminated composite skew trapezoidal bottom of a rectangular tank filled with fluid are investigated in detail new results on the vibration of non rectangular plates in contact with the fluid hitherto not found in the literature are presented here for the first time keywords element free galerkin method moving kriging fluid structure interaction skew plates trapezoidal plates 1 introduction the knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of thin structural panels in contact with fluid is essential for the design of submarines ships storage tanks oil containers etc hence the flexural vibration behavior of submerged panels has attracted the attention of several researchers since the beginning of the 20th century pioneering works on this research area started with analytical and experimental investigations lamb 1920 powell and roberts 1922 mclachlan 1932 peake and thurston 1954 on the vibration frequencies of thin isotropic circular plates placed into a hole of an infinite rigid wall with incompressible inviscid fluid on one side kwak 1991 and kwak and kim 1991 studied the effect of surrounding fluid on vibration characteristics of circular plates while amabili et al 1996 investigated the vibration behavior of annular plates placed in an annular aperture of an infinite rigid wall lindholm et al 1965 carried out an experimental investigation on the flexural vibration behaviour of submerged partial fully rectangular cantilever plates subsequently several experimental analytical numerical studies on the vibration frequencies of isotropic rectangular plates in contact with fluid have been reported in the literature cheung and zhou 2000 zhou and cheung 2000 ergin and uğurlu 2003 hosseini hashemi et al 2012 cho et al 2015a b cho et al 2016 the effect of sloshing on the flexural vibration behavior of submerged rectangular panels has been considered by fu and price 1987 soedel and soedel 1994 haddara and cao 1996 and kerboua et al 2008 recent investigations include vibration behaviour of laminated composite khorshid and farhadi 2013 canales and mantari 2017 and functionally graded khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 rectangular plates in contact with bounded fluid wang et al 2016 wang and yang 2017 and wang and zu 2017 examined the linear and nonlinear vibration behaviour of axially moving plates in contact with fluid it is observed from the existing literature that the vibration behaviour of rectangular or circular plates in contact with the fluid has been thorougly investigated while similar studies on non rectangular panels are scarce in the literature possibly due to the complexity of analysing non rectangular geometry the widely used finite element method fem has limitations for non rectangular domains as the accuracy of the commonly used isoparametric elements reduces with mesh distortion the meshfree methods with scattered nodes such as the element free galerkin method belytschko et al 1994 is comparatively a better numerical technique for modeling non rectangular domains the element free galerkin method efg with moving kriging mk shape function has been successfully applied for the analysis of rectangular plates by bui and nguyen 2011 and bui et al 2009 2011 non rectangular panels such as skew and trapezoidal plates find wide applications in ships submarine hulls etc even though a good amount of publications are available on the in vacuo vibration frequencies of skew plates mcgee and butalia 1992 reddy and palaninathan 1999 singha et al 2006 and trapezoidal plates liew et al 1993 kitipornchai et al 1994 zhou and zheng 2008 kumar et al 2017 the vibration behavior of such non rectangular plates in contact with bounded fluid is not easily available to the best of the authors knowledge the only published work on vibration of skew plates in contact with fluid is by muthuveerappan et al 1985 recently the authors used efg method with mk shape function to investigate nonlinear bending behaviour of quadrilateral plates watts et al 2017 snap through instability behaviour of shallow shell panels on rectangular watts et al 2018a and non rectangular watts et al 2018b plan forms the same technique is extended here to study free vibration behaviour of skew and trapezoidal plates in contact with the bounded fluid the non rectangular plate is assumed to be a flexible part of the rigid bottom of the rectangular tank filled with fluid the fluid is assumed to be ideal and the effect of free surface waves is ignored 2 moving kriging based shape functions according to kriging interpolation the field variable u h x may be interpolated within the sub domain as gu

and discussion an in house matlab code based on efg method with mk shape function is developed to solve the eigenvalue problem obtained in the previous section in order to avoid shear locking circular support domains with 20 nodes are used in the present investigation this was done based on the authors experience watts et al 2017 to eliminate shear locking for thin plates the value of shear correction factor is taken as 5 6 and the density of the fluid is taken as 1000 kg m3 for all the calculations the material properties unless otherwise specified are given by isotropic e 200 gpa μ 0 3

contact with fluid and ω v is the natural frequency of the structure in a dry environment 6 1 convergence study the convergence of natural frequencies of a clamped cccc isotropic square plate a b 1 in a dry environment is presented in table 1 for two different span to thickness ratios of a h 10 and 100 it is observed that the authors solutions converge for a uniform nodal distribution of 27 27 nodes and the same match well with the published results dawe and roufaeil 1980 liew et al 2004 ferreira et al 2011 and hence the same nodal distribution of 27 27 nodes is used in all the examples considered hereafter next authors results of the non dimensional natural frequencies for an isotropic square plate a h 20 in contact with cubic c a d b e d 1 fluid domain are given in table 2 along with the available results in the literature the present results obtained for two different boundary conditions ssss cccc are found to be in good agreement with those based on mindlin plate theory mpt by hosseini hashemi et al 2010 and canales and mantari 2017 it is also to be noted from table 2 that the natural frequencies of the plate converged when 8 terms m n 8 are used in the fourier series now the influence of fluid plate width ratio on the convergence of natural frequency of plate is investigated the non dimensional natural frequencies of ssss square bottom plate of water filled rectangular tank are listed in table 3 for different fluid plate width ratios the obtained results are compared with those of cheung and zhou 2000 which are based on classical plate theory cpt it is observed from table 3 that the number of fourier terms required for convergence of natural frequencies increases with increase in fluid plate width ratio therefore the number of terms required in the fourier series are considered based on the fluid plate width ratio in subsequent investigations 6 2 effect of geometrical parameters after examining the convergence properties and accuracy of the present method the effects of various geometrical parameters on natural frequencies of skew trapezoidal plates in contact with the fluid are studied natural frequencies of a flexible a h 100 skew a b 1 bottom structure in contact with cuboidal c a d b 2 e d 1 fluid domain ρ f 1000 kg m3 are tabulated in table 4 for three different skew angles ψ 0 30 45 and two different boundary conditions it is observed that the natural frequencies of the clamped plates cccc are as expected higher than those of simply supported plates ssss due to increase in flexural stiffness with increase in number of constraints natural frequencies of the skew plate in a dry environment ω v are also included in table 4 and the same are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of liew et al 1993 it is evident from table 4 that the added mass has a significant effect on the vibration behaviour of the flexible bottom and the values of the natural frequencies in contact with the fluid are considerably lower than the same for the plates in a dry environment natural frequencies of a thin a h 100 trapezoidal a b 1 1 b 2 b 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 flexible bottom of a rectangular tank c a d b 1 2 e d 1 filled with water is presented in table 5 the various geometrical parameters and coordinate systems are shown in fig 3a and b the authors results of natural frequencies for the trapezoidal plate in a dry environment are also listed in table 5 along with those of kitipornchai et al 1994 and kumar et al 2017 it is observed that both the natural frequencies ω v and ω f decrease with the increase of b 2 b 1 ratio this marked decrease in natural frequencies for both ssss and cccc plates is presumably due to the decrease in flexural stiffness of the trapezoidal plate with the increase of b 2 b 1 ratio next first five non dimensional natural frequencies of five layer cross ply 90 0 90 0 90 and angle ply 45 45 45 45 45 thin a h 100 laminated composite skew a b 1 plates in contact with fluid c a d b 2 e d 1 are presented in tables 6 and 7 respectively tables 6 and 7 also include a comparison of the non dimensional frequencies of laminated skew plates in a dry environment with the analytical solutions of anlas and goker 2001 and finite element solutions of singha et al 2006 the above study is also carried out for laminated composite trapezoidal plates and the first five natural frequencies are listed in tables 8 and 9 the vibration behaviour of the composite plates is qualitatively similar to those of isotropic plates in dry wet environment 6 3 effect of fluid plate density ratio the influence of fluid plate density ratio on the free vibration behavior of simply supported ssss flexible bottom of rectangular tank is investigated here the ratio of first six natural frequencies r ω ω f ω v in fluid domain to those in dry environment of a square plate a b 1 a h 20 in contact with a cubic c a d b e d 1 fluid domain is plotted against fluid plate density ratio r ρ ρ f ρ s in fig 4 the present results are found to have good agreement with the solutions of cheung and zhou 2000 upon successful validation similar studies are conducted for simply supported ssss

23347,free vibration characteristics of a flexible non rectangular bottom of a fluid filled rectangular tank are investigated using a semi analytical technique element free galerkin method efg based on moving kriging mk shape functions is used along with the mindlin plate theory to model the flexible plate two different types of non rectangular structural domains viz skew and trapezoidal configurations are considered in the present study the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the effect of surface waves is ignored potential flow theory is assumed and the velocity potential is used to calculate the kinetic energy of the fluid the results obtained are first validated with available solutions in the literature for elastic rectangular plates in contact with the fluid thereafter the effects of various structural and fluid domain parameters on natural frequencies of thin isotropic and laminated composite skew trapezoidal bottom of a rectangular tank filled

keywords element free galerkin method moving kriging fluid structure interaction skew plates trapezoidal plates 1 introduction the knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of thin structural panels in contact with fluid is essential for the design of submarines ships storage tanks oil containers etc hence the flexural vibration behavior of submerged panels has attracted the attention of several researchers since the beginning of the 20th century pioneering works on this research area started with analytical and experimental investigations lamb 1920 powell and roberts 1922 mclachlan 1932 peake and thurston 1954 on the vibration frequencies of thin isotropic circular plates placed into a hole of an infinite rigid wall with incompressible inviscid fluid on one side kwak 1991 and kwak and kim 1991 studied the effect of surrounding fluid on vibration characteristics of circular plates while amabili et al 1996 investigated the vibration behavior of annular plates placed in an annular aperture of an infinite rigid wall lindholm et al 1965 carried out an experimental investigation on the flexural vibration behaviour of submerged partial fully rectangular cantilever plates subsequently several experimental analytical numerical studies on the vibration frequencies of isotropic rectangular plates in contact with fluid have been reported in the literature cheung and zhou 2000 zhou and cheung 2000 ergin and uğurlu 2003 hosseini hashemi et al 2012 cho et al 2015a b cho et al 2016 the effect of sloshing on the flexural vibration behavior of submerged rectangular panels has been considered by fu and price 1987 soedel and soedel 1994 haddara and cao 1996 and kerboua et al 2008 recent investigations include vibration behaviour of laminated composite khorshid and farhadi 2013 canales and mantari 2017 and functionally graded khorshidi and bakhsheshy 2015 rectangular plates in contact with bounded fluid wang et al 2016 wang and yang 2017 and wang and zu 2017 examined the linear and nonlinear vibration behaviour of axially moving plates in contact with fluid it is observed from the existing literature that the vibration behaviour of rectangular or circular plates in contact with the fluid has been thorougly investigated while similar studies on non rectangular panels are scarce in the literature possibly due to the complexity of analysing non rectangular geometry the widely used finite element method fem has limitations for non rectangular domains as the accuracy of the commonly used isoparametric elements reduces with mesh distortion the meshfree methods with scattered nodes such as the element free galerkin method belytschko et al 1994 is comparatively a better numerical technique for modeling non rectangular domains the element free galerkin method efg with moving kriging mk shape function has been successfully applied for the analysis of rectangular plates by bui and nguyen 2011 and bui et al 2009 2011 non rectangular panels such as skew and trapezoidal plates find wide applications in ships submarine hulls etc even though a good amount of publications are available on the in vacuo vibration frequencies of skew plates mcgee and butalia 1992 reddy and palaninathan 1999 singha et al 2006 and trapezoidal plates liew et al 1993 kitipornchai et al 1994 zhou and zheng 2008 kumar et al 2017 the vibration behavior of such non rectangular plates in contact with bounded fluid is not easily available to the best of the authors knowledge the only published work on vibration of skew plates in contact with fluid is by muthuveerappan et al 1985 recently the authors used efg method with mk shape function to investigate nonlinear bending behaviour of quadrilateral plates watts et al 2017 snap through instability behaviour of shallow shell panels on rectangular watts et al 2018a and non rectangular watts et al 2018b plan forms the same technique is extended here to study free vibration behaviour of skew and trapezoidal plates in contact with the bounded fluid the non rectangular plate is assumed to be a flexible part of the rigid bottom of the rectangular tank filled with fluid the fluid is assumed to be ideal and the effect of free surface waves is ignored 2 moving kriging based shape functions according to kriging interpolation the field variable u h x may be interpolated within the sub domain as gu

a dry environment is presented in table 1 for two different span to thickness ratios of a h 10 and 100 it is observed that the authors solutions converge for a uniform nodal distribution of 27 27 nodes and the same match well with the published results dawe and roufaeil 1980 liew et al 2004 ferreira et al 2011 and hence the same nodal distribution of 27 27 nodes is used in all the examples considered hereafter next authors results of the non dimensional natural frequencies for an isotropic square plate a h 20 in contact with cubic c a d b e d 1 fluid domain are given in table 2 along with the available results in the literature the present results obtained for two different boundary conditions ssss cccc are found to be in good agreement with those based on mindlin plate theory mpt by hosseini hashemi et al 2010 and canales and mantari 2017 it is also to be noted from table 2 that the natural frequencies of the plate converged when 8 terms m n 8 are used in the fourier series now the influence of fluid plate width ratio on the convergence of natural frequency of plate is investigated the non dimensional natural frequencies of ssss square bottom plate of water filled rectangular tank are listed in table 3 for different fluid plate width ratios the obtained results are compared with those of cheung and zhou 2000 which are based on classical plate theory cpt it is observed from table 3 that the number of fourier terms required for convergence of natural frequencies increases with increase in fluid plate width ratio therefore the number of terms required in the fourier series are considered based on the fluid plate width ratio in subsequent investigations 6 2 effect of geometrical parameters after examining the convergence properties and accuracy of the present method the effects of various geometrical parameters on natural frequencies of skew trapezoidal plates in contact with the fluid are studied natural frequencies of a flexible a h 100 skew a b 1 bottom structure in contact with cuboidal c a d b 2 e d 1 fluid domain ρ f 1000 kg m3 are tabulated in table 4 for three different skew angles ψ 0 30 45 and two different boundary conditions it is observed that the natural frequencies of the clamped plates cccc are as expected higher than those of simply supported plates ssss due to increase in flexural stiffness with increase in number of constraints natural frequencies of the skew plate in a dry environment ω v are also included in table 4 and the same are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of liew et al 1993 it is evident from table 4 that the added mass has a significant effect on the vibration behaviour of the flexible bottom and the values of the natural frequencies in contact with the fluid are considerably lower than the same for the plates in a dry environment natural frequencies of a thin a h 100 trapezoidal a b 1 1 b 2 b 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 flexible bottom of a rectangular tank c a d b 1 2 e d 1 filled with water is presented in table 5 the various geometrical parameters and coordinate systems are shown in fig 3a and b the authors results of natural frequencies for the trapezoidal plate in a dry environment are also listed in table 5 along with those of kitipornchai et al 1994 and kumar et al 2017 it is observed that both the natural frequencies ω v and ω f decrease with the increase of b 2 b 1 ratio this marked decrease in natural frequencies for both ssss and cccc plates is presumably due to the decrease in flexural stiffness of the trapezoidal plate with the increase of b 2 b 1 ratio

e d 1 are presented in tables 6 and 7 respectively tables 6 and 7 also include a comparison of the non dimensional frequencies of laminated skew plates in a dry environment with the analytical solutions of anlas and goker 2001 and finite element solutions of singha et al 2006 the above study is also carried out for laminated composite trapezoidal plates and the first five natural frequencies are listed in tables 8 and 9 the vibration behaviour of the composite plates is qualitatively similar to those of isotropic plates in dry wet environment 6 3 effect of fluid plate density ratio the influence of fluid plate density ratio on the free vibration behavior of simply supported ssss flexible bottom of rectangular tank is investigated here the ratio of first six natural frequencies r ω ω f ω v in fluid domain to those in dry environment of a square plate a b 1 a h 20 in contact with a cubic c a d b e d 1 fluid domain is plotted against fluid plate density ratio r ρ ρ f ρ s in fig 4 the present results are found to have good agreement with the solutions of cheung and zhou 2000 upon successful validation similar studies are conducted for simply supported ssss isotropic skew a b 1 a h 100 ψ 30 and trapezoidal plates a b 1 1 a h 100 b 2 b 1 0 4 in contact with water c a 2 d a 2 e d 1 and the ratio of first five natural frequencies r ω ω f ω v are plotted in figs 5 and 6 respectively it is observed from figs 5 and 6 that the natural frequencies in general decrease with the increase of fluid plate density ratio due to the increase in the value of fluid added mass m f 6 4 effect of fluid depth to width ratio the frequency ratios r ω of simply supported ssss skew a b 1 a h 100 ψ 30 and trapezoidal a b 1 1 b 2 b 1 0 4 bottom plate of a water filled c a 2 d a 2 ρ f 1000 kg m3 tank are plotted in figs 7 and 8 respectively for different fluid depth to width ratio r e e d in both the cases the first natural frequency is found to decrease significantly with increase in depth of the fluid compared to the higher modal frequencies the second and higher mode natural frequencies decrease initially with an increase in fluid depth but remain unchanged with further increase in fluid depth to width ratio r e 6 5 effect of fluid plate width ratio as discussed in section 6 1 the number of terms required in the fourier series for convergence of natural frequencies of the plate in contact with fluid increase with the increase in fluid plate width ratios table 3 hence for this particular study m n 24 fourier terms are considered for all the values of fluid plate width ratios r w c a the frequency ratios r ω for simply supported ssss thin a h 100 c d e a 1 skew a b 1 ψ 30 and trapezoidal a b 1 1 b 2 b 1 0 4 plates are plotted against fluid plate width ratio r w in figs 9 and 10 respectively it is observed from figs 9 and 10 that for a constant fluid depth all the modal frequencies increase marginally with a change in r w and then become independent and remain unchanged with further increase in the fluid plate width ratio 7 conclusions hydroelastic vibrations of the non rectangular flexible bottom of a fluid filled rectangular tank

23348,with the wide spreads of the wind energy production industry the demand for the safe and feasible design of wind turbine structures is growing swiftly the magnificent deployment of wind turbines in hostile environments with high seismic hazard has lead engineers to consider more comprehensive way of seismic design and control technics of a gigantic structure like jacket supported offshore wind turbine owt the current research provides an overview to alleviate the dynamic structural responses of the jacket supported owt due to the seismic loads associated with static wind and wave loads multiple tuned mass damper mtmd has been installed at the top and base of the turbine tower corresponding to the mode shapes of the structure the mtmd parameters have been optimized based on response surface methodology rsm the performance of mtmd following the multi mode control strategy seems to be prominent in suppressing the first two vibrational modes to evaluate the proposed strategy frequency response function frf fast fourier transforms fft peak and lateral displacements of the tower root mean square rms shear and moment have been investigated through the uncontrolled and controlled structures in addition the practicability of the mtmd system is also compared with the single tuned mass damper stmd keywords multiple tuned mass dampers vibration control response surface method jacket supported offshore wind turbine multi mode approach 1 introduction during the last decades wind turbine technology has become remarkable in the field of renewable energy offshore wind turbines owts have the potential to be a wealthy contributor to global energy production due to the presence of higher quality wind resource for coastal energy loads many researchers have focused on the study of the owts because of their enormous resources jonkman 2009 wandji et al 2016 various substructures and superstructures are available for the owts namely monopile gravity based structure tripod suction bucket jacket and a floating platform butterfield et al 2007 for an offshore support structure to be viable for wind turbines it must safely withstand the offshore environment which includes the combined effects of wind and wave loads jonkman 2007 antonutti et al 2014 offshore structures in hostile environments are always exposed to not only the wind and wave loadings but also most violent seismic loadings it is required to evaluate the impact of seismic loads on the owt structure to derive effective vibration reduction systems or technics lots of researchers have recently devoted their attention for understanding the behaviors of owts under seismic loading condition witcher 2005 prowell et al 2009 bae and kim 2014 sharmin et al 2017 2018 therefore the response of the owt is attained through the seismic analysis including the wind and wave loadings it is obliged to control for increasing the efficiency of the structure in recent decades vibration control technologies for structures have achieved significant success to reduce the vibration of slender structures in order to reduce the response of structure owing to a different type of loads many devices have been proposed such as a hybrid mass damper hmd lackner and rotea 2011 active mass damper amd gattulli and ghanem 1999 semi active control system symans and constantinou 1997 damping isolation system ou et al 2007 tuned liquid column damper tlcd colwell and basu 2009 viscoelastic damper tezcan and uluca 2003 friction damper patil and jangid 2005 passive vibration control might be considered as one of the most suitable and feasible strategies for vibration control in offshore platforms a passive tuned mass damper tmd is generally used for controlling the dynamic response of structures because of their effectiveness robustness and relative ease of installation wang and lin 2007 the tmd can be defined as the combination of a mass a spring and a viscous damper incorporated with the structural system tmds are mostly effective when the first mode contribution to the response is dominant soong and dargush 1997 multiple tuned mass dampers mtmds have been confirmed to be more effective than a single tmd in the dynamic response control of structures iwanami and seto 1984 the mtmds with distributed natural frequencies have been proposed by several researchers previously abe and fujino 1994 kareem and kline 1995 joshi and jangid 1997 the effectiveness of the distributed tmd to control the across wind vibration of a 76 storey benchmark building has been studied elias and matsagar 2014 the researches on the seismic response control of jacket supported owts with mtmd have been rarely conducted even though some researches have been driven to control the vibration of monopile wind turbine using passive tmds due to multiple hazards wind wave and earthquake loads yilmaz 2014 zuo et al 2017 nacelle and spar vibrations of floating owt have been controlled using mtmds dinh and basu 2015 and using tlcd jaksic et al 2015 some scaled models and experimental studies on an owt have been done using tmd wu et al 2016 and tlcd chen et al 2015 in addition many vibration control methods for marine offshore structures have been reviewed by kandasamy et al 2016 to achieve the attribute responses from the tmds to mitigate the maximum displacements story drifts shear force the various harmonic responses for earthquake excitations different optimization techniques have been introduced to optimize tmd parameters tmd parameters have been optimized using a hybrid coded genetic algorithm ga considering the location of the tmd arfiadi and hadi 2011 other optimization methods have also been proposed such as developed by lee et al 2006 that employing a frequency domain approach a mathematical optimization method using harmony search bekdas and nigdeli 2011 and for the limitation of the tmd response using two stage optimizations wang et al 2009 response surface methodology rsm widely applied in the optimization field is a powerful and efficient mathematical approach the effective use of rsm for structures has been shown in box and draper 1987 2007 and khan et al 2016a 2016b the rsm is one of the new approaches for applying the jacket supported owt structure to optimize damping parameters for controlling and mitigating vibration the intention of the present study is to mitigate the seismic responses through mtmd system based on the mode shapes and frequencies of the structure under static wind and wave loads tmds have been placed at the locations corresponding to the maximum mode shape amplitudes of the structure at the particular locations because at the first mode the tower top shows the maximum displacement response while at the second mode the tower base shows the maximum the frequency and damping ratios have been optimized through the central composite design ccd based on rsm and multi objective optimization desirability function to increase the efficiency of the mtmd then the result of the mtmd performance has been evaluated with different aspects under the different ground motions moreover mtmd performance has been compared with stmd to check the plausibility of the system finally this observation shows that the rsm based design of mtmd is applicable to control the vibration response of the structure under the seismic and other operational loads and to suppress the maximum responses of the first two modes significantly 2 structural model 2 1 equation of motion the governing equation of motion of the structure placed with tmds at the top and base of the tower has been obtained considering the equilibrium of forces as shown in eq 1 1 m s ü s c s u s k s u s m s r ü g where m s k s and c s are the

unknown relative nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively the earthquake ground acceleration can be depicted by u g and r is the vector of influence coefficients the stiffness k d and damping c d parameters of the tmd d 1 n can be computed based on the modal frequencies for the mtmd the mass matrix is of order n d n d as in eq 2 2 m s m n n n 0 n d 0 d n m d d d where m n n

for the structure installed with tmds have been thus derived using newmark β integration method wherein 5 damping ratio has been considered fig 1 a illustrates the typical jacket supported owt with the allocation of the tmds 2 2 loads the upwind national renewable energy laboratory nrel jacket supported 5 mw owt jonkman et al 2009 has been subjected to the static wind and wave loads and the dynamic seismic loads the wind and wave loads have been estimated by fast 2016 originated by nrel then those outcomes have been transferred to the opensees model the fast is an aero hydro servo elastic solver that is proficient in performing a fully coupled analysis of a floating owt the wind and wave loads have been applied as a static force on the tower and jacket nodes respectively these loads are a total six components of forces and moments in x y and z direction fast follows subsequent equations to determine the tower top thrust force and torque moriarty and hansen 2005 5 dt b 1 2 ρ

been assumed to be rigid and inactive operationally during the dynamic seismic simulation the gravity of the structure has been considered in the opensees analysis 2 3 owt model the finite element model fem of the owt has been modeled by using the opensees shown in fig 1 b the 68 m tower has been constructed with 9 elements and the jacket support structure consists of 64 nodes and 112 elements where every element is considered as force beam column element in opensees model for water depth of 50 m and water density 1025 kg m 3 the hydrodynamic loads calculated by the fast have been applied to jacket nodes as nodal forces and moments the designed jacket consists of 4 central piles 4 levels of x braces mud braces 4 legs a transition piece tp the rotor nacelle assembly rna along the hub has been created as rigid bodies and its mass has been lumped at the top of the tower following to the nrel 5 mw baseline turbine the tp among the baseline turbine and the jacket structure has been assumed as a density filling the rectangular rigid body the full model contains tower top mass tower tp jacket structure and a circular foundation monopile below the mudline the geometric parameters of the jacket support structure and tower properties are listed in table 1 song et al 2013 vorpahl et al 2013 2 4 fem validation fem is essential for predicting the natural behavior of complex structures with and without unusual loadings this study has considered nrel 5 mw wind turbine as the reference model since the model parameter has been taken as same as reference model to establish the fem of the structure this investigation has compared the natural frequencies of the structure with those of the reference song et al have chosen fast to simulate the reference model in 2013 to verify the opensees fem not only with the fast analysis but also a couple of fem such as sap2000 and ansys have been created which is shown in fig 1 c and d fig 2 illustrates the mode shapes of the structure and the corresponding modal natural frequencies are represented in table 2 the opensees fem natural frequency has been assimilated with the other natural frequencies of fems including a reference model this depiction clearly goes with the perception of the validation besides the gravitational load has been also checked through the opensees after obtaining the static analysis result the summation of reaction forces of the structure at fixed supports is equivalent to the total gravity load this is another way to accomplish the verification of opensees fem 3 optimal design based on rsm it is apparently undeniable that first two vibration modes typically constitute the major contribution of the dynamic responses of the structure around 80 structural mass of the entire jacket supported structure is governed by the first two modes therefore the first two vibration modes have been considered to control under random vibration tmds installed to alleviate those two vibrational modes have been designed according to the first two modal parameters of the uncontrolled structure the total mass of tmds has been considered 5 of the structural mass and mass of each tmd m d i μ m s where μ is the mass ratio and m s is the mass of the structure has been distributed based on the modal participation factor the first and second tmds have been located on the top and base of the tower for controlling first and second mode respectively moreover to enhance the performance of mtmd system multi objective optimization based on response surface methodology rsm has been applied for this purpose an experiment has been carried out based on rsm coupled with a ccd to explore the factors affecting responses of the structures due to the interaction effect of the frequency ratio and the damping ratio of structural response frequency response amplitude of first two modes and peak displacement of tower top and base under el centro earthquake has been counted as a structural response those structural responses have been considered as an objective function where frequency ratio and the damping ratio have been taken as an independent variable for the mtmd the objective function illustrates in eqs 7 and 8 7 f 1 max d b 1 s t m o d e max d b 2 n d m o d e max d b k t h m o d e 8 f 2 p d k where max d b f m o d e f 1 2 k explains the maximum magnitude of the frequency response function frf for each modal frequency and p d f f 1 2 k is the peak displacement response either top or base of the tower for optimizing the frequency ratio and damping ratio from the analysis of design experiment value frequency and damping ratio values have been used as design variable of the dampers and structural analysis has been executed to get the structural response the design of experiments has been made at total 9 experimental points composed of 4 factorial points 4 axial points and 1 center point which has been generated randomly with given interest region of frequency ratio and damping ratio interest region of the mtmd independent variable is shown in table 3 table 4 describes the analysis point and corresponding structural responses under el centro earthquake the frequency ratio α and damping ratio ξ indicates the analysis point and frequency response amplitude of the first mode d b 1 frequency response amplitude of second mode d b 2 maximum displacement of tower top p d 1 and maximum displacement of tower base p d 2 are the corresponding structural responses the model equation developed by the design matrix involving the quadratic term has been estimated the structural responses of the structure with mtmd according to the multiple linear regression the variable coefficient has been attained r p c where r is the predicted response p is the product of the design matrix and c is the corresponding coefficient the corresponding coefficient vector is the pseudo inverse of p and the experimental response is depicted by c p p 1 p r through the coefficients it is possible to know the nature of various factors characterizing the response of various models the quadratic models based on ccd have been executed and the magnitude of the coefficients can describe the contribution of several factors to the responses the quadratic models are displayed by eq 9 9 r c o i 1 i n c i s i i 1 i n c i s i 2 i f 1 i n c i f s i s f u where r is the predicted response c is the coefficient s i is the coded factor i f 1 2 3 n and u is the offset term the damper frequency ratio has a large impact on the structural response under the seismic excitation since the r 2 is significantly high excepted for the second mode frequency amplitude the overall performance of this model can be considered as feasible table 5 shows the r 2 for frequency response and peak displacement response for each damper and the quadratic models fig 3 a b d and e portrays the three dimensional structural response plotted along with the two factors of mtmd under the el centro earthquake it helps to visualize how the response changes with the different combination of factors the result suggests that frequency ratio is the vital factor compared to the damping ratio for designing mtmd desirability function based on rsm has been used to optimize mtmd performances for optimization cases of mtmd parameter the frequency amplitude and peak displacement responses have been targeted to minimize table 6 shows the response goal of optimization and parameter limits for the different responses of mtmd here four responses are competing with each other on the basis of frequency ratio and damping ratio for the mtmd all the optimization analysis has been demonstrated by using minitab 2013 software tools fig 3 c and f exhibits the optimization based on the composite desirability function optimization mainly based on a goal set up and those set up has been used to each response and factors to find out the enrich optimization result in this present case minimum set as a goal has been applied within the range such as lower target and upper for all the responses separately in addition an equal weight of 1 has been imposed to all the responses which have adopted the shape of the responses for its intimate desirability function to optimize all responses at the same time composite desirability is required which ascertains how it optimizes a set response together here the composite desirability has been found 1 0 in the mtmd parameter due to the first mode frequency amplitude and peak displacement value set up on top of the tower moreover the second mode frequency amplitude and peak displacement value installed at the base of the tower composite desirability is 0 9041 which has been close to 1 one as desired and it points out that the settings have been favorable for all responses the final optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio for tmd 1 are 1 0518 and 0 114 and for the tmd 2 is 0 9018 and 0 1114 respectively finally by using optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio the damping and stiffness values of those tmds can be obtained from eq 10 and 11 10 k d i m d i α d o p t i ω s i 2 11 c d i 2 m d i α d o p t i ω s i ξ d o p t i where k d i and c d i are the stiffness and damping coefficients m d i is the mass of damper α d i o p t and ξ d o p t i is the rsm optimized frequency ratio and damping ratio of the damper ω s i is the natural frequency of jacket supported structure here i indicates the position of damper where the damper will be placed table 7 is expressed the final mtmd properties based on the analysis result the predicted frequency response amplitude for the first and second mode is 4 5068 db and 2 3632 db along with the individual desirability of 1 0 and 0 95382 respectively as opposed to the analysis obtained responses are 5 00 db and 2 512 db successively for the mtmd parameter on the other side the predicted peak displacement values for the top and base of the tower are 0 2494 m and 0 0762 m along with the individual desirability of 1 0 and 0 8570 respectively whereas the analysis gained responses are correspondingly 0 2477 m and 0 0721 m for mtmd parameter after installing mtmd based on the optimization parameter eigenvalue analysis has been performed through the fem of opensees and sap 2000 table 8 shows natural frequencies of the uncontrolled and controlled structure through mtmd which is almost same for both of this fem 4 numerical analysis 4 1 model verification with mtmd to verify the effectiveness of the rsm based mtmd system in the structure the structure subjected to sweep acceleration which contains 0 10 hz frequency has been simulated by sap2000 and opensees the sweep acceleration consists of 6000 load steps with an equal spacing of 0 01 sec and maximum pga of 1 012 g sweep signal is one of the general types of vibration testing services performed by the structure it is useful for identifying resonances and frequency ranges of the structure in this investigation the vibration waveforms have been swept through a range of frequencies however they are of separate amplitude frequency and phase at any instant in time the maximum lateral displacement and frfs of the uncontrolled and controlled structure associated with mtmd have been described as the two main performance indices in this study fig 4 a to c shows the time history excitation the amplitude of the frf for uncontrolled and controlled structure associated with mtmd and maximum lateral displacement under sweep acceleration 0 10 hz fig 4 b depicts that the frf amplitude is maximum at the fundamental natural frequency which is comparatively reasonable for examining the rsm based design of mtmd to control the first and second mode according to the fig 4 b and table 9 the maximum amplitude reduction values are around 62 and 63 for the first mode and for the second mode mitigation worth is around 52 and 49 at opensees and sap2000 fem respectively compared to the uncontrolled structure therefore mtmd performs numerous control effect not only for the first mode but also for the second mode of the structure the frf vibration response amplitudes of the mtmd for the top node decays significantly with wide suppression bandwidths gained in the frequency range frf curves for both the sap2000 and opensees fem have been assimilated which proves the verification of opensees fem of the structure it has been mentioned before the opensees fem model has been subjected to the static analysis with the external nodal wind and wave loads at the first place the dynamic earthquake analysis initiated from the previous static analysis case has been performed based on fig 4 c the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement along the tower height has been gained from the simulations of sweep acceleration it is apparent that mtmd reduces the maximum displacement of the uncontrolled structure fig 4 c shows that the maximum displacements of the both uncontrolled fems are around 1 533 m and 1 541 m sweep acceleration is not a real seismic excitation therefore the reduced value owing to the controlled system is not noticeable under the sweep acceleration associated with operational loads even though frf curves show the splendid result under sweep acceleration overall it can be concluded that mtmd has a significant contribution in decrementing vibration response of the structure under sweep acceleration to check precisely the various realistic ground motion has been performed in the later part of this study additionally the stmd parameters have been optimally designed by using eq 10 and 11 and compared with the mtmd to check the robustness of the rsm based mtmd systems the stmd has been only placed at the top of the tower based on the modal parameters of the first mode of the uncontrolled structure the total mass of the stmd has been considered as an equal mass of the mtmd finally by using eq 10 and 11 the stiffness and damping values of the stmd are achieved as 267 34 kn m and 83 93 kn sec m respectively where the corresponding optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio are 0 82 and 0 26 4 2 earthquake analysis for further verification of the seismic performance of mtmd with some realistic earthquakes the structure has been subjected to el centro 1940 ns kobe 1995 and tabas 1978 ground accelerations it is important to check that practically the tmds can be placed or not at the considered locations while the structure is experiencing seismic vibration at the tower top position in particular it is required to examine the available installation space area the ranges of the displacements inline both ways of the tmd itself are around 0 89 m 0 42 m and 0 47 m 0 671 m 0 328 m and 0 343 m and 0 171 m 0 084 m and 0 087 m respectively for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes the available space at the top point of the tower is 3 94 m that is enough space to allow the maximum movements of the tmd thus the tmd can be installed at the top position of the tower practically since the tower top area is sufficient for tmd s movement when it goes under all the distinctive earthquakes after that fig 5 a to f represents the time series responses at the top and base of the tower with and without mtmd and stmd under the seismic excitations the decreasing amounts of maximum tower top and base displacement for the mtmd are 23 76 and 35 63 under el centro 14 16 and 25 16 under kobe and 33 63 and 35 84 under tabas consecutively with respect to the uncontrolled structure the point to be noted is that mtmd can effectively alleviate the relatively high amplitude displacements which have occurred during the initial period of the analysis and responded quickly to these early vibration excitations it is particularly important for the vibration suppression under the seismic excitations further the peak displacements are reduced up to 29 62 13 27 and 39 28 respectively under el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes with reference to the uncontrolled structure when the stmd is installed in the top of the tower besides the highest tower base displacement for the stmd are shortened around by 14 28 5 15 and 25 serially for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes even though the mtmd is slightly less effective than the stmd at the top of the tower but in the base of the tower the control effectiveness is raised around 25 21 and 22 for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively compared to the stmd contrariwise fig 5 g to i shows the outcome of the maximum displacement responses at the top of the tower for all the ground motions associated with the operational loads the decreasing amount of seismic response of the structure under the seismic loads in addition to static wind and wave loads is less influential compared to the individual effect of the seismic loads which is shown in fig 5 a to f the same synopsis can be found when the stmd has been installed the interesting point is that the control efficiency of the mtmd is more or less similar with the stmd for the peak displacement of the tower under this specific case due to the small mass of each tmd in the mtmd compare to the stmd it is also relatively easy to place practically the robustness of the mtmd compare to the stmd is explained further by the figs 9 and 10 in section 4 4 and 4 5 moreover it is revealed that the combined response has been obtained by superimposing all of them together which is shifted upward from the initial response position of the structure this observation leads to the conclusion that the interaction of the wind wave and seismic loads has a significant effect on the jacket supported structure even though it is not clear through the analysis of peak displacement response 4 3 maximum lateral displacement the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement of the tower nodes attained from all simulations of the ground motions with and without other loads has been plotted in fig 6 where the lateral displacement distribution increases along the tower heights and installation of mtmd reduces the maximum displacement of the structure fig 6 displays that the maximum lateral displacement of the tower decreases for all turbine tower nodes which is reasonable for the control effect of the lateral displacement gained by mtmd under all three seismic excitations in addition to this it is also fabricated that mtmd has an efficient contribution in reducing the vibration response of the structure under isolated seismic loads compared to the combination of the wind and wave loads for these three seismic excitations in order to access characteristics of the response displacements and to show the mtmd effectiveness in decreasing the higher mode responses the root means square rms value on response displacements has been performed which can be defined by eq 12 12 s rms 1 n n 1 n s n 2 where s rms is the root mean square value n is the total number of sampling points and s n input vector or matrix also to check the effectiveness of the control mtmd system from rms value eq 13 is used as follows 13 r eff 1 s c s uc 100 where r eff is the effective value of rms s uc and s c are the uncontrolled and controlled rms displacement respectively table 10 shows the outcome of the rms value on displacement responses with and without mtmd of the structure based on the computed rms value in table 10 it is observed that the reductions of displacement responses are 55 25 21 57 and 50 on top of the tower and 47 75 34 64 and 45 on the base of the tower with respect to the uncontrolled structure by using mtmd controlled system due to el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively therefore the mtmd is efficient to reduce the vibration of the structure subjected to the seismic loads that are combined with wind and wave loads which is not clear through the peak displacement results in the time domain moreover the mtmd is more feasible for the el centro and tabas earthquakes than kobe due to the different characteristics of the seismic excitations fig 7 a and b represents the response spectra rs of the input ground accelerations and the uncontrolled structural responses revealing the characteristics of both input and output accelerations respectively in fig 7 a the dominant frequencies are 1 8 2 2 and 8 hz for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively but the noticeable frequencies in the fig 7 b are 0 327 and 1 174 hz corresponding to the fundamental natural frequencies of the owt the shape of the rs of the fig 7 in the frequencies over 5 hz goes the same with that of the dynamic amplification of acceleration shown in the following chopra 2011 upon this supposition and based on fig 7 different input motions have the different characteristics pga and band frequency hence the decreasing amounts of displacement responses of el centro and tabas earthquake compared to kobe earthquake seem to be more reasonable thus the analysis results serve the main concern of mitigating vibration of owt under earthquakes through mtmd 4 4 shear force and moment the shear force response of the structure with and without mtmd under the three selected earthquakes has been shown in fig 8 a to check the effectiveness of mtmd through the analysis results of the shear force value which has been plotted against all the tower node with respect to the height such as node number 10 and 1 denote 88 15 m and 20 15 m altitude of the tower respectively the maximum shear force randomly fluctuates from the top to the base of the tower it is invented that mitigation rates are appreciable due to el centro earthquake compare to the other seismic excitations associated with operational loads along with all tower nodes in addition the effect of mtmd is reasonable to control the shear force on the other side the moment demand response is a key component in the design of the wind turbine structure the moment demand responses of the tower nodes have been shown in fig 8 b which indicates that the maximum moment responses harmonically increase from the top to the base hence the effect of mtmd on the moment responses due to the seismic loads associated with other operational loads is prominent along the tower height fig 9 shows the amplitude of the shear force under fft for the uncontrolled and controlled structure both in stmd and mtmd due to el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes with the operational loads from fig 9 a it is observed that the maximum shear forces are governed by the first and second mode frequencies where for the uncontrolled structure they belong to around 0 319 and 1 165 hz successively on the other hand for the mtmd they are around 0 320 and 1 21 hz respectively under the el centro earthquake similarly it is established that the top element shear force has been dominated around the fundamental natural frequencies the first mode is 0 356 hz and the second mode is 1 24 hz of the structure in the case of kobe and tabas earthquakes with the mtmd system in addition for the mtmd the mitigated amplitude values are around 64 73 and 60 successively for the first mode and for the second mode reduction values are around 59 59 and 52 compared to the uncontrolled owt structure under the el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes associated with operational loads when the stmd is applied the maximum shear forces are also ruled by the fundamental natural frequencies in all the scenarios the alleviated amplitude values are slightly larger than the mtmd in every case as it is tuned in the first vibration mode in the case of the higher vibration mode second mode the stmd is not sufficient to minimize the maximum shear force amplitudes compared to the mtmd mtmd decrease sufficiently the maximum shear force amplitudes for both the fundamental vibration modes therefore this system sufficiently fulfills the requirement of multi mode control purpose according to the above discussion the seismic loads associated with wind and wave loads have a profound influence on the fundamental natural frequencies of the structure therefore the amplitude and the response of the structure due to seismic and other operational loads require being minimized which is possible through the proposed mtmd system the mtmd system for the jacket supported owt has been proved and reasonable by the several investigation ways which are mentioned above in a descriptive way 4 5 frequency response function frf fig 10 shows the amplitude of the frf for uncontrolled and controlled structure equipped with the mtmd and stmd on top of the tower due to the three distinctive earthquakes frf amplitude is maximum at the fundamental natural frequencies of every distinctive structure the peak values are much larger at the first modal frequencies and decrease gradually as the mode order increases therefore the first mode should be controlled beforehand moreover the declinations of maximum amplitude for the mtmd are around 55 56 and 51 respectively for the first mode and for the second mode the attenuated values are around 38 46 and 47 under the el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes correspondingly with respect to the uncontrolled structure in the case of the stmd the energy at the first mode amplitudes is marginally smaller than the mtmd for every distinctive earthquake as it is expected when the mtmd is applied although the first mode control effectiveness is less than the stmd mtmd consistently decreases the fundamental vibration modes first and second modes rather than the stmd in every scenario of earthquakes the above results and discussions are similarly coherent with the study by moon 2010 thus this evaluation conducts to the judgment that mtmd is more feasible to suppress several multi mode frequencies of the uncontrolled structure under the three seismic excitations than the stmd which only controls the first vibration mode 5 conclusion this research focuses on the multi mode vibration response control of the jacket supported owt under seismic and other operational loads using the mtmd the optimal design parameters of the mtmd have been developed through the rsm the feasibility of the proposed method has been verified via numerical simulations with and without the mtmd and stmd from the outcomes the following conclusions are drawn a sequential procedure has been proposed where mtmd parameters are optimized through the rsm the performance of mtmd parameters optimally designed by the rsm has been proved proficient in controlling the vibration after comparing the performance of mtmd with the stmd it is clearly visible that mtmd is suitable for multi mode control purpose while stmd is found to be efficient mainly for suppressing single mode vibration the displacement and shear force analyses show that the structural displacement and shear force at the top and the base of the tower have been suppressed reasonably according to the frf it is noticeable that the mtmd can decrease the peak responses of several multi mode fundamental frequencies of the uncontrolled structure under the three seismic excitations the amplitude reduction rates are more than 50 and 35 in the first and the second modes successively with respect to the uncontrolled structure regarding the rms and fft the mtmd seems effective not only to minimize the seismic responses but also to reduce the responses due to other operational loads the potential of the mtmd has been proved in this research to suppress the vibration of a gigantic jacket supported owt structure under the seismic and other operational loads the further research needs to be done considering the dynamic interaction of wind and wave loads

23348,with the wide spreads of the wind energy production industry the demand for the safe and feasible design of wind turbine structures is growing swiftly the magnificent deployment of wind turbines in hostile environments with high seismic hazard has lead engineers to consider more comprehensive way of seismic design and control technics of a gigantic structure like jacket supported offshore wind turbine owt the current research provides an overview to alleviate the dynamic structural responses of the jacket supported owt due to the seismic loads associated with static wind and wave loads multiple tuned mass damper mtmd has been installed at the top and base of the turbine tower corresponding to the mode shapes of the structure the mtmd parameters have been optimized based on response surface methodology rsm the performance of mtmd following the multi mode control strategy seems to be prominent in suppressing the first two vibrational modes to evaluate the proposed strategy frequency response function frf fast fourier transforms fft peak and lateral displacements of the tower root mean square rms shear and moment have been investigated through the uncontrolled and controlled structures in addition the practicability of the mtmd system is also compared with the single tuned mass damper stmd keywords multiple tuned mass dampers vibration control response surface method jacket supported offshore wind turbine multi mode approach 1 introduction during the last decades wind turbine technology has become remarkable in the field of renewable energy offshore wind turbines owts have the potential to be a wealthy contributor to global energy production due to the presence of higher quality wind resource for coastal energy loads many researchers have focused on the study of the owts because of their enormous resources jonkman 2009 wandji et al 2016 various substructures and superstructures are available for the owts namely monopile gravity based structure tripod suction bucket jacket and a floating platform butterfield et al 2007 for an offshore support structure to be viable for wind turbines it must safely withstand the offshore environment which includes the combined effects of wind and wave loads jonkman 2007 antonutti et al 2014 offshore structures in hostile environments are always exposed to not only the wind and wave loadings but also most violent seismic loadings it is required to evaluate the impact of seismic loads on the owt structure to derive effective vibration reduction systems or technics lots of researchers have recently devoted their attention for understanding the behaviors of owts under seismic loading condition witcher 2005 prowell et al 2009 bae and kim 2014 sharmin et al 2017 2018 therefore the response of the owt is attained through the seismic analysis including the wind and wave loadings it is obliged to control for increasing the efficiency of the structure in recent decades vibration control technologies for structures have achieved significant success to reduce the vibration of slender structures in order to reduce the response of structure owing to a different type of loads many devices have been proposed such as a hybrid mass damper hmd lackner and rotea 2011 active mass damper amd gattulli and ghanem 1999 semi active control system symans and constantinou 1997 damping isolation system ou et al 2007 tuned liquid column damper tlcd colwell and basu 2009 viscoelastic damper tezcan and uluca 2003 friction damper patil and jangid 2005 passive vibration control might be considered as one of the most suitable and feasible strategies for vibration control in offshore platforms a passive tuned mass damper tmd is generally used for controlling the dynamic response of structures because of their effectiveness robustness and relative ease of installation wang and lin 2007 the tmd can be defined as the combination of a mass a spring and a viscous damper incorporated with the structural system tmds are mostly effective when the first mode contribution to the response is dominant soong and dargush 1997 multiple tuned mass dampers mtmds have been confirmed to be more effective than a single tmd in the dynamic response control of structures iwanami and seto 1984 the mtmds with distributed natural frequencies have been proposed by several researchers previously abe and fujino 1994 kareem and kline 1995 joshi and jangid 1997 the effectiveness of the distributed tmd to control the across wind vibration of a 76 storey benchmark building has been studied elias and matsagar 2014 the researches on the seismic response control of jacket supported owts with mtmd have been rarely conducted even though some researches have been driven to control the vibration of monopile wind turbine using passive tmds due to multiple hazards wind wave and earthquake loads yilmaz 2014 zuo et al 2017 nacelle and spar vibrations of floating owt have been controlled using mtmds dinh and basu 2015 and using tlcd jaksic et al 2015 some scaled models and experimental studies on an owt have been done using tmd wu et al 2016 and tlcd chen et al 2015 in addition many vibration control methods for marine offshore structures have been reviewed by kandasamy et al 2016 to achieve the attribute responses from the tmds to mitigate the maximum displacements story drifts shear force the various harmonic responses for earthquake excitations different optimization techniques have been introduced to optimize tmd parameters tmd parameters have been optimized using a hybrid coded genetic algorithm ga considering the location of the tmd arfiadi and hadi 2011 other optimization methods have also been proposed such as developed by lee et al 2006 that employing a frequency domain approach a mathematical optimization method using harmony search bekdas and nigdeli 2011 and for the limitation of the tmd response using two stage optimizations wang et al 2009 response surface methodology rsm widely applied in the optimization field is a powerful and efficient mathematical approach the effective use of rsm for structures has been shown in box and draper 1987 2007 and khan et al 2016a 2016b the rsm is one of the new approaches for applying the jacket supported owt structure to optimize damping parameters for controlling and mitigating vibration the intention of the present study is to mitigate the seismic responses through mtmd system based on the mode shapes and frequencies of the structure under static wind and wave loads tmds have been placed at the locations corresponding to the maximum mode shape amplitudes of the structure at the particular locations because at the first mode the tower top shows the maximum displacement response while at the second mode the tower base shows the maximum the frequency and damping ratios have been optimized through the central composite design ccd based on rsm and multi objective optimization desirability function to increase the efficiency of the mtmd then the result of the mtmd performance has been evaluated with different aspects under the different ground motions moreover mtmd performance has been compared with stmd to check the plausibility of the system finally this observation shows that the rsm based design of mtmd is applicable to control the vibration response of the structure under the seismic and other operational loads and to suppress the maximum responses of the first two modes significantly 2 structural model 2 1 equation of motion the governing equation of motion of the structure placed with tmds at the top and base of the tower has been obtained considering the equilibrium of forces as shown in eq 1 1 m s ü s c s u s k s u s m s r ü g where m s k s and c s are the mass stiffness and damping matrices of the structure of order n d n d and n and d are the degrees of freedom dof for the structure and mtmd respectively ü s u s u s u 1 u 2 u n 1 u n u 1 u d t are the unknown relative nodal acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively the earthquake ground acceleration can be depicted by u g and r is the vector of influence coefficients the stiffness k d and damping c d parameters of the tmd d 1 n can be computed based on the modal frequencies for the mtmd the mass matrix is of order n d n d as in eq 2 2 m s m n n n 0 n d 0 d n m d d d where m n n n is the mass matrices of the structure and m d d d is the mass matrices of the mtmd the concise stiffness matrix is k n n n corresponding to the sway degrees of freedom performed as the dynamic dof the damping matrix c n αm n βk n n n is not explicitly known but has been obtained by using the same rayleigh s damping ratio in all modes and α and β are the damping constants having a unit of sec 1 and sec the k d d d and c d d d has been expressed corresponding to the degrees of freedom associated with the tmds the stiffness and damping of the mtmd are the input in the k s and c s as follows in eqs 3 and 4 3 k s k n n n 0 n d 0 d n 0 d d k d n n k d n d k d d n k d d d n d n d 4 c s c n n n 0 n d 0 d n 0 d d c d n n c d n d c d d n c d d d n d n d the coupled differential equations of eq 1 for the structure installed with tmds have been thus derived using newmark β integration method wherein 5 damping ratio has been considered fig 1 a illustrates the typical jacket supported owt with the allocation of the tmds 2 2 loads the upwind national renewable energy laboratory nrel jacket supported 5 mw owt jonkman et al 2009 has been subjected to the static wind and wave loads and the dynamic seismic loads the wind and wave loads have been estimated by fast 2016 originated by nrel then those outcomes have been transferred to the opensees model the fast is an aero hydro servo elastic solver that is proficient in performing a fully coupled analysis of a floating owt the wind and wave loads have been applied as a static force on the tower and jacket nodes respectively these loads are a total six components of forces and moments in x y and z direction fast follows subsequent equations to determine the tower top thrust force and torque moriarty and hansen 2005 5 dt b 1 2 ρ

been assumed to be rigid and inactive operationally during the dynamic seismic simulation the gravity of the structure has been considered in the opensees analysis 2 3 owt model the finite element model fem of the owt has been modeled by using the opensees shown in fig 1 b the 68 m tower has been constructed with 9 elements and the jacket support structure consists of 64 nodes and 112 elements where every element is considered as force beam column element in opensees model for water depth of 50 m and water density 1025 kg m 3 the hydrodynamic loads calculated by the fast have been applied to jacket nodes as nodal forces and moments the designed jacket consists of 4 central piles 4 levels of x braces mud braces 4 legs a transition piece tp the rotor nacelle assembly rna along the hub has been created as rigid bodies and its mass has been lumped at the top of the tower following to the nrel 5 mw baseline turbine the tp among the baseline turbine and the jacket structure has been assumed as a density filling the rectangular rigid body the full model contains tower top mass tower tp jacket structure and a circular foundation monopile below the mudline the geometric parameters of the jacket support structure and tower properties are listed in table 1 song et al 2013 vorpahl et al 2013 2 4 fem validation fem is essential for predicting the natural behavior of complex structures with and without unusual loadings this study has considered nrel 5 mw wind turbine as the reference model since the model parameter has been taken as same as reference model to establish the fem of the structure this investigation has compared the natural frequencies of the structure with those of the reference song et al have chosen fast to simulate the reference model in 2013 to verify the opensees fem not only with the fast analysis but also a couple of fem such as sap2000 and ansys have been created which is shown in fig 1 c and d fig 2 illustrates the mode shapes of the structure and the corresponding modal natural frequencies are represented in table 2 the opensees fem natural frequency has been assimilated with the other natural frequencies of fems including a reference model this depiction clearly goes with the perception of the validation besides the gravitational load has been also checked through the opensees after obtaining the static analysis result the summation of reaction forces of the structure at fixed supports is equivalent to the total gravity load this is another way to accomplish the verification of opensees fem 3 optimal design based on rsm it is apparently undeniable that first two vibration modes typically constitute the major contribution of the dynamic responses of the structure around 80 structural mass of the entire jacket supported structure is governed by the first two modes therefore the first two vibration modes have been considered to control under random vibration tmds installed to alleviate those two vibrational modes have been designed according to the first two modal parameters of the uncontrolled structure the total mass of tmds has been considered 5 of the structural mass and mass of each tmd m d i μ m s where μ is the mass ratio and m s is the mass of the structure has been distributed based on the modal participation factor the first and second tmds have been located on the top and base of the tower for controlling first and second mode respectively moreover to enhance the performance of mtmd system multi objective optimization based on response surface methodology rsm has been applied for this purpose an experiment has been carried out based on rsm coupled with a ccd to explore the factors affecting responses of the structures due to the interaction effect of the frequency ratio and the damping ratio of structural response frequency response amplitude of first two modes and peak displacement of tower top and base under el centro earthquake has been counted as a structural response those structural responses have been considered as an objective function where frequency ratio and the damping ratio have been taken as an independent variable for the mtmd the objective function illustrates in eqs 7 and 8 7 f 1 max d b 1 s t m o d e max d b 2 n d m o d e max d b k t h m o d e 8 f 2 p d k where max d b f m o d e f 1 2 k explains the maximum magnitude of the frequency response function frf for each modal frequency and p d f f 1 2 k is the peak displacement response either top or base of the tower for optimizing the frequency ratio and damping ratio from the analysis of design experiment value frequency and damping ratio values have been used as design variable of the dampers and structural analysis has been executed to get the structural response the design of experiments has been made at total 9 experimental points composed of 4 factorial points 4 axial points and 1 center point which has been generated randomly with given interest region of frequency ratio and damping ratio interest region of the mtmd independent variable is shown in table 3 table 4 describes the analysis point and corresponding structural responses under el centro earthquake the frequency ratio α and damping ratio ξ indicates the analysis point and frequency response amplitude of the first mode d b 1 frequency response amplitude of second mode d b 2 maximum displacement of tower top p d 1 and maximum displacement of tower base p d 2 are the corresponding structural responses the model equation developed by the design matrix involving the quadratic term has been estimated the structural responses of the structure with mtmd according to the multiple linear regression the variable coefficient has been attained r p c where r is the predicted response p is the product of the design matrix and c is the corresponding coefficient the corresponding coefficient vector is the pseudo inverse of p and the experimental response is depicted by c p p 1 p r through the coefficients it is possible to know the nature of various factors characterizing the response of various models the quadratic models based on ccd have been executed and the magnitude of the coefficients can describe the contribution of several factors to the responses the quadratic models are displayed by eq 9 9 r c o i 1 i n c i s i i 1 i n c i s i 2 i f 1 i n c i f s i s f u where r is the predicted response c is the coefficient s i is the coded factor i f 1 2 3 n and u is the offset term the damper frequency ratio has a large impact on the structural response under the seismic excitation since the r 2 is significantly high excepted for the second mode frequency amplitude the overall performance of this model can be considered as feasible table 5 shows the r 2 for frequency response and peak displacement response for each damper and the quadratic models fig 3 a b d and e portrays the three dimensional structural response plotted along with the two factors of mtmd under the el centro earthquake it helps to visualize how the response changes with the different combination of factors the result suggests that frequency ratio is the vital factor compared to the damping ratio for designing mtmd desirability function based on rsm has been used to optimize mtmd performances for optimization cases of mtmd parameter the frequency amplitude and peak displacement responses have been targeted to minimize table 6 shows the response goal of optimization and parameter limits for the different responses of mtmd here four responses are competing with each other on the basis of frequency ratio and damping ratio for the mtmd all the optimization analysis has been demonstrated by using minitab 2013 software tools fig 3 c and f exhibits the optimization based on the composite desirability function optimization mainly based on a goal set up and those set up has been used to each response and factors to find out the enrich optimization result in this present case minimum set as a goal has been applied within the range such as lower target and upper for all the responses separately in addition an equal weight of 1 has been imposed to all the responses which have adopted the shape of the responses for its intimate desirability function to optimize all responses at the same time composite desirability is required which ascertains how it optimizes a set response together here the composite desirability has been found 1 0 in the mtmd parameter due to the first mode frequency amplitude and peak displacement value set up on top of the tower moreover the second mode frequency amplitude and peak displacement value installed at the base of the tower composite desirability is 0 9041 which has been close to 1 one as desired and it points out that the settings have been favorable for all responses the final optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio for tmd 1 are 1 0518 and 0 114 and for the tmd 2 is 0 9018 and 0 1114 respectively finally by using optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio the damping and stiffness values of those tmds can be obtained from eq 10 and 11 10 k d i m d i α d o p t i ω s i 2 11 c d i 2 m d i α d o p t i ω s i ξ d o p t i where k d i and c d i are the stiffness and damping coefficients m d i is the mass of damper α d i o p t and ξ d o p t i is the rsm optimized frequency ratio and damping ratio of the damper ω s i is the natural frequency of jacket supported structure here i indicates the position of damper where the damper will be placed table 7 is expressed the final mtmd properties based on the analysis result the predicted frequency response amplitude for the first and second mode is 4 5068 db and 2 3632 db along with the individual desirability of 1 0 and 0 95382 respectively as opposed to the analysis obtained responses are 5 00 db and 2 512 db successively for the mtmd parameter on the other side the predicted peak displacement values for the top and base of the tower are 0 2494 m and 0 0762 m along with the individual desirability of 1 0 and 0 8570 respectively whereas the analysis gained responses are correspondingly 0 2477 m and 0 0721 m for mtmd parameter after installing mtmd based on the optimization parameter eigenvalue analysis has been performed through the fem of opensees and sap 2000 table 8 shows natural frequencies of the uncontrolled and controlled structure through mtmd which is almost same for both of this fem 4 numerical analysis 4 1 model verification with mtmd to verify the effectiveness of the rsm based mtmd system in the structure the structure subjected to sweep acceleration which contains 0 10 hz frequency has been simulated by sap2000 and opensees the sweep acceleration consists of 6000 load steps with an equal spacing of 0 01 sec and maximum pga of 1 012 g sweep signal is one of the general types of vibration testing services performed by the structure it is useful for identifying resonances and frequency ranges of the structure in this investigation the vibration waveforms have been swept through a range of frequencies however they are of separate amplitude frequency and phase at any instant in time the maximum lateral displacement and frfs of the uncontrolled and controlled structure associated with mtmd have been described as the two main performance indices in this study fig 4 a to c shows the time history excitation the amplitude of the frf for uncontrolled and controlled structure associated with mtmd and maximum lateral displacement under sweep acceleration 0 10 hz fig 4 b depicts that the frf amplitude is maximum at the fundamental natural frequency which is comparatively reasonable for examining the rsm based design of mtmd to control the first and second mode according to the fig 4 b and table 9 the maximum amplitude reduction values are around 62 and 63 for the first mode and for the second mode mitigation worth is around 52 and 49 at opensees and sap2000 fem respectively compared to the uncontrolled structure therefore mtmd performs numerous control effect not only for the first mode but also for the second mode of the structure the frf vibration response amplitudes of the mtmd for the top node decays significantly with wide suppression bandwidths gained in the frequency range frf curves for both the sap2000 and opensees fem have been assimilated which proves the verification of opensees fem of the structure it has been mentioned before the opensees fem model has been subjected to the static analysis with the external nodal wind and wave loads at the first place the dynamic earthquake analysis initiated from the previous static analysis case has been performed based on fig 4 c the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement along the tower height has been gained from the simulations of sweep acceleration it is apparent that mtmd reduces the maximum displacement of the uncontrolled structure fig 4 c shows that the maximum displacements of the both uncontrolled fems are around 1 533 m and 1 541 m sweep acceleration is not a real seismic excitation therefore the reduced value owing to the controlled system is not noticeable under the sweep acceleration associated with operational loads even though frf curves show the splendid result under sweep acceleration overall it can be concluded that mtmd has a significant contribution in decrementing vibration response of the structure under sweep acceleration to check precisely the various realistic ground motion has been performed in the later part of this study additionally the stmd parameters have been optimally designed by using eq 10 and 11 and compared with the mtmd to check the robustness of the rsm based mtmd systems the stmd has been only placed at the top of the tower based on the modal parameters of the first mode of the uncontrolled structure the total mass of the stmd has been considered as an equal mass of the mtmd finally by using eq 10 and 11 the stiffness and damping values of the stmd are achieved as 267 34 kn m and 83 93 kn sec m respectively where the corresponding optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio are 0 82 and 0 26 4 2 earthquake analysis for further verification of the seismic performance of mtmd with some realistic earthquakes the structure has been subjected to el centro 1940 ns kobe 1995 and tabas 1978 ground accelerations it is important to check that practically the tmds can be placed or not at the considered locations while the structure is experiencing seismic vibration at the tower top position in particular it is required to examine the available installation space area the ranges of the displacements inline both ways of the tmd itself are around 0 89 m 0 42 m and 0 47 m 0 671 m 0 328 m and 0 343 m and 0 171 m 0 084 m and 0 087 m respectively for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes the available space at the top point of the tower is 3 94 m that is enough space to allow the maximum movements of the tmd thus the tmd can be installed at the top position of the tower practically since the tower top area is sufficient for tmd s movement when it goes under all the distinctive earthquakes after that fig 5 a to f represents the time series responses at the top and base of the tower with and without mtmd and stmd under the seismic excitations the decreasing amounts of maximum tower top and base displacement for the mtmd are 23 76 and 35 63 under el centro 14 16 and 25 16 under kobe and 33 63 and 35 84 under tabas consecutively with respect to the uncontrolled structure the point to be noted is that mtmd can effectively alleviate the relatively high amplitude displacements which have occurred during the initial period of the analysis and responded quickly to these early vibration excitations it is particularly important for the vibration suppression under the seismic excitations further the peak displacements are reduced up to 29 62 13 27 and 39 28 respectively under el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes with reference to the uncontrolled structure when the stmd is installed in the top of the tower besides the highest tower base displacement for the stmd are shortened around by 14 28 5 15 and 25 serially for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes even though the mtmd is slightly less effective than the stmd at the top of the tower but in the base of the tower the control effectiveness is raised around 25 21 and 22 for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively compared to the stmd contrariwise fig 5 g to i shows the outcome of the maximum displacement responses at the top of the tower for all the ground motions associated with the operational loads the decreasing amount of seismic response of the structure under the seismic loads in addition to static wind and wave loads is less influential compared to the individual effect of the seismic loads which is shown in fig 5 a to f the same synopsis can be found when the stmd has been installed the interesting point is that the control efficiency of the mtmd is more or less similar with the stmd for the peak displacement of the tower under this specific case due to the small mass of each tmd in the mtmd compare to the stmd it is also relatively easy to place practically the robustness of the mtmd compare to the stmd is explained further by the figs 9 and 10 in section 4 4 and 4 5 moreover it is revealed that the combined response has been obtained by superimposing all of them together which is shifted upward from the initial response position of the structure this observation leads to the conclusion that the interaction of the wind wave and seismic loads has a significant effect on the jacket supported structure even though it is not clear through the analysis of peak displacement response 4 3 maximum lateral displacement the distribution of the maximum lateral displacement of the tower nodes attained from all simulations of the ground motions with and without other loads has been plotted in fig 6 where the lateral displacement distribution increases along the tower heights and installation of mtmd reduces the maximum displacement of the structure fig 6 displays that the maximum lateral displacement of the tower decreases for all turbine tower nodes which is reasonable for the control effect of the lateral displacement gained by mtmd under all three seismic excitations in addition to this it is also fabricated that mtmd has an efficient contribution in reducing the vibration response of the structure under isolated seismic loads compared to the combination of the wind and wave loads for these three seismic excitations in order to access characteristics of the response displacements and to show the mtmd effectiveness in decreasing the higher mode responses the root means square rms value on response displacements has been performed which can be defined by eq 12 12 s rms 1 n n 1 n s n 2 where s rms is the root mean square value n is the total number of sampling points and s n input vector or matrix also to check the effectiveness of the control mtmd system from rms value eq 13 is used as follows 13 r eff 1 s c s uc 100 where r eff is the effective value of rms s uc and s c are the uncontrolled and controlled rms displacement respectively table 10 shows the outcome of the rms value on displacement responses with and without mtmd of the structure based on the computed rms value in table 10 it is observed that the reductions of displacement responses are 55 25 21 57 and 50 on top of the tower and 47 75 34 64 and 45 on the base of the tower with respect to the uncontrolled structure by using mtmd controlled system due to el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively therefore the mtmd is efficient to reduce the vibration of the structure subjected to the seismic loads that are combined with wind and wave loads which is not clear through the peak displacement results in the time domain moreover the mtmd is more feasible for the el centro and tabas earthquakes than kobe due to the different characteristics of the seismic excitations fig 7 a and b represents the response spectra rs of the input ground accelerations and the uncontrolled structural responses revealing the characteristics of both input and output accelerations respectively in fig 7 a the dominant frequencies are 1 8 2 2 and 8 hz for el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes respectively but the noticeable frequencies in the fig 7 b are 0 327 and 1 174 hz corresponding to the fundamental natural frequencies of the owt the shape of the rs of the fig 7 in the frequencies over 5 hz goes the same with that of the dynamic amplification of acceleration shown in the following chopra 2011 upon this supposition and based on fig 7 different input motions have the different characteristics pga and band frequency hence the decreasing amounts of displacement responses of el centro and tabas earthquake compared to kobe earthquake seem to be more reasonable thus the analysis results serve the main concern of mitigating vibration of owt under earthquakes through mtmd 4 4 shear force and moment the shear force response of the structure with and without mtmd under the three selected earthquakes has been shown in fig 8 a to check the effectiveness of mtmd through the analysis results of the shear force value which has been plotted against all the tower node with respect to the height such as node number 10 and 1 denote 88 15 m and 20 15 m altitude of the tower respectively the maximum shear force randomly fluctuates from the top to the base of the tower it is invented that mitigation rates are appreciable due to el centro earthquake compare to the other seismic excitations associated with operational loads along with all tower nodes in addition the effect of mtmd is reasonable to control the shear force on the other side the moment demand response is a key component in the design of the wind turbine structure the moment demand responses of the tower nodes have been shown in fig 8 b which indicates that the maximum moment responses harmonically increase from the top to the base hence the effect of mtmd on the moment responses due to the seismic loads associated with other operational loads is prominent along the tower height fig 9 shows the amplitude of the shear force under fft for the uncontrolled and controlled structure both in stmd and mtmd due to el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes with the operational loads from fig 9 a it is observed that the maximum shear forces are governed by the first and second mode frequencies where for the uncontrolled structure they belong to around 0 319 and 1 165 hz successively on the other hand for the mtmd they are around 0 320 and 1 21 hz respectively under the el centro earthquake similarly it is established that the top element shear force has been dominated around the fundamental natural frequencies the first mode is 0 356 hz and the second mode is 1 24 hz of the structure in the case of kobe and tabas earthquakes with the mtmd system in addition for the mtmd the mitigated amplitude values are around 64 73 and 60 successively for the first mode and for the second mode reduction values are around 59 59 and 52 compared to the uncontrolled owt structure under the el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes associated with operational loads when the stmd is applied the maximum shear forces are also ruled by the fundamental natural frequencies in all the scenarios the alleviated amplitude values are slightly larger than the mtmd in every case as it is tuned in the first vibration mode in the case of the higher vibration mode second mode the stmd is not sufficient to minimize the maximum shear force amplitudes compared to the mtmd mtmd decrease sufficiently the maximum shear force amplitudes for both the fundamental vibration modes therefore this system sufficiently fulfills the requirement of multi mode control purpose according to the above discussion the seismic loads associated with wind and wave loads have a profound influence on the fundamental natural frequencies of the structure therefore the amplitude and the response of the structure due to seismic and other operational loads require being minimized which is possible through the proposed mtmd system the mtmd system for the jacket supported owt has been proved and reasonable by the several investigation ways which are mentioned above in a descriptive way 4 5 frequency response function frf fig 10 shows the amplitude of the frf for uncontrolled and controlled structure equipped with the mtmd and stmd on top of the tower due to the three distinctive earthquakes frf amplitude is maximum at the fundamental natural frequencies of every distinctive structure the peak values are much larger at the first modal frequencies and decrease gradually as the mode order increases therefore the first mode should be controlled beforehand moreover the declinations of maximum amplitude for the mtmd are around 55 56 and 51 respectively for the first mode and for the second mode the attenuated values are around 38 46 and 47 under the el centro kobe and tabas earthquakes correspondingly with respect to the uncontrolled structure in the case of the stmd the energy at the first mode amplitudes is marginally smaller than the mtmd for every distinctive earthquake as it is expected when the mtmd is applied although the first mode control effectiveness is less than the stmd mtmd consistently decreases the fundamental vibration modes first and second modes rather than the stmd in every scenario of earthquakes the above results and discussions are similarly coherent with the study by moon 2010 thus this evaluation conducts to the judgment that mtmd is more feasible to suppress several multi mode frequencies of the uncontrolled structure under the three seismic excitations than the stmd which only controls the first vibration mode 5 conclusion this research focuses on the multi mode vibration response control of the jacket supported owt under seismic and other operational loads using the mtmd the optimal design parameters of the mtmd have been developed through the rsm the feasibility of the proposed method has been verified via numerical simulations with and without the mtmd and stmd from the outcomes the following conclusions are drawn a sequential procedure has been proposed where mtmd parameters are optimized through the rsm the performance of mtmd parameters optimally designed by the rsm has been proved proficient in controlling the vibration after comparing the performance of mtmd with the stmd it is clearly visible that mtmd is suitable for multi mode control purpose while stmd is found to be efficient mainly for suppressing single mode vibration the displacement and shear force analyses show that the structural displacement and shear force at the top and the base of the tower have been suppressed reasonably according to the frf it is noticeable that the mtmd can decrease the peak responses of several multi mode fundamental frequencies of the uncontrolled structure under the three seismic excitations the amplitude reduction rates are more than 50 and 35 in the first and the second modes successively with respect to the uncontrolled structure regarding the rms and fft the mtmd seems effective not only to minimize the seismic responses but also to reduce the responses due to other operational loads the potential of the mtmd has been proved in this research to suppress the vibration of a gigantic jacket supported owt structure under the seismic and other operational loads the further research needs to be done considering the dynamic interaction of wind and wave loads

23349,in this study a finite element model is developed to simulate the problem of a single point multi segment mooring subjected to water waves the governing equation for cable structure is derived from the principle of virtual work a finite element method is then used to obtain the discrete equations for numerical computation due to high nonlinearity of the discrete equations of motion for cables further manipulations including incremental and iterative schemes are used in the solution procedures where the implicit newmark s method is chosen for time integration to describe the wave forces the morison equation is used to calculate the drag forces on cables and the fluid motion generated by water wave is based on potential wave theory in which the linear wave is applied the initial equilibrium configuration of the cable structure which is required before dynamic analysis is calculated by the viscous relaxation technique in static analysis good agreement between numerical results is shown in calculation of a single buoy relaxation comparisons of the present results of the four segment mooring with an iterative model also confirm applicability of the present numerical model meanwhile effects caused by nonlinear waves are also demonstrated keywords water wave mooring finite element multi segment nonlinear 1 introduction mooring structures play an important role in ocean engineering because of the rapidly increasing expansion of telecommunication systems and buoy systems frequently used in marine and offshore engineering most of them are widely applied to monitoring the oceanophysical environment in mooring type floating structures such as data buoys and signal buoys so the analysis and design of the submarine mooring structure is very important the focus of recent research is mainly on the motion and tension of the moorings response to fluid forces such as waves and currents it is very difficult to analyze the mechanism of mooring structures due to the nonlinearities of structures including geometrical nonlinearity material nonlinearity and non conservative loadings lo 1982 therefore researches on the nonlinear problem of mooring structures are still mainly dominated by numerical methods which can be divided into three categories lumped parameter method finite element method and the iteration method chiou 1990 the lumped parameter method uses a force balance on discrete elements to write the equations of motion this method arises from the lumping of the mass and externally applied forces at adjacent nodes which are joined by mass less springs this discretization approach has an intuitive simplicity to it and as such is relatively easy to implement the lumped parameter method has been shown to be roughly equivalent to the finite element method with straight line elements typical numerical implementations are inferior to finite element method in topology computational flexibility and completeness leonard and nath 1981 webster and palo 1986 the finite element method has had a great impact on structural analysis and has been used successfully in solving both structural and non structural problems either linear or nonlinear oden 1972 zienkiewicz 1977 irons and ahmad 1980 for solving undersea cable problems finite element methods derive their governing equations through principles of virtual work one advantage of this approach is the possibility of a more sophisticated treatment of mass compared to lumped parameter method finite element methods can derive the governing equations using an integration of the mass over the entire element thus leading to a consistent mass formulation leonard and nath 1981 lo 1982 developed a finite element model based on the principle of virtual work to solve the nonlinear dynamic problem for cable and membrane structures most temporal integration schemes in use today have their roots in the method developed by newmark 1959 the methods typically employ temporal finite differences with a variety of different schemes used to interpolate the solution over the time step in addition to the newmark method and its variants which are popularly employed with finite element based models researchers in the cable dynamics field have employed a variety of schemes for the temporal integration problem chiou and leonard 1991 use simple backward finite differences sun et al 1994 use the generalized trapezoidal rule a first order variant of the newmark method a popular finite difference scheme is the second order accurate box method in which the governing equations are discretized on the half grid point in both space and time this method was first employed for the solution of tow cable dynamics by ablow and schechter 1983 since then it has been used in both towing and mooring applications by milinazzo et al 1987 howell 1992 tjavaras 1996 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 1999 and park et al 2003 among others the temporal portion of the box method is a special form of the generalized α method chung and hulbert 1993 gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 chung and hulbert 1993 which has been used in solving the dynamic problem of marine cables by gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 this development will also demonstrate that the box method is seldom the best choice of temporal discretization schemes for the cable dynamics problem for calculation of wave forces acting on the undersea moorings models of wave body interaction generally depend on the size of the body compared to the incident wave length a floating body with small characteristic length may be analyzed by the morison equation morison et al 1950 the present work focuses on buoys which are slender compared to incident wave length the morison equation has been extended for dynamic analyses of ocean structures undergoing large displacement and has been widely used for analyses of oceanic structures assembled from slender cylindrical members the purpose of this study is to present a solution procedure based on finite element model for analyzing the dynamic problem of a single point multi segment mooring subject to wave forces the next section describes the concerned problem the governing equation and boundary conditions it is followed by a finite element model for the governing equation and solution schemes used in this paper verification of the model and dynamic simulations of the mooring system subject to wave forces are given in section 4 finally in section 5 we draw a brief conclusion from this paper 2 problem description the aim of this paper is to study the dynamic problem of a multi buoy mooring in water waves the problem considered is sketched in fig 1 a multi buoy mooring with one end fixed at the bottom is deployed in water of constant depth h a cartesian coordinate system is adopted with its origin fixed above the anchor point on the bottom the x 1 axis is placed at the still water level with positive defined directed to the right and positive x 2 axis pointed upward the incident wave is given propagated in the positive x 1 direction the principle of virtual work is used to describe the equilibrium of the cable structure the virtual work equation for a cable structure is given by lo 1982 1 s 0 τ 11 δ γ 11 a 0 d s 0 s 0 ρ 0 a 0 u i δ u i d s 0 s 0 ρ 0 a 0 b 0 i δ u i d s 0 s 0 f 0 i δ u i d s 0 0 in which τ 11 is the kirchhoff stress tensor δγ 11 the virtual strain

becomes static analysis if the inertia force term is dropped a dummy index i denotes a summation with respect to that index hereafter boundary conditions of the problem are as follows the anchor end of the cable is regarded as a fixed boundary i e u i 0 the moving end of the cable tied to a buoy moves with the center of the buoy under the assumption of small dimension of the buoy thus moving boundary can be expressed by equation of motion of the buoy as 2 m b u i f i t i δ 2 i ρ w v b m b g i 1 2 in which m b is the mass of the buoy f i the drag force on the buoy t i the tension of the cable acted on the buoy δ 2i the kronecker delta ρ w the density of fluid v b the volume of the buoy submerged in the fluid and g the gravitational acceleration the finite element method is used to solve the virtual work equation by which a cable is subdivided into finite elements then the equation of motion of a cable element can be expressed as 3 f i i g i i p i i i 1 2 i 1 n e where f i i denotes the internal force g i i the inertia force p i i the external force the subscript i the component of cartesian coordinate the capital superscript i the nodal serial number and n e the amount of nodes in an element corresponding to the virtual work equation eq 1 internal force inertia force and external force can be expressed in discretized form as 4 f i i 1 1 τ 11 l 1 i l 1 j x i j u i j

cartesian component of position of a node on an unstressed element u i i the component of displacement of the node after deforming l i the shape function l 1 i the differential of l i with respect to ξ 1 the natural coordinate of the element which ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and a 11 the inner product of the unit base vector a 1 tangent to the undeformed cable axis i e a 11 a 1 a 1 from eq 6 computation of the fluid force on a cable element in water waves can be written as 7 p i i 1 1 f i l i a 11 d ξ 1 i 1 2 i 1 n e in which f i is the cartesian component of the fluid force per unit length in ocean engineering cable structures are usually regarded as small structures which the diameter of the cross section is much smaller than the wave length sarpakaya and isaacson 1981 the wave forces acting on the cable therefore can be evaluated from the morison formula as following 8 f n 1 2 c n d ρ w v n u n v n u n ρ w a c v n a c c a v n u n in which the first term on the right hand side denotes the drag force the second term the inertial force f n the vector of the fluid force per unit length normal to the cable axis c n the normal drag coefficient d the cable diameter ρ w the fluid density v n the fluid velocity vector normal to the cable axis u n the cable velocity vector normal to the cable axis a c the cable area c a the added mass coefficient v n the fluid acceleration vector normal to the cable axis and u n the cable acceleration vector normal to the cable axis the motion of the fluid in water waves is expressed based on potential theory in which the second order stokes wave is used dean and dalrymple 1984 9 φ g a ω cosh k x 2 h cosh k h cos k x 1 ω t 3 ω a 2 8 cosh 2 k z h sinh 4 k h sin 2 k x 1 2 ω t where φ is the velocity potential g is the gravitational acceleration a is wave amplitude k is the wave number and ω is the angular frequency of waves noted that the first term in the right hand side of eq 9 is the linear expression and the second term represents the second order term in this paper some results used for comparison were linear waves therefore only the linear expression of eq 9 is used thereof accordingly horizontal velocity vertical velocity horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration of the fluid particles under free surface can be written as φ x1 φ x2 φ x1t and φ x2t respectively in which the right hand subscripts denote the partial differentials with respect to x 1 x 2 or t eq 3 only describes the equation of motion of a cable element by assembling the equations of each element the global equation of motion of a cable can be obtained as following 10 f g p in which f is the global internal force vector g the global inertia force vector and p the global external force vector in this study the fixed end of the cable is set to be the first node serial number 1 in numerical modeling and the moving one is set to be the last node serial number n the amount of nodes of the cable the boundary conditions therefore can be expressed as 11 u i 1 0 i 1 2 12 m b u i n e f i n e t i n e δ 2 i ρ w v b m b g i 1 2 the dynamic problem of the cable structure would be solved by combining the global equation of motion and boundary conditions 3 numerical solution the discretized equation of motion eq 3 for cables is highly nonlinear and while it can be used directly in the solution of nonlinear problems further manipulations including incremental and newton raphson iteration schemes are used in the solution procedures in this study thus the alternate form of the equation of motion evaluated at time t δt and k 1 th iteration is given as 13 f i i k 1 t δ t g i i k 1 t δ t p i i k 1 t δ t i 1 2 i 1 ne in which the left hand superscripts denote time and left hand subscripts denote the iteration number then internal force inertia force and external force can be expressed respectively as 14 f i i k 1 t δ t 1 1 τ 11 k 1 t δ t l 1 i l 1 j x i j u i j k 1 t δ t a 0 a 11 d ξ 1 i 1 2 i j 1 ne 15 g i i k 1 t δ

series expansion for two variables to eq 14 the tangent stiffness matrix is obtained as 17 k i j i j k t δ t 1 1 τ 11 k t δ t l 1 i l 1 j δ i j l 1 k l 1 i x i k u i k k t δ t e t l 1 m l 1 j x j m u

j is the consistent mass matrix and can be expressed as 19 m i j i j 1 1 l i l j δ i j ρ 0 a 0 a 11 d ξ 1 i j 1 2 i j 1 ne therefore the equation of motion of a cable element evaluated at time t δt and k 1 th iteration is rewritten as 20 k i j i j k t δ t δ u j j m i j i j u j j k 1 t δ t p i i k 1 t δ t f i i k t δ t i j 1 2 i j 1 ne on assembling the element stiffness matrices mass matrices and load vectors following standard procedures one obtains 21 k t k t δ t δ u m u k 1 t δ t p k 1 t δ t f k t δ t in which k t k t δ t is the global tangent stiffness matrix m the global consistent mass matrix δu the global incremental displacement vector u k 1 t δ t the global acceleration vector p k 1 t δ t the global external load vector and f k t δ t the global internal force vector in performing time domain analysis for prestressed cable structures nonlinear static analyses are usually needed to establish the initial equilibrium configurations lo 1982 for nonlinear static analyses a combined incremental and iteration approach is adopted in this study the static equations of equilibrium can be derived from eq 21 by dropping the inertia force terms and replacing the left hand superscripts by the increment number the solution procedure is that the external forces are applied incrementally to the cable and the response of the cable is assumed to be linear in each increment after a stable equilibrium configuration of the cable is obtained its transient dynamic response under prescribed external loads is to be analyzed eq 21 is a set of second order linear ordinary differential equations in this study the implicit newmark s method is chosen for integration of the equations of motion newmark 1959 by applying newmark s method eq 21 is further rearranged as 22 k t k t δ t δ u p k 1 t δ t f k t δ t in which 23 k t k t δ t k t k t δ t a 0 m 24 δ u u k 1 t δ t u k t δ t 25 p k 1 t δ t p k 1 t δ t m a 0 u k t δ t u t a 1 u t a 2 u t in eq 23 through 25 k t k t δ t is the modified tangent stiffness matrix p k 1 t δ t the modified external load vector a 0 1 β δ t 2 a 1 1 β δ t a 2 1 2 β 1 and β the newmark s constant therefore the incremental displacements are obtained by solving system of linear equations after the incremental displacements are computed the accelerations and velocities can be computed further 4 results and discussion to verify the present numerical model a dynamic problem is concerned about which a single point mooring is released in the still water region as shown in fig 2 a single point mooring of 71 56 inch length is located in the still water region with one end fixed on the bottom and the other end tied to a buoy location of the buoy is specified before it is released verification of modeling is to simulate the dynamic process of the mooring after the buoy is released the initial configuration of the prestressed mooring can be obtained by viscous relaxation method before the buoy is released properties of mooring cable and buoy are listed in table 1 a concentrated mass element is used to model the buoy in numerical modeling fig 3 shows the speeds of buoy at time 0 21 s after release by using different amounts of linear elements and their relative errors compared to fewer elements the result shows that the relative errors are below 0 1 when more than 20 elements are used in numerical computation therefore 20 linear elements are used to simulate the dynamic process for verification in this study the response of the buoy speed during the first 3 s after release is shown in fig 4 results of chiou s model chiou 1990 and computer programs seadyn and snaplg are also presented in fig 4 the result shows that the present model can simulate the dynamic process of relaxation of a single point mooring reasonably the velocity comparison shows good agreement of present model with other methods validation of present model on dynamic simulation is then demonstrated note that the maximum speed of the buoy after released the present result shows the most conservative magnitude this property will be sued to explain the results in multi buoy simulations in the following in this section the problem of a single point multi segment mooring acted by water wave is simulated and numerical results by chiou 1990 obtained using an iterative scheme and linear wave theory are used for comparisons as shown in fig 5 a 152 4 m mooring system with four buoys tied to it is located in still water region the single point mooring is anchored to the sea floor and is initially vertical due to the excess buoyancy from the buoys to prevent abrasion of the cable on the sea floor a small length of 7 6 m of chain near the sea floor is employed a 3 05 m incident linear wave train with 12 s period is applied to the system the cable chain and buoys have the properties listed in table 2 the density of fluid is 1000 kg m3 and the water depth is 152 4 m in numerical computation linear elements are employed in the present study to model the cable and with concentrated mass elements to model the buoys according to the conditions above the amount of elements are examined to confirm the convergence the results show that the relative error is below 0 01 when more than 26 linear elements are employed by which condition the behavior of motion of the system is discussed as follows horizontal position of the four buoys in water waves is shown in fig 6 along with water level above buoy 4 plotted on the top of figure note that the given water level moves following the sine function and the buoys start to move forward x 1 direction motions of the buoys are periodic but the equilibrium position of each buoy is different from the initial position the largest positive displacement of buoy 4 is 2 21 m while the largest negative one is 0 4 m which indicates the range of horizontal motion of buoy 4 is about 2 6 m which is smaller than the size of motion of fluid particle on the surface 3 05 m buoys 1 2 and 3 do not move back to the initial positions due to the offsets which are larger than the amplitudes of motion of each buoy the phase of motion of each buoy is inconsistent with each other mean horizontal position of the four buoys over a period is shown in fig 7 and the net offset of vibration of the four buoys is to be noted the offset increases gradually with time and tends to be constant after about 16 periods the offset is due to the fact that the hydrodynamic forces are position dependent implying that hydrodynamic forces on the system are non zero mean processes in other words the offset is due to non zero mean forces from the hydrodynamic wave loads therefore it can be concluded that the direction of the offset is consistent with the direction of wave propagation vertical vibration of the buoy 4 in water waves is shown in fig 8 where time variation of the water level is also given for better reference note that the buoy 4 is released at the water surface and as the buoyance is considered and the equilibrium of the buoy cable system is calculated the center of the buoy 4 is above the water surface the response frequency of the buoy is double that of the wave at the top in the present case the horizontal velocity of the water particles causes the mooring cable to curve such that the buoy is forced to move downward the buoyancy of the buoys tends to stretch the mooring cable this imparts an upward motion to the buoys when the horizontal velocities of the water particles change direction the trajectory of buoy 4 over a period after the offset being constant is displayed in fig 9 in which locations of the buoy at each quarter cycle are signed the trajectory of the top buoy is neither circular nor elliptic the aforementioned double response of vertical vibration near the peek as well as an offset of vibration are to be noted in the figure the present simulation results can be compared with chiou 1990 using an iteration scheme lateral profiles of the cable for the beginning one period 12sec are shown in figs 10 12 separately the vertical axis indicates number of step the cable is divided as adopted from chiou 1990 buoys 1 2 3 and 4 are corresponding to step numbers 6 11 15 and 19 respectively in figures the lines indicate the present results while the dash lines are chiou s results basically cable profiles below buoy 3 are compatible for the two results but not coincide above buoy 3 although the trends are consistent as drawn from comparisons of a single buoy mooring with chiou s results fig 4 the present results are more conservative figs 10 12 also show the same tendency at time 2sec 3sec and 4 s buoys of chiou s are obviously moving faster and similarly after 6sec when wave velocity reverses the direction since the buoy 4 is initially floating on the water surface the initial equilibrium configuration is computed first and in the dynamic simulation the state of variable submergence of the buoy 4 in water is considered in this study therefore the initially tensioned cable tends to pull the buoy to move and the results are slower than chiou s results overall speaking the range of buoy 4 position in one period show 0 3 m x 1 2 3 m and 0 06 m x 2 0 005 m as shown in fig 9 which are very closed to chiou s results 1 5 ft x 1 8 0 ft and 0 2 ft x 2 0 ft chiou 1990 p 127 fig 4 34 the lateral profiles solid symbol line of the mooring cable at different time step in a period after the offset being constant are displayed in fig 13 in order to highlight the horizontal displacement of the mooring the horizontal and vertical scales are not the same in the figure at the same time configurations of the mooring one second ago are also plotted in the figure as dash lines to present the tendency of the mooring the displacement of buoy 4 at the top is larger than other buoys due to the larger velocity of fluid particle on the free surface in waves as shown in a b e and f of fig 13 in the process of movement of the mooring the fourth buoy turns first as shown in c of fig 13 the cable and buoys under buoy 4 have not yet reached the maximum positive displacement while the buoy 4 is changing direction once the cable and buoys under buoy 4 reach the maximum positive displacement buoy 4 has moved a distance in negative direction as shown in d the same situations are also shown in g and h of fig 13 respectively although the mooring system moves in different tunes up and down it still maintains a stable equilibrium state due to the upward driven buoyancy of buoys configuration of the mooring cable is not smooth in each buoy position in this paragraph a nonlinear wave considering the second order stokes wave is used and the problem of four buoy mooring is simulated to show the effects of nonlinear wave compared with linear theory a wave amplitude 7 62 m and a period 48sec are considered and horizontal and vertical positions of the buoy 4 are plotted in our numerical experiments 26 and 45 element numbers of the cable are considered in this high wave condition buoy 4 is attached to the cable therefore the motion is similar to the linear cases discussed above at wave peak buoy 4 is moving forward and downward at wave crossing there is no horizontal force acting on buoy 4 and it is moving upward at wave trough basically buoy is moving backward and downward however if the vertical position of the buoy is higher than the water surface it will show an instant drop on the water surface the size of the drop motion is also related to the size of the cable element a bigger element will show a bigger drop in the following the results of 45 elements are used to illustrate the phenomena fig 14 shows the horizontal position of the buoy 4 versus number of wave period and the water level is also plotted for reference the results show that after eight wave periods the horizontal motion of buoy 4 reach a stable and periodic state to get a better picture of the relation between water level and horizontal position of buoy 4 a closer look of fig 14 for the 12 to 13 wave periods are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that since the nonlinear water level is steeper and narrower at the wave peak compared to the linear wave therefore the buoy moves forward x 1 direction farther in a shorter time on the other hand at the wave trough the buoy moves backward shorter in x 1 direction in a longer time fig 16 shows the vertical position of the buoy 4 versus number of wave period and the water level is also plotted for reference compared with the variation of x 1 position the vertical position reaches stable state faster furthermore after the buoy 4 moving downward there are two coming upward movements which will be clarified in one wave period a closer look of fig 16 for the 12 to 13 wave periods is shown in fig 17 where the water levels are overlapped for easier interpretation and the x 1 position is added for reference it can be observed that the buoy 4 at the water surface is moved downward by the wave peak since the nonlinear wave force is bigger than the linear wave therefore the buoy is pushed more forward and dragged more downward than the linear case then after the wave down crossing the buoy is moving upward however the water level turns to the wave trough and the buoy moves with the water level until the buoy dragged under the water surface it can also be noticed that since the nonlinear wave has a shallower wave trough therefore the buoy position is above that in the linear case this explains the phenomena of the two time moving upward of the buoy 4 and the effects caused by nonlinear waves 5 conclusions in this paper a solution procedure based on finite element model is presented for analyzing the dynamic problem of a single point multi segment mooring subject to wave forces to describe the wave forces the morison equation is used to calculate the drag forces on cables and buoys and the fluid motion generated by water waves is based on potential wave theory due to high nonlinearity of the discrete equations of motion for cables further manipulations including incremental and iterative schemes are used in the solution procedures in this study the implicit newmark s method is chosen for integration of the equations of motion in nonlinear dynamic analysis good agreements between numerical results are shown in calculation of a single point moor relaxation and a four segmented mooring system motions of the buoys and the mooring line are simulated the effects of nonlinear waves on the mooring system are also demonstrated the present numerical model is shown to be capable of simulating dynamic motions of a single point multi segment mooring reasonably and can be used in dynamic analysis of mooring

model meanwhile effects caused by nonlinear waves are also demonstrated keywords water wave mooring finite element multi segment nonlinear 1 introduction mooring structures play an important role in ocean engineering because of the rapidly increasing expansion of telecommunication systems and buoy systems frequently used in marine and offshore engineering most of them are widely applied to monitoring the oceanophysical environment in mooring type floating structures such as data buoys and signal buoys so the analysis and design of the submarine mooring structure is very important the focus of recent research is mainly on the motion and tension of the moorings response to fluid forces such as waves and currents it is very difficult to analyze the mechanism of mooring structures due to the nonlinearities of structures including geometrical nonlinearity material nonlinearity and non conservative loadings lo 1982 therefore researches on the nonlinear problem of mooring structures are still mainly dominated by numerical methods which can be divided into three categories lumped parameter method finite element method and the iteration method chiou 1990 the lumped parameter method uses a force balance on discrete elements to write the equations of motion this method arises from the lumping of the mass and externally applied forces at adjacent nodes which are joined by mass less springs this discretization approach has an intuitive simplicity to it and as such is relatively easy to implement the lumped parameter method has been shown to be roughly equivalent to the finite element method with straight line elements typical numerical implementations are inferior to finite element method in topology computational flexibility and completeness leonard and nath 1981 webster and palo 1986 the finite element method has had a great impact on structural analysis and has been used successfully in solving both structural and non structural problems either linear or nonlinear oden 1972 zienkiewicz 1977 irons and ahmad 1980 for solving undersea cable problems finite element methods derive their governing equations through principles of virtual work one advantage of this approach is the possibility of a more sophisticated treatment of mass compared to lumped parameter method finite element methods can derive the governing equations using an integration of the mass over the entire element thus leading to a consistent mass formulation leonard and nath 1981 lo 1982 developed a finite element model based on the principle of virtual work to solve the nonlinear dynamic problem for cable and membrane structures most temporal integration schemes in use today have their roots in the method developed by newmark 1959 the methods typically employ temporal finite differences with a variety of different schemes used to interpolate the solution over the time step in addition to the newmark method and its variants which are popularly employed with finite element based models researchers in the cable dynamics field have employed a variety of schemes for the temporal integration problem chiou and leonard 1991 use simple backward finite differences sun et al 1994 use the generalized trapezoidal rule a first order variant of the newmark method a popular finite difference scheme is the second order accurate box method in which the governing equations are discretized on the half grid point in both space and time this method was first employed for the solution of tow cable dynamics by ablow and schechter 1983 since then it has been used in both towing and mooring applications by milinazzo et al 1987 howell 1992 tjavaras 1996 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 1999 and park et al 2003 among others the temporal portion of the box method is a special form of the generalized α method chung and hulbert 1993 gobat and grosenbaugh 2001 chung and hulbert 1993 which has been used in solving the dynamic problem of marine cables by gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 this development will also demonstrate that the box method is seldom the best choice of temporal discretization schemes for the cable dynamics problem for calculation of wave forces acting on the undersea moorings models of wave body interaction generally depend on the size of the body compared to the incident wave length a floating body with small characteristic length may be analyzed by the morison equation morison et al 1950 the present work focuses on buoys which are slender compared to incident wave length the morison equation has been extended for dynamic analyses of ocean structures undergoing large displacement and has been widely used for analyses of oceanic structures assembled from slender cylindrical members the purpose of this study is to present a solution procedure based on finite element model for analyzing the dynamic problem of a single point multi segment mooring subject to wave forces the next section describes the concerned problem the governing equation and boundary conditions it is followed by a finite element model for the governing equation and solution schemes used in this paper verification of the model and dynamic simulations of the mooring system subject to wave forces are given in section 4 finally in section 5 we draw a brief conclusion from this paper 2 problem description the aim of this paper is to study the dynamic problem of a multi buoy mooring in water waves the problem considered is sketched in fig 1 a multi buoy mooring with one end fixed at the bottom is deployed in water of constant depth h a cartesian coordinate system is

becomes static analysis if the inertia force term is dropped a dummy index i denotes a summation with respect to that index hereafter boundary conditions of the problem are as follows the anchor end of the cable is regarded as a fixed boundary i e u i 0 the moving end of the cable tied to a buoy moves with the center of the buoy under the assumption of small dimension of the buoy thus moving

computation of the fluid force on a cable element in water waves can be written as 7 p i i 1 1 f i l i a 11 d ξ 1 i 1 2 i 1 n e in which f i is the cartesian component of the fluid force per unit length in ocean engineering cable structures are usually regarded as small structures which the diameter of the cross section is much smaller than the wave length sarpakaya and isaacson 1981 the wave

the partial differentials with respect to x 1 x 2 or t eq 3 only describes the equation of motion of a cable element by assembling the equations of each element the global equation of motion of a cable can be obtained as following 10 f g p in which f is the global internal force vector g the global inertia force vector and p the global external force vector in this study the fixed end of the cable is set to be the first node serial number 1 in numerical modeling and the moving one is set to be the last node serial number n the amount of nodes of the cable the boundary conditions therefore can be expressed as 11 u i 1 0 i 1 2 12 m b u i n e f i n e t i n e δ 2 i ρ w v b m b g i 1 2 the dynamic problem of the cable structure would be solved by combining the global equation of motion and boundary conditions 3 numerical solution the discretized equation of motion eq 3 for cables is highly nonlinear and while it can be used directly in the solution of nonlinear problems further manipulations including incremental and newton raphson iteration schemes are used in the solution procedures in this study thus the alternate form of the equation of motion evaluated at time t δt and k 1 th iteration is given as 13 f i i k 1 t δ t g i i k 1 t δ t p i i k 1 t δ t i 1 2 i 1 ne in which the left hand superscripts denote time and left hand subscripts denote the iteration number then internal force inertia force and external force can be expressed respectively as 14 f i i k 1 t δ t 1 1 τ 11 k 1 t δ t l 1 i l 1 j x i j u i j k 1 t δ t a 0 a 11 d ξ 1 i 1 2 i j 1 ne 15 g i i k 1 t δ

performing time domain analysis for prestressed cable structures nonlinear static analyses are usually needed to establish the initial equilibrium configurations lo 1982 for nonlinear static analyses a combined incremental and iteration approach is adopted in this study the static equations of equilibrium can be derived from eq 21 by dropping the inertia force terms and replacing the left hand superscripts by the increment number the solution procedure is that the external forces are applied incrementally to the cable and the response of the cable is assumed to be linear in each increment after a stable equilibrium configuration of the cable is obtained its transient dynamic response under prescribed external loads is to be analyzed eq 21 is a set of second order linear ordinary differential equations in this study the implicit newmark s method is chosen for integration of the equations of motion newmark 1959 by applying newmark s method eq 21 is further rearranged as 22 k t

is the modified tangent stiffness matrix p k 1 t δ t the modified external load vector a 0 1 β δ t 2 a 1 1 β δ t a 2 1 2 β 1 and β the newmark s constant therefore the incremental displacements are obtained by solving system of linear equations after the incremental displacements are computed the accelerations and velocities can be computed further 4 results and discussion to verify the present numerical model a dynamic problem is concerned about which a single point mooring is released in the still water region as shown in fig 2 a single point mooring of 71 56 inch length is located in the still water region with one end fixed on the bottom and the other end tied to a buoy location of the buoy is specified before it is released verification of modeling is to simulate the dynamic process of the mooring after the buoy is released the initial configuration of the prestressed mooring can be obtained by viscous relaxation method before the buoy is released properties of mooring cable and buoy are listed in table 1 a concentrated mass element is used to model the buoy in numerical modeling fig 3 shows the speeds of buoy at time 0 21 s after release by using different amounts of linear elements and their relative errors compared to fewer elements the result shows that the relative errors are below 0 1 when more than 20 elements are used in numerical computation therefore 20 linear elements are used to simulate the dynamic process for verification in this study the response of the buoy speed during the first 3 s after release is shown in fig 4 results of chiou s model chiou 1990 and computer programs seadyn and snaplg are also presented in fig 4 the result shows that the present model can simulate the dynamic process of relaxation of a single point mooring reasonably the velocity comparison shows good agreement of present model with other methods validation of present model on dynamic simulation is then demonstrated note that the maximum speed of the buoy after released the present result shows the most conservative magnitude this property will be sued to explain the results in multi buoy simulations in the following in this section the problem of a single point multi segment mooring acted by water wave is simulated and numerical results by chiou 1990 obtained using an iterative scheme and linear wave theory are used for comparisons as shown in fig 5 a 152 4 m mooring system with four buoys tied to it is located in still water region the single point mooring is anchored to the sea floor and is initially vertical due to the excess buoyancy from the buoys to prevent abrasion of the cable on the sea floor a small length of 7 6 m of chain near the sea floor is employed a 3 05 m incident linear wave train with 12 s period is applied to the system the cable chain and buoys have the properties listed in table 2 the density of fluid is 1000 kg m3 and the water depth is 152 4 m in numerical computation linear elements are employed in the present study to model the cable and with concentrated mass elements to model the buoys according to the conditions above the amount of elements are examined to confirm the convergence the results show that the relative error is below 0 01 when more than 26 linear elements are employed by which condition the behavior of motion of the system is discussed as follows horizontal position of the four buoys in water waves is shown in fig 6 along with water level above buoy 4 plotted on the top of figure note that the given water level moves following the sine function and the buoys start to move forward x 1 direction motions of the buoys are periodic but the equilibrium position of each buoy is different from the initial position the largest positive displacement of buoy 4 is 2 21 m while the largest negative one is 0 4 m which indicates the range of horizontal motion of buoy 4 is about 2 6 m which is smaller than the size of motion of fluid particle on the surface 3 05 m buoys 1 2 and 3 do not move back to the initial positions due to the offsets which are larger than the amplitudes of motion of each buoy the phase of motion of each buoy is inconsistent with each other mean horizontal position of the four buoys over a period is shown in fig 7 and the net offset of vibration of the four buoys is to be noted the offset increases gradually with time and tends to be constant after about 16 periods the offset is due to the fact that the hydrodynamic forces are position dependent implying that hydrodynamic forces on the system are non zero mean processes in other words the offset is due to non zero mean forces from the hydrodynamic wave loads therefore it can be concluded that the direction of the offset is consistent with the direction of wave propagation vertical vibration of the buoy 4 in water waves is shown in fig 8 where time variation of the water level is also given for better reference note that the buoy 4 is released at the water surface and as the buoyance is considered and the equilibrium of the buoy cable system is calculated the center of the buoy 4 is above the water surface the response frequency of the buoy is double that of the wave at the top in the present case the horizontal velocity of the water particles causes the mooring cable to curve such that the buoy is forced to move downward the buoyancy of the buoys tends to stretch the mooring cable this imparts an upward motion to the buoys when the horizontal velocities of the water particles change direction the trajectory of buoy 4 over a period after the offset being constant is displayed in fig 9 in which locations of the buoy at each quarter cycle are signed the trajectory of the top buoy is neither circular nor elliptic the aforementioned double response of vertical vibration near the peek as well as an offset of vibration are to be noted in the figure the present simulation results can be compared with chiou 1990 using an iteration scheme lateral profiles of the cable for the beginning one period 12sec are shown in figs 10 12 separately the vertical axis indicates number of step the cable is divided as adopted from chiou 1990 buoys 1 2 3 and 4 are corresponding to step numbers 6 11 15 and 19 respectively in figures the lines indicate the present results while the dash lines are chiou s results basically cable profiles below buoy 3 are compatible for the two results but not coincide above buoy 3 although the trends are consistent as drawn from comparisons of a single buoy mooring with chiou s results fig 4 the present results are more conservative figs 10 12 also show the same tendency at time 2sec 3sec and 4 s buoys of chiou s are obviously moving faster and similarly after 6sec when wave velocity reverses the direction since the buoy 4 is initially floating on the water surface the initial equilibrium configuration is computed first and in the dynamic simulation the state of variable submergence of the buoy 4 in water is considered in this study therefore the initially tensioned cable tends to pull the buoy to move and the results are slower than chiou s results overall speaking the range of buoy 4 position in one period show 0 3 m x 1 2 3 m and 0 06 m x 2 0 005 m as shown in fig 9 which are very closed to chiou s results 1 5 ft x 1 8 0 ft and 0 2 ft x 2 0 ft chiou 1990 p 127 fig 4 34 the lateral profiles solid symbol line of the mooring cable at different time step in a period after the offset being constant are displayed in fig 13 in order to highlight the horizontal displacement of the mooring the horizontal and vertical scales are not the same in the figure at the same time configurations of the mooring one second ago are also plotted in the figure as dash lines to present the tendency of the mooring the displacement of buoy 4 at the top is larger than other buoys due to the larger velocity of fluid particle on the free surface in waves as shown in a b e and f of fig 13 in the process of movement of the mooring the fourth buoy turns first as shown in c of fig 13 the cable and buoys under buoy 4 have not yet reached the maximum positive displacement while the buoy 4 is changing direction once the cable and buoys under buoy 4 reach the maximum positive displacement buoy 4 has moved a distance in negative direction as shown in d the same situations are also shown in g and h of fig 13 respectively although the mooring system moves in different tunes up and down it still maintains a stable equilibrium state due to the upward driven buoyancy of buoys configuration of the mooring cable is not smooth in each buoy position in this paragraph a nonlinear wave considering the second order stokes wave is used and the problem of four buoy mooring is simulated to show the effects of nonlinear wave compared with linear theory a wave amplitude 7 62 m and a period 48sec are considered and horizontal and vertical positions of the buoy 4 are plotted in our numerical experiments 26 and 45 element numbers of the cable are considered in this high wave condition buoy 4 is attached to the cable therefore the motion is similar to the linear cases discussed above at wave peak buoy 4 is moving forward and downward at wave crossing there is no horizontal force acting on buoy 4 and it is moving upward at wave trough basically buoy is moving backward and downward however if the vertical position of the buoy is higher than the water surface it will show an instant drop on the water surface the size of the drop motion is also related to the size of the cable element a bigger element will show a bigger drop in the following the results of 45 elements are used to illustrate the phenomena fig 14 shows the horizontal position of the buoy 4 versus number of wave period and the water level is also plotted for reference the results show that after eight wave periods the horizontal motion of buoy 4 reach a stable and periodic state to get a better picture of the relation between water level and horizontal position of buoy 4 a closer look of fig 14 for the 12 to 13 wave periods are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that since the nonlinear water level is steeper and narrower at the wave peak compared to the linear wave therefore the buoy moves forward x 1 direction farther in a shorter time on the other hand at the wave trough the buoy moves backward shorter in x 1 direction in a longer time fig 16 shows the vertical position of the buoy 4 versus number of wave period and the water level is also plotted for reference compared with the variation of x 1 position the vertical position reaches stable state faster furthermore after the buoy 4 moving downward there are two coming upward movements which will be clarified in one wave period a closer look of fig 16 for the 12 to 13 wave periods is shown in fig 17 where the water levels are overlapped for easier interpretation and the x 1 position is added for reference it can be observed that the buoy 4 at the water surface is moved downward by the wave peak since the nonlinear wave force is bigger than the linear wave therefore the buoy is pushed more forward and dragged more downward than the linear case then after the wave down crossing the buoy is moving upward however the water level turns to the wave trough and the buoy moves with the water level until the buoy dragged under the water surface it can also be noticed that since the nonlinear wave has a shallower wave trough therefore the buoy position is above that in the linear case this explains the phenomena of the two time moving upward of the buoy 4 and the effects caused by nonlinear waves 5 conclusions in this paper a solution procedure based on finite element model is presented for analyzing the dynamic problem of a single point multi segment mooring subject to wave forces to describe the wave forces the morison equation is used to calculate the drag forces on cables and buoys and the fluid motion generated by water waves is based on potential wave theory due to high nonlinearity of the discrete equations of motion for cables further manipulations including incremental and iterative schemes are used in the solution procedures in this study the implicit newmark s method is chosen for integration of the equations of motion in nonlinear dynamic analysis good agreements between numerical results are shown in calculation of a single point moor relaxation and a four segmented mooring system motions of the buoys and the mooring line are simulated the effects of nonlinear waves on the mooring system are also demonstrated the present numerical model is shown to be capable of simulating dynamic motions of a single point multi segment mooring reasonably and can be used in dynamic analysis of mooring
