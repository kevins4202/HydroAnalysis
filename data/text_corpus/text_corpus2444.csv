12220,it is long reported that the fractionation of different stable isotopes of same element is temperature dependent therefore it is a long practice to use stable isotopes as paleo thermometer to understand temperature dependent physical processes on earth extending the application stable isotopes have also been used to understand different physical processes operating in hydrosphere particularly where there is physical phase change of water ice vapor system like understanding global precipitation pattern water shade response and hydrograph separation etcetera best interest of this research is to understand a very small part of hydrologic cycle which is groundwater and its isotopic response with imposed natural geothermal gradient the proposed geothermometer is exclusive to confined aquifer system and not applicable to unconfined aquifers fundamental proposition of this research is for a gently dipping 15 confined aquifer and rayleigh number ra c very close to but less than 40 will onset free unicellular laminar convection due to temperature dependent density gradient imposed by down dip incremental geothermal heat both 18o and 2h will respond in confined aquifer system with respect to this geothermal heat obeying the equilibrium isotope fractionation model depending on 16o 16o and 16o 18o vibrational frequency 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature region up dip while 16o will tend to concentrate at higher temperature region down dip depending on this basic postulation the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research can estimate groundwater temperature with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature qualitatively having precision level well within reported standard deviation of o18 absolute abundance in ppm for vpdb which is 2067

confined aquifer unicellular laminar convection vibrational frequency rayleigh number vpdb vsmow 1 introduction world of isotope which includes both stable and radio isotope is a fascinating branch of earth science stable isotope has huge implication in deep understanding of different physical processes operating on earth whereas radioisotope is the tool to date absolute ages of rocks in earth science stable isotope fractionation has been used for in depth understanding of process of crystallization of igneous rocks and its geochemistry friedman et al 1977 chiba et al 1989 water rock interaction taylor 1977 and hydrothermal system craig 1966 gregory et al 1981 1989 criss et al 1983 1986 criss et al 1985 stable isotope fractionation is a temperature dependent process however gravity driven stable isotope fractionation for gas in polar region is also reported craig et al 1988 water ice vapor system best exemplifies the temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation pattern in terms of oxygen 18o 18o and hydrogen h 2h isotope ratios souchez et al 2000 christopher et al 2003 cappa et al 2005 deshpande et al 2013 casado et al 2016 oxygen and hydrogen ratios act as most conservative tracers in the hydrologic cycle intrinsic to water molecule which explicate the origin of the water phase transition and transportation of water in the field of hydrology stable isotopes have huge implications stable isotope has been used to estimate aquifer recharge and seasonality effect on recharge darling et al 1988 and separating base flow from overland flow in hydrograph separation criss 1997 maurya et al 2011 ahluwalia et al 2013 stable isotope fractionation has been used to understand the process of global precipitation pattern also craig 1961a kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 2016 since variation of δ18o and δ2h has geographic influence which includes temperature altitude latitude and longitude effect in terms of precipitation pattern therefore isotopic signature of groundwater can provide unique information in terms of its sources and flow paths strong linear variation of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation pattern which has able to establish empirical meteoric water line or mwl craig 1961a b can distinguish water of meteoric origin from any other parentage since stable isotope fractionation is used as geothermometer significant work has been done in the field of earth science in terms of fundamental understanding of the physical processes operating on earth particularly understanding of paleo environment and paleo temperature hydrogen and oxygen isotopes have been successfully used to determine if paleo temperature was relatively warmer or cooler than present epstein et al 1953 erez at al 1983 bemis et al 1988 mcguffie et al 2005 empirical chemical geothermometers has been developed to estimate temperature of geothermal system fournier 1979 fournier 1982 fouillac et al 1981 arnorsson et al 1985 giggenbach et al 1988 goff et al 2000 these reported chemical geothermometers are restricted to high temperature regime of geothermal system in and around 100 c 250 c according to the literature review of this research there is no reported study which involves measuring the absolute groundwater temperature by 18o fractionation in confined aquifer system when there is no phase change involved but only temperature gradient exists current research is exclusively focused on this research gap and trying to bridge the gap in the field of stable isotope hydrogeology with this small contribution 2 internal heat of earth and groundwater flow cooling history of earth started just after formation of solar system through millions of years of cooling earth has reached its life sustainable thermal stability the outer part of the earth which is formally known as crust has cooled enough to get its rigid configuration but interior of the earth is still hot enough to carry molten rock material for the purpose of hydrogeology and this research we need not to be worried about thermal processes operating at mantle or core but need to have very good understanding of thermal zonation of upper crust the two main sources of conduction of heat to the earth s crust are heat flowing at the base of the lithosphere from the deeper mantle and radiogenic heat production in the crust main source of heat at shallow crustal level is radiogenic heat produced due to decay of radionuclides of radioactive minerals present in the crust radiogenic source of heat is due to radioactive decay of u th and 40k heat generated by long lived radioactive isotopes of above mentioned elements has an important role on earth s internal heat budget as going deep at shallow crustal level as discussed earlier for this research we will only focus on radiogenic heat flow in the shallow continental lithosphere ignoring the mantle heat flux average composition of continental crust is of granodiorite under granitoid family rocks one of the most important constituents of granodiorite is orthoclase and plagioclase feldspar with quartz orthoclase feldspar contains 40k and plagioclase feldspar contains u and th lowrie 2007 p 228 rybach 1976 1988 for any rock of granitic family total amount of radioactive heat production can be estimated by following equation 1 lowrie 2007 p 228 1 qr 95 2 cu 25 6 cth 0 00348 c40 k amount of radiogenic heat production due to distribution of radioactive minerals in crustal material when qr total radioactive heat cu cth and c40 k are contribution of u th 40k towards the process lowrie 2007 p 228 according to turner and verhoogen 2004 p 436 average geothermal gradient of earth is approximately 30 c km the same value has been reported by lowrie 2007 p 225 for undisturbed crustal material this geothermal gradient is not constant throughout the globe geothermal gradient may be significantly high near active mid oceanic spreading center subduction zones or strike slip boundaries but significantly as low as 7 c km in nearby deep oceanic tranches best 2003 p 5 the process of thermal conduction due to normal geothermal gradient can be best understood by fourier s law which is described by equation 2 2 h grad t fourier s law of thermal conduction when h heat flux t temperature proportionality constant negative sign of the equation denotes that heat will flow from higher temperature to lower temperature domenico et al 1997 p 192 2 1 groundwater response to normal geothermal gradient for this research earth s internal heat and its influence on groundwater flow is very important as discussed earlier temperature increases as we go down the crust due to geothermal gradient therefore this increment of temperature with depth which formally known as geothermal gradient has influence on groundwater flow for an inclined confined aquifer there will be increment in temperature moving down dip as shown in fig 1 however groundwater flow is of newtonian type but this temperature gradient has huge influence on another differential movement by thermal convection in simple words since a b c in terms of temperature there will be thermal convection of groundwater from higher to lower temperature up dip as shown in fig 1 since moving down dip temperature is increasing hot water of deeper part will try to come up dip displacing the cold water resulting in a unicellular laminar flow this convection occurred due to density difference of water due to temperature gradient is called free convection domenico et al 1997 p 207 considering a force balance on a fluid in a gravitational field for hydrostatic equilibrium following equation should hold good as described by equation 3 wood et al 1982 3 ρ x g 0 force balance equation of a fluid in a gravitational field when ρ density gradient due to temperature gradient g local gravity vector onset of free convection in naturally occurring porous media can be defined by a dimensionless parameter rayleigh number ra which can be defined as follows by equation 4 considering geothermal gradient of 25 c km wood et al 1982 4 ra k g σ ρ c t h δ t γ λ equation of rayleigh number when k permeability of medium g acceleration due to gravity σ volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid ρc t volumetric heat capacity of fluid h thickness of the porous layer δt temperature difference across the layer γ kinematic viscosity of the fluid λ effective thermal conductivity of the fluid filled medium the rayleigh number expresses the transport of energy by free convection onset of free convection in porous media occurs at rayleigh number approximately 4π2 that is ra ra c 40 when ra c is the critical number for onset of free convection wood et al 1982 vicinity of this critical number free convection of groundwater will onset due to density gradient as described in fig 1 for a dipping stratum of dip angle θ ra c needs to be multiplied with cos θ to accommodate changed orientation of gravity relative to the stratum 2 2 expected isotopic response to free thermal convection fundamental proposition of this research is for a gently dipping dip amount 15 confined aquifer and rayleigh number very close to 40 there will be a free laminar convection due to temperature dependent density gradient imposed by incremental geothermal heat down dip fractionation of stable isotope is dependent on energy level of isotopes at lower temperature heavy isotopes are more preferred to concentrate where the separation of energy levels between light and heavy isotope bond is greater since water in the confined aquifer is in equilibrium with ambient geothermal gradient therefore stable isotope of water both δ18o and δ2h will fractionate accordingly with temperature gradient in this stable isotope fractionation process of water there is no breaking of chemical bond involved and different isotopes of water will tend to equilibrate according to their thermal stability regimes with response to corresponding vibrational frequency and corresponding bond strength therefore we can consider this temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation process as equilibrium isotope fractionation from spectroscopic data vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 193 cm 1 whereas 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 for h h the vibrational frequency is 4401 213 cm 1 and h 2h vibrational frequency is 3813 15 cm 1 huber et al 1979 vibrational frequency decreases with increasing bond strength considering above mentioned analogy and the process of temperature dependent equilibrium stable isotope fractionation process and its response to a confined aquifer system the heavier isotope will concentrate at lower temperature regime when there is a temperature gradient in the system therefore it is likely that for a confined aquifer as described in fig 1 as moving down dip absolute abundance of 18o will decrease 3 the deterministic analytical model stable isotope fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen of liquid water system due to imposed thermal gradient and no phase change can be conceptualized as thermal diffusion process significant work has been done in laboratory experimental condition to separate heavy water from water isotope mixture considering the process of thermal diffusion bebbington et al 1959 murphy 1955 yeh and yang 1984 yeh 2009 therefore the derivation of proposed deterministic model starts from fick s law of diffusion obeying fourier s law of thermal conduction 3 1 conceptual model behind every modeling work there is a conceptual model to understand the process of free unicellular laminar convection of groundwater in a porous media let us consider fig 2 temperature is increasing down dip therefore there will be temperature dependent density gradient d when d2 d1 less dense high temperature d1 water will tend to move up where as more dense low temperature d2 water will tend to sink down this will onset the free unicellular laminar convection of groundwater flow marked by the rayleigh number ra c less than but very close to 40 which has been described by equation 4 again considering fig 2 we can divide the aquifer into infinitesimal equal length xn compartments depending on temperature dependent density for fig 2 x1 x2 xn when x 0 each compartment will have definite temperature and depending on temperature different stable isotope concentration in this temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation process therefore it is expected that 18o 18o ratio will decrease down dip since temperature is increasing 3 2 assumptions and boundary conditions considering fig 2 the boundaries of the natural porous media have been assumed impermeable isotopic fractionation of soil gases by diffusion is reported severinghaus et al 1996 for unconfined aquifer system however the scenario is not applicable to the modeling domain of this research considering impermeable confined aquifer boundary farther the aquifer is subdivided to infinitesimal compartments x1 x2 xn the boundaries of individual compartments are isothermal but considering the finite length of the aquifer temperature is increasing down dip the porous media has high permeability and it is homogenous and isotropic having hydraulic conductivity structure and diffusive property same in all directions putting the conceptual model to the scenario of a gently dipping confined aquifer it is assumed that the area of recharge is very distal and water within the aquifer is in thermal equilibrium with surrounding having negligible or zero effect of pumping therefore we are assuming a steady state aquifer condition 3 3 analytical model diffusion is a process by which matter is transported from one part of the system to another because of random molecular motion and concentration gradient as described the effort of separation of heavy water from water isotope mixture has been done considering it as thermal diffusion bebbington et al 1959 murphy 1955 yeh and yang 1984 yeh 2009 therefore the best way to understand the temperature dependent fractionation of 18o in liquid water system with response to temperature gradient starts with understanding of fick s law of diffusion crank 1993 which is described by equation 5 5 f d c fick s law of diffusion when f material flux g cm d diffusion coefficient cm2 s and c spatial gradient in concentration negative sign in the above equation signifies that the transport is in the direction of decreasing concentration criss 1999 p 166 if we restrict the above equation for only one dimensional transport then the above equation simplifies to following which is described by equation 6 6 f d c x one dimensional approximation of fick s law of diffusion for this research we are assuming a steady state aquifer condition and thermal flux therefore we do not need to apply laplacian operator 2 on fick s law of diffusion to estimate divergence of the flux through time with respect to concentration in the reference volume now for equation 6 we will replace the variables of one dimensional frick s law of diffusion to fit it in our modeling domain and scenario in frick s law of diffusion the negative sign denotes diffusion of mass from higher concentration to lower concentration in our modeling scenario particularly for the initial condition the distribution of all isotopomers of water are homogeneously distributed before imposing the thermal gradient therefore with this analogy we can ignore the negative sign of frick s law of diffusion for our modeling scenario now let us replace f by i when i is heavy isotope concentration c can be replaced by c when c is infinitesimal change of concentration of diffusing heavy isotope i is a function of c now only problem with replacing x by t when t is temperature is in the original fick s law x is a vector quantity and t which is temperature is a scalar quantity we can overcome this challenge conceptually by means of fig 3 at points a b c as we are going down dip temperature is increasing alternately we can assume temperature is increasing along x axis therefore with small increment of x in positive direction t will also increase accordingly now we can substitute x by t considering d which is diffusion constant we can substitute it by absolute abundance of 18o 2005 2 0 45 ppm in vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water craig 1961a b baertschi 1976 o neil 1986 we can use the notation of i v s m o w for replacing d justification behind replacing the diffusivity constant of frick s law of diffusion by absolute abundance of 18o in vsmow which is also a constant number is that latter it will be demonstrated how temperature dependent 18o fractionation could be used as geo thermometer with respect to 18o absolute abundance of vsmow and corresponding benchmark temperature of 25 c after manipulation fick s law of diffusion in one dimensional transport for stable isotope fractionation due to thermal diffusion equation 6 becomes i i vsmow c t separating the variables in the above equation it reduces to t i vsmow c i taking the integral t i vsmow c i solving it ivsmow ln i t k when k integral constant rearranging the constant the above equation can be written as equation 7 7 ivsmow ln i k t when k k initial expression of temperature with isotope concentration it is a common practice in stable isotope geochemistry to express concentration of desired heavy isotope in ratio with reference to some benchmark for the above mentioned equation we are assuming absolute concentration of 18o in ppm of vsmow as benchmark therefore we can replace i by i i vsmow for the value of k we can put the absolute value of i vsmow since it is a constant therefore the above mentioned equation 7 becomes as following equation 8 8 ivsmow ln i ivsmow ivsmow t temperature and isotope concentration as vsmow standard in simple words the above mentioned equation 8 tells us that with change in temperature how the heavy stable isotope will fractionate in absolute value ppm with respect to the benchmark which is vsmow and for 18o the reported absolute abundance is 2005 2 0 45 ppm since the definition of vsmow do not include any associated temperature with it the reference of vsmow of equation 8 needs to be replaced by vpdb vienna standard pee dee belemnite supplementary a which includes 25 c benchmark temperature of ocean water at the time of precipitation coplen et al 1983 clark and fritz 1997 p 11 now we can rewrite equation 8 replacing vsmow by vpdb as described by equation 9 9 ivpdb ln i ivpdb ivpdb t temperature and isotope concentration as vpdb standard 4 estimation of groundwater temperature equation 9 is the complete mathematical expression of the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research for estimation of absolute groundwater temperature for any reported value of δ18o in vsmow standard for any water isotope analysis we can convert the standard from vsmow to vpdb after that considering the basic equation of δ we can calculate absolute abundance of 18o in ppm by equation 10 10 δ x 1000 x r std 1 calculation of 18o absolute abundance in ppm from reported δ value by isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms or laser water isotope analyzer supplementary data b when δ x is the value reported in per mill from isotope analysis r std refers to the standard for this research it is vpdb with absolute abundance of 18o 2067 1 2 1 ppm at 25 c and x is the ratio of 18o 18o for any water sample analysis now in field or in laboratory by physically simulating a gently dipping confined aquifer system dip amount 15 with imposed thermal gradient the temperature of the water sample can be noted down at the time of taking the sample for isotope analysis after solving equation 10 we can get a value of 18o in ppm corresponding to that temperature we can name it experimentally derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for a corresponding temperature now for solving equation 9 the value of 18o in ppm that we got by solving equation 10 we can put the value in the place of i therefore for equation 9 all the parameters of left hand side are known hence the left hand side of equation 9 will boil down to a number of 18o absolute abundance in ppm which will correspond to the recorded temperature of water sample which was considered for isotopic analysis we can name it model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for that corresponding temperature in the definition of vpdb the temperature benchmark associated with it was 25 c reported value of 18o 18o for vpdb is 2067 1 2 1 x 10 6 urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner et al 2001 considering 25 c as benchmark temperature we can assume absolute abundance of 18o in vpdb is 2067 1 2 1 ppm at that temperature here one clarification is that changing the reference from vsmow to vpdb will not change absolute abundance of 18o in ppm in the water sample this conversion only needs to put a benchmark temperature in absolute scale which is 25 c in the proposed deterministic analytical model in equation 9 for the expression i i vpdb term there are three possible outcomes the ratio will be either greater than 1 or less than 1 or equal to 1 taking under consideration of three possible outcomes if i i vpdb is greater than 1 i i vpdb 1 then ln i i vpdb is a positive fraction which will give a number of absolute abundance of 18o greater than the benchmark of 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature lower than 25 c if i i vpdb is less than 1 i i vpdb 1 then ln i i vpdb is a negative fraction which will give a number of absolute abundance of 18o lesser than the benchmark of 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature higher than 25 c considering the last scenario if the expression i i vpdb is equal to 1 i i vpdb 1 then absolute abundance of 18o will be 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature equal to 25 c since we are considering the benchmark temperature of 25 c with absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 2 0 45 ppm therefore we can demarcate this benchmark as reference water now we can get a number in terms of 18o absolute abundance in ppm corresponding to a particular temperature t with reference to the benchmark temperature of 25 c the 18o geothermometer will work in such a way that how much the water is warmer or cooler in absolute temperature scale with respect to the benchmark temperature of 25 c while solving the model in spreadsheet computational environment some exciting findings have been observed to validate the proposed model in this research published δ18o data of groundwater by criss et al 1995 from sacramento valley california is considered table 1 represents the δ18o values published by criss et al 1995 of different geological age from the data furnished in table 1 it is evident that meteoric water and holocene groundwater have same kind of isotopic signature in terms of δ18o value probably due to frequent recharge but considering pleistocene and holocene groundwater δ18o values are significantly different we can assume pleistocene groundwater in the formation is deep seeded than holocene groundwater since it is geologically older therefore pleistocene groundwater is likely to be warmer than holocene groundwater due to incremental geothermal heat flood plain groundwater can be considered geologically youngest and coldest table 2 summarizes experimentally derived 18o value in ppm of flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature as proposed by equation 10 data furnished in table 2 surely depicts a decreasing 18o absolute abundance in ppm for geologically older and likely to be warmer water this trend satisfies the basic postulation of this research now we are trying to get the 18o concentration in ppm for the same values of δ18o for flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater from the deterministic model as described by equation 9 table 3 summarizes systematic solution in spreadsheet computational environment of equation 10 by comparing tables 2 and 3 what we can observe that 18o concentration in ppm for flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater experimentally derived and model derived 18o concentration in ppm are extremely close to each other in fact within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance in vpdb which is 2 1 ppm however pronounced fractionation of 18o and 2h in meteoric precipitation is very much reported reyleigh 1902 for storm events the common observation is that as moist air mass is losing water vapor by the process of condensation and precipitation the atmospheric water vapor is continuously depleted in heavier isotope that is 18o and 2h therefore there is a chance of enrichment of 18o for recharge water of a confined aquifer now considering a prolonged period like pleistocene or holocene there will be a complete mixing of recharge water and aquifer storage water and stable isotopes will be stratified by its preferential temperature regime as per normal geothermal gradient this process of mixing and stable isotopic homogenization will lead to initial isotopic concentration of the aquifer water close to the isotopic abundance of vsmow since it is isotopically heaviest of its kind in liquid water system that is another reason why diffusion constant in fick s law in equation 6 is replaced by 18o absolute abundance of vsmow therefore it can be conclusive that the analytical deterministic model proposed in this research describes and satisfies the physical process of 18o fractionation in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient 5 summary the proposed deterministic analytical model in this research starts with a theoretical model of subsurface fluid convection and mass transfer due to incremental geothermal heat considering 25 c km geothermal gradient proposed by wood et al 1982 in their paper wood et al 1982 derived different convection models of subsurface fluid flow depending on different heat flux and geometry dip of the stratum they justified their different thermal convection models of subsurface fluid flow for different rayleigh numbers ra c rayleigh number is a critical value ra c which demarcates onset of different free thermal convection patterns of subsurface fluid two basic parameters that generate different thermal convection patterns in subsurface fluid are differential heat budget governed by rayleigh number ra c and geometric orientation of the stratum dip while establishing their different subsurface thermal fluid convection models wood et al 1982 proposed that onset of thermal convection in subsurface fluid due to incremental heat budget down dip resulting in density difference may take long years to generate in any geological setting therefore they considered thermal convection of subsurface fluid is a very slow process and hydraulic conductivity of the porous media may be an influential parameter to govern the process considering one of their subsurface fluid convection model when dip of the strata is less than 15 dip amount 15 and ra c is less than but very close to 40 will onset a density difference of subsurface fluid leading to a free unicellular laminar convection due to incremental heat budget down dip superimposing the above mentioned thermal convection model of subsurface fluid transport to a gently dipping confined aquifer system dip amount 15 a free unicellular laminar convection due to density difference in the aquifer will onset due to incremental geothermal heat down dip the dip amount of the strata 15 and the r ac very close to 40 are two most important parameters to make up dip free unicellular laminar convection to happen in the confined aquifer overcoming the gravitational force which will eventually lead to isotopic stratification according to the preferential temperature regime for higher rayleigh number particularly for the higher value of parameter δ t at numerator of equation 4 there will be rapid thermal convection in the aquifer which will destroy the molecular diffusion of the regime resulting no isotopic stratification whereas 15 dip amount of the strata is the minimum dip angle where free unicellular laminar convection will initiate up dip overcoming the gravitational attraction due to normal geothermal gradient for the confined aquifer under consideration we can compartmentalize the aquifer to infinitesimally small thermal compartments with increasing temperature down dip boundary of the aquifer can be considered impermeable isotopic fractionation of soil gases by diffusion is reported severinghaus et al 1996 but this is not applicable to our modeling scenario since we are assuming impermeable confined aquifer boundary and the deterministic model is not applicable to unconfined aquifer conceptual model of this research assumes that for a continuous gently dipping confined aquifer these infinitesimally small thermal compartments will differentiate oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes of water molecule depending on their corresponding thermal stability regimes vibrational frequency of a molecule decreases with increasing bond strength therefore heavier isotope will concentrate at lower temperature regime with agreement of published spectroscopic data of 16o 16o and 16o 18o vibrational frequency which satisfies the above mentioned statement it is likely that for a gently dipping aquifer absolute abundance of 18o in ppm will decrease down dip as temperature is increasing considering a homogeneous isotropic highly conductive aquifer material with structure and diffusive property same in all directions and impermeable aquifer boundary the derivation of deterministic analytical model starts with fick s law of thermal diffusion since stable isotope separation process in liquid water has been described as thermal diffusion process after one dimensional approximation of fick s law of diffusion and manipulating the variables and solving it analytically the differential equation boils down to a mathematical expression corresponds to 18o absolute abundance in ppm for a particular temperature in more generalized way for any gently dipping confined aquifer system regional groundwater flow will be definitely gravity driven advection but in micro scale different isotopomers of water will also fractionate depending upon its thermal stability regime due to incremental geothermal heat budget down dip this physical fractionation of different isotopomers of water can be conceptualized as thermal diffusion process mobilized by unicellular laminar free thermal convection of water to validate the model in real life scenario groundwater data of δ18o value of different geological age determined by inorganic 14c dating method from sacramento valley california published by criss et al 1995 has been considered in the literature corresponding temperatures of groundwater samples of different geological age taken under consideration for isotopic analysis for δ18o is not reported but considering the groundwater model map imposed on regional geology published in the literature if we select flood plain groundwater holocene groundwater and pleistocene groundwater what we can observe that a steady decline of δ18o and 18o absolute abundance in ppm we can consider flood plain water is geologically youngest followed by holocene and pleistocene groundwater as per their 14c date reported by criss et al 1995 however the 14c dating of groundwater from dissolved inorganic carbon is ambiguous and debated in scientific literature but the above assumptions are quite realistic and justified therefore it is likely that pleistocene groundwater is at deeper depth with higher temperature followed by holocene groundwater then flood plain groundwater a continuous warmer trend of groundwater has been observed as it is getting geologically older with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c in terms of δ18o value and the absolute concentration 18o in ppm this satisfies the basic postulation of this research not only that if we consider δ18o is equals to zero at 25 c and which we named as reference water experimentally derived absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 12 ppm whereas model derived 18o absolute abundance is 2004 17 ppm considering flood plain holocene and pleistocene groundwater and their corresponding 18o absolute abundance in ppm experimentally derived and model derived numbers are very close to each other and within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance of vpdb which is 2 1 ppm since experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm are quite similar to each other it can be assumed that the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research is describing the physical principal of 18o isotope fractionation process of liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient this 18o fractionation is attributed to free unicellular laminar thermal subsurface fluid convection model proposed by wood et al 1982 along with thermal stratification of different isotopomers of water molecule by thermal diffusion process the analytical model proposed in this research for fractionation of 18o in liquid water system exclusively identifies heat as the primary cause of fractionation considering the simple analogy that heavier isotope will concentrate in the colder regime grew et al 1952 however for stable isotopic fractionation of gas in polar ice caps along with temperature gravity has also been considered as one of the important factor for the process of fractionation of stable isotope craig et al 1988 however for a liquid inter molecular attraction is much more than for gas therefore for our modeling scenario that is different isotopomers of water molecule gravity settling due to molecular mass difference can be neglected this statement can be justified by no isotopic stratification of water molecule 2h18o at philippine trench and lake baikal as reported by dansgaard 1960 6 conclusions with concluding remarks no effort has so far been made to estimate absolute temperature of groundwater by 18o fractionation however significant effort has been made to separate heavy water from water isotope mixture applying the principal of thermal diffusion and temperature gradient proposed deterministic analytical model give the direction in the field of stable isotope geochemistry to estimate absolute groundwater temperature by 18o fractionation with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for water samples of different geological age from sacramento valley california are quite similar to each other and within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance of vpdb which is 2 1 ppm temperature data of different groundwater samples taken under consideration for δ18o analysis of different geological age were not reported for the study area of sacramento valley california therefore it could not be possible to demarcate temperature expression corresponding to individual water sample δ18o analysis but an increasing temperature trend of groundwater is evident in terms of δ18o value and 18o absolute abundance in ppm with increasing geological age with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature this trend is consistent with respect to groundwater model map and regional geology of sacramento valley california and satisfies the basic proposition of the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research this research also identifies that it is not the gravity but heat is the primary cause for isotopic stratification in liquid water system this research may be helpful as indirect evidence of exploration of radioactive minerals if groundwater temperature is abnormally high considering no evidence of igneous pluton emplacement in near past or no geothermal spring nearby this extra heat can be attributed to radiogenic heat due to radioactive mineral enrichment for hydrocarbon exploration and production this research will be helpful to estimate formation fluid temperature this research may help to detect concentrated heavy water for deuterium 2h which is required in atomic nuclear fusion reactors in atomic power generating stations appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article a the definition of vsmow do not have any temperature associated with it at the time of derivation of definition of vpdb belemnitella americana from cretaceous pee dee formation in south carolina usa which is international reference material of 18o 16o ratio in marine carbonate it was assumed that the internal calcite structure of the fossil was precipitated from sea water with δ18o very close to vsmow at 25 c coplen et al 1983 clark 1997 p 11 the relation between δ18o of vsmow and vpdb is liner and described by following equation1 sharp 2007 p 29 δ o vsmow 18 1 03091 δ o vpdb 18 30 91 equation 1 linear relationship of vsmow and vpdb since we are dealing with water isotope whatever analytical apparatus we are using may be isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms or laser water isotope analyzer reported value of oxygen isotope will be in vsmow standard that reported value in vsmow standard can be converted to vpdb standard according to equation 1 b for isotopic analysis of liquid water laser water isotope analyzer is preferred laser water isotope analyzer takes 1 9 1 8 μml of water sample in a single suction and evaporate it instantaneously to put it into the gas cell or cavity there symmetrically tuned laser of each 1 hz cycle is pass to generate absorption spectra in near ir spectral range for different isotopologue e g 2ho hdo of water present in the sample since the absorption line intensity or area under the pick is linearly dependent on concentration of different isotopologue of water present in the cavity therefore 18o 16o ratio can be calculated accurately and very precisely the reason behind preference of laser water isotope analyzer with respect to irms for analysis is that laser water isotope analyzer in the process of evaporation rejects any salt present in the water and reports 18o 16o ratio exclusive to water

12220,it is long reported that the fractionation of different stable isotopes of same element is temperature dependent therefore it is a long practice to use stable isotopes as paleo thermometer to understand temperature dependent physical processes on earth extending the application stable isotopes have also been used to understand different physical processes operating in hydrosphere particularly where there is physical phase change of water ice vapor system like understanding global precipitation pattern water shade response and hydrograph separation etcetera best interest of this research is to understand a very small part of hydrologic cycle which is groundwater and its isotopic response with imposed natural geothermal gradient the proposed geothermometer is exclusive to confined aquifer system and not applicable to unconfined aquifers fundamental proposition of this research is for a gently dipping 15 confined aquifer and rayleigh number ra c very close to but less than 40 will onset free unicellular laminar convection due to temperature dependent density gradient imposed by down dip incremental geothermal heat both 18o and 2h will respond in confined aquifer system with respect to this geothermal heat obeying the equilibrium isotope fractionation model depending on 16o 16o and 16o 18o vibrational frequency 18o will tend to concentrate at lower temperature region up dip while 16o will tend to concentrate at higher temperature region down dip depending on this basic postulation the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research can estimate

earth science stable isotope has huge implication in deep understanding of different physical processes operating on earth whereas radioisotope is the tool to date absolute ages of rocks in earth science stable isotope fractionation has been used for in depth understanding of process of crystallization of igneous rocks and its geochemistry friedman et al 1977 chiba et al 1989 water rock interaction taylor 1977 and hydrothermal system craig 1966 gregory et al 1981 1989 criss et al 1983 1986 criss et al 1985 stable isotope fractionation is a temperature dependent process however gravity driven stable isotope fractionation for gas in polar region is also reported craig et al 1988 water ice vapor system best exemplifies the temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation pattern in terms of oxygen 18o 18o and hydrogen h 2h isotope ratios souchez et al 2000 christopher et al 2003 cappa et al 2005 deshpande et al 2013 casado et al 2016 oxygen and hydrogen ratios act as most conservative tracers in the hydrologic cycle intrinsic to water molecule which explicate the origin of the water phase transition and transportation of water in the field of hydrology stable isotopes have huge implications stable isotope has been used to estimate aquifer recharge and seasonality effect on recharge darling et al 1988 and separating base flow from overland flow in hydrograph separation criss 1997 maurya et al 2011 ahluwalia et al 2013 stable isotope fractionation has been used to understand the process of global precipitation pattern also craig 1961a kumar et al 2010 rai et al 2014 2016 since variation of δ18o and δ2h has geographic influence which includes temperature altitude latitude and longitude effect in terms of precipitation pattern therefore isotopic signature of groundwater can provide unique information in terms of its sources and flow paths strong linear variation of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation pattern which has able to establish empirical meteoric water line or mwl craig 1961a b can distinguish water of meteoric origin from any other parentage since stable isotope fractionation is used as geothermometer significant work has been done in the field of earth science in terms of fundamental understanding of the physical processes operating on earth particularly understanding of paleo environment and paleo temperature hydrogen and oxygen isotopes have been successfully used to determine if paleo temperature was relatively warmer or cooler than present epstein et al 1953 erez at al 1983 bemis et al 1988 mcguffie et al 2005 empirical chemical geothermometers has been developed to estimate temperature of geothermal system fournier 1979 fournier 1982 fouillac et al 1981 arnorsson et al 1985 giggenbach et al 1988 goff et al 2000 these reported chemical geothermometers are restricted to high temperature regime of geothermal system in and around 100 c 250 c according to the literature review of this research there is no reported study which involves measuring the absolute groundwater temperature by 18o fractionation in confined aquifer system when there is no phase change involved but only temperature gradient exists current research is exclusively focused on this research gap and trying to bridge the gap in the field of stable isotope hydrogeology with this small contribution 2 internal heat of earth and groundwater flow cooling history of earth started just after formation of solar system through millions of years of cooling earth has reached its life sustainable thermal stability the outer part of the earth which is formally known as crust has cooled enough to get its rigid configuration but interior of the earth is still hot enough to carry molten rock material for the purpose of hydrogeology and this research we need not to be worried about thermal processes operating at mantle or core but need to have very good understanding of thermal zonation of upper crust the two main sources of conduction of heat to the earth s crust are heat flowing at the base of the lithosphere from the deeper mantle and radiogenic heat production in the crust main source of heat at shallow crustal level is radiogenic heat produced due to decay of radionuclides of radioactive minerals present in the crust radiogenic source of heat is due to radioactive decay of u th and 40k heat generated by long lived radioactive isotopes of above mentioned elements has an important role on earth s internal heat budget as going deep at shallow crustal level as discussed earlier for this research we will only focus on radiogenic heat flow in the shallow continental lithosphere ignoring the mantle heat flux average composition of continental crust is of granodiorite under granitoid family rocks one of the most important constituents of granodiorite is orthoclase and plagioclase feldspar with quartz orthoclase feldspar contains 40k and plagioclase feldspar contains u and th lowrie 2007 p 228 rybach 1976 1988 for any rock of granitic family total amount of radioactive heat production can be estimated by following equation 1 lowrie 2007 p 228 1 qr 95 2 cu 25 6 cth 0 00348 c40 k amount of radiogenic heat production due to distribution of radioactive minerals in crustal material when qr total radioactive heat cu cth and c40 k are contribution of u th 40k towards the process lowrie 2007 p 228 according to turner and verhoogen 2004 p 436 average geothermal gradient of earth is approximately 30 c km the same value has been reported by lowrie 2007 p 225 for undisturbed crustal material this geothermal gradient is not constant throughout the globe geothermal gradient may be significantly high near active mid oceanic spreading center subduction zones or strike slip boundaries but significantly as low as 7 c km in nearby deep oceanic tranches best 2003 p 5 the process of thermal conduction due to normal geothermal gradient can be best understood by fourier s law which is described by equation 2 2 h grad t fourier s law of thermal conduction when h heat flux t temperature proportionality constant negative sign of the equation denotes that heat will flow from higher temperature to lower temperature domenico et al 1997 p 192 2 1 groundwater response to normal geothermal gradient for this research earth s internal heat and its influence on groundwater flow is very important as discussed earlier temperature increases as we go down the crust due to geothermal gradient therefore this increment of temperature with depth which formally known as geothermal gradient has influence on groundwater flow for an inclined confined aquifer there will be increment in temperature moving down dip as shown in fig 1 however groundwater flow is of newtonian type but this temperature gradient has huge influence on another differential movement by thermal convection in simple words since a b c in terms of temperature there will be thermal convection of groundwater from higher to lower temperature up dip as shown in fig 1 since moving down dip temperature is increasing hot water of deeper part will try to come up dip displacing the cold water resulting in a unicellular laminar flow this convection occurred due to density difference of water due to temperature gradient is called free convection domenico et al 1997 p 207 considering a force balance on a fluid in a gravitational field for hydrostatic equilibrium following equation should hold good as described by equation 3 wood et al 1982 3 ρ x g 0 force balance equation of a fluid in a gravitational field when ρ density gradient due to temperature gradient g local gravity vector onset of free convection in naturally occurring porous media can be defined by a dimensionless parameter rayleigh number ra which can be defined as follows by equation 4 considering geothermal gradient of 25 c km wood et al 1982 4 ra k g σ ρ c t h δ t γ λ equation of rayleigh number when k permeability of medium g acceleration due to gravity σ volumetric thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid ρc t volumetric heat capacity of fluid h thickness of the porous layer δt temperature difference across the layer γ kinematic viscosity of the fluid λ effective thermal conductivity of the fluid filled medium the rayleigh number expresses the transport of energy by free convection onset of free convection in porous media occurs at rayleigh number approximately 4π2 that is ra ra c 40 when ra c is the critical number for onset of free convection wood et al 1982 vicinity of this critical number free convection of groundwater will onset due to density gradient as described in fig 1 for a dipping stratum of dip angle θ ra c needs to be multiplied with cos θ to accommodate changed orientation of gravity relative to the stratum 2 2 expected isotopic response to free thermal convection fundamental proposition of this research is for a gently dipping dip amount 15 confined aquifer and rayleigh number very close to 40 there will be a free laminar convection due to temperature dependent density gradient imposed by incremental geothermal heat down dip fractionation of stable isotope is dependent on energy level of isotopes at lower temperature heavy isotopes are more preferred to concentrate where the separation of energy levels between light and heavy isotope bond is greater since water in the confined aquifer is in equilibrium with ambient geothermal gradient therefore stable isotope of water both δ18o and δ2h will fractionate accordingly with temperature gradient in this stable isotope fractionation process of water there is no breaking of chemical bond involved and different isotopes of water will tend to equilibrate according to their thermal stability regimes with response to corresponding vibrational frequency and corresponding bond strength therefore we can consider this temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation process as equilibrium isotope fractionation from spectroscopic data vibrational frequency of 16o 16o is 1580 193 cm 1 whereas 16o 18o is 1535 57 cm 1 for h h the vibrational frequency is 4401 213 cm 1 and h 2h vibrational frequency is 3813 15 cm 1 huber et al 1979 vibrational frequency decreases with increasing bond strength considering above mentioned analogy and the process of temperature dependent equilibrium stable isotope fractionation process and its response to a confined aquifer system the heavier isotope will concentrate at lower temperature regime when there is a temperature gradient in the system therefore it is likely that for a confined aquifer as described in fig 1 as moving down dip absolute abundance of 18o will decrease 3 the deterministic analytical model stable isotope fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen of liquid water system due to imposed thermal gradient and no phase change can be conceptualized as thermal diffusion process significant work has been done in laboratory experimental condition to separate heavy water from water isotope mixture considering the process of thermal diffusion bebbington et al 1959 murphy 1955 yeh and yang 1984 yeh 2009 therefore the derivation of proposed deterministic model starts from fick s law of diffusion obeying fourier s law of thermal conduction 3 1 conceptual model behind every modeling work there is a conceptual model to understand the process of free unicellular laminar convection of groundwater in a porous media let us consider fig 2 temperature is increasing down dip therefore there will be temperature dependent density gradient d when d2 d1 less dense high temperature d1 water will tend to move up where as more dense low temperature d2 water will tend to sink down this will onset the free unicellular laminar convection of groundwater flow marked by the rayleigh number ra c less than but very close to 40 which has been described by equation 4 again considering fig 2 we can divide the aquifer into infinitesimal equal length xn compartments depending on temperature dependent density for fig 2 x1 x2 xn when x 0 each compartment will have definite temperature and depending on temperature different stable isotope concentration in this temperature dependent stable isotope fractionation process therefore it is expected that 18o 18o ratio will decrease down dip since temperature is increasing 3 2 assumptions and boundary conditions considering fig 2 the boundaries of the natural porous media have been assumed impermeable isotopic fractionation of soil gases by diffusion is reported severinghaus et al 1996 for unconfined aquifer system however the scenario is not applicable to the modeling domain of this research considering impermeable confined aquifer boundary farther the aquifer is subdivided to infinitesimal compartments x1 x2 xn the boundaries of individual compartments are isothermal but considering the finite length of the aquifer temperature is increasing down dip the porous media has high permeability and it is homogenous and isotropic having hydraulic conductivity structure and diffusive property same in all directions putting the conceptual model to the scenario of a gently dipping confined aquifer it is assumed that the area of recharge is very distal and water within the aquifer is in thermal equilibrium with surrounding having negligible or zero effect of pumping therefore we are assuming a steady state aquifer condition 3 3 analytical model diffusion is a process by which matter is transported from one part of the system to another because of random molecular motion and concentration gradient as described the effort of separation of heavy water from water isotope mixture has been done considering it as thermal diffusion bebbington et al 1959 murphy 1955 yeh and yang 1984 yeh 2009 therefore the best way to understand the temperature dependent fractionation of 18o in liquid water system with response to temperature gradient starts with understanding of fick s law of diffusion crank 1993 which is described by equation 5 5 f d c fick s law of diffusion when f material flux g cm d diffusion coefficient cm2 s and c spatial gradient in concentration negative sign in the above equation signifies that the transport is in the direction of decreasing concentration criss 1999 p 166 if we restrict the above equation for only one dimensional transport then the above equation simplifies to following which is described by equation 6 6 f d c x one dimensional approximation of fick s law of diffusion for this research we are assuming a steady state aquifer condition and thermal flux therefore we do not need to apply laplacian operator 2 on fick s law of diffusion to estimate divergence of the flux through time with respect to concentration in the reference volume now for equation 6 we will replace the variables of one dimensional frick s law of diffusion to fit it in our modeling domain and scenario in frick s law of diffusion the negative sign denotes diffusion of mass from higher concentration to lower concentration in our modeling scenario particularly for the initial condition the distribution of all isotopomers of water are homogeneously distributed before imposing the thermal gradient therefore with this analogy we can ignore the negative sign of frick s law of diffusion for our modeling scenario now let us replace f by i when i is heavy isotope concentration c can be replaced by c when c is infinitesimal change of concentration of diffusing heavy isotope i is a function of c now only problem with replacing x by t when t is temperature is in the original fick s law x is a vector quantity and t which is temperature is a scalar quantity we can overcome this challenge conceptually by means of fig 3 at points a b c as we are going down dip temperature is increasing alternately we can assume temperature is increasing along x axis therefore with small increment of x in positive direction t will also increase accordingly now we can substitute x by t considering d which is diffusion constant we can substitute it by absolute abundance of 18o 2005 2 0 45 ppm in vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water craig 1961a b baertschi 1976 o neil 1986 we can use the notation of i v s m o w for replacing d justification behind replacing the diffusivity constant of frick s law of diffusion by absolute abundance of 18o in vsmow which is also a constant number is that latter it will be demonstrated how temperature dependent 18o fractionation could be used as geo thermometer with respect to 18o absolute abundance of vsmow and corresponding benchmark temperature of 25 c after manipulation fick s law of diffusion in one dimensional transport for stable isotope fractionation due to thermal diffusion equation 6 becomes i i vsmow c t separating the variables in the above equation it reduces to t i vsmow c i taking the integral t i vsmow c i solving it ivsmow ln i t k when k integral constant rearranging the constant the above equation can be written as equation 7 7 ivsmow ln i k t when k k initial expression of temperature with isotope concentration it is a common practice in stable isotope geochemistry to express concentration of desired heavy isotope in ratio with reference to some benchmark for the above mentioned equation we are assuming absolute concentration of 18o in ppm of vsmow as benchmark therefore we can replace i by i i vsmow for the value of k we can put the absolute value of i vsmow since it is a constant therefore the above mentioned equation 7 becomes as following equation 8 8 ivsmow ln i ivsmow ivsmow t temperature and isotope concentration as vsmow standard in simple words the above mentioned equation 8 tells us that with change in temperature how the heavy stable isotope will fractionate in absolute value ppm with respect to the benchmark which is vsmow and for 18o the reported absolute abundance is 2005 2 0 45 ppm since the definition of vsmow do not include any associated temperature with it the reference of vsmow of equation 8 needs to be replaced by vpdb vienna standard pee dee belemnite supplementary a which includes 25 c benchmark temperature of ocean water at the time of precipitation coplen et al 1983 clark and fritz 1997 p 11 now we can rewrite equation 8 replacing vsmow by vpdb as described by equation 9 9 ivpdb ln i ivpdb ivpdb t temperature and isotope concentration as vpdb standard 4 estimation of groundwater temperature equation 9 is the complete mathematical expression of the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research for estimation of absolute groundwater temperature for any reported value of δ18o in vsmow standard for any water isotope analysis we can convert the standard from vsmow to vpdb after that considering the basic equation of δ we can calculate absolute abundance of 18o in ppm by equation 10 10 δ x 1000 x r std 1 calculation of 18o absolute abundance in ppm from reported δ value by isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms or laser water isotope analyzer supplementary data b when δ x is the value reported in per mill from isotope analysis r std refers to the standard for this research it is vpdb with absolute abundance of 18o 2067 1 2 1 ppm at 25 c and x is the ratio of 18o 18o for any water sample analysis now in field or in laboratory by physically simulating a gently dipping confined aquifer system dip amount 15 with imposed thermal gradient the temperature of the water sample can be noted down at the time of taking the sample for isotope analysis after solving equation 10 we can get a value of 18o in ppm corresponding to that temperature we can name it experimentally derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for a corresponding temperature now for solving equation 9 the value of 18o in ppm that we got by solving equation 10 we can put the value in the place of i therefore for equation 9 all the parameters of left hand side are known hence the left hand side of equation 9 will boil down to a number of 18o absolute abundance in ppm which will correspond to the recorded temperature of water sample which was considered for isotopic analysis we can name it model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for that corresponding temperature in the definition of vpdb the temperature benchmark associated with it was 25 c reported value of 18o 18o for vpdb is 2067 1 2 1 x 10 6 urey et al 1951 cuna et al 2001 werner et al 2001 considering 25 c as benchmark temperature we can assume absolute abundance of 18o in vpdb is 2067 1 2 1 ppm at that temperature here one clarification is that changing the reference from vsmow to vpdb will not change absolute abundance of 18o in ppm in the water sample this conversion only needs to put a benchmark temperature in absolute scale which is 25 c in the proposed deterministic analytical model in equation 9 for the expression i i vpdb term there are three possible outcomes the ratio will be either greater than 1 or less than 1 or equal to 1 taking under consideration of three possible outcomes if i i vpdb is greater than 1 i i vpdb 1 then ln i i vpdb is a positive fraction which will give a number of absolute abundance of 18o greater than the benchmark of 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature lower than 25 c if i i vpdb is less than 1 i i vpdb 1 then ln i i vpdb is a negative fraction which will give a number of absolute abundance of 18o lesser than the benchmark of 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature higher than 25 c considering the last scenario if the expression i i vpdb is equal to 1 i i vpdb 1 then absolute abundance of 18o will be 2005 2 0 45 ppm it means it will indicate temperature equal to 25 c since we are considering the benchmark temperature of 25 c with absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 2 0 45 ppm therefore we can demarcate this benchmark as reference water now we can get a number in terms of 18o absolute abundance in ppm corresponding to a particular temperature t with reference to the benchmark temperature of 25 c the 18o geothermometer will work in such a way that how much the water is warmer or cooler in absolute temperature scale with respect to the benchmark temperature of 25 c while solving the model in spreadsheet computational environment some exciting findings have been observed to validate the proposed model in this research published δ18o data of groundwater by criss et al 1995 from sacramento valley california is considered table 1 represents the δ18o values published by criss et al 1995 of different geological age from the data furnished in table 1 it is evident that meteoric water and holocene groundwater have same kind of isotopic signature in terms of δ18o value probably due to frequent recharge but considering pleistocene and holocene groundwater δ18o values are significantly different we can assume pleistocene groundwater in the formation is deep seeded than holocene groundwater since it is geologically older therefore pleistocene groundwater is likely to be warmer than holocene groundwater due to incremental geothermal heat flood plain groundwater can be considered geologically youngest and coldest table 2 summarizes experimentally derived 18o value in ppm of flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature as proposed by equation 10 data furnished in table 2 surely depicts a decreasing 18o absolute abundance in ppm for geologically older and likely to be warmer water this trend satisfies the basic postulation of this research now we are trying to get the 18o concentration in ppm for the same values of δ18o for flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater from the deterministic model as described by equation 9 table 3 summarizes systematic solution in spreadsheet computational environment of equation 10 by comparing tables 2 and 3 what we can observe that 18o concentration in ppm for flood plain pleistocene and holocene groundwater experimentally derived and model derived 18o concentration in ppm are extremely close to each other in fact within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance in vpdb which is 2 1 ppm however pronounced fractionation of 18o and 2h in meteoric precipitation is very much reported reyleigh 1902 for storm events the common observation is that as moist air mass is losing water vapor by the process of condensation and precipitation the atmospheric water vapor is continuously depleted in heavier isotope that is 18o and 2h therefore there is a chance of enrichment of 18o for recharge water of a confined aquifer now considering a prolonged period like pleistocene or holocene there will be a complete mixing of recharge water and aquifer storage water and stable isotopes will be stratified by its preferential temperature regime as per normal geothermal gradient this process of mixing and stable isotopic homogenization will lead to initial isotopic concentration of the aquifer water close to the isotopic abundance of vsmow since it is isotopically heaviest of its kind in liquid water system that is another reason why diffusion constant in fick s law in equation 6 is replaced by 18o absolute abundance of vsmow therefore it can be conclusive that the analytical deterministic model proposed in this research describes and satisfies the physical process of 18o fractionation in liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient 5 summary the proposed deterministic analytical model in this research starts with a theoretical model of subsurface fluid convection and mass transfer due to incremental geothermal heat considering 25 c km geothermal gradient proposed by wood et al 1982 in their paper wood et al 1982 derived different convection models of subsurface fluid flow depending on different heat flux and geometry dip of the stratum they justified their different thermal convection models of subsurface fluid flow for different rayleigh numbers ra c rayleigh number is a critical value ra c which demarcates onset of different free thermal convection patterns of subsurface fluid two basic parameters that generate different thermal convection patterns in subsurface fluid are differential heat budget governed by rayleigh number ra c and geometric orientation of the stratum dip while establishing their different subsurface thermal fluid convection models wood et al 1982 proposed that onset of thermal convection in subsurface fluid due to incremental heat budget down dip resulting in density difference may take long years to generate in any geological setting therefore they considered thermal convection of subsurface fluid is a very slow process and hydraulic conductivity of the porous media may be an influential parameter to govern the process considering one of their subsurface fluid convection model when dip of the strata is less than 15 dip amount 15 and ra c is less than but very close to 40 will onset a density difference of subsurface fluid leading to a free unicellular laminar convection due to incremental heat budget down dip superimposing the above mentioned thermal convection model of subsurface fluid transport to a gently dipping confined aquifer system dip amount 15 a free unicellular laminar convection due to density difference in the aquifer will onset due to incremental geothermal heat down dip the dip amount of the strata 15 and the r ac very close to 40 are two most important parameters to make up dip free unicellular laminar convection to happen in the confined aquifer overcoming the gravitational force which will eventually lead to isotopic stratification according to the preferential temperature regime for higher rayleigh number particularly for the higher value of parameter δ t at numerator of equation 4 there will be rapid thermal convection in the aquifer which will destroy the molecular diffusion of the regime resulting no isotopic stratification whereas 15 dip amount of the strata is the minimum dip angle where free unicellular laminar convection will initiate up dip overcoming the gravitational attraction due to normal geothermal gradient for the confined aquifer under consideration we can compartmentalize the aquifer to infinitesimally small thermal compartments with increasing temperature down dip boundary of the aquifer can be considered impermeable isotopic fractionation of soil gases by diffusion is reported severinghaus et al 1996 but this is not applicable to our modeling scenario since we are assuming impermeable confined aquifer boundary and the deterministic model is not applicable to unconfined aquifer conceptual model of this research assumes that for a continuous gently dipping confined aquifer these infinitesimally small thermal compartments will differentiate oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes of water molecule depending on their corresponding thermal stability regimes vibrational frequency of a molecule decreases with increasing bond strength therefore heavier isotope will concentrate at lower temperature regime with agreement of published spectroscopic data of 16o 16o and 16o 18o vibrational frequency which satisfies the above mentioned statement it is likely that for a gently dipping aquifer absolute abundance of 18o in ppm will decrease down dip as temperature is increasing considering a homogeneous isotropic highly conductive aquifer material with structure and diffusive property same in all directions and impermeable aquifer boundary the derivation of deterministic analytical model starts with fick s law of thermal diffusion since stable isotope separation process in liquid water has been described as thermal diffusion process after one dimensional approximation of fick s law of diffusion and manipulating the variables and solving it analytically the differential equation boils down to a mathematical expression corresponds to 18o absolute abundance in ppm for a particular temperature in more generalized way for any gently dipping confined aquifer system regional groundwater flow will be definitely gravity driven advection but in micro scale different isotopomers of water will also fractionate depending upon its thermal stability regime due to incremental geothermal heat budget down dip this physical fractionation of different isotopomers of water can be conceptualized as thermal diffusion process mobilized by unicellular laminar free thermal convection of water to validate the model in real life scenario groundwater data of δ18o value of different geological age determined by inorganic 14c dating method from sacramento valley california published by criss et al 1995 has been considered in the literature corresponding temperatures of groundwater samples of different geological age taken under consideration for isotopic analysis for δ18o is not reported but considering the groundwater model map imposed on regional geology published in the literature if we select flood plain groundwater holocene groundwater and pleistocene groundwater what we can observe that a steady decline of δ18o and 18o absolute abundance in ppm we can consider flood plain water is geologically youngest followed by holocene and pleistocene groundwater as per their 14c date reported by criss et al 1995 however the 14c dating of groundwater from dissolved inorganic carbon is ambiguous and debated in scientific literature but the above assumptions are quite realistic and justified therefore it is likely that pleistocene groundwater is at deeper depth with higher temperature followed by holocene groundwater then flood plain groundwater a continuous warmer trend of groundwater has been observed as it is getting geologically older with reference to benchmark temperature of 25 c in terms of δ18o value and the absolute concentration 18o in ppm this satisfies the basic postulation of this research not only that if we consider δ18o is equals to zero at 25 c and which we named as reference water experimentally derived absolute abundance of 18o is 2005 12 ppm whereas model derived 18o absolute abundance is 2004 17 ppm considering flood plain holocene and pleistocene groundwater and their corresponding 18o absolute abundance in ppm experimentally derived and model derived numbers are very close to each other and within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance of vpdb which is 2 1 ppm since experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm are quite similar to each other it can be assumed that the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research is describing the physical principal of 18o isotope fractionation process of liquid water system with imposed temperature gradient this 18o fractionation is attributed to free unicellular laminar thermal subsurface fluid convection model proposed by wood et al 1982 along with thermal stratification of different isotopomers of water molecule by thermal diffusion process the analytical model proposed in this research for fractionation of 18o in liquid water system exclusively identifies heat as the primary cause of fractionation considering the simple analogy that heavier isotope will concentrate in the colder regime grew et al 1952 however for stable isotopic fractionation of gas in polar ice caps along with temperature gravity has also been considered as one of the important factor for the process of fractionation of stable isotope craig et al 1988 however for a liquid inter molecular attraction is much more than for gas therefore for our modeling scenario that is different isotopomers of water molecule gravity settling due to molecular mass difference can be neglected this statement can be justified by no isotopic stratification of water molecule 2h18o at philippine trench and lake baikal as reported by dansgaard 1960 6 conclusions with concluding remarks no effort has so far been made to estimate absolute temperature of groundwater by 18o fractionation however significant effort has been made to separate heavy water from water isotope mixture applying the principal of thermal diffusion and temperature gradient proposed deterministic analytical model give the direction in the field of stable isotope geochemistry to estimate absolute groundwater temperature by 18o fractionation with reference to 25 c benchmark temperature experimentally derived and model derived 18o absolute abundance in ppm for water samples of different geological age from sacramento valley california are quite similar to each other and within the standard deviation of 18o absolute abundance of vpdb which is 2 1 ppm temperature data of different groundwater samples taken under consideration for δ18o analysis of different geological age were not reported for the study area of sacramento valley california therefore it could not be possible to demarcate temperature expression corresponding to individual water sample δ18o analysis but an increasing temperature trend of groundwater is evident in terms of δ18o value and 18o absolute abundance in ppm with increasing geological age with respect to 25 c benchmark temperature this trend is consistent with respect to groundwater model map and regional geology of sacramento valley california and satisfies the basic proposition of the deterministic analytical model proposed in this research this research also identifies that it is not the gravity but heat is the primary cause for isotopic stratification in liquid water system this research may be helpful as indirect evidence of exploration of radioactive minerals if groundwater temperature is abnormally high considering no evidence of igneous pluton emplacement in near past or no geothermal spring nearby this extra heat can be attributed to radiogenic heat due to radioactive mineral enrichment for hydrocarbon exploration and

12221,in developing countries there is high limitation and irregularity in river flow data recording and a significant number of hydrologic basins are ungauged despite the fact that the estimation of surface and groundwater asset assumes the measurements as a basic concern in resource management and planning understanding baseflow forms specifically as a piece of the total flow of river basins can be utilized as a demonstrative tool to portray hydrologic frameworks and turns into a basic issue of water balance contemplates hence this work seeks to compare baseflow estimates in the abaya chamo lakes basin using baseflow separation algorithms such as river analysis package rap time plot tp and kille k the assessments are then utilized to set up and establish further the associations with multivariate factors such as climate geomorphometric land use cover and aquifer properties indeed an accessible 16 daily river discharge records were therefore used to estimate the value of the baseflow index bfi the estimates from both river analysis package and time plot algorisms are more hydrologically plausible and compared well to each other with a linear correlation coefficient of 0 96 in any case the graphical kille method is somehow underestimated the baseflow yield the estimated value over whole ranges between 0 29 and 0 62 which suggests about 42 of the long term total river flow is a contribution of groundwater discharge furthermore this index was gathered with multivariate s to have a consistent causal explanations as a descriptor of the hydrological framework and have a significant positive coefficient of correlation with slope elevation forest land use cover hypsometric integral rock age and plateau physiographic sub section with its prevailing climatic conditions and while negative correlation with grassland use cover and escarpment physiographic sub section this study therefore explicitly revealed that the evolution of geomorphological features in the plateau physiographic subsection with associated elevation hypsometric integral drainage density and climatic features were found to be the dominant control of the baseflow yield over other multivariate s such as land cover and aquifer properties the stepwise regression equation for lakes basin based on multivariate attributes is used as proxy knowledge to ungauged basins to estimate baseflow yield with considerable caution because of the heterogeneity in various variables graphical abstract image 1 keywords baseflow index baseflow separation major river sub basin river flow 1 introduction conceptualization of the hydrological basin system provides information necessary for the effective management planning and development of the available water resources despite the irregular and limited distributions of basin scale hydrological data soulsby et al 2008 a record of total river flow has been playing a vital role in exploring basin hydrology as a whole the total flow of the river comprises both the direct surface runoff and the groundwater discharge as a baseflow particularly the baseflow is a desirable entity that is generally known for water management as a part of the total discharge representing the low flow in the river channel santhi et al 2008 the long term ratio of baseflow to the total river flow volume is used to define the base flow index institute of hydrology 1980 this index is used as a common spatiotemporal descriptor of basin characteristics among the most important low flow indices in many previous studies through its links to physiographic climatic geomorphological land cover soil type geological and other related parameters nathan et al 1996 lacey and grayson 1998 haberlandt et al 2001 mwakalila et al 2002 in turn all catchment characteristics are controlled and affect the timing and quantity of baseflow yield mazvimavi et al 2005 stuckey 2006 delin et al 2007 gebert et al 2007 santhi et al 2008 bloomfield et al 2009 furthermore this parameter can also be used possibly to calibrate and validate hydrological models as well arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 the baseflow index of a given basin cannot be measured directly or accurately but it can be deduced systematically using appropriate techniques from measurable total river flow eckhardt 2005 the baseflow separation techniques have been one of the most common and desperate analysis approaches used in hydrology hewlett and hibbert 1967 indeed the deduced results could have been numerically reproducible yet it is still subjected and much more difficult to understand and interpret in this regard various authors have been conducted relevant studies on the estimation of baseflow index from river flow records for many years nathan and mcmahon 1990 arnold et al 1995 lim et al 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 szilagyi et al 1998 arnold and allen 1999 these studies have used the technique of graphical analytical and digital filtering to separate the baseflow from the total river flow in order to provide objective measures of baseflow indices the procedures available for this purpose are still largely arbitrary in importance for a given river flow chapman and maxwell 1996 chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 at the same time the choice of a particular technique may affect more or less the baseflow index bfi estimation furthermore understanding adopting and transferring hydrological knowledge from gauged to ungauged remote basins based on multivariate controlling factors at different spatial scales has become a special attention for researchers in different parts of the world gebert et al 2007 haberlandt et al 2001 mazvimavi et al 2005 longobardi and villani 2008 santhi et al 2008 in this regard most studies have been used regression techniques that comprises linear stepwise and multiple regressions the regression relates the baseflow index to basin characteristics such as physiographic climatic geomorphological land cover soil type and geological variables for instance here in ethiopia abebe and foerch 2006 established a relationship between the climatic morphological and geological features of a catchment and baseflow in the wabi shebele river basin this particular study found that the bfi has a better relationship with drainage density than other factors and further suggested that the developed regression equation is fair to estimate the baseflow in ungauged basins in line with these the current study is motivated through and considered the inclusion of more additional multivariate basin characteristics over six different major sub river basins as a spatial unit within the abaya chamo lakes basin of the central main ethiopia rift system these are to explore relationships and to identify the main control of basin hydrology ultimately the result is useful in providing a conceptualization of the hydrological system of the area and then to extrapolate information to ungauged river catchments which indirectly appreciate how the river flow records are important in characterizing hydrologic systems therefore the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to compare and provide reliable results using three different digital filter and graphical baseflow separation algorithms 2 to investigate dominant catchment factors that control baseflow and quantify relationships between aspects of basin scale geomorphological hydrogeological land cover and hydro climatic attributes in controlling basin hydrology and 3 to establishing regression equation that links multivariate basin characteristics to baseflow index this potentially opens up the possibility in estimating attributes of flow in similar nearby ungauged catchments the parameterizations in the analysis were completely limited to the sub river basins which did not include lakes found in the rift floor where these rivers enter 2 a brief description of the study area 2 1 location the study area abaya chamo lake basin is located within the southern main ethiopian rift valley ethiopia fig 1 geographically the region is bounded within utm 307113 m 468 468 m and 598 747 m 897 222 m easting and northing respectively the entire basin area is 18 905 5 km2 2 2 topography and climate the area is topographically a fault bounded rift valley with broad flat valley bottom the volcanic mountains and hills in the eastern and western highland define the lakes basin boundaries the margins of the rift are not clearly defined everywhere the highest elevations of the flanking plateau surfaces are about 3430 m above mean sea level in the western side from chencha towards fonko and northern highland tips whereas the massive up high thrust mountains in the eastern side of the rift are around 2 500 m from hager mariam towards hager selam both sides are steeply dipping towards the lake in the floor generally the altitude of the region varies between 1107 m and3430 m above mean sea level the basin is often divided into three physiographical subsections such as the lowland rift floor 1107 1404 m a transitional escarpment 1404 1833 m and the highland plateau 1833 3430 m the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz mainly controls the climate of the realm the convergences of northern and southern hemispheric trade winds in the tropics as well as the associated atmospheric circulation are also responsible the rainy season in the area runs from march to may and from july to october indicating bimodal rainfall pattern outreach 1995 legesse et al 2003 the mean annual rainfall varies across the river basins from 951 mm to 1653 mm while a small variation in the mean annual temperature about 20 2 c and relatively higher values on the rift floor with a slight decrease in the adjacent highlands 2 3 land use and cover fig 2 presents the land cover distribution of the lakes basin fao 1998 six land use classes were identified and the land use and cover map in fig 2 of the lakes basin shows cultivated 49 1 wood bush shrubland 33 9 forest 5 4 grassland 10 5 swamp marsh 0 8 and water body 7 4 the rift floor and the highlands are predominantly farm plots with intervening grazing land the transitional escarpments are mostly woodland and bushes there are riparian vegetation and irrigated farms along the course of a number of the rivers 2 4 geomorphology geology and hydrogeology geomorphologically the area is extremely variable because of the repeated tectonic and volcanic events with the associated erosion of volcanic rocks and the consequent deposition processes the prominent features of the lakes basin are grabens a block fault and resulting geological structure in which the valley floor has become vertically displaced with respect to the valley sides the prevailed tectonic activities and the lithological variations have been partially controlling the drainage density and drainage pattern most of the river channels follow the young lineaments within the rift system kefale and jiri 2013 thomas et al 2015 the e w orientated active extensional tectonics is characterizing the study area as a part of the southern main ethiopian rift fig 3 shows the two main fault systems 1 the rift margins n30e n40e trending faults system and 2 the rift floor n s to n20e trending fault system along the active wonji fault belt wfb the former rift margins fault systems are characterized by a few widely spaced faults with very large vertical displacements in the rift floor which is well developed and defined in the eastern margin by a more or less continuous system whereas the western margin is marked by some major faults significantly within the area of arba minch and fonko the second wfb has formed around 1 6 million years ma ago this structural system is marked by a variety of sigmoidal overlapping right stepping en echelon fault arrangement zones that obliquely cut the floor into steep scarps mohr 1968 gibson 1969 gibson and tazieff 1970 kazmin et al 1980 rocks are extremely faulted and volcanic rocks predominantly overlay the region across the tectonically active rift system these rocks are spans from pre pliocene and holocene geological period the older volcanic units outcrop on the rift escarpment or margin whereas the recent volcanic units cover the entire rift floor kazmin et al 1980 halcrow 2008 the volcano tectonic and sedimentation processes during tertiary to quaternary periods result in present day geological and geomorphic features in the area and mainly marked by tertiary volcanic rocks such as trap series alkali basalt trachyte ignimbrites inter bedded with acidic tuff and pumice as well as the quaternary alluvium deposits aden series basaltic flows and related spatter cones woldegebriel et al 1990 the precambrian basement rocks are exposed to the southeast part that consists of biotite gneiss amphibolite mafic and ultramafic granite mica and chlorite rocks jica 2012 rocks become older as one goes from the north towards the rift to the south of lake chamo these rocks are representing numerous lithologic units that form alternating permeable and impermeable ranges with different ages a set of different faults and degree of weathering results in present forms of differences in hydrogeological properties besides the extensional rift tectonics controls strongly the movement and occurrence of the deep groundwater system gizaw 2002 upon the distribution of hydrogeological properties of rocks and geological structures kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 have classified into three hydrostratigraphic units of the basin as shown in fig 3 1 the porous media aquifer formed in lacustrine alluvial and colluvial sediments and volcano sedimentary rock types of quaternary age along the rivers lakes and as an infill of depressions on the rift floor 2 the fractured aquifers formed in tertiary and quaternary basalts trachyte ignimbrite and rhyolite in the highlands escarpment and rift floor areas and 3 the fractured and porous media mixed aquifers formed in volcanic rocks intercalated with sedimentary and pumiceous pyroclastic rocks 3 approach and methods the drainage basin comprises six major sub river basins as basic spatial units and the two low lying lakes are lined up in the rift floor such as abaya and chamo with an extent of 1109 9 km2 and 316 km2 respectively these lakes occupy much of the rift floor and the major rivers drain towards them from both the western and eastern highland chains these rivers with their corresponding catchment areas are named as billate 5659 5 km2 gidabo 4199 1 km2 gelana 3865 6 km2 hamessa guracha 1006 7 km2 kulfo gina 1368 7 km2 and sife chamo 1379 4 km2 jica 2012 halcrow 2008 this study focuses on these six major sub river basins in order to analyze the characteristics of the river and its flows the daily river discharge data at 16 stations were collected from the hydrology and water quality department ministry of water irrigation and electricity mowie fig 1 and table 1 present the location and the basic information of the stations the most important criteria used to select the gauging stations were the status of availability the reliability of continuous daily river low flow data the data measurement began in the early 1970s in this study three different approaches of baseflow separation were used the filter based river analysis package rap the time plot baseflow separation program t plot and the graphical kille method 3 1 filter based river analysis package rap this package was developed by monash university melbourne australia and lyne hollick 1979 the method of calculating the baseflow component from the total flow hydrograph is through the digital filter as described by grayson et al 1996 the lyn and holick s method is accepted generally as an appropriate approximation on which the lyn hollick filter has an alpha parameter grayson et al 1996 the lyn hollick algorithm is given in equation 1 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where t time q t direct runoff at time step t q t stream flow at time step t α filter parameter associated with the catchment 3 2 time plot baseflow separation program t plot this method used gabriel periodic filter algorithm as given in equation 2 the recursive filter commonly used in a signal analysis as discussed in nathan and mcmahon 1990 and lyne and hollick 1979 2 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k filtered quick response at the kth sampling instant y k original stream flow and α filter parameter y k f k is filtered baseflow the purpose of this filter is to create a relatively smooth transition from a period of baseflow before a storm event to the usually elevated baseflow following the storm event these filters are calibrated to produce estimates of baseflow from total flow data indeed the constants in a very filter are adjusted until the calculated time series resembles baseflow thus the daily mean streamflow data were filtered forward in time to produce an estimate of baseflow and the result was filtered backward in time as nathan and mcmahon 1990 grayson et al 1996 and marsh et al 2003 recommended a value of 0 975 for α 3 3 the kille method this graphical method is used recently in ethiopia on hydrogeological and hydrochemical mapping sima et al 2003 2004 2009 the method determines the baseflow from a series of observed monthly minimum river flow values demuth 1993 it has advantages further in consolidated rock areas because as the minimum river flow values are often affected by interflow leading to a significant overestimation of baseflow thus a more sophisticated hydrograph separation kille method is recommended over such areas kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 the detailed procedures were given in jiri sima et al 2009 the results from the three baseflow separation algorithms were subjected to comparisons using correlation among each other the aim is finding a computational reproducibility and the stability of each method in determining the most likely representative bfi evaluation for a particular major river basin as a common case a stable solution would be desirable while the bfi is estimated from short river flow records then the representative bfi values for a major river basin were finally used for further analysis 3 4 parameterizations of multivariate s multivariate characteristics of major river sub basins named in table 2 were parameterized with a representative often the mean value either the estimated mean values specifically for each of the six major river basins were averaged over the raster or polygon based sub units as given in table 5 the available climate data sets for the study area were collected from the national meteorological agency nma for each major basin the climatic variables used in the analysis include annual rainfall rf potential evapotranspiration pet estimated using penman monteith method parameterized values are described in halcrow 2008 and climate index ci was deduced from the rainfall to potential evapotranspiration ratios a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m of abaya chamo lake basin produced from usgs was used to derive appropriate major river basins boundaries the basin characteristics were also computed such as mean elevation elv mean slope slop percentage of basin area with elevation physiographical regions rift floor escarpment and plateau percentage of mean major river subbasin area of total lakes basin area cat a for each basin drainage densities dd and hypsometric integral hi were calculated from dem the dd was calculated by dividing the total drainage length within a basin to the major river basin area as indicated in equation 3 horton 1945 and strahler 1957 the hypsometric integral of a basin is defined by assigning each mean elevation mean elv minimum elevation min elv and maximum elevation max elv values to each sub basin areas which are done using through the zonal procedure using equation 4 3 d d d r a i n g e l e n g t h k m drainge area km 2 4 h i mean elv min elv max elv min elv land use of abaya chamo lake basin was extracted and the major land cover class was identified in terms of percentage of the area weighted average of the assigned individual land cover group in the major river basin area the hydrogeologic and hydrostratigraphic data were collected from the department of hydrogeology ministry of water irrigation and electricity additional information s were derived also from pumping well reports and previous studies halcrow 2008 jica 2012 kefale and jiri 2013 thomas et al 2015 due to the relative limitation and reliability of available data on an aquifer saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity the hydrogeological data of aquifer variables such as transmissivity specific discharge and underlying rock age values were considered for basins in this study here the point estimates of transmissivity and specific discharge were used as representative values whereas the mean values of rocks age were utilized in each basin as rock age for a basin the analysis considered the six subbasins as the basic spatial unit for comparison and then pearson correlation coefficients were employed to obtain the statistical relationship between the baseflow index and the multivariate of a major river basin to determine the control of basin hydrology finally a simple empirical regression approach was used as a tool to investigate the effects of the basin s geomorphometric hydrogeological land cover and hydro climatic characteristics in controlling baseflow index 4 result and discussion 4 1 comparison of bfi indices derived from baseflow separation algorithms the separations of the baseflow section from the total hydrograph were done through both graphical and tuning the filter value in between 0 990 and 0 995 until it gave a satisfactory and acceptable end in the recession part of the hydrograph table 3 presents the results of baseflow yield that deduced from daily river flow time series for 16 gauging stations using baseflow separation techniques within abaya chamo lake basin as shown in section 3 1 3 3 of the methodology this result provides the most important data concerning information about subsurface in outflow water resources for subsequent utilization in a sustainable manner the observed average annual total river flows are within the range between 0 40 and 16 9 m3 s over the analysis period accordingly the estimated average annual baseflow is in between 0 08 and 8 04 m3 s 0 05 and 5 58 m3 s and 0 13 and 9 25 m3 s using baseflow separation methods rap k and tp respectively for sixteen river basins with corresponding catchment size within the range of 41 5518 km2 here the correct values of the bfi were unknown as a basic drawback and appeared as an issue to pick among methods that approximate the fact in reality at the most effective still these baseflow results from three ways as shown in table 3 were usually comparable among one another and additionally to previously published studies by kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 in fact the numerical estimates of the kille methodology were underestimated the baseflow value in most cases over the other two methods comparison analyses were employed to produce suitable representative baseflow indices for the main sub river basins hence a simple correlation analyses were done using the baseflow indices results of the rap bfi r kille bfi k time plot bfi t along with pairs of their averages bfi rtav bfi rkav bfi ktav and averages of three bfi avg against the mean total river flow and the specific runoff ratio of runoff to its catchment area as given in matrix table 4 this comparison assessment of baseflow index among three methods showed the estimate of average pairs of rap and tp bfi rt comparatively captured the mean flow and specific runoff better than kille method the underestimation of the kille method might be possibly associated with the very fact that the available data series for the method were comparatively shorter since it is relayed on monthly statistical information not like the others therefore the multivariate analyses were subsequently considered as a representative value for the individual major sub river basins to be the average value of the rap and time plot baseflow index estimates accordingly the spatial variation baseflow index for the study area based on gauged rivers ranges from 0 29 to 0 62 with a standard deviation of 0 11 that suggests 42 average long term river channel flow is assumed to be shallow subsurface flow contribution in abaya chamo lake basin 4 2 geomorphometric hydro climatic land use and aquifer variables considered for the bf analysis the hydrologic sub river basins are taken into account as a basic spatial unit in throughout the analysis to investigating the consequences of geomorphometric lithological land cover and hydro climatic features in controlling basin hydrology indeed the corresponding parameter estimates of basin characteristic variables are conferred in table 5 for every hydraulic unit s six major river sub basins following the statistical multivariate analysis the result of the matrix generally suggests that the baseflow indices are correlated to various basin characteristics with a scientifically meaningful causal relationship on which a change in specific parameter affects baseflow yield while the remainder of the basin attributes did not reveal a transparent pattern perhaps some variables within the matrix have shown cross correlations between them as well this explains a number of the variables are randomly associated with one another without any meaningful relationship thus the result of the basin scale correlations matrix given in table 6 was used for interpretations and discussions about the nature of the baseflow controls and therefore the relationships among the multivariate well to begin with physiographic variables such as catchment area elevation and slope were found to be one of the most important factors that influence baseflow yield particularly in this study it appears as indicated in table 6 an increase in drainage size will apparently increase the annual baseflow volumes from 0 24 m3 s to 3 79 m3 s within the lake basin the consequence is certainly clear on which an increase in the extent of surface area has the possibility of collecting and accumulating extra flows and this result confirms the direct proportionality of baseflow and drainage areas as pointed by price 2011 noticeably in a similar manner the slope is found to be the strongest predictor or first order control of baseflow r2 0 75 throughout the study area while with regards elevation the spatially distributed annual baseflow yield estimates increase downstream with a correlation coefficient of 0 89 as elevation effect on baseflow yield these combined effects of both elevation and slope steepness could likely be related to the rates and water transmission which determine whether it will be retained and percolate in the soil or reach a channel network moreover systematic baseflow regionalization based on the physiographic regions is often a good indicative tool to deduce the occurrence of baseflow in this regard as shown in fig 1 the analysis took under consideration the categorization of the physiographic subsection into highlands plateau shaded green rift margins escarpment yellow shade and lowlands floor red shade as well as lakes the respective subsections are partially accounting 37 34 and 28 of the study area respectively the robust positive correlation was therefore found on the plateau with a coefficient of the correlation of 0 92 with high baseflow yield and which covers the largest physiographical area unlike the plateau both the rift floor and escarpment conversely associated with low baseflow yield in fact the direct explanation of physiographic regions and the baseflow yield seems difficult regardless of linking it with other prevailing climatic factors like precipitation potential evaporation as indicated in table 6 and fig 4 matrix the degree of linearity within the pairs of variables is shown in terms of their correlation here the plateau area is characterized by high precipitation and low potential evapotranspiration which in our case implies precipitation is linearly proportional to elevation in excess of potential evaporation in contrast the lower physiographic regions including the escarpment and the rift floor are characterized by low precipitation and high potential evapotranspiration in order that these connections may reveal the high baseflow occurs in the plateau wherever there is high precipitation in excess previous studies in this regard explained the direct proportionality of precipitation to bfi memon 1995 santhi et al 2008 stuckey 2006 rumsey et al 2015 and it has therefore clear since precipitation is the major source of surface and subsurface flow to the hydrologic systems conversely the distribution of potential evapotranspiration appears to decreases the amount of available water as a limiting factor for baseflow yield memon 1995 this is also true for abaya chamo lakes basin in part the analyses of morphometric variables were also investigated as a different issue indeed the mean aridity indices ci drainage density dd and hypsometric integral hi values of the major sub river basin are also presented in table 5 the estimated values are ranges from 0 74 to 0 88 0 17 km km2 to 0 26 km km2 and 0 20 to 0 36 with standard deviations of 0 07 0 04 and 0 07 respectively the spatial distribution of ci shows the northern and northeastern part of the lake abaya including the sub basin of bilate and gidabo river seemed to be comparatively arid ci 0 88 than that of the western and southeastern parts of the basin the drainage density dd is whereas outlined as the channel spacing due to tectonic activities which is conversely distributed unlike ci across the study area this can be expressed in terms of climate topographic index lithologic age and structure thus the distribution of lower dd presents low relief highly permeable subsoil and thick vegetation and found in the north and northeast parts of lake abaya nevertheless the higher value of dd distribution within the eastern and southwestern basin typically depicts high relief impermeable subsurface material and sparse vegetation nag et al 1998 strahler 1957 rasool et al 2011 the other morphometric variable hi appears to be somehow heterogeneous in terms of spatial distribution pattern across the lakes basin it indicates the variations of erosional stage and level of tectonic activities across the sub river basins as given in table 5 a lower hypsometric integral value to the south of lake abaya represents the old and more eroded areas and evenly dissected drainage basins while the higher hi values over the sub river basin of gidabo and bilate signify that the majority of the topography is high relative to the mean elevation like a smooth upland surface cut by deeply incised streams indicating the young and less eroded areas in this regard several studies in different a part of the world have proved the hi values are controlling the basin hydrology this parameter is also ready to offer the more valuable information about the tectonic lithological and environmental conditions abebe and foerch 2006 moglen and bras 1995 willgoose and hancock 1998 huang and niemann 2006 marani et al 2001 and vivoni et al 2008 bloomfield et al 2011 in this view the association among hi ci and dd are implicit as vital factors to elucidate the hydrological system consistently with respect to the baseflow index and seems to be essential for understanding the hydrodynamics of the study area the visual review of fig 5 and table 6 typically shows the bfi has a relatively vital correlation to hi with a coefficient of 0 4 as compared to ci and dd this statistical coefficient may imply its larger influence in controlling the hydrologic system among morphometric characteristics and the relationship governs the baseflow yield within the study area r2 0 80 regarding cross correlation hi has a strong cross linear relationship with ci r2 0 75 and negatively correlated with dd 0 35 still on the other hand the bfi remains somehow influenced positively by climate index and negatively by drainage density which in turn affects the baseflow successively this outcome corresponds to different previous studies by wang and l wu 2013 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 and abrahams 1984 as wang and l wu 2013 demonstrated once the baseflow dominates a river flow throughout periods of drought the base flow yield is strongly related to the drainage density of the basin simultaneously in this study the long term baseflow yield exhibits a negative correlation r2 0 50 with drainage density this negative relationship to hypsometric integral seems to be an important indicator for baseflow estimation however its cross correlate ion aridity index and drainage density remains difficulties here in our case the higher hi situation is found in a region of high elevation or physiographical plateau region where precipitation is in excess of potential evapotranspiration with low dd likewise price 2011 verified the composition as the drainage density in humid regions is higher at higher degree slopes than that of the lower slope in arid regions the land use and cover information of the study area in fig 2 identified by six land cover categories in step with fao 1998 the importance of land cover characteristics for the generation of baseflow yield was explained also statistically in the matrix table 6 on which significant correlation was found between the baseflow index and the percentage of forest and grassland cover portions r2 0 36 0 56 respectively this confirms an increase in forest cover area considerably enhance baseflow yield however there is an apparent conflict within the previous studies regarding the effect of forest cover on baseflow yield johnson 1998 brujinzeel 2004 brown et al 2005 due to the fact that forest coverage is subjected to greater interception and the associated evapotranspiration rates out of which particularly studies such as harr et al 1982 keppeler and ziemer 1990 hicks et al 1991 smith 1991 pointed the forest cover will increase baseflow yield while grasslands coverage has comparatively high rates of evapotranspiration that in turn have a negative effect on the baseflow yield unlike that of forest coverage besides the other identified categories of land covers in fig 2 do not show a clear significant association within the study area the quantitative measurement of hydrogeological aquifer characteristics for a basin is problematic due to a limitation in data points and information especially over such a complex rift margin zones where there are high geomorphological variations in order to deduce aquifer properties the available hydrogeological maps and borehole points were accustomed in most cases the hydraulic conductivity transmissivity specific discharge and sometimes aquifer age are apparently considered as the basic lithological descriptor one trying to find a purposeful reference to different basin wise variables in the present study three aquifer variables such as transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age were used to parameterize for each spatial unit in our case the basic hydrological sub river basins considered to compliment with spatial scale to other basin characteristics the selection was thus due to less reliability of available data on aquifer saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity the parameterized values of transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age vary from 115 to 355 m2 day 3 0 22 5 l s and 2 1 to 191 8 ma respectively these variables also exhibited significant spatial variation across a topographically delineated basin for instance the northern and northeastern parts of lake abaya billate and gidabo river basin have a higher transmissivity and specific discharge with a relatively younger aquifer age while the other portions such as galena hamessa guracha kulfo gina and sife chamo have comparatively lower transmissivity specific discharge with an older aquifer age which is settled within the east west and south parts of the lake abaya and chamo likewise a strong cross linear positive relationship was found between aquifer transmissivity and specific discharge with a correlation coefficient of 0 88 as shown in the correlation matrix in table 6 while the aquifer age has a significantly negative correlation with transmissivity r2 0 41 these combinations can be consistently explained as older less permeable aquifer units such as the oldest late precambrian rock intercalated with intrusive granite in the west and south east of lake chamo and the tertiary lower basalt and volcanic rocks in the east and west plateau of lake abaya and chamo tend to contribute low specific discharge while the younger and generally high permeable quaternary volcano sedimentary units of rift floor around lakes supply high specific discharge accordingly among these aquifer variables transmissivity has a significant correlation r2 0 33 with baseflow yield as compared to the mean age and specific discharge not clear in abaya chamo lakes basin in comparison we tend to look consistently further into the aquifer variable with other basin characteristics with respect to baseflow yield to begin with the representative value of the aquifer transmissivity of major river basin has a significant negative cross correlation 0 47 with drainage density as highlighted in table 6 this relationship happens through transmissivity over which the aquifer permeability and hydrological conductivity are directly proportional while the aquifer permeability is inversely related to drainage density zecharias and brntsaert 1988 this implies that the ratio of total surface run off to groundwater baseflow is greater for a relatively impermeable lithological unit than those with higher transmissivity or permeability besides previous studies have stated that there are significant variations in drainage density in lithology across a variety of geologic settings carlston 1963 tandon 1974 kelson and wells 1989 therefore in order to place a straightforward summarization on a causal explanation of the surface hydrological system in the study area relatively high precipitation from highlands plateau with the associated morphometric settings should flow in the higher drainage network the resulting total surface runoff due to land use and soil characteristics and are going to be greater for groundwater units with lower drainage density which can lead to amplifying erosion of the underlying river these provide some reason for the presence of unconsolidated superficial sedimentary deposits up to just about 30 m thick throughout the basin floor around abaya and chamo lakes which can also contribute to supplying sediments to lakes 4 3 regional multiple regression the regression model was developed under the computational complexity of the variables on which the indicated variables in table 5 have high multicollinearity because of the existence of high correlations among some variables multicollinearity in a model can have a negative effect on model quality and stability rawlings et al 1998 indeed the model selection procedure does not solely depend on the statistical significance high coefficient of determination low multicollinearity and parameter parsimony however the conjointly of hydrological credibleness and plausibility are critical and therefore the practical sensible convenience of the variables are thought about in order to overcome the multicollinearity to the best fit with baseflow index a stepwise multiple regression was performed jonson 1991 on the descriptive variables the most fitted relationship model with informative and explanatory variables is usually recommended as given in equation 5 on which the model includes slope slop and drainage density dd for the area under investigation and the units of the independent variables are specified in table 5 5 bfi 0 08 slop 2 73 dd 0 67 all regression coefficients are significant at 95 confidence level with a coefficient of determination r2 the estimated r2 for equation 5 is 0 96 and therefore the standard error of estimation is 0 026 the significance of the estimated regression coefficients is also given in table 7 and herewith the test shows the statistical significance p value 1 of the regression model that involves slope and drainage density the following fig 6 demonstrates a regression relationship developed between the estimated and modeled bfi and showed sensible agreement 5 conclusion and recommendation as a typical common practice in previous studies the estimate of baseflow indices bfi was used as the dependent variable to investigate the characteristics of the hydrologic system through three different baseflow separation techniques rap tp and k method and have demonstrated the spatial variation among sub river basins the bfi results from the river analysis package and time plot method for 16 river gauging station were comparable to each other with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 and showed computationally reproducible and a lot plausible accurate baseflow estimate additionally estimates from both algorithms capture the hydrological characteristics of the basin nevertheless the kille method was underestimated in comparison in abaya chamo lake basin in light of the analyses both separation methods rap and tp are computationally less expensive in terms of data the time required and less subjective in comparison their estimates are captured the most noticeable hydrological properties such as specific surface runoff and mean flow of the corresponding sub river basin however since the baseflow values were resulted by subjective determination procedure and in turn which might introduce some uncertainty due to the filtering parameter especially for large mesoscale basins therefore there is a clear necessity of physically based model approach for resource evaluation the present multivariate analyses are entirely based on topographically defined independent surface catchment and assumed the variation of basin characteristics of each sub river basins are responsible for respective base flow rate regardless of groundwater flux transfer the method involves solely a conventional hydrological technique to delineate the six hydrologic units and parameterizations of the representative values are straightforward computationally besides the results are interpreted in line with scientific findings however higher heterogeneity uneven data distribution and the limitation of variables like hydrogeological parameters transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age soil type across the unit could cause some error as a limitation the present study explored the multivariate attribute that dominantly controls basin hydrology particularity the baseflow yield as a hydrologic descriptor the peak yield is found at the highest elevation in the plateau physiographic region this particular region is characterized by highest rainfall in excess and strongly correlated with hypsometric integral r2 0 96 and low drainage density r2 0 49 as compared with the escarpment and therefore the rift floor in general since bfi is employed to explain the overall hydrologic system of the lake basin the study reveals morphometric variables slope elevation and prevailing climatic conditions seems to be a dominating factor in comparison to other multivariate such as land cover and lithological variables in reference to causal relationship and a statistical significance as well the established regression model in equation 5 provides a tool for estimating the baseflow yield with statistical significance the equation might be used as a base to extrapolate to the ungauged catchments with great care this can point out the advantage of baseflow regionalization using acceptable multivariate analysis for physical characterization of the hydrologic system additionally to boot the earlier discussion hi is consistently vital variable to imply baseflow yield and can be used to infer aquifers transmissivity wherever there is less or no data point this could lean by t 976 7 hi 83 6 where t aquifer transmissivity in m2 day and hi hypsometric integral with r2 of 0 71 however it would need a lot of refined calibration this equation presents the evolution of the past and present tectonic activity are highly determine the transmissivity of aquifer unit or geological formation and this relationship will be conjointly accustomed to parameterize transmissivity values in a given basin generally the estimated baseflow values and therefore the physical characterization of the hydrologic system still accounts for only the long term average for the region consequently this study has vital implications for the remote areas where specific data availability is limited to have an insight into the hydrologic framework it is conjointly higher to contemplate a lot of supplementary

12221,in developing countries there is high limitation and irregularity in river flow data recording and a significant number of hydrologic basins are ungauged despite the fact that the estimation of surface and groundwater asset assumes the measurements as a basic concern in resource management and planning understanding baseflow forms specifically as a piece of the total flow of river basins can be utilized as a demonstrative tool to portray hydrologic frameworks and turns into a basic issue of water balance contemplates hence this work seeks to compare baseflow estimates in the abaya chamo lakes basin using baseflow separation algorithms such as river analysis package rap time plot tp and kille k the assessments are then utilized to set up and establish further the associations with multivariate factors such as climate geomorphometric land use cover and aquifer properties indeed an accessible 16 daily river discharge records were therefore used to estimate the value of the baseflow index bfi the estimates from both river analysis package and time plot algorisms are more hydrologically plausible and compared well to each other with a linear correlation coefficient of 0 96 in any case the graphical kille method is somehow underestimated the baseflow yield the estimated value over whole ranges between 0 29 and 0 62 which suggests about 42 of the long term total river flow is a contribution of groundwater discharge furthermore this index was gathered with multivariate s to have a consistent causal explanations as a descriptor of the hydrological framework and have a significant positive coefficient of correlation with slope elevation forest land use cover hypsometric integral rock age and plateau physiographic sub section with its prevailing climatic conditions and while negative correlation with grassland use cover and escarpment physiographic sub section this study therefore explicitly revealed that the evolution of geomorphological features in the plateau physiographic subsection with associated elevation hypsometric integral drainage density and climatic features were found to be the dominant control of the baseflow yield over other multivariate s such as land cover and aquifer properties the stepwise regression equation for lakes basin based on multivariate attributes is used as proxy knowledge to ungauged basins to estimate baseflow yield with considerable caution because of the heterogeneity in various variables graphical abstract image 1 keywords baseflow index baseflow separation major river sub basin river flow 1 introduction conceptualization of the hydrological basin system provides information necessary for the effective management planning and development of the available water resources despite the irregular and limited distributions of basin scale hydrological data soulsby et al 2008 a record of total river flow has been playing a vital role in exploring basin hydrology as a whole the total flow of the river comprises both the direct surface runoff and the groundwater discharge as a baseflow particularly the baseflow is a desirable entity that is generally known for water management as a part of the total discharge representing the low flow in the river channel santhi et al 2008 the long term ratio of baseflow to the total river flow volume is used to define the base flow index institute of hydrology 1980 this index is used as a common spatiotemporal descriptor of basin characteristics among the most important low flow indices in many previous studies through its links to physiographic climatic geomorphological land cover soil type geological and other related parameters nathan et al 1996 lacey and grayson 1998 haberlandt et al 2001 mwakalila et al 2002 in turn all catchment characteristics are controlled and affect the timing and quantity of baseflow yield mazvimavi et al 2005 stuckey 2006 delin et al 2007 gebert et al 2007 santhi et al 2008 bloomfield et al 2009 furthermore this parameter can also be used possibly to calibrate and validate hydrological models as well arnold et al 2000 stewart et al 2007 batelaan and de smedt 2007 combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 risser et al 2009 the baseflow index of a given basin cannot be measured directly or accurately but it can be deduced systematically using appropriate techniques from measurable total river flow eckhardt 2005 the baseflow separation techniques have been one of the most common and desperate analysis approaches used in hydrology hewlett and hibbert 1967 indeed the deduced results could have been numerically reproducible yet it is still subjected and much more difficult to understand and interpret in this regard various authors have been conducted relevant studies on the estimation of baseflow index from river flow records for many years nathan and mcmahon 1990 arnold et al 1995 lim et al 2005 lyne and hollick 1979 szilagyi et al 1998 arnold and allen 1999 these studies have used the technique of graphical analytical and digital filtering to separate the baseflow from the total river flow in order to provide objective measures of baseflow indices the procedures available for this purpose are still largely arbitrary in importance for a given river flow chapman and maxwell 1996 chapman 1999 eckhardt 2005 at the same time the choice of a particular technique may affect more or less the baseflow index bfi estimation furthermore understanding adopting and transferring hydrological knowledge from gauged to ungauged remote basins based on multivariate controlling factors at different spatial scales has become a special attention for researchers in different parts of the world gebert et al 2007 haberlandt et al 2001 mazvimavi et al 2005 longobardi and villani 2008 santhi et al 2008 in this regard most studies have been used regression techniques that comprises linear stepwise and multiple regressions the regression relates the baseflow index to basin characteristics such as physiographic climatic geomorphological land cover soil type and geological variables for instance here in ethiopia abebe and foerch 2006 established a relationship between the climatic morphological and geological features of a catchment and baseflow in the wabi shebele river basin this particular study found that the bfi has a better relationship with drainage density than other factors and further suggested that the developed regression equation is fair to estimate the baseflow in ungauged basins in line with these the current study is motivated through and considered the inclusion of more additional multivariate basin characteristics over six different major sub river basins as a spatial unit within the abaya chamo lakes basin of the central main ethiopia rift system these are to explore relationships and to identify the main control of basin hydrology ultimately the result is useful in providing a conceptualization of the hydrological system of the area and then to extrapolate information to ungauged river catchments which indirectly appreciate how the river flow records are important in characterizing hydrologic systems therefore the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to compare and provide reliable results using three different digital filter and graphical baseflow separation algorithms 2 to investigate dominant catchment factors that control baseflow and quantify relationships between aspects of basin scale geomorphological hydrogeological land cover and hydro climatic attributes in controlling basin hydrology and 3 to establishing regression equation that links multivariate basin characteristics to baseflow index this potentially opens up the possibility in estimating attributes of flow in similar nearby ungauged catchments the parameterizations in the analysis were completely limited to the sub river basins which did not include lakes found in the rift floor where these rivers enter 2 a brief description of the study area 2 1 location the study area abaya chamo lake basin is located within the southern main ethiopian rift valley ethiopia fig 1 geographically the region is bounded within utm 307113 m 468 468 m and 598 747 m 897 222 m easting and northing respectively the entire basin area is 18 905 5 km2 2 2 topography and climate the area is topographically a fault bounded rift valley with broad flat valley bottom the volcanic mountains and hills in the eastern and western highland define the lakes basin boundaries the margins of the rift are not clearly defined everywhere the highest elevations of the flanking plateau surfaces are about 3430 m above mean sea level in the western side from chencha towards fonko and northern highland tips whereas the massive up high thrust mountains in the eastern side of the rift are around 2 500 m from hager mariam towards hager selam both sides are steeply dipping towards the lake in the floor generally the altitude of the region varies between 1107 m and3430 m above mean sea level the basin is often divided into three physiographical subsections such as the lowland rift floor 1107 1404 m a transitional escarpment 1404 1833 m and the highland plateau 1833 3430 m the seasonal migration of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz mainly controls the climate of the realm the convergences of northern and southern hemispheric trade winds in the tropics as well as the associated atmospheric circulation are also responsible the rainy season in the area runs from march to may and from july to october indicating bimodal rainfall pattern outreach 1995 legesse et al 2003 the mean annual rainfall varies across the river basins from 951 mm to 1653 mm while a small variation in the mean annual temperature about 20 2 c and relatively higher values on the rift floor with a slight decrease in the adjacent highlands 2 3 land use and cover fig 2 presents the land cover distribution of the lakes basin fao 1998 six land use classes were identified and the land use and cover map in fig 2 of the lakes basin shows cultivated 49 1 wood bush shrubland 33 9 forest 5 4 grassland 10 5 swamp marsh 0 8 and water body 7 4 the rift floor and the highlands are predominantly farm plots with intervening grazing land the transitional escarpments are mostly woodland and bushes there are riparian vegetation and irrigated farms along the course of a number of the rivers 2 4 geomorphology geology and hydrogeology geomorphologically the area is extremely variable because of the repeated tectonic and volcanic events with the associated erosion of volcanic rocks and the consequent deposition processes the prominent features of the lakes basin are grabens a block fault and resulting geological structure in which the valley floor has become vertically displaced with respect to the valley sides the prevailed tectonic activities and the lithological variations have been partially controlling the drainage density and drainage pattern most of the river channels follow the young lineaments within the rift system kefale and jiri 2013 thomas et al 2015 the e w orientated active extensional tectonics is characterizing the study area as a part of the southern main ethiopian rift fig 3 shows the two main fault systems 1 the rift margins n30e n40e trending faults system and 2 the rift floor n s to n20e trending fault system along the active wonji fault belt wfb the former rift margins fault systems are characterized by a few widely spaced faults with very large vertical displacements in the rift floor which is well developed and defined in the eastern margin by a more or less continuous system whereas the western margin is marked by some major faults significantly within the area of arba minch and fonko the second wfb has formed around 1 6 million years ma ago this structural system is marked by a variety of sigmoidal overlapping right stepping en echelon fault arrangement zones that obliquely cut the floor into steep scarps mohr 1968 gibson 1969 gibson and tazieff 1970 kazmin et al 1980 rocks are extremely faulted and volcanic rocks predominantly overlay the region across the tectonically active rift system these rocks are spans from pre pliocene and holocene geological period the older volcanic units outcrop on the rift escarpment or margin whereas the recent volcanic units cover the entire rift floor kazmin et al 1980 halcrow 2008 the volcano tectonic and sedimentation processes during tertiary to quaternary periods result in present day geological and geomorphic features in the area and mainly marked by tertiary volcanic rocks such as trap series alkali basalt trachyte ignimbrites inter bedded with acidic tuff and pumice as well as the quaternary alluvium deposits aden series basaltic flows and related spatter cones woldegebriel et al 1990 the precambrian basement rocks are exposed to the southeast part that consists of biotite gneiss amphibolite mafic and ultramafic granite mica and chlorite rocks jica 2012 rocks become older as one goes from the north towards the rift to the south of lake chamo these rocks are representing numerous lithologic units that form alternating permeable and impermeable ranges with different ages a set of different faults and degree of weathering results in present forms of differences in hydrogeological properties besides the extensional rift tectonics controls strongly the movement and occurrence of the deep groundwater system gizaw 2002 upon the distribution of hydrogeological properties of rocks and geological structures kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 have classified into three hydrostratigraphic units of the basin as shown in fig 3 1 the porous media aquifer formed in lacustrine alluvial and colluvial sediments and volcano sedimentary rock types of quaternary age along the rivers lakes and as an infill of depressions on the rift floor 2 the fractured aquifers formed in tertiary and quaternary basalts trachyte ignimbrite and rhyolite in the highlands escarpment and rift floor areas and 3 the fractured and porous media mixed aquifers formed in volcanic rocks intercalated with sedimentary and pumiceous pyroclastic rocks 3 approach and methods the drainage basin comprises six major sub river basins as basic spatial units and the two low lying lakes are lined up in the rift floor such as abaya and chamo with an extent of 1109 9 km2 and 316 km2 respectively these lakes occupy much of the rift floor and the major rivers drain towards them from both the western and eastern highland chains these rivers with their corresponding catchment areas are named as billate 5659 5 km2 gidabo 4199 1 km2 gelana 3865 6 km2 hamessa guracha 1006 7 km2 kulfo gina 1368 7 km2 and sife chamo 1379 4 km2 jica 2012 halcrow 2008 this study focuses on these six major sub river basins in order to analyze the characteristics of the river and its flows the daily river discharge data at 16 stations were collected from the hydrology and water quality department ministry of water irrigation and electricity mowie fig 1 and table 1 present the location and the basic information of the stations the most important criteria used to select the gauging stations were the status of availability the reliability of continuous daily river low flow data the data measurement began in the early 1970s in this study three different approaches of baseflow separation were used the filter based river analysis package rap the time plot baseflow separation program t plot and the graphical kille method 3 1 filter based river analysis package rap this package was developed by monash university melbourne australia and lyne hollick 1979 the method of calculating the baseflow component from the total flow hydrograph is through the digital filter as described by grayson et al 1996 the lyn and holick s method is accepted generally as an appropriate approximation on which the lyn hollick filter has an alpha parameter grayson et al 1996 the lyn hollick algorithm is given in equation 1 1 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where t time q t direct runoff at time step t q t stream flow at time step t α filter parameter associated with the catchment 3 2 time plot baseflow separation program t plot this method used gabriel periodic filter algorithm as given in equation 2 the recursive filter commonly used in a signal analysis as discussed in nathan and mcmahon 1990 and lyne and hollick 1979 2 f k α f k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 where f k filtered quick response at the kth sampling instant y k original stream flow and α filter parameter y k f k is filtered baseflow the purpose of this filter is to create a relatively smooth transition from a period of baseflow before a storm event to the usually elevated baseflow following the storm event these filters are calibrated to produce estimates of baseflow from total flow data indeed the constants in a very filter are adjusted until the calculated time series resembles baseflow thus the daily mean streamflow data were filtered forward in time to produce an estimate of baseflow and the result was filtered backward in time as nathan and mcmahon 1990 grayson et al 1996 and marsh et al 2003 recommended a value of 0 975 for α 3 3 the kille method this graphical method is used recently in ethiopia on hydrogeological and hydrochemical mapping sima et al 2003 2004 2009 the method determines the baseflow from a series of observed monthly minimum river flow values demuth 1993 it has advantages further in consolidated rock areas because as the minimum river flow values are often affected by interflow leading to a significant overestimation of baseflow thus a more sophisticated hydrograph separation kille method is recommended over such areas kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 the detailed procedures were given in jiri sima et al 2009 the results from the three baseflow separation algorithms were subjected to comparisons using correlation among each other the aim is finding a computational reproducibility and the stability of each method in determining the most likely representative bfi evaluation for a particular major river basin as a common case a stable solution would be desirable while the bfi is estimated from short river flow records then the representative bfi values for a major river basin were finally used for further analysis 3 4 parameterizations of multivariate s multivariate characteristics of major river sub basins named in table 2 were parameterized with a representative often the mean value either the estimated mean values specifically for each of the six major river basins were averaged over the raster or polygon based sub units as given in table 5 the available climate data sets for the study area were collected from the national meteorological agency nma for each major basin the climatic variables used in the analysis include annual rainfall rf potential evapotranspiration pet estimated using penman monteith method parameterized values are described in halcrow 2008 and climate index ci was deduced from the rainfall to potential evapotranspiration ratios a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m of abaya chamo lake basin produced from usgs was used to derive appropriate major river basins boundaries the basin characteristics were also computed such as mean elevation elv mean slope slop percentage of basin area with elevation physiographical regions rift floor escarpment and plateau percentage of mean major river subbasin area of total lakes basin area cat a for each basin drainage densities dd and hypsometric integral hi were calculated from dem the dd was calculated by dividing the total drainage length within a basin to the major river basin area as indicated in equation 3 horton 1945 and strahler 1957 the hypsometric integral of a basin is defined by assigning each mean elevation mean elv minimum elevation min elv and maximum elevation max elv values to each sub basin areas which are done using through the zonal procedure using equation 4 3 d d d r a i n g e l e n g t h k m drainge area km 2 4 h i mean elv min elv max elv min elv land use of abaya chamo lake basin was extracted and the major land cover class was identified in terms of percentage of the area weighted average of the assigned individual land cover group in the major river basin area the hydrogeologic and hydrostratigraphic data were collected from the department of hydrogeology ministry of water irrigation and electricity additional information s were derived also from pumping well reports and previous studies halcrow 2008 jica 2012 kefale and jiri 2013 thomas et al 2015 due to the relative limitation and reliability of available data on an aquifer saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity the hydrogeological data of aquifer variables such as transmissivity specific discharge and underlying rock age values were considered for basins in this study here the point estimates of transmissivity and specific discharge were used as representative values whereas the mean values of rocks age were utilized in each basin as rock age for a basin the analysis considered the six subbasins as the basic spatial unit for comparison and then pearson correlation coefficients were employed to obtain the statistical relationship between the baseflow index and the multivariate of a major river basin to determine the control of basin hydrology finally a simple empirical regression approach was used as a tool to investigate the effects of the basin s geomorphometric hydrogeological land cover and hydro climatic characteristics in controlling baseflow index 4 result and discussion 4 1 comparison of bfi indices derived from baseflow separation algorithms the separations of the baseflow section from the total hydrograph were done through both graphical and tuning the filter value in between 0 990 and 0 995 until it gave a satisfactory and acceptable end in the recession part of the hydrograph table 3 presents the results of baseflow yield that deduced from daily river flow time series for 16 gauging stations using baseflow separation techniques within abaya chamo lake basin as shown in section 3 1 3 3 of the methodology this result provides the most important data concerning information about subsurface in outflow water resources for subsequent utilization in a sustainable manner the observed average annual total river flows are within the range between 0 40 and 16 9 m3 s over the analysis period accordingly the estimated average annual baseflow is in between 0 08 and 8 04 m3 s 0 05 and 5 58 m3 s and 0 13 and 9 25 m3 s using baseflow separation methods rap k and tp respectively for sixteen river basins with corresponding catchment size within the range of 41 5518 km2 here the correct values of the bfi were unknown as a basic drawback and appeared as an issue to pick among methods that approximate the fact in reality at the most effective still these baseflow results from three ways as shown in table 3 were usually comparable among one another and additionally to previously published studies by kefale and jiri 2013 and thomas et al 2015 in fact the numerical estimates of the kille methodology were underestimated the baseflow value in most cases over the other two methods comparison analyses were employed to produce suitable representative baseflow indices for the main sub river basins hence a simple correlation analyses were done using the baseflow indices results of the rap bfi r kille bfi k time plot bfi t along with pairs of their averages bfi rtav bfi rkav bfi ktav and averages of three bfi avg against the mean total river flow and the specific runoff ratio of runoff to its catchment area as given in matrix table 4 this comparison assessment of baseflow index among three methods showed the estimate of average pairs of rap and tp bfi rt comparatively captured the mean flow and specific runoff better than kille method the underestimation of the kille method might be possibly associated with the very fact that the available data series for the method were comparatively shorter since it is relayed on monthly statistical information not like the others therefore the multivariate analyses were subsequently considered as a representative value for the individual major sub river basins to be the average value of the rap and time plot baseflow index estimates accordingly the spatial variation baseflow index for the study area based on gauged rivers ranges from 0 29 to 0 62 with a standard deviation of 0 11 that suggests 42 average long term river channel flow is assumed to be shallow subsurface flow contribution in abaya chamo lake basin 4 2 geomorphometric hydro climatic land use and aquifer variables considered for the bf analysis the hydrologic sub river basins are taken into account as a basic spatial unit in throughout the analysis to investigating the consequences of geomorphometric lithological land cover and hydro climatic features in controlling basin hydrology indeed the corresponding parameter estimates of basin characteristic variables are conferred in table 5 for every hydraulic unit s six major river sub basins following the statistical multivariate analysis the result of the matrix generally suggests that the baseflow indices are correlated to various basin characteristics with a scientifically meaningful causal relationship on which a change in specific parameter affects baseflow yield while the remainder of the basin attributes did not reveal a transparent pattern perhaps some variables within the matrix have shown cross correlations between them as well this explains a number of the variables are randomly associated with one another without any meaningful relationship thus the result of the basin scale correlations matrix given in table 6 was used for interpretations and discussions about the nature of the baseflow controls and therefore the relationships among the multivariate well to begin with physiographic variables such as catchment area elevation and slope were found to be one of the most important factors that influence baseflow yield particularly in this study it appears as indicated in table 6 an increase in drainage size will apparently increase the annual baseflow volumes from 0 24 m3 s to 3 79 m3 s within the lake basin the consequence is certainly clear on which an increase in the extent of surface area has the possibility of collecting and accumulating extra flows and this result confirms the direct proportionality of baseflow and drainage areas as pointed by price 2011 noticeably in a similar manner the slope is found to be the strongest predictor or first order control of baseflow r2 0 75 throughout the study area while with regards elevation the spatially distributed annual baseflow yield estimates increase downstream with a correlation coefficient of 0 89 as elevation effect on baseflow yield these combined effects of both elevation and slope steepness could likely be related to the rates and water transmission which determine whether it will be retained and percolate in the soil or reach a channel network moreover systematic baseflow regionalization based on the physiographic regions is often a good indicative tool to deduce the occurrence of baseflow in this regard as shown in fig 1 the analysis took under consideration the categorization of the physiographic subsection into highlands plateau shaded green rift margins escarpment yellow shade and lowlands floor red shade as well as lakes the respective subsections are partially accounting 37 34 and 28 of the study area respectively the robust positive correlation was therefore found on the plateau with a coefficient of the correlation of 0 92 with high baseflow yield and which covers the largest physiographical area unlike the plateau both the rift floor and escarpment conversely associated with low baseflow yield in fact the direct explanation of physiographic regions and the baseflow yield seems difficult regardless of linking it with other prevailing climatic factors like precipitation potential evaporation as indicated in table 6 and fig 4 matrix the degree of linearity within the pairs of variables is shown in terms of their correlation here the plateau area is characterized by high precipitation and low potential evapotranspiration which in our case implies precipitation is linearly proportional to elevation in excess of potential evaporation in contrast the lower physiographic regions including the escarpment and the rift floor are characterized by low precipitation and high potential evapotranspiration in order that these connections may reveal the high baseflow occurs in the plateau wherever there is high precipitation in excess previous studies in this regard explained the direct proportionality of precipitation to bfi memon 1995 santhi et al 2008 stuckey 2006 rumsey et al 2015 and it has therefore clear since precipitation is the major source of surface and subsurface flow to the hydrologic systems conversely the distribution of potential evapotranspiration appears to decreases the amount of available water as a limiting factor for baseflow yield memon 1995 this is also true for abaya chamo lakes basin in part the analyses of morphometric variables were also investigated as a different issue indeed the mean aridity indices ci drainage density dd and hypsometric integral hi values of the major sub river basin are also presented in table 5 the estimated values are ranges from 0 74 to 0 88 0 17 km km2 to 0 26 km km2 and 0 20 to 0 36 with standard deviations of 0 07 0 04 and 0 07 respectively the spatial distribution of ci shows the northern and northeastern part of the lake abaya including the sub basin of bilate and gidabo river seemed to be comparatively arid ci 0 88 than that of the western and southeastern parts of the basin the drainage density dd is whereas outlined as the channel spacing due to tectonic activities which is conversely distributed unlike ci across the study area this can be expressed in terms of climate topographic index lithologic age and structure thus the distribution of lower dd presents low relief highly permeable subsoil and thick vegetation and found in the north and northeast parts of lake abaya nevertheless the higher value of dd distribution within the eastern and southwestern basin typically depicts high relief impermeable subsurface material and sparse vegetation nag et al 1998 strahler 1957 rasool et al 2011 the other morphometric variable hi appears to be somehow heterogeneous in terms of spatial distribution pattern across the lakes basin it indicates the variations of erosional stage and level of tectonic activities across the sub river basins as given in table 5 a lower hypsometric integral value to the south of lake abaya represents the old and more eroded areas and evenly dissected drainage basins while the higher hi values over the sub river basin of gidabo and bilate signify that the majority of the topography is high relative to the mean elevation like a smooth upland surface cut by deeply incised streams indicating the young and less eroded areas in this regard several studies in different a part of the world have proved the hi values are controlling the basin hydrology this parameter is also ready to offer the more valuable information about the tectonic lithological and environmental conditions abebe and foerch 2006 moglen and bras 1995 willgoose and hancock 1998 huang and niemann 2006 marani et al 2001 and vivoni et al 2008 bloomfield et al 2011 in this view the association among hi ci and dd are implicit as vital factors to elucidate the hydrological system consistently with respect to the baseflow index and seems to be essential for understanding the hydrodynamics of the study area the visual review of fig 5 and table 6 typically shows the bfi has a relatively vital correlation to hi with a coefficient of 0 4 as compared to ci and dd this statistical coefficient may imply its larger influence in controlling the hydrologic system among morphometric characteristics and the relationship governs the baseflow yield within the study area r2 0 80 regarding cross correlation hi has a strong cross linear relationship with ci r2 0 75 and negatively correlated with dd 0 35 still on the other hand the bfi remains somehow influenced positively by climate index and negatively by drainage density which in turn affects the baseflow successively this outcome corresponds to different previous studies by wang and l wu 2013 de wit and stankiewicz 2006 and abrahams 1984 as wang and l wu 2013 demonstrated once the baseflow dominates a river flow throughout periods of drought the base flow yield is strongly related to the drainage density of the basin simultaneously in this study the long term baseflow yield exhibits a negative correlation r2 0 50 with drainage density this negative relationship to hypsometric integral seems to be an important indicator for baseflow estimation however its cross correlate ion aridity index and drainage density remains difficulties here in our case the higher hi situation is found in a region of high elevation or physiographical plateau region where precipitation is in excess of potential evapotranspiration with low dd likewise price 2011 verified the composition as the drainage density in humid regions is higher at higher degree slopes than that of the lower slope in arid regions the land use and cover information of the study area in fig 2 identified by six land cover categories in step with fao 1998 the importance of land cover characteristics for the generation of baseflow yield was explained also statistically in the matrix table 6 on which significant correlation was found between the baseflow index and the percentage of forest and grassland cover portions r2 0 36 0 56 respectively this confirms an increase in forest cover area considerably enhance baseflow yield however there is an apparent conflict within the previous studies regarding the effect of forest cover on baseflow yield johnson 1998 brujinzeel 2004 brown et al 2005 due to the fact that forest coverage is subjected to greater interception and the associated evapotranspiration rates out of which particularly studies such as harr et al 1982 keppeler and ziemer 1990 hicks et al 1991 smith 1991 pointed the forest cover will increase baseflow yield while grasslands coverage has comparatively high rates of evapotranspiration that in turn have a negative effect on the baseflow yield unlike that of forest coverage besides the other identified categories of land covers in fig 2 do not show a clear significant association within the study area the quantitative measurement of hydrogeological aquifer characteristics for a basin is problematic due to a limitation in data points and information especially over such a complex rift margin zones where there are high geomorphological variations in order to deduce aquifer properties the available hydrogeological maps and borehole points were accustomed in most cases the hydraulic conductivity transmissivity specific discharge and sometimes aquifer age are apparently considered as the basic lithological descriptor one trying to find a purposeful reference to different basin wise variables in the present study three aquifer variables such as transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age were used to parameterize for each spatial unit in our case the basic hydrological sub river basins considered to compliment with spatial scale to other basin characteristics the selection was thus due to less reliability of available data on aquifer saturated thickness and hydraulic conductivity the parameterized values of transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age vary from 115 to 355 m2 day 3 0 22 5 l s and 2 1 to 191 8 ma respectively these variables also exhibited significant spatial variation across a topographically delineated basin for instance the northern and northeastern parts of lake abaya billate and gidabo river basin have a higher transmissivity and specific discharge with a relatively younger aquifer age while the other portions such as galena hamessa guracha kulfo gina and sife chamo have comparatively lower transmissivity specific discharge with an older aquifer age which is settled within the east west and south parts of the lake abaya and chamo likewise a strong cross linear positive relationship was found between aquifer transmissivity and specific discharge with a correlation coefficient of 0 88 as shown in the correlation matrix in table 6 while the aquifer age has a significantly negative correlation with transmissivity r2 0 41 these combinations can be consistently explained as older less permeable aquifer units such as the oldest late precambrian rock intercalated with intrusive granite in the west and south east of lake chamo and the tertiary lower basalt and volcanic rocks in the east and west plateau of lake abaya and chamo tend to contribute low specific discharge while the younger and generally high permeable quaternary volcano sedimentary units of rift floor around lakes supply high specific discharge accordingly among these aquifer variables transmissivity has a significant correlation r2 0 33 with baseflow yield as compared to the mean age and specific discharge not clear in abaya chamo lakes basin in comparison we tend to look consistently further into the aquifer variable with other basin characteristics with respect to baseflow yield to begin with the representative value of the aquifer transmissivity of major river basin has a significant negative cross correlation 0 47 with drainage density as highlighted in table 6 this relationship happens through transmissivity over which the aquifer permeability and hydrological conductivity are directly proportional while the aquifer permeability is inversely related to drainage density zecharias and brntsaert 1988 this implies that the ratio of total surface run off to groundwater baseflow is greater for a relatively impermeable lithological unit than those with higher transmissivity or permeability besides previous studies have stated that there are significant variations in drainage density in lithology across a variety of geologic settings carlston 1963 tandon 1974 kelson and wells 1989 therefore in order to place a straightforward summarization on a causal explanation of the surface hydrological system in the study area relatively high precipitation from highlands plateau with the associated morphometric settings should flow in the higher drainage network the resulting total surface runoff due to land use and soil characteristics and are going to be greater for groundwater units with lower drainage density which can lead to amplifying erosion of the underlying river these provide some reason for the presence of unconsolidated superficial sedimentary deposits up to just about 30 m thick throughout the basin floor around abaya and chamo lakes which can also contribute to supplying sediments to lakes 4 3 regional multiple regression the regression model was developed under the computational complexity of the variables on which the indicated variables in table 5 have high multicollinearity because of the existence of high correlations among some variables multicollinearity in a model can have a negative effect on model quality and stability rawlings et al 1998 indeed the model selection procedure does not solely depend on the statistical significance high coefficient of determination low multicollinearity and parameter parsimony however the conjointly of hydrological credibleness and plausibility are critical and therefore the practical sensible convenience of the variables are thought about in order to overcome the multicollinearity to the best fit with baseflow index a stepwise multiple regression was performed jonson 1991 on the descriptive variables the most fitted relationship model with informative and explanatory variables is usually recommended as given in equation 5 on which the model includes slope slop and drainage density dd for the area under investigation and the units of the independent variables are specified in table 5 5 bfi 0 08 slop 2 73 dd 0 67 all regression coefficients are significant at 95 confidence level with a coefficient of determination r2 the estimated r2 for equation 5 is 0 96 and therefore the standard error of estimation is 0 026 the significance of the estimated regression coefficients is also given in table 7 and herewith the test shows the statistical significance p value 1 of the regression model that involves slope and drainage density the following fig 6 demonstrates a regression relationship developed between the estimated and modeled bfi and showed sensible agreement 5 conclusion and recommendation as a typical common practice in previous studies the estimate of baseflow indices bfi was used as the dependent variable to investigate the characteristics of the hydrologic system through three different baseflow separation techniques rap tp and k method and have demonstrated the spatial variation among sub river basins the bfi results from the river analysis package and time plot method for 16 river gauging station were comparable to each other with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 and showed computationally reproducible and a lot plausible accurate baseflow estimate additionally estimates from both algorithms capture the hydrological characteristics of the basin nevertheless the kille method was underestimated in comparison in abaya chamo lake basin in light of the analyses both separation methods rap and tp are computationally less expensive in terms of data the time required and less subjective in comparison their estimates are captured the most noticeable hydrological properties such as specific surface runoff and mean flow of the corresponding sub river basin however since the baseflow values were resulted by subjective determination procedure and in turn which might introduce some uncertainty due to the filtering parameter especially for large mesoscale basins therefore there is a clear necessity of physically based model approach for resource evaluation the present multivariate analyses are entirely based on topographically defined independent surface catchment and assumed the variation of basin characteristics of each sub river basins are responsible for respective base flow rate regardless of groundwater flux transfer the method involves solely a conventional hydrological technique to delineate the six hydrologic units and parameterizations of the representative values are straightforward computationally besides the results are interpreted in line with scientific findings however higher heterogeneity uneven data distribution and the limitation of variables like hydrogeological parameters transmissivity specific discharge and aquifer age soil type across the unit could cause some error as a limitation the present study explored the multivariate attribute that dominantly controls basin hydrology particularity the baseflow yield as a hydrologic descriptor the peak yield is found at the highest elevation in the plateau physiographic region this particular region is characterized by highest rainfall in excess and strongly correlated with hypsometric integral r2 0 96 and low drainage density r2 0 49 as compared with the escarpment and therefore the rift floor in general since bfi is employed to explain the overall hydrologic system of the lake basin the study reveals morphometric variables slope elevation and prevailing climatic conditions seems to be a dominating factor in comparison to other multivariate such as land cover and lithological variables in reference to causal relationship and a statistical significance as well the established regression model in equation 5 provides a tool for estimating the baseflow yield with statistical significance the equation might be used as a base to extrapolate to the ungauged catchments with great care this can point out the advantage of baseflow regionalization using acceptable multivariate analysis for physical characterization of the hydrologic system additionally to boot the earlier discussion hi is consistently vital variable to imply baseflow yield and can be used to infer aquifers transmissivity wherever there is less or no data point this could lean by t 976 7 hi 83 6 where t aquifer transmissivity in m2 day and hi hypsometric integral with r2 of 0 71 however it would need a lot of refined calibration this equation presents the evolution of the past and present tectonic activity are highly determine the transmissivity of aquifer unit or geological formation and this relationship will be conjointly accustomed to parameterize transmissivity values in a given basin generally the estimated baseflow values and therefore the physical characterization of the hydrologic system still accounts for only the long term average for the region consequently this study has vital implications for the remote areas where specific data availability is limited to have an insight into the hydrologic framework it is conjointly higher to contemplate a lot of supplementary potential variables such as soil type potentiometric water level hydraulic conductivity etc that will facilitate in providing solid information acknowledgment the authors are grateful to the school of

human health like lung cancer chronic bronchitis dermatitis and asthma sud et al 2008 conventional methods which were used earlier for removal of metal ions like chemical precipitation ion exchange chemical oxidation reduction reverse osmosis etc suffer from many disadvantages such as less efficiency sensitive operating conditions and production of non biodegradable sludge leading to high

applied to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions the whole dataset of 382 samples was partitioned into two parts as the training dataset of 80 306 runs and the test dataset of 20 76 runs respectively the procedure for developing svr model is illustrated in section 2 1 further the svr based model is compared with the mlr model to demonstrate the superior capability of the former with the successful application of ai techniques in the present work we hope that this humble effort shall motivate other workers to explore the use of svr particularly for modeling problems in chemical engineering and its allied fields especially in areas for which the theory is not well developed 2 basic ideas of support vector machines svms a brief description of support vector machines can be found in the literature mat deris et al 2011 parveen et al 2017b smola and schölkopf 2004 vapnik et al 1996 the objective of a ε svr model is to map the input data x into a higher dimensional feature space f via a nonlinear mapping function ϕ x for the training dataset g x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n with x i ε r n and y i ε r n as the input and the output target variables the regression function can be approximated by the following equation 1 f x w w ϕ x b where ϕ x and w ϕ x as the feature function and the feature space dot product minimizing the above regression function as given below 2 minimize r f c 1 n i 1 n l ε y f x w 1 2 w 2 3 l ε y f x w 0 if y f x w ε y f x w ε otherwise in eq 2 the first term l ε y f x w and the second term 1 2 w 2 represent the ε insensitive loss function and the

3 results and discussions in this work support vector regression is successfully applied to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions adsorption data for developing the svr based and mlr based model is taken from the available published literature malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 where independent variables are particle size of adsorbent mm solution ph initial concentration of ni ii ion mg l liquid flow rate ml min effluent volume ml height of the bed cm and contact time min the whole dataset of 382 samples is partitioned into two parts as the training dataset of 80 306 runs and the test dataset of 20 76 runs respectively multiple linear regression mlr model is developed using the training dataset and its performance is evaluated for the unseen dataset finally the developed svr model is compared with the commonly used multiple linear regression mlr model over the test unseen dataset on the basis of statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient r average absolute relative error aare root mean square error rmse standard deviation sd mean relative error mre etc furthermore the prediction performance of the svr based model is shown depicting the effect of various independent variables on the removal efficiency of ni ii ions and the comparisons made with experimental data 3 1 multiple linear regression mlr model the independent input parameters for the mlr model are particle size of adsorbent z1 ph of the solution z 2 initial ni ii ion concentration z 3 liquid flow rate z 4 effluent volume z 5 bed height z 6 and contact time z 7 and the removal percent of ni ii ions as the target y 3 1 1 the following mlr based model equation is obtained y 0 1115 0 2689 z1 0 0995 z 2 0 00175 z 3 0 02266 z 4 0 00008 z 5 0 0131 z 6 0 0013 z 7 performance of mlr based model has been shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively poor generalization performance is found for the test dataset unseen data this is due to the fact that the mlr based model uses the empirical risk minimization erm principle minimizing only the empirical error error associated with the training data and does not take into account the model flatness this results in overtraining i e high accuracy for training dataset and low accuracy for the test dataset giving poor generalization performance 3 2 support vector regression model an svr implementation named ε svr present in the libsvm library of matlab is employed for developing the svr model chang and lin 2001 rbf kernel is chosen in this study since it requires only one parameter to be adjusted and possesses good general performance peng and ling 2015 zaidi 2015 grid search technique with 10 fold cross validation is used to obtain the optimal values of the model parameters c ε and the kernel parameter γ by varying these parameters to a wide range of c 25 215 γ 2 15 22 and ε 2 15 24 the optimal values of the model parameters for the svr model are given in table 2 the model outputs have been utilized to construct the training and test course curves as shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively these figures show that the predicted data points via svr based model are close to the experimental data points a comparison between the predicted values of ni ii ions removal efficiency by the svr based model and those obtained from the experiments for the training dataset and the test dataset is shown in the fig 4 the obtained values of model evaluation parameters in table 3 for training and test dataset are very close to each other it can be seen that the results thus obtained with the svr based model are much improved statistical evaluation parameters of the svr based model for the training dataset and the test dataset are shown in table 3 the close proximity of the statistical evaluation parameters between training dataset and test dataset indicate the perfectly trained model 3 3 svr based model versus mlr based model the performance of the developed svr based model is compared with the mlr based model as shown in fig 5 and table 4 it is observed that all the predicted data points for svr based model lie close to the ideal fit line while those for the mlr model are dispersed this clearly depicts the superior prediction performance of the svr based model this is because the svr model is based on structural risk minimization srm principle that optimizes the generalization accuracy around training or empirical error and the model flatness table 4 reveal the superiority of the svr model with lowest value of aare of 6 88 and highest value of coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9861 in comparison to the mlr model the distribution of predicted data points of ni ii ions removal efficiency via svr based model and mlr based models with respect to absolute deviation ad for the training dataset is well illustrated in table 5 93 96 predicted data points fall below 20 ad and 96 64 predicted data points are below 50 ad only 3 36 predicted data points are found above an ad of more than 50 whereas nearly 84 9 predicted data points via mlr based are obtained within an absolute deviation below 50 and a total of 15 1 predicted data points are having more than 50 ad similarly the predicted data point distribution of ni ii ions removal efficiency for the svr based and mlr based models with respect to absolute deviation ad for the test dataset is demonstrated in table 6 it is observed that nearly 93 24 predicted data points are below 20 ad 4 05 predicted data points are in between 20 and 50 of ad or it can be said that 97 3 predicted data points falls below 50 ad only 2 7 deviations are found above an ad of more than 50 while the mlr based model predicts nearly 45 9 data points having an absolute deviation ad below 20 moreover 39 19 predicted data points have the ad in between 20 50 or it can be stated that a total of 85 1 predicted data points have an absolute deviation below 50 only 14 86 predicted data points have an absolute deviation ad above the 50 3 4 performance assessment of the developed svr based model in the light of existing theory and experimental findings 3 4 1 initial ni ii ion concentration effect on the adsorption capacity fig 6 illustrates the sorption breakthrough curves of ni ii ions c t c 0 at different initial ni ii concentration while keeping all other experimental conditions constant the adsorption bed capacity increases from 7 31 to 11 17 mg g as the initial concentration of ni ii is increased from 50 to 200 mg l a faster breakthrough appears at higher initial nickel concentrations and with the decreased inlet nickel ii concentrations breakthrough curves decreases as the lower concentration gradient results in slower transport because of the decreased diffusion coefficient the waste tea bed saturated quickly at ni ii concentration of 200 mg l resulting in earlier breakthrough and exhaustion time malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 predictions made by the svr based model for the ni ii ions adsorption have been shown with dotted line in fig 6 it can be clearly seen from this figure that the svr based model is having better agreement with the experimental data for all the initial ni ii ion concentrations and all the experimental data points lie close to the predicted curve 3 4 2 effect of initial ph values on the adsorption capacity of ni ii ions the metal chemistry in water and the adsorbent surface metal binding sites is greatly affected by the initial ph of the solution the ph of the solutions is varied from 2 0 5 0 while keeping all other experimental conditions at constant as shown in fig 7 the longest breakthrough time and the maximum bed capacity are obtained at 4 0 ph h ions contend with the ni ii ions for the surface of the adsorbent below ph 3 0 providing a hindrance to ni ii ions from reaching the binding sites of the sorbent above ph 5 0 the ni ii ions begin to precipitate because of the formation of nickel hydroxide precipitate malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 the predicted curves for the svr model clearly tailor the experimental values very closely 3 4 3 particle size effect on the adsorption capacity of ni ii ions fig 8 shows that the breakthrough time and maximum bed capacities decrease with the increase in the size of adsorbent particles the performance of adsorption is improved by decreasing the particle size as smaller particles possess a shorter diffusion path with shorter diffusion path the adsorbate diffuses more quickly and deeper into the adsorbent particle giving a higher rate of adsorption a very close match between the predicted breakthrough curves by the svr model and experimental breakthrough curves can be noted in fig 8 similarly the effects of other input parameters such as bed height and flow rates on ni ii ions adsorption capacity have also been investigated as shown in figs 9 and 10 provided in supplementary file it is observed that the simulated results accurately predict the parametric effects on breakthrough curves and follow the same trend as that of the experimental curves thus it can be safely said that the svr based model can be employed to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions under varying experimental conditions a good match between the experimental and predicted values is observed in figs 6 8 and figs 9 10 this may be attributed to the fact that the svr model is utilizing the structural risk minimization srm principle it optimizes the generalization accuracy over the empirical or training error and the model flatness or the capacity of svm on the contrary the mlr and other traditional regression techniques use the empirical risk minimization principle erm which minimizes the empirical error error associated with the training data and does not consider the capacity of the learning machines this results in overtraining i e high accuracy for training data set and low for the test data giving poor generalization performance therefore the prediction performance of the svr model is better with respect to all the independent parameters like bed height flow rate ph particle size etc 4 conclusions svr has been applied in adsorption process to predict the ni ii ions removal efficiency and the results thus obtained have been compared with the mlr model it has been observed that the prediction performance of svr model is much better as compared to the mlr it gives the lowest aare value of 6 88 and a high value of r 0 993 it is also found that the svr model effectively predicts the behavior of the complex interaction process of ni ii ions removal from wastewater under various experimental conditions good svr prediction results can be helpful in the more efficient design and fabrication of an efficient treatment plant for heavy metal rich effluent hence svr can be utilized in chemical engineering and its allied fields for prediction purposes acknowledgments we wish to thank all other authors whose research is consulted in this work especially messrs

cost adsorbent support vector regression structural risk minimization 1 introduction pollution due to ni ii ions is of great concern across the globe because of its toxicity and harmful effects on human health like lung cancer chronic bronchitis dermatitis and asthma sud et al 2008 conventional methods which were used earlier for removal of metal ions like chemical precipitation ion exchange chemical oxidation reduction reverse osmosis etc suffer from many disadvantages such as less efficiency sensitive operating conditions and production of non biodegradable sludge leading to high disposal cost another more powerful technology as an alternative to these existing methods is the adsorption of heavy metals using low cost adsorbent for treating the domestic and industrial wastewater ju and ezuma 2014 in the recent past support vector machines have become very popular for classification and regression purposes as support vector classification svc and support vector regression svr gunn 1997 svr based models do not suffer from over fitting problems i e high accuracy for training dataset and low for test dataset unseen as they are based on structural risk minimization srm principle which always guarantees a unique global and optimal solution svr based models do not rely on the amount of data even with a fewer amount of data they can give a good prediction however the only disadvantage of using svr technique is that it requires an efficient parameter optimization to give prediction with higher accuracy i e svr model parameters needs to be optimized via some optimization techniques grid search methodology with 10 fold cross validation particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga differential evolution de etc the more robust the optimization of svr model parameters the better is the prediction accuracy and generalization of the svr model recently svr has found its application for prediction purposes such as time series

of heavy metals parveen et al 2017a 2016 etc fawzy et al 2016 studied the biosorption process of ni ii and cd ii ions from aqueous solution using typha domingensis as a biosorbent the effects of input parameters such as initial ph biomass dosage initial metal ions concentration contact time and particle size on the biosorption efficiency were also investigated furthermore the experimental data was fitted to langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and biosorption kinetics pseudo first order and pseudo second order were also determined another similar study was performed by fawzy et al 2018 for ni ii ion biosorption from aqueous solution using potamogeton pectinatus as a biosorbent a removal efficiency of 63 4 of ni ii ions was achieved at the optimum ph value of 5 biosorbent dosage 10 g l particle size 0 125 0 25 mm within 180 min artificial neural network ann structure of 5 6 1 predicted the adsorption efficiency with coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 967 the novel support vector regression svr based adsorption model for ni ii ions removal was developed using the experimental data from the published literature malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 tea factory waste was used as an adsorbent and the soluble dirtiness component was removed by washing with distilled water the cleaned and decolorized tea waste was dried at room temperature for a few days ni ii stock solution of 1g l was prepared in distilled water with nicl2 6h2o fixed bed column of perspex tubes 2 0 cm internal diameter and 30 cm in height was used to carry out the experiments the bed length of 30 cm with porosity 0 42 was used column temperature and stream feeding solution was maintained at 25 ᵒc via a thermostatic bath the ranges for the independent input parameters were as follows liquid flow rate 5 20 ml min initial ni ii concentration 50 200 mg l bed height 10 30 cm ph of feed solution 2 0 5 0 and particle size 0 15 0 25 to 1 0 3 0 mm of adsorbent in this work support vector regression svr is applied to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions the whole dataset of 382 samples was partitioned into two parts as the training dataset of 80 306 runs and the test dataset of 20 76 runs respectively the procedure for developing svr model is illustrated in section 2 1 further the svr based model is compared with the mlr model to demonstrate the superior capability of the former with the successful application of ai techniques in the present work we hope that this humble effort shall motivate other workers to explore the use of svr particularly for modeling problems in chemical engineering and its allied fields especially in areas for which the theory is not well developed 2 basic ideas of support vector machines svms a brief description of support vector machines can be found in the literature mat deris et al 2011 parveen et al 2017b smola and schölkopf 2004 vapnik et al 1996 the objective of a ε svr model is to map the input data x into a higher dimensional feature space f via a nonlinear mapping function ϕ x for the training dataset g x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n with x i ε r n and y i ε r n as the input and the output target variables the regression function can be approximated by the following equation 1 f x w w ϕ x b where ϕ x and w ϕ x as the feature function and the feature space dot product minimizing the above regression function as given below 2 minimize r f c 1 n i 1 n l ε y f x w 1 2 w 2 3 l ε y f x w 0 if y f x w ε y f x w ε otherwise in eq 2 the first term l ε y f x w and the second term 1 2 w 2 represent the ε insensitive loss function and the model flatness nandi et al 2004 the term c is a measure of trade off between the training error and the model flatness with the introduction of slack variables ξ and ξ svr function becomes 4 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to 5 y i w ϕ x b ε ξ i 6 w ϕ x b y i ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 the expanded form of the svr is thus given as 7 f x α i α i i 1 n s v α i α i ϕ x i ϕ x j b by solving the above optimization problem qp the coefficients of lagrangian multiplier α and α in eq 7 are obtained the non zero coefficients of α and α and the corresponding input vectors x i are the support vectors svs thus by applying the kernel function the basic svr function is then given by 8 f x α i α i i 1 n s v α i α i k x x i b the term b can be obtained by applying karush kuhn tucker kkt conditions 2 1 svr based modeling procedure the steps involved in the development of the svr based model are lee and chern 2013 shi et al 2012 collection of data consisting of independent and dependent variables preprocessing of data normalization and scaling of data is done the whole dataset is divided into training and test dataset using simple random sampling technique srs appropriate kernel is selected amongst various kernel functions namely linear polynomial sigmoid radial basis function rbf etc the svr model parameters c ε rbf kernel γ is optimized using grid search methodology with 10 fold cross validation model training is done with the optimum value of the model parameters c ε γ performance of the model is evaluated in terms of statistical measures such as average absolute relative error aare root mean square error rmse standard deviation sd mean relative error mre leave one out cross validation on training dataset q l o o 2 and leave one out cross validation on test dataset q e x t 2 3 results and discussions in this work support vector regression is successfully applied to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions adsorption data for developing the svr based and mlr based model is taken from the available published literature malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 where independent variables are particle size of adsorbent mm solution ph initial concentration of ni ii ion mg l liquid flow rate ml min effluent volume ml height of the bed cm and contact time min the whole dataset of 382 samples is partitioned into two parts as the training dataset of 80 306 runs and the test dataset of 20 76 runs respectively multiple linear regression mlr model is developed using the training dataset and its performance is evaluated for the unseen dataset finally the developed svr model is compared with the commonly used multiple linear regression mlr model over the test unseen dataset on the basis of statistical parameters such as correlation coefficient r average absolute relative error aare root mean square error rmse standard deviation sd mean relative error mre etc furthermore the prediction performance of the svr based model is shown depicting the effect of various independent variables on the removal efficiency of ni ii ions and the comparisons made with experimental data 3 1 multiple linear regression mlr model the independent input parameters for the mlr model are particle size of adsorbent z1 ph of the solution z 2 initial ni ii ion concentration z 3 liquid flow rate z 4 effluent volume z 5 bed height z 6 and contact time z 7 and the removal percent of ni ii ions as the target y 3 1 1 the following mlr based model equation is obtained y 0 1115 0 2689 z1 0 0995 z 2 0 00175 z 3 0 02266 z 4 0 00008 z 5 0 0131 z 6 0 0013 z 7 performance of mlr based model has been shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively poor generalization performance is found for the test dataset unseen data this is due to the fact that the mlr based model uses the empirical risk minimization erm principle minimizing only the empirical error error associated with the training data and does not take into account the model flatness this results in overtraining i e high accuracy for training dataset and low accuracy for the test dataset giving poor generalization performance 3 2 support vector regression model an svr implementation named ε svr present in the libsvm library of matlab is employed for developing the svr model chang and lin 2001 rbf kernel is chosen in this study since it requires only one parameter to be adjusted and possesses good general performance peng and ling 2015 zaidi 2015 grid search technique with 10 fold cross validation is used to obtain the optimal values of the model parameters c ε and the kernel parameter γ by varying these parameters to a wide range of c 25 215 γ 2 15 22 and ε 2 15 24 the optimal values of the model parameters for the svr model are given in table 2 the model outputs have been utilized to construct the training and test course curves as shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively these figures show that the predicted data points via svr based model are close to the experimental data points a comparison between the predicted values of ni ii ions removal efficiency by the svr based model and those obtained from the experiments for the training dataset and the test dataset is shown in the fig 4 the obtained values of model evaluation parameters in table 3 for training and test dataset are very close to each other it can be seen that the results thus obtained with the svr based model are much improved statistical evaluation parameters of the svr based model for the training dataset and the test dataset are shown in table 3 the close proximity of the statistical evaluation parameters between training dataset and test dataset indicate the perfectly trained model 3 3 svr based model versus mlr based model the performance of the developed svr based model is compared with the mlr based model as shown in fig 5 and table 4 it is observed that all the predicted data points for svr based model lie close to the ideal fit line while those for the mlr model are dispersed this clearly depicts the superior prediction performance of the svr based model this is because the svr model is based on structural risk minimization srm principle that optimizes the generalization accuracy around training or empirical error and the model flatness table 4 reveal the superiority of the svr model with lowest value of aare of 6 88 and highest value of coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9861 in comparison to the mlr model the distribution of predicted data points of ni ii ions removal efficiency via svr based model and mlr based models with respect to absolute deviation ad for the training dataset is well illustrated in table 5 93 96 predicted data points fall below 20 ad and 96 64 predicted data points are below 50 ad only 3 36 predicted data points are found above an ad of more than 50 whereas nearly 84 9 predicted data points via mlr based are obtained within an absolute deviation below 50 and a total of 15 1 predicted data points are having more than 50 ad similarly the predicted data point distribution of ni ii ions removal efficiency for the svr based and mlr based models with respect to absolute deviation ad for the test dataset is demonstrated in table 6 it is observed that nearly 93 24 predicted data points are below 20 ad 4 05 predicted data points are in between 20 and 50 of ad or it can be said that 97 3 predicted data points falls below 50 ad only 2 7 deviations are found above an ad of more than 50 while the mlr based model predicts nearly 45 9 data points having an absolute deviation ad below 20 moreover 39 19 predicted data points have the ad in between 20 50 or it can be stated that a total of 85 1 predicted data points have an absolute deviation below 50 only 14 86 predicted data points have an absolute deviation ad above the 50 3 4 performance assessment of the developed svr based model in the light of existing theory and experimental findings 3 4 1 initial ni ii ion concentration effect on the adsorption capacity fig 6 illustrates the sorption breakthrough curves of ni ii ions c t c 0 at different initial ni ii concentration while keeping all other experimental conditions constant the adsorption bed capacity increases from 7 31 to 11 17 mg g as the initial concentration of ni ii is increased from 50 to 200 mg l a faster breakthrough appears at higher initial nickel concentrations and with the decreased inlet nickel ii concentrations breakthrough curves decreases as the lower concentration gradient results in slower transport because of the decreased diffusion coefficient the waste tea bed saturated quickly at ni ii concentration of 200 mg l resulting in earlier breakthrough and exhaustion time malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 predictions made by the svr based model for the ni ii ions adsorption have been shown with dotted line in fig 6 it can be clearly seen from this figure that the svr based model is having better agreement with the experimental data for all the initial ni ii ion concentrations and all the experimental data points lie close to the predicted curve 3 4 2 effect of initial ph values on the adsorption capacity of ni ii ions the metal chemistry in water and the adsorbent surface metal binding sites is greatly affected by the initial ph of the solution the ph of the solutions is varied from 2 0 5 0 while keeping all other experimental conditions at constant as shown in fig 7 the longest breakthrough time and the maximum bed capacity are obtained at 4 0 ph h ions contend with the ni ii ions for the surface of the adsorbent below ph 3 0 providing a hindrance to ni ii ions from reaching the binding sites of the sorbent above ph 5 0 the ni ii ions begin to precipitate because of the formation of nickel hydroxide precipitate malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 the predicted curves for the svr model clearly tailor the experimental values very closely 3 4 3 particle size effect on the adsorption capacity of ni ii ions fig 8 shows that the breakthrough time and maximum bed capacities decrease with the increase in the size of adsorbent particles the performance of adsorption is improved by decreasing the particle size as smaller particles possess a shorter diffusion path with shorter diffusion path the adsorbate diffuses more quickly and deeper into the adsorbent particle giving a higher rate of adsorption a very close match between the predicted breakthrough curves by the svr model and experimental breakthrough curves can be noted in fig 8 similarly the effects of other input parameters such as bed height and flow rates on ni ii ions adsorption capacity have also been investigated as shown in figs 9 and 10 provided in supplementary file it is observed that the simulated results accurately predict the parametric effects on breakthrough curves and follow the same trend as that of the experimental curves thus it can be safely said that the svr based model can be employed to predict the removal efficiency of ni ii ions under varying experimental conditions a good match between the experimental and predicted values is observed in figs 6 8 and figs 9 10 this may be attributed to the fact that the svr model is utilizing the structural risk minimization srm principle it optimizes the generalization accuracy over the empirical or training error and the model flatness or the capacity of svm on the contrary the mlr and other traditional regression techniques use the empirical risk minimization principle erm which minimizes the empirical error error associated with the training data and does not consider the capacity of the learning machines this results in overtraining i e high accuracy for training data set and low for the test data giving poor generalization performance therefore the prediction performance of the svr model is better with respect to all the independent parameters like bed height flow rate ph particle size etc 4 conclusions svr has been applied in adsorption process to predict the ni ii ions removal efficiency and the results thus obtained have been compared with the mlr model it has been observed that the prediction performance of svr model is much better as compared to the mlr it gives the lowest aare value of 6 88 and a high value of r 0 993 it is also found that the svr model effectively predicts the behavior of the complex interaction process of ni ii ions removal from wastewater under various experimental conditions good svr prediction results can be helpful in the more efficient design and fabrication of an efficient treatment plant for heavy metal rich effluent hence svr can be utilized in chemical engineering and its allied fields for prediction purposes acknowledgments we wish to thank all other authors whose research is consulted in this work especially messrs

12223,this study aims to evaluate the role of people s risk perception and their socioeconomic demographic and other social correlates in providing sustainable arsenic mitigation we interviewed the head of 340 households in three arsenic affected villages of bihar india a conceptual framework of risk perception and decision making of arsenic mitigation technology is used to capture possible predictors of risk perception bivariate analysis was performed to derive the predictors of risk perception and cross tab analysis was conducted to calculate novel findings a majority of the respondents were willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies as a result of their higher perceived risks to health and income than social discrimination risk respondents caste education level agricultural landholdings and social trust were the strongest predictors of perceived health risks in addition to these factors income sanitation practices people s prioritization of socio environmental problems arsenic awareness and social capital were the strongest predictors of perceived economic risk respondents agricultural landholdings prioritization of social problems arsenic awareness and social capital were the strongest predictors of perceived social discrimination risk arsenic mitigation is highly likely to be successful among communities with greater perceived health and economic risks the households with higher perceived social discrimination risk should be targeted for arsenic awareness program along with the mitigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic health risk perception economic risk perception social discrimination risk perception decision making socioeconomic demographic social capital 1 introduction worldwide nearly 300 million individuals lives are potentially at risk due to the exposure to groundwater arsenic contamination chakraborti et al 2017 2018 murcott 2012 studies suggest that the less adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions by the arsenic exposed communities has hindered the sustainable arsenic mitigation initiatives hossain et al 2015 jakariya et al 2007 kabir and howard 2007 singh and stern 2017 consequently these individuals still consume arsenic contaminated water more than the permissible limit of 10 μg l established by the world health organization india and bangladesh being at the higher risk chakraborti et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 several studies have highlighted that individuals with higher perceived risks tend to adopt environmental mitigation policies gerber and neeley 2005 kunreuther and slovic 1996 risk perception studies also help in evolving the understanding of individuals decision making processes of the adoption of environmental mitigation technologies the risk perception framework is applied in an array of environmental challenges such as climate change natural hazards flood insurance coastal environment protection landslides and air pollution bickerstaff 2004 carlton and jacobson 2013 damm et al 2013 huang et al 2013 jones et al 2013 however only handful studies have highlighted the role of individuals perceived risks of groundwater contamination in taking proactive protective actions such as significant increase in expenses on mitigation activities abdalla et al 1992 janmaat 2007 groundwater arsenic contamination is an environmental hazard and because of the lack of communities involvement in arsenic mitigation programs efficient technologies to identify the arsenic safe aquifer and cost effective arsenic mitigation technologies most of the arsenic mitigation programs could not attain sustainability hossain et al 2017 singh and stern 2017 although technology based arsenic mitigation solutions have embraced arsenic mitigation sustainability research technological challenges in the adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies and preferences of arsenic mitigation technologies by the arsenic exposed communities have been recently studied in bangladesh and india hossain et al 2014 2015 singh 2015 singh et al 2017 these scientific reports highlight the significance of socioeconomic demographic and other social factors in the successful adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies hossain et al 2015 singh et al 2008 2017 singh 2015 nevertheless studies on peoples perceived risks and their impact on decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation are still in its early stages singh 2015 singh and taylor 2018 a few studies have highlighted the fact that risk perception plays a vital role in ensuring arsenic mitigation sustainability in this context walker et al 2006 found that consumers who perceive health risk associated with drinking arsenic contaminated water were about five times less likely to consume arsenic polluted tap water walker et al 2006 mcspirit and reid 2011 reported that people s perception of poor drinking water quality in west virginia usa significantly influenced the amount of bottled water purchased mcspirit and reid 2011 mankad and tapsuwan 2011 have suggested that perceptions associated with the threat i e vulnerability risk severity and response efficacy could influence public acceptance of decentralized water supplies mankad and tapsuwan 2011 furthermore the value of clean arsenic free potable water to rural populations such as those that are the subject of this paper is influenced by their risk perceptions and has important implications for social acceptability of arsenic mitigation technologies being promoted if affected individuals do not have much concern for arsenic contamination despite its known dangers and place a low value on arsenic free drinking water then the cost of mitigation technologies may turn out to be a significant hindrance to their promotion among rural households ahmad et al 2005 this point was largely unappreciated in the past so far we did not encounter any existing studies that have evaluated decision making for better environmental services under perceived risks to income economic risk or risk of social discrimination in other words the risk is most often considered a singular undifferentiated construct neglecting its various economic social and health dimensions as such the roles that socioeconomic and demographic factors play in the perception of risk from arsenic exposure as well as on its actual health impacts are not well understood hanchett 2004 however such information could help us determine what types of intervention programs would be more effective and also help in terms of tailoring the outreach messages to the specific circumstances involving a community perceptions are particularly important since research has also shown that awareness of groundwater arsenic contamination does not always lead to the adoption of mitigation techniques such as filtration konishi and coggins 2008 walker et al 2006 2008 although existing research has underscored the need to contextualize risk perception of arsenic in the broader socioeconomic and technological settings severtson et al 2006 there exist important research gaps in studying the role of risk perception in the adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies while a variety of studies highlight the association between socioeconomic and demographic factors including household income number of children gender age and general trust and people s risk perception dosman et al 2001 siegrist et al 2005 none of them have attempted to investigate the causal relationships between socioeconomic and demographic factors knowledge and awareness institutional trust social capital and social trust to risk perceptions in the context of arsenic contamination singh 2015 singh and taylor 2018 this study aims to address two primary goals related to the aforementioned gaps a to investigate people s decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived risks to health income economic and social discrimination to arsenic and b to analyze the socioeconomic demographic and other factors that construct people s risk perceptions to groundwater arsenic contamination this article is an extended and detailed version of the study first presented in a conference singh and taylor 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 administration of the survey based on the prevailing levels of arsenic severity and the arsenic mitigation initiatives new hand pumps deep tube wells and arsenic treatment units three villages namely suarmarwa rampur diara and bhawani tola of the maner block of patna district in bihar india were selected for this study singh 2015 singh and ghosh 2012 singh et al 2014 2018 thakur and gupta 2016 fig 1 the survey design and implementation procedure were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the authors institution the questionnaires were provided to the villagers along with the principal investigator s personal plea briefly explaining the objectives of the project and its potential benefits to society the target populations were adults only therefore written consent forms were provided only to adults in the villages the respondents were surveyed only after receiving their signed consent forms in the cases of illiterate respondents the personal plea and the consent forms were read to them and their thumb impressions were obtained if they agreed to participate in the survey in case of refusal to participate in the survey or even hesitation the interview was ended immediately only two of 340 people approached declined to participate in the survey a couple of respondents asked the surveyor to explain the project and potential benefits to the village in more detail before deciding to participate in the study singh 2015 a detailed description of the survey administration is provided in singh 2015 in brief the surveyed populations were randomly selected and stratified by the variable of caste as the castes forward 1 1 forward caste upper caste at the top of the social stratification in indian villages backward 2 2 backward caste lower than the upper caste group that has been categorized as other backward classes by constitutional provision it consists of those castes which like the scheduled castes were in the past subjected to exclusions and therefore remained socially and educationally backward despite having a higher position than the scheduled castes in the local traditional caste hierarchy and scheduled 3 3 scheduled caste at the bottom of the social stratification consists of those castes that were associated with the most impure work and menial labor with no possibility of upward mobility and were subjected to serve social exclusion and disadvantages in comparison to the other castes caste are the sub groups of the population in the project area which are internally homogeneous but externally heterogeneous unsd 2008 the following equation eq 1 was used to derive the total number of households to be covered in each caste group including forward upper backward and scheduled caste 1 t o t a l n u m b e r o f h o u s e h o l d s t o b e c o v e r e d g r o u p s i z e s a m p l e s i z e t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n s i z e where group size total population of the caste group sample size 110 and total population size total population of the village a minimum sample size of 100 was decided following a standard statistical number for households surveys warner 2012 in suarmarwa a total of 43 111 of 260 in rampur diara a total of 24 119 of 500 and in bhawani tola a total of 22 110 of 500 households were surveyed the head of the households was randomly surveyed in the tola mahallah 4 4 tola or mahallah is a small unit of the neighborhood in rural areas in the project area wikipedia 2015 mahallah wikipedia the free enclopedia getting unbiased information from a rural community is challenging due to factors such as low literacy isolation and a widespread feeling of distrust of outsiders contacting the village head or a reliable person who is well known in the community was the first step toward starting the survey in the villages the survey was conducted between april and august of 2013 foreign visitors to villages are perceived as being concerned with their benefits so trust is key to earning cooperation the researchers must also have ample funding support to conduct the survey to reduce this bias against visitors it is critical to convince the village head or the young adults who would assist in administering the surveys in the community of the seriousness of the work and the potential benefits to the society prior experience working with the communities and an understanding of the local socioeconomic cultural and political environment play a vital role in convincing respondents that the project will benefit society thereby increasing the likelihood of honest responses the author met the village heads and or village representatives and discussed the project goals and survey strategy the village heads or representatives were then asked to recommend 6 8 people to assist in conducting the survey the 6 8 team members were chosen based on their education awareness of general environmental or social issues interpersonal and communication skills and social networks it is important to mention here that maintaining a positive and respectful attitude avoiding arguments with villagers showing commitment towards the work and being respectful to respondents are the most important factors in establishing credibility among villagers the team members were trained in the use of the survey instrument by explaining each question followed by open discussion to clarify any doubts an experienced member proved to be helpful in such debates by having an opportunity to speak up and share his her experience this helped to conduct the survey smoothly about 15 people were provided with the questionnaire and the survey was pre tested and discussed among the team members the ideal periods for meeting respondents and conducting surveys were mid morning and late afternoon it took approximately 40 min for each respondent to complete the survey the respondents were approached individually first the background of the research was explained and the importance of their honest and unbiased responses was emphasized the answers were noted as communicated and simultaneously were entered into an ms excel spreadsheet version 2010 later the data were coded in the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version 21 for windows for further analysis a total of 340 households comprising a total population of about 2500 were surveyed with a 99 response rate the questionnaire was initially developed in english and was translated into hindi for the respondents singh 2015 people s risk perceptions were measured to evaluate the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technology s under scenarios of perceived risks to their health income economy and social discrimination or isolation participants were presented with three scenarios to elicit their decision to adopt or not arsenic mitigation technology s a would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive health risk due to drinking arsenic contaminated water b would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive economic risk due to expenses from arsenic induced health problems c would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive social discrimination risk due to arsenic induced diseases responses were recorded on a 5 point likert scale i e strongly agree agree neutral disagree and strongly disagree scored from 1 to 5 respectively 2 2 data analysis statistical package for social sciences spss ibm version 21 in windows environment was used for statistical analysis ibm 2012 spss 2012 descriptive analysis for all the variables was performed to determine the percentage frequency of each variable in the surveyed villages a detailed village wise analysis is presented in singh 2015 here we have presented the cumulative frequency of each variable a bivariate analysis was performed between the risk perceptions health economic and social discrimination and socioeconomic demographic and other variables ibm 2012 spss 2012 warner 2012 which helped to evaluate the relationship between the two variables pattern linear vs nonlinear of the relationship strength of the relationship between the two variables direction of the relationship and whether the results can be generalized to the sampled population nzssds 2002 warner 2012 the alpha level of significance for all the analysis was set at 0 05 the standardized residual and z scores were also derived to interpret the results with precision for example which cell s produced a statistically significant difference utexas 2014 warner 2012 a critical value of 1 96 corresponding to an alpha of 0 05 was chosen to compare the size of the standardized residuals utexas 2014 warner 2012 2 3 conceptual model and determinants of risk perception of groundwater arsenic the arsenic risk perception model has been conceptualized based on the hypothesis h1 the arsenic exposed communities will adopt arsenic mitigation technologies or programs under perceived health risk perceived economic risk and perceived risk of social discrimination and h2 the existing socioeconomic and demographic factors people s prioritization of socio environmental problems and social capital are major drivers in constructing people s perceived risks fig 2 2 3 1 socioeconomic and demographic characteristics gender age level of education marital status income housing status ethnicity and race have been commonly studied to evaluate their predictive capacities in shaping people s risk perceptions botzen et al 2009 glatron and beck 2008 generally age has been found to have a positive correlation with risk perception of hazards lindell and hwang 2008 however negative associations of risk perception and age have also been reported botzen et al 2009 gender is often found to be an essential determinant of risk perception as women often perceive risks more than men shepherd et al 2011 additionally individuals with a high income and education level have been found to have a lower perception of risks akompab et al 2013 along with these most common socioeconomic and demographic variables we have incorporated caste and agricultural landholdings of the surveyed communities these variables have been selected for this study based on literature review field studies by the authors and meetings with the communities in arsenic contaminated areas caste which is an important variable in this study is salient because it is a proxy for social class as determined by distinctions of hereditary rank profession or wealth blair 1973 in indian villages caste is still the principal institution structuring allegiances and relationships and also plays a very important role in the realm of politics sahay 2009 a large and powerful caste group can be more easily dominant if its position in the local caste hierarchy is not too low srinivas 1955 the practices of a dominant caste are often emulated by lower castes thereby becoming a de facto social model in a village due to their prestige it is common for upper caste individuals to be consulted by other castes on important occasions including ceremonial ones sahay 2009 tsujita and oda 2012 because of such asymmetrical social hierarchy elite capture of resources by the dominant caste usually politically and or economically powerful groups has been a common story in many regions of india 2 3 2 water and sanitation factors time spent and distance traveled to collect water has been reported as two of the major hindrances in the success of arsenic mitigation programs we were interested to know if these two factors have any effect on the individual s perceived health risk economic risk and social discrimination risk in the villages in rural areas the sanitation status or practices of the communities could be directly connected to their socioeconomic status and awareness level about health and hygiene padder 2013 therefore information about household sanitation practices was gathered with the help of questions about the place for defecation and materials used for washing hands after defecation 2 3 3 knowledge and awareness about arsenic knowledge and awareness play very important roles in constructing people s risk perception as it is difficult to perceive arsenic risk in the absence of any understanding of its existence and adverse impacts akompab et al 2013 therefore awareness about arsenic contamination and associated health risks would be a pre requisite for the existence of perceptions of risk resulting from arsenic exposure an in depth analysis of arsenic awareness in the studied area is provided in singh et al 2018 in brief the respondents knowledge and awareness about arsenic was collected using a set of ten questions e g do you know what arsenic is do you know the source s of arsenic have you heard about arsenic and arsenic related health problems is your drinking water source contaminated with arsenic is there any arsenic mitigation program operating in your area and is the arsenic mitigation program technique effective in your area singh et al 2018 2 3 4 people s prioritization of socio environmental problems some studies have demonstrated that people who give priority to environmental issues often perceive the greater risk to the environment in their locality slimak and dietz 2006 the studied areas have multiple social and environmental problems including floods poverty poor water quality and limited water accessibility therefore the information about the respondents prioritization of socio environmental problems would generate baseline data as well as help us in evaluating its impact on risk perceptions 2 3 5 social capital social capital offers a lens to study the co evolution of social networks and norms in the generation of adaptive capacity among collectives pelling and high 2005 such as communities organizations and sites at the individual level it reflects an individual s social relations and networks and at the community level it embraces social values equity and trust in others janssens et al 2004 social capital has been largely neglected in most risk perception investigations in this study we hypothesize that the communities or an individual with high social capital will perceive less risk the underlying assumption based on the literature is that high social capital lessens the feeling of vulnerability with the result that individuals perceive less risk from their local problems de carolis and saparito 2006 evaluating social capital in arsenic contaminated areas would help us understand how individuals social capital influences their risk perceptions social capital was evaluated at community and individual levels 2 3 5 1 social capital at the community level community level social capital was assessed through evaluating the presence and functionality of institutions and their trusts in agencies in the project area anganwadi self help groups and mahila samakhya are the three most active and visible grassroots institutions studies showed that self help groups have worked to build the foundation of social capital janssens et al 2004 anganwadi courtyard shelter is a government of india s child care and mother care unit at panchayat levels comprised of mostly female health workers anganwadi 2014 the mahila samakhya is a women s empowerment program of the government of india designed to aid socioeconomically impoverished women through increased literacy janssens et al 2004 self help groups are also comprised of socioeconomically disadvantaged women in villages in india and other south asian countries financial support to the self help group members is achieved through a fund developed by the group members regular savings social empowerment through micro finance fouillet and augsburg 2007 in a recent study the mahila samakhya was found to have successfully helped to generate social capital in the state janssens et al 2004 these institutions are also very active and successful in other social innovation programs like total sanitation campaign in bihar india janssens et al 2004 therefore evaluating the presence and functionality of such institutions would help us understand the role of the existing institutions in shaping communities risk perception people who have trust in institutions involved in mitigation activities are found to perceive less risk to existing environmental issues in their neighborhood carlton and jacobson 2013 trusts in institutions were derived for government agencies non governmental agencies panchayati raj institutions private agencies and academics scientists 2 3 5 2 social capital at the individual level social trust has been identified as one of the primary social factors that influence people s risk perception of their environment with higher levels of social trust linked to lower levels of perceived risk carlton and jacobson 2013 individuals social capital was evaluated through respondents social trust and their social capital social trust was assessed via people s trust in their neighbors and others individuals social capital was evaluated through whether other community members sought their advice and valued their views and whether they participate in panchayat activities 3 results and discussions 3 1 socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the surveyed population the detailed socioeconomic and demographic survey results are explained in singh 2015 here we present a village wise comparison of socioeconomic and demographic survey results that help to understand the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the surveyed population fig 3 a o the gender of the participants was significantly different p 0 038 across the three villages the majority being the male 95 respondents fig 3 a the maximum participation in the survey was by the backward castes followed by the forward castes and the scheduled castes respectively fig 3 d a majority 94 of the respondents was married 6 had never been married and one respondent was widowed fig 3 c 5 5 single respondents who were never married or were a widow or abandoned regarding the level of education a total of 86 of the population had some level of education fig 3 e however the rest of the population 14 was illiterate although the average literacy rate in the area was greater than the state s literacy rate of 35 the majority of the population had only a primary level of education followed by a secondary and a college level of education respectively fig 3 e six people per household were found to be the average family size in the area fig 3 f the occupation of the majority of the population was found to be either wage labor 39 or agriculture 34 fig 3 g the majority of the respondents 71 earn between rs 500 to rs 10 000 just above the poverty line 18 earned more than rs 10 000 per month and 11 below the poverty level bpl with a monthly income less than rs 500 fig 3 h the largest proportion 37 of the population was found to live in kachcha 6 6 kachcha house houses with temporary roofs made with cemented floor and or wall mud houses followed by pucca 7 7 pucca house houses with flooring roof and walls should be cemented brick houses thatched roof and straw made roof houses respectively fig 3 j altogether a total of 33 of the population was found to be living in poorly constructed structures mostly made of straw or mud housing status is generally associated with income however it was observed that a few respondents with higher income intentionally avoided better houses as they wanted to hide or avoid exposing their income to the villagers eighty one percent of the respondents were defecating in open places regardless of toilet availability only 19 of the population used toilets for defecation fig 3 n it was very surprising that the total sanitation campaign program the government of india s most ambitious program to accomplish one of the millennium development goals had almost no impact on the sanitation practices in the surveyed population 3 2 hypothesis i perceived risks and decision making for arsenic mitigation technologies the vast majority of individuals 91 perceives health risk due to drinking arsenic contaminated water and was willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 1 about 66 of the respondents perceive economic risk from arsenic contamination only 46 of the surveyed population connects risk of social discrimination with arsenic contamination table 1 the respondents showed a neutral response to perceived social discrimination risk with the numbers almost equally split between those who perceive social discrimination risk and others who disagree or are neutral table 1 originally the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived risks were recorded at the five point likert scale for further analysis the response levels were collapsed to disagree by adding strongly disagree and disagree neutral no change and agree by adding strongly agree and agree we investigated which response categories agree neutral and disagree for the health risk perception economic risk perception and social discrimination risk perception had the greatest inter village differences the respondents of rampur diara village were slightly more likely 93 to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk than the respondents of suarmarwa 90 and bhawani tola 89 villages table 2 a the percentage differences were small but statistically significant p 0 006 and there was a curvilinear association between the villages and the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk after reviewing the health survey reports we found that among the three surveyed villages suarmarwa had the highest arsenicosis symptoms as well as other health diseases followed by rampur diara and bhawani tola singh and taylor 2019 table 2 b presents a crosstabs analysis between respondents decision to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived economic risk and the surveyed villages the residents of rampur diara village were more likely 72 to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived economic risk than the respondents of suarmarwa 68 and bhawani tola 59 villages table 2 b the association between the two variables was similar to the association between health risk perception and the surveyed villages the crosstabs analysis between respondents decision to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived social discrimination risk and the surveyed villages revealed that the individuals of suarmarwa village 53 and rampur diara 49 were more likely to perceive social discrimination risk than bhawani tola 37 table 2 c the health risk p 0 006 economic risk p 0 001 and social discrimination risk p 0 001 perceived by the respondents were different across the surveyed villages and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp tables 2a 2c high perceived health and economic risks in rampur diara village could be linked to the arsenic awareness among the surveyed communities this village has been more widely investigated for groundwater soil and food contamination by arsenic than the other two villages singh 2011 singh and ghosh 2011 2012 moreover several arsenic mitigation programs and projects have been executed in rampur diara that might have raised arsenic awareness among the communities hadi 2003 therefore the greater perceived health risk to arsenic contamination and potential economic burden as a consequence of health problems in rampur diara village could be linked to arsenic awareness to confirm this we performed a crosstabs analysis between arsenic awareness and the three surveyed villages we found that rampur diara village was more likely to be aware of arsenic and associated issues high awareness 53 3 than suarmarwa high awareness 26 7 and bhawani tola high awareness 20 0 furthermore we attempted to find a logical reason for a higher perceived social discrimination risk in suarmarwa and rampur diara than bhawani tola based on the crosstabs analysis we found that suarmarwa village had only two caste groups dominated by the backward caste 76 6 and the scheduled caste 23 4 however in rampur diara the forward caste 62 2 was more prevalent than the backward caste 18 5 and the scheduled caste 19 3 this unequal caste distribution might be responsible for greater social discrimination risk perception in these two villages in bhawani tola the castes were more evenly distributed forward caste 42 7 backward caste 37 3 and scheduled caste 20 0 a possible explanation for the observed difference in perceived social discrimination risk may relate to greater dominance of upper caste or backward caste over lower caste groups in suarmarwa and rampur diara which makes social discrimination an ever present risk and the residents more sensitized to it hoff and pandey 2006 3 3 factors influencing the likelihood of adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived risks 3 3 1 factors influencing the likelihood of adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived health risk variables such as caste education level agricultural landholdings housing status presence and functionality of anganwadi and social capital people who participate in panchayat activities were found to have a contributing effect on communities perceived health risk moreover people s perceived economic risk was found to be strongly positively correlated with the respondents health risk perception in sum educated higher caste communities who own land live in better housing structures and had trust in anganwadi in the area tend to perceive more health risk therefore under perceived health risk communities that possess the above mentioned characteristics will adopt arsenic mitigation technology in the arsenic contaminated areas the results of bivariate analyses showed that there was a very strong positive correlation between respondents perceived health risk social discrimination risk and their perceived economic risk it further shows that the communities that had high perceived health risk and social discrimination risk were likely to perceive more economic risk likewise a strong positive correlation was derived between caste education level housing status sanitation behavior place for defecation and material used to wash hands after defecation people s prioritization of social problems lack of land lack of school and poverty arsenic awareness trust in agencies ngos panchayati raj institutions private agencies and individual social capital as neighbors and others sought and valued their advice with the residents perceived economic risk fig 4 however a strong negative correlation was observed between people s prioritization of socio environmental problems lack of health facilities flood drought water accessibility and water quality and presence and functionality of institutions anganwadi with the respondents perceived economic risk fig 4 in sum socio demographic factors caste education and housing status sanitation practice people s prioritization of socio environmental problems arsenic awareness presence and functionality of institution anganwadi trust in agencies and social capital were found to be strong predictors of the perceived economic risk of the communities in comparison to the other two perceived risks economic and health risks we found fewer predictors for perceived risk of social discrimination none of the socioeconomic and demographic factors except agricultural landholdings was found to be a statistically significant predictor of the communities social risk perception people with larger agricultural landholdings who spent more time collecting water and traveled a distance of 50 m and the communities that had higher trust in mahila samakhya and self help groups were strongly negatively correlated with their social discrimination risk perception fig 4 in contrast those who were aware of arsenic contamination who had trust in ngos and panchayati raj institutions and the respondents with higher social capital were found to be strongly positively correlated with their perceived social discrimination risk fig 4 furthermore communities social discrimination risk perception was found to be strongly positively correlated with their perceived economic risk 3 4 novel findings 3 4 1 caste and risk perceptions there was a positive linear relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk and caste the respondents who belong to the upper caste are more likely than those who belong to lower caste to perceive health risk and therefore are willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 3 a the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk was different across the respondents of the three caste groups p 0 018 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk and caste the respondents who belong to the upper caste are more likely than those who belong to lower caste to perceive the economic risk to arsenic contamination and are willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 3 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents of the three caste groups p 0 001 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp the likelihood to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk among forward caste respondents was about 1 75 times greater and among backward caste respondents about 1 5 times higher than the scheduled caste respondents table 3 b ethnicity and race have been studied to derive risk perception under multi hazard environments and floods since ethnicity and race both represent a social hierarchy the association of castes with risk perceptions in our study could be explained in analogous terms with the ethnicity and race of the respondents lindell and hwang 2008 petrolia et al 2013 3 4 2 agricultural landholdings and risk perception there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk and agricultural landholdings table 4 a the respondents who own land are more likely than those who do not to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived health risk the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents who do and do not have landholdings p 0 014 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 4 a there was a negative relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived social discrimination risk and agricultural landholdings the respondents who own land are less likely than those who do not to perceive social discrimination risk and therefore less likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 4 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived social discrimination risk was different across the respondents who do or do not have landholdings p 0 035 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 4 b 3 4 3 water and sanitation behavior and risk perception the respondents who spent more than 10 min collecting water are less likely to perceive social discrimination risk than those who spend more time collecting water those who spend less than 10 min collecting water are less likely adopting arsenic mitigation technology table 5 a respondents who collect water from outside hand pumps requires traveling approximately 50 m far have more opportunity to interact with other community members this is a common practice that builds social capital consequently these respondents feel less vulnerable the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the water collection time groups p 0 005 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 5 a the respondents who practice good sanitation habits i e use a toilet for defecation and use soap or ash for hand washing are more likely to perceive economic risk and more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who prefer to defecate in open fields and use soil for hand washing table 5 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents sanitation habits p 0 002 and p 0 012 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 5 b 3 4 4 arsenic awareness and risk perceptions there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk and arsenic awareness table 6 the respondents who had high arsenic awareness are more likely to perceive economic risk and more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no arsenic awareness the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the arsenic awareness levels p 0 001 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 6 the likelihood to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk was approximately 1 6 times greater among those who had greater arsenic awareness than the respondents with no arsenic awareness 3 4 5 social capital and risk perceptions the respondents who reported that there was no mahila samakhya in the villages perceive greater social discrimination than respondents with a neutral or neutral view of mahila samakhya and were more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 7 a the respondents who had no view on the presence and functionality of the self help group and those who put a high score on the unavailability of a self help group in the village perceived higher social discrimination risk these respondents showed greater agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived social discrimination risk than those who had a clear view agreed and disagreed on the presence and functionality table 7 b the respondents who had trust in ngos and those had no view on this issue perceive higher social discrimination risk and are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no trust in ngos table 7 c the respondents who had trust in pris perceive greater social discrimination risk therefore they are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no trust or had no view in pris table 7 d the respondents who perceived that their neighbors and others sought their advice and valued their views are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived social discrimination risk than those with the opposite or neutral perception on this matter table 7 e the role of trust in institutions and social capital are not always predictors of risk perception our findings of the institutional trust and social trust as the strongest predictors of risk perceptions are in agreement with prior research de frança doria et al 2009 dobbie and brown 2014 doria et al 2009 vaske et al 2008 in contrast carlton and jacobson 2013 have recently reported that social trust did not influence risk perceptions we agree with the authors recommendation that the inconsistent results are because of the system studied additionally another probable explanation could be that the indicators or the variables used to define risk perception were not of a similar nature and the studied areas and contexts were also heterogeneous 4 conclusions and policy implications this study provides insights into communities decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under their perceived risks to health income and social discrimination to groundwater arsenic contamination the findings are potentially advantageous to policymakers as this help identify the mechanisms of decision making to adopt better environmental services for the communities wellbeing risk perception in general but health economic and social discrimination risk perceptions in particular cause individuals to take precautionary measures and support policies aimed at arsenic mitigation botzen et al 2009 a one size fits all approach to promoting arsenic mitigation is unlikely to succeed owing to the heterogeneous nature of the communities affected as is evident from this paper different castes and economic classes constituting the affected communities have differing perceptions of health economic and social risk because of their varied perceptions and priorities upper caste communities should be targeted for immediate arsenic mitigation as they are more likely to adopt this might also help to enhance technology adoption among lower castes because the latter seek to emulate the former in many situations however it appears that unfortunately health concerns take a backseat to pressing issues of economic survival for lower caste and impoverished households in the short term education and awareness campaigns aimed at arsenic contamination and specifically its adverse impacts on livelihoods should be implemented among the lower caste communities including backward and scheduled caste communities with minimal trust in the institutions and low social capital both owing perhaps to their social marginalization were most concerned with economic risks and social discrimination risks however underprivileged communities for whom social problems were the highest priority had low or no arsenic awareness therefore to raise arsenic awareness in these communities campaigns should focus in the medium to long term on strengthening institutions and enhancing social capital activities most importantly these institutions should be involved in village level arsenic mitigation programs that groundwater arsenic may not be a priority among poor communities should not be seen as a discouraging finding on the contrary it should be seen as an affirmation of the fact that environmental and health perceptions are related to socio economic problems like lack of jobs lack of land lack of schools or lack of health facilities understanding these linkages could be very useful for understanding how people perceive risks what the predictors are and how decisions are made for ultimately delivering better social or environmental services the results of this study suggest that severity of groundwater soil or food arsenic contamination while necessary should not be the only control on mitigation policies people s risk perception plays a vital role in the adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions caste broad measures of economic well being and markers of social status within the community are essential drivers of the different risk perceptions however it appears that social marginality which is a relative social position as determined by the compounding effect of education landholding arsenic awareness among other factors is a crucial factor perhaps more so than absolute measures of income and education therefore socioeconomic and demographic factors awareness institutional trust social trust and social capital etc should necessarily be evaluated before implementing any arsenic mitigation policy this approach would help increase adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions and achieve their sustainable use 5 future directions the identified predictors of the three risk perceptions to groundwater arsenic contamination will help us model the risk perceptions of arsenic contamination due to the limitation of the scope of the paper we have only presented the significant predictors of the three kinds of risk perceptions studied an appropriate logistic regression model would be applied to model the perceived risks to health income economy and social discrimination we have also captured the geographical coordinates of each surveyed household households level of risk perceptions could be mapped which will help identify the target communities that are ready to adopt arsenic mitigation technology since awareness was found to be a contributing factor to both higher health risk perception and economic risk perception at the village level arsenic awareness campaigns with an emphasis on the health risks and potential economic risks should be given priority additionally to cover a large population a cellphone based arsenic health risk assessment application can be used singh 2017 arsenic mitigation programs should be promoted among the communities that perceive higher social discrimination risk highlighting the potential social discrimination because of the risk of arsenicosis advanced machine learning techniques can be used to develop prediction models of individuals perceived risks to arsenic contamination and the complex association with the socioeconomic demographic and other factors can be investigated singh et al 2018 appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this

12223,this study aims to evaluate the role of people s risk perception and their socioeconomic demographic and other social correlates in providing sustainable arsenic mitigation we interviewed the head of 340 households in three arsenic affected villages of bihar india a conceptual framework of risk perception and decision making of arsenic mitigation technology is used to capture possible predictors of risk perception bivariate analysis was performed to derive the predictors of risk perception and cross tab analysis was conducted to calculate novel findings a majority of the respondents were willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies as a result of their higher perceived risks to health and income than social discrimination risk respondents caste education level agricultural landholdings and social trust were the strongest predictors of perceived health risks in addition to these factors income sanitation practices people s prioritization of socio environmental problems arsenic awareness and social capital were the strongest predictors of perceived economic risk respondents agricultural landholdings prioritization of social problems arsenic awareness and social capital were the strongest predictors of perceived social discrimination risk arsenic mitigation is highly likely to be successful among communities with greater perceived health and economic risks the households with higher perceived social discrimination risk should be targeted for arsenic awareness program along with the mitigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic health risk perception economic risk perception social discrimination risk perception decision making socioeconomic demographic social capital 1 introduction worldwide nearly 300 million individuals lives are potentially at risk due to the exposure to groundwater arsenic contamination chakraborti et al 2017 2018 murcott 2012 studies suggest that the less adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions by the arsenic exposed communities has hindered the sustainable arsenic mitigation initiatives hossain et al 2015 jakariya et al 2007 kabir and howard 2007 singh and stern 2017 consequently these individuals still consume arsenic contaminated water more than the permissible limit of 10 μg l established by the world health organization india and bangladesh being at the higher risk chakraborti et al 2018 rahman et al 2009 several studies have highlighted that individuals with higher perceived risks tend to adopt environmental mitigation policies gerber and neeley 2005 kunreuther and slovic 1996 risk perception studies also help in evolving the understanding of individuals decision making processes of the adoption of environmental mitigation technologies the risk perception framework is applied in an array of environmental challenges such as climate change natural hazards flood insurance coastal environment protection landslides and air pollution bickerstaff 2004 carlton and jacobson 2013 damm et al 2013 huang et al 2013 jones et al 2013 however only handful studies have highlighted the role of individuals perceived risks of groundwater contamination in taking proactive protective actions such as significant increase in expenses on mitigation activities abdalla et al 1992 janmaat 2007 groundwater arsenic contamination is an environmental hazard and because of the lack of communities involvement in arsenic mitigation programs efficient technologies to identify the arsenic safe aquifer and cost effective arsenic mitigation technologies most of the arsenic mitigation programs could not attain sustainability hossain et al 2017 singh and stern 2017 although technology based arsenic mitigation solutions have embraced arsenic mitigation sustainability research technological challenges in the adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies and preferences of arsenic mitigation technologies by the arsenic exposed communities have been recently studied in bangladesh and india hossain et al 2014 2015 singh 2015 singh et al 2017 these scientific reports highlight the significance of socioeconomic demographic and other social factors in the successful adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies hossain et al 2015 singh et al 2008 2017 singh 2015 nevertheless studies on peoples perceived risks and their impact on decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation are still in its early stages singh 2015 singh and taylor 2018 a few studies have highlighted the fact that risk perception plays a vital role in ensuring arsenic mitigation sustainability in this context walker et al 2006 found that consumers who perceive health risk associated with drinking arsenic contaminated water were about five times less likely to consume arsenic polluted tap water walker et al 2006 mcspirit and reid 2011 reported that people s perception of poor drinking water quality in west virginia usa significantly influenced the amount of bottled water purchased mcspirit and reid 2011 mankad and tapsuwan 2011 have suggested that perceptions associated with the threat i e vulnerability risk severity and response efficacy could influence public acceptance of decentralized water supplies mankad and tapsuwan 2011 furthermore the value of clean arsenic free potable water to rural populations such as those that are the subject of this paper is influenced by their risk perceptions and has important implications for social acceptability of arsenic mitigation technologies being promoted if affected individuals do not have much concern for arsenic contamination despite its known dangers and place a low value on arsenic free drinking water then the cost of mitigation technologies may turn out to be a significant hindrance to their promotion among rural households ahmad et al 2005 this point was largely unappreciated in the past so far we did not encounter any existing studies that have evaluated decision making for better environmental services under perceived risks to income economic risk or risk of social discrimination in other words the risk is most often considered a singular undifferentiated construct neglecting its various economic social and health dimensions as such the roles that socioeconomic and demographic factors play in the perception of risk from arsenic exposure as well as on its actual health impacts are not well understood hanchett 2004 however such information could help us determine what types of intervention programs would be more effective and also help in terms of tailoring the outreach messages to the specific circumstances involving a community perceptions are particularly important since research has also shown that awareness of groundwater arsenic contamination does not always lead to the adoption of mitigation techniques such as filtration konishi and coggins 2008 walker et al 2006 2008 although existing research has underscored the need to contextualize risk perception of arsenic in the broader socioeconomic and technological settings severtson et al 2006 there exist important research gaps in studying the role of risk perception in the adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies while a variety of studies highlight the association between socioeconomic and demographic factors including household income number of children gender age and general trust and people s risk perception dosman et al 2001 siegrist et al 2005 none of them have attempted to investigate the causal relationships between socioeconomic and demographic factors knowledge and awareness institutional trust social capital and social trust to risk perceptions in the context of arsenic contamination singh 2015 singh and taylor 2018 this study aims to address two primary goals related to the aforementioned gaps a to investigate people s decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived risks to health income economic and social discrimination to arsenic and b to analyze the socioeconomic demographic and other factors that construct people s risk perceptions to groundwater arsenic contamination this article is an extended and detailed version of the study first presented in a conference singh and taylor 2018 2 material and methods 2 1 administration of the survey based on the prevailing levels of arsenic severity and the arsenic mitigation initiatives new hand pumps deep tube wells and arsenic treatment units three villages namely suarmarwa rampur diara and bhawani tola of the maner block of patna district in bihar india were selected for this study singh 2015 singh and ghosh 2012 singh et al 2014 2018 thakur and gupta 2016 fig 1 the survey design and implementation procedure were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the authors institution the questionnaires were provided to the villagers along with the principal investigator s personal plea briefly explaining the objectives of the project and its potential benefits to society the target populations were adults only therefore written consent forms were provided only to adults in the villages the respondents were surveyed only after receiving their signed consent forms in the cases of illiterate respondents the personal plea and the consent forms were read to them and their thumb impressions were obtained if they agreed to participate in the survey in case of refusal to participate in the survey or even hesitation the interview was ended immediately only two of 340 people approached declined to participate in the survey a couple of respondents asked the surveyor to explain the project and potential benefits to the village in more detail before deciding to participate in the study singh 2015 a detailed description of the survey administration is provided in singh 2015 in brief the surveyed populations were randomly selected and stratified by the variable of caste as the castes forward 1 1 forward caste upper caste at the top of the social stratification in indian villages backward 2 2 backward caste lower than the upper caste group that has been categorized as other backward classes by constitutional provision it consists of those castes which like the scheduled castes were in the past subjected to exclusions and therefore remained socially and educationally backward despite having a higher position than the scheduled castes in the local traditional caste hierarchy and scheduled 3 3 scheduled caste at the bottom of the social stratification consists of those castes that were associated with the most impure work and menial labor with no possibility of upward mobility and were subjected to serve social exclusion and disadvantages in comparison to the other castes caste are the sub groups of the population in the project area which are internally homogeneous but externally heterogeneous unsd 2008 the following equation eq 1 was used to derive the total number of households to be covered in each caste group including forward upper backward and scheduled caste 1 t o t a l n u m b e r o f h o u s e h o l d s t o b e c o v e r e d g r o u p s i z e s a m p l e s i z e t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n s i z e where group size total population of the caste group sample size 110 and total population size total population of the village a minimum sample size of 100 was decided following a standard statistical number for households surveys warner 2012 in suarmarwa a total of 43 111 of 260 in rampur diara a total of 24 119 of 500 and in bhawani tola a total of 22 110 of 500 households were surveyed the head of the households was randomly surveyed in the tola mahallah 4 4 tola or mahallah is a small unit of the neighborhood in rural areas in the project area wikipedia 2015 mahallah wikipedia the free enclopedia getting unbiased information from a rural community is challenging due to factors such as low literacy isolation and a widespread feeling of distrust of outsiders contacting the village head or a reliable person who is well known in the community was the first step toward starting the survey in the villages the survey was conducted between april and august of 2013 foreign visitors to villages are perceived as being concerned with their benefits so trust is key to earning cooperation the researchers must also have ample funding support to conduct the survey to reduce this bias against visitors it is critical to convince the village head or the young adults who would assist in administering the surveys in the community of the seriousness of the work and the potential benefits to the society prior experience working with the communities and an understanding of the local socioeconomic cultural and political environment play a vital role in convincing respondents that the project will benefit society thereby increasing the likelihood of honest responses the author met the village heads and or village representatives and discussed the project goals and survey strategy the village heads or representatives were then asked to recommend 6 8 people to assist in conducting the survey the 6 8 team members were chosen based on their education awareness of general environmental or social issues interpersonal and communication skills and social networks it is important to mention here that maintaining a positive and respectful attitude avoiding arguments with villagers showing commitment towards the work and being respectful to respondents are the most important factors in establishing credibility among villagers the team members were trained in the use of the survey instrument by explaining each question followed by open discussion to clarify any doubts an experienced member proved to be helpful in such debates by having an opportunity to speak up and share his her experience this helped to conduct the survey smoothly about 15 people were provided with the questionnaire and the survey was pre tested and discussed among the team members the ideal periods for meeting respondents and conducting surveys were mid morning and late afternoon it took approximately 40 min for each respondent to complete the survey the respondents were approached individually first the background of the research was explained and the importance of their honest and unbiased responses was emphasized the answers were noted as communicated and simultaneously were entered into an ms excel spreadsheet version 2010 later the data were coded in the statistical package for the social sciences spss software version 21 for windows for further analysis a total of 340 households comprising a total population of about 2500 were surveyed with a 99 response rate the questionnaire was initially developed in english and was translated into hindi for the respondents singh 2015 people s risk perceptions were measured to evaluate the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technology s under scenarios of perceived risks to their health income economy and social discrimination or isolation participants were presented with three scenarios to elicit their decision to adopt or not arsenic mitigation technology s a would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive health risk due to drinking arsenic contaminated water b would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive economic risk due to expenses from arsenic induced health problems c would you agree to adopt arsenic mitigation if you perceive social discrimination risk due to arsenic induced diseases responses were recorded on a 5 point likert scale i e strongly agree agree neutral disagree and strongly disagree scored from 1 to 5 respectively 2 2 data analysis statistical package for social sciences spss ibm version 21 in windows environment was used for statistical analysis ibm 2012 spss 2012 descriptive analysis for all the variables was performed to determine the percentage frequency of each variable in the surveyed villages a detailed village wise analysis is presented in singh 2015 here we have presented the cumulative frequency of each variable a bivariate analysis was performed between the risk perceptions health economic and social discrimination and socioeconomic demographic and other variables ibm 2012 spss 2012 warner 2012 which helped to evaluate the relationship between the two variables pattern linear vs nonlinear of the relationship strength of the relationship between the two variables direction of the relationship and whether the results can be generalized to the sampled population nzssds 2002 warner 2012 the alpha level of significance for all the analysis was set at 0 05 the standardized residual and z scores were also derived to interpret the results with precision for example which cell s produced a statistically significant difference utexas 2014 warner 2012 a critical value of 1 96 corresponding to an alpha of 0 05 was chosen to compare the size of the standardized residuals utexas 2014 warner 2012 2 3 conceptual model and determinants of risk perception of groundwater arsenic the arsenic risk perception model has been conceptualized based on the hypothesis h1 the arsenic exposed communities will adopt arsenic mitigation technologies or programs under perceived health risk perceived economic risk and perceived risk of social discrimination and h2 the existing socioeconomic and demographic factors people s prioritization of socio environmental problems and social capital are major drivers in constructing people s perceived risks fig 2 2 3 1 socioeconomic and demographic characteristics gender age level of education marital status income housing status ethnicity and race have been commonly studied to evaluate their predictive capacities in shaping people s risk perceptions botzen et al 2009 glatron and beck 2008 generally age has been found to have a positive correlation with risk perception of hazards lindell and hwang 2008 however negative associations of risk perception and age have also been reported botzen et al 2009 gender is often found to be an essential determinant of risk perception as women often perceive risks more than men shepherd et al 2011 additionally individuals with a high income and education level have been found to have a lower perception of risks akompab et al 2013 along with these most common socioeconomic and demographic variables we have incorporated caste and agricultural landholdings of the surveyed communities these variables have been selected for this study based on literature review field studies by the authors and meetings with the communities in arsenic contaminated areas caste which is an important variable in this study is salient because it is a proxy for social class as determined by distinctions of hereditary rank profession or wealth blair 1973 in indian villages caste is still the principal institution structuring allegiances and relationships and also plays a very important role in the realm of politics sahay 2009 a large and powerful caste group can be more easily dominant if its position in the local caste hierarchy is not too low srinivas 1955 the practices of a dominant caste are often emulated by lower castes thereby becoming a de facto social model in a village due to their prestige it is common for upper caste individuals to be consulted by other castes on important occasions including ceremonial ones sahay 2009 tsujita and oda 2012 because of such asymmetrical social hierarchy elite capture of resources by the dominant caste usually politically and or economically powerful groups has been a common story in many regions of india 2 3 2 water and sanitation factors time spent and distance traveled to collect water has been reported as two of the major hindrances in the success of arsenic mitigation programs we were interested to know if these two factors have any effect on the individual s perceived health risk economic risk and social discrimination risk in the villages in rural areas the sanitation status or practices of the communities could be directly connected to their socioeconomic status and awareness level about health and hygiene padder 2013 therefore information about household sanitation practices was gathered with the help of questions about the place for defecation and materials used for washing hands after defecation 2 3 3 knowledge and awareness about arsenic knowledge and awareness play very important roles in constructing people s risk perception as it is difficult to perceive arsenic risk in the absence of any understanding of its existence and adverse impacts akompab et al 2013 therefore awareness about arsenic contamination and associated health risks would be a pre requisite for the existence of perceptions of risk resulting from arsenic exposure an in depth analysis of arsenic awareness in the studied area is provided in singh et al 2018 in brief the respondents knowledge and awareness about arsenic was collected using a set of ten questions e g do you know what arsenic is do you know the source s of arsenic have you heard about arsenic and arsenic related health problems is your drinking water source contaminated with arsenic is there any arsenic mitigation program operating in your area and is the arsenic mitigation program technique effective in your area singh et al 2018 2 3 4 people s prioritization of socio environmental problems some studies have demonstrated that people who give priority to environmental issues often perceive the greater risk to the environment in their locality slimak and dietz 2006 the studied areas have multiple social and environmental problems including floods poverty poor water quality and limited water accessibility therefore the information about the respondents prioritization of socio environmental problems would generate baseline data as well as help us in evaluating its impact on risk perceptions 2 3 5 social capital social capital offers a lens to study the co evolution of social networks and norms in the generation of adaptive capacity among collectives pelling and high 2005 such as communities organizations and sites at the individual level it reflects an individual s social relations and networks and at the community level it embraces social values equity and trust in others janssens et al 2004 social capital has been largely neglected in most risk perception investigations in this study we hypothesize that the communities or an individual with high social capital will perceive less risk the underlying assumption based on the literature is that high social capital lessens the feeling of vulnerability with the result that individuals perceive less risk from their local problems de carolis and saparito 2006 evaluating social capital in arsenic contaminated areas would help us understand how individuals social capital influences their risk perceptions social capital was evaluated at community and individual levels 2 3 5 1 social capital at the community level community level social capital was assessed through evaluating the presence and functionality of institutions and their trusts in agencies in the project area anganwadi self help groups and mahila samakhya are the three most active and visible grassroots institutions studies showed that self help groups have worked to build the foundation of social capital janssens et al 2004 anganwadi courtyard shelter is a government of india s child care and mother care unit at panchayat levels comprised of mostly female health workers anganwadi 2014 the mahila samakhya is a women s empowerment program of the government of india designed to aid socioeconomically impoverished women through increased literacy janssens et al 2004 self help groups are also comprised of socioeconomically disadvantaged women in villages in india and other south asian countries financial support to the self help group members is achieved through a fund developed by the group members regular savings social empowerment through micro finance fouillet and augsburg 2007 in a recent study the mahila samakhya was found to have successfully helped to generate social capital in the state janssens et al 2004 these institutions are also very active and successful in other social innovation programs like total sanitation campaign in bihar india janssens et al 2004 therefore evaluating the presence and functionality of such institutions would help us understand the role of the existing institutions in shaping communities risk perception people who have trust in institutions involved in mitigation activities are found to perceive less risk to existing environmental issues in their neighborhood carlton and jacobson 2013 trusts in institutions were derived for government agencies non governmental agencies panchayati raj institutions private agencies and academics scientists 2 3 5 2 social capital at the individual level social trust has been identified as one of the primary social factors that influence people s risk perception of their environment with higher levels of social trust linked to lower levels of perceived risk carlton and jacobson 2013 individuals social capital was evaluated through respondents social trust and their social capital social trust was assessed via people s trust in their neighbors and others individuals social capital was evaluated through whether other community members sought their advice and valued their views and whether they participate in panchayat activities 3 results and discussions 3 1 socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the surveyed population the detailed socioeconomic and demographic survey results are explained in singh 2015 here we present a village wise comparison of socioeconomic and demographic survey results that help to understand the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the surveyed population fig 3 a o the gender of the participants was significantly different p 0 038 across the three villages the majority being the male 95 respondents fig 3 a the maximum participation in the survey was by the backward castes followed by the forward castes and the scheduled castes respectively fig 3 d a majority 94 of the respondents was married 6 had never been married and one respondent was widowed fig 3 c 5 5 single respondents who were never married or were a widow or abandoned regarding the level of education a total of 86 of the population had some level of education fig 3 e however the rest of the population 14 was illiterate although the average literacy rate in the area was greater than the state s literacy rate of 35 the majority of the population had only a primary level of education followed by a secondary and a college level of education respectively fig 3 e six people per household were found to be the average family size in the area fig 3 f the occupation of the majority of the population was found to be either wage labor 39 or agriculture 34 fig 3 g the majority of the respondents 71 earn between rs 500 to rs 10 000 just above the poverty line 18 earned more than rs 10 000 per month and 11 below the poverty level bpl with a monthly income less than rs 500 fig 3 h the largest proportion 37 of the population was found to live in kachcha 6 6 kachcha house houses with temporary roofs made with cemented floor and or wall mud houses followed by pucca 7 7 pucca house houses with flooring roof and walls should be cemented brick houses thatched roof and straw made roof houses respectively fig 3 j altogether a total of 33 of the population was found to be living in poorly constructed structures mostly made of straw or mud housing status is generally associated with income however it was observed that a few respondents with higher income intentionally avoided better houses as they wanted to hide or avoid exposing their income to the villagers eighty one percent of the respondents were defecating in open places regardless of toilet availability only 19 of the population used toilets for defecation fig 3 n it was very surprising that the total sanitation campaign program the government of india s most ambitious program to accomplish one of the millennium development goals had almost no impact on the sanitation practices in the surveyed population 3 2 hypothesis i perceived risks and decision making for arsenic mitigation technologies the vast majority of individuals 91 perceives health risk due to drinking arsenic contaminated water and was willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 1 about 66 of the respondents perceive economic risk from arsenic contamination only 46 of the surveyed population connects risk of social discrimination with arsenic contamination table 1 the respondents showed a neutral response to perceived social discrimination risk with the numbers almost equally split between those who perceive social discrimination risk and others who disagree or are neutral table 1 originally the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived risks were recorded at the five point likert scale for further analysis the response levels were collapsed to disagree by adding strongly disagree and disagree neutral no change and agree by adding strongly agree and agree we investigated which response categories agree neutral and disagree for the health risk perception economic risk perception and social discrimination risk perception had the greatest inter village differences the respondents of rampur diara village were slightly more likely 93 to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk than the respondents of suarmarwa 90 and bhawani tola 89 villages table 2 a the percentage differences were small but statistically significant p 0 006 and there was a curvilinear association between the villages and the decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk after reviewing the health survey reports we found that among the three surveyed villages suarmarwa had the highest arsenicosis symptoms as well as other health diseases followed by rampur diara and bhawani tola singh and taylor 2019 table 2 b presents a crosstabs analysis between respondents decision to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived economic risk and the surveyed villages the residents of rampur diara village were more likely 72 to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived economic risk than the respondents of suarmarwa 68 and bhawani tola 59 villages table 2 b the association between the two variables was similar to the association between health risk perception and the surveyed villages the crosstabs analysis between respondents decision to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived social discrimination risk and the surveyed villages revealed that the individuals of suarmarwa village 53 and rampur diara 49 were more likely to perceive social discrimination risk than bhawani tola 37 table 2 c the health risk p 0 006 economic risk p 0 001 and social discrimination risk p 0 001 perceived by the respondents were different across the surveyed villages and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp tables 2a 2c high perceived health and economic risks in rampur diara village could be linked to the arsenic awareness among the surveyed communities this village has been more widely investigated for groundwater soil and food contamination by arsenic than the other two villages singh 2011 singh and ghosh 2011 2012 moreover several arsenic mitigation programs and projects have been executed in rampur diara that might have raised arsenic awareness among the communities hadi 2003 therefore the greater perceived health risk to arsenic contamination and potential economic burden as a consequence of health problems in rampur diara village could be linked to arsenic awareness to confirm this we performed a crosstabs analysis between arsenic awareness and the three surveyed villages we found that rampur diara village was more likely to be aware of arsenic and associated issues high awareness 53 3 than suarmarwa high awareness 26 7 and bhawani tola high awareness 20 0 furthermore we attempted to find a logical reason for a higher perceived social discrimination risk in suarmarwa and rampur diara than bhawani tola based on the crosstabs analysis we found that suarmarwa village had only two caste groups dominated by the backward caste 76 6 and the scheduled caste 23 4 however in rampur diara the forward caste 62 2 was more prevalent than the backward caste 18 5 and the scheduled caste 19 3 this unequal caste distribution might be responsible for greater social discrimination risk perception in these two villages in bhawani tola the castes were more evenly distributed forward caste 42 7 backward caste 37 3 and scheduled caste 20 0 a possible explanation for the observed difference in perceived social discrimination risk may relate to greater dominance of upper caste or backward caste over lower caste groups in suarmarwa and rampur diara which makes social discrimination an ever present risk and the residents more sensitized to it hoff and pandey 2006 3 3 factors influencing the likelihood of adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived risks 3 3 1 factors influencing the likelihood of adoption of arsenic mitigation technologies under perceived health risk variables such as caste education level agricultural landholdings housing status presence and functionality of anganwadi and social capital people who participate in panchayat activities were found to have a contributing effect on communities perceived health risk moreover people s perceived economic risk was found to be strongly positively correlated with the respondents health risk perception in sum educated higher caste communities who own land live in better housing structures and had trust in anganwadi in the area tend to perceive more health risk therefore under perceived health risk communities that possess the above mentioned characteristics will adopt arsenic mitigation technology in the arsenic contaminated areas the results of bivariate analyses showed that there was a very strong positive correlation between respondents perceived health risk social discrimination risk and their perceived economic risk it further shows that the communities that had high perceived health risk and social discrimination risk were likely to perceive more economic risk likewise a strong positive correlation was derived between caste education level housing status sanitation behavior place for defecation and material used to wash hands after defecation people s prioritization of social problems lack of land lack of school and poverty arsenic awareness trust in agencies ngos panchayati raj institutions private agencies and individual social capital as neighbors and others sought and valued their advice with the residents perceived economic risk fig 4 however a strong negative correlation was observed between people s prioritization of socio environmental problems lack of health facilities flood drought water accessibility and water quality and presence and functionality of institutions anganwadi with the respondents perceived economic risk fig 4 in sum socio demographic factors caste education and housing status sanitation practice people s prioritization of socio environmental problems arsenic awareness presence and functionality of institution anganwadi trust in agencies and social capital were found to be strong predictors of the perceived economic risk of the communities in comparison to the other two perceived risks economic and health risks we found fewer predictors for perceived risk of social discrimination none of the socioeconomic and demographic factors except agricultural landholdings was found to be a statistically significant predictor of the communities social risk perception people with larger agricultural landholdings who spent more time collecting water and traveled a distance of 50 m and the communities that had higher trust in mahila samakhya and self help groups were strongly negatively correlated with their social discrimination risk perception fig 4 in contrast those who were aware of arsenic contamination who had trust in ngos and panchayati raj institutions and the respondents with higher social capital were found to be strongly positively correlated with their perceived social discrimination risk fig 4 furthermore communities social discrimination risk perception was found to be strongly positively correlated with their perceived economic risk 3 4 novel findings 3 4 1 caste and risk perceptions there was a positive linear relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk and caste the respondents who belong to the upper caste are more likely than those who belong to lower caste to perceive health risk and therefore are willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 3 a the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk was different across the respondents of the three caste groups p 0 018 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk and caste the respondents who belong to the upper caste are more likely than those who belong to lower caste to perceive the economic risk to arsenic contamination and are willing to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 3 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents of the three caste groups p 0 001 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp the likelihood to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk among forward caste respondents was about 1 75 times greater and among backward caste respondents about 1 5 times higher than the scheduled caste respondents table 3 b ethnicity and race have been studied to derive risk perception under multi hazard environments and floods since ethnicity and race both represent a social hierarchy the association of castes with risk perceptions in our study could be explained in analogous terms with the ethnicity and race of the respondents lindell and hwang 2008 petrolia et al 2013 3 4 2 agricultural landholdings and risk perception there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived health risk and agricultural landholdings table 4 a the respondents who own land are more likely than those who do not to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived health risk the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents who do and do not have landholdings p 0 014 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 4 a there was a negative relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived social discrimination risk and agricultural landholdings the respondents who own land are less likely than those who do not to perceive social discrimination risk and therefore less likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 4 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived social discrimination risk was different across the respondents who do or do not have landholdings p 0 035 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 4 b 3 4 3 water and sanitation behavior and risk perception the respondents who spent more than 10 min collecting water are less likely to perceive social discrimination risk than those who spend more time collecting water those who spend less than 10 min collecting water are less likely adopting arsenic mitigation technology table 5 a respondents who collect water from outside hand pumps requires traveling approximately 50 m far have more opportunity to interact with other community members this is a common practice that builds social capital consequently these respondents feel less vulnerable the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the water collection time groups p 0 005 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 5 a the respondents who practice good sanitation habits i e use a toilet for defecation and use soap or ash for hand washing are more likely to perceive economic risk and more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who prefer to defecate in open fields and use soil for hand washing table 5 b the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the respondents sanitation habits p 0 002 and p 0 012 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 5 b 3 4 4 arsenic awareness and risk perceptions there was a positive relationship between decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk and arsenic awareness table 6 the respondents who had high arsenic awareness are more likely to perceive economic risk and more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no arsenic awareness the agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation was different across the arsenic awareness levels p 0 001 and could be generalized to the population living in other arsenic contaminated areas in the mgp table 6 the likelihood to adopt arsenic mitigation under perceived economic risk was approximately 1 6 times greater among those who had greater arsenic awareness than the respondents with no arsenic awareness 3 4 5 social capital and risk perceptions the respondents who reported that there was no mahila samakhya in the villages perceive greater social discrimination than respondents with a neutral or neutral view of mahila samakhya and were more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies table 7 a the respondents who had no view on the presence and functionality of the self help group and those who put a high score on the unavailability of a self help group in the village perceived higher social discrimination risk these respondents showed greater agreement to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived social discrimination risk than those who had a clear view agreed and disagreed on the presence and functionality table 7 b the respondents who had trust in ngos and those had no view on this issue perceive higher social discrimination risk and are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no trust in ngos table 7 c the respondents who had trust in pris perceive greater social discrimination risk therefore they are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies than those who had no trust or had no view in pris table 7 d the respondents who perceived that their neighbors and others sought their advice and valued their views are more likely to adopt arsenic mitigation technology under perceived social discrimination risk than those with the opposite or neutral perception on this matter table 7 e the role of trust in institutions and social capital are not always predictors of risk perception our findings of the institutional trust and social trust as the strongest predictors of risk perceptions are in agreement with prior research de frança doria et al 2009 dobbie and brown 2014 doria et al 2009 vaske et al 2008 in contrast carlton and jacobson 2013 have recently reported that social trust did not influence risk perceptions we agree with the authors recommendation that the inconsistent results are because of the system studied additionally another probable explanation could be that the indicators or the variables used to define risk perception were not of a similar nature and the studied areas and contexts were also heterogeneous 4 conclusions and policy implications this study provides insights into communities decision making to adopt arsenic mitigation technologies under their perceived risks to health income and social discrimination to groundwater arsenic contamination the findings are potentially advantageous to policymakers as this help identify the mechanisms of decision making to adopt better environmental services for the communities wellbeing risk perception in general but health economic and social discrimination risk perceptions in particular cause individuals to take precautionary measures and support policies aimed at arsenic mitigation botzen et al 2009 a one size fits all approach to promoting arsenic mitigation is unlikely to succeed owing to the heterogeneous nature of the communities affected as is evident from this paper different castes and economic classes constituting the affected communities have differing perceptions of health economic and social risk because of their varied perceptions and priorities upper caste communities should be targeted for immediate arsenic mitigation as they are more likely to adopt this might also help to enhance technology adoption among lower castes because the latter seek to emulate the former in many situations however it appears that unfortunately health concerns take a backseat to pressing issues of economic survival for lower caste and impoverished households in the short term education and awareness campaigns aimed at arsenic contamination and specifically its adverse impacts on livelihoods should be implemented among the lower caste communities including backward and scheduled caste communities with minimal trust in the institutions and low social capital both owing perhaps to their social marginalization were most concerned with economic risks and social discrimination risks however underprivileged communities for whom social problems were the highest priority had low or no arsenic awareness therefore to raise arsenic awareness in these communities campaigns should focus in the medium to long term on strengthening institutions and enhancing social capital activities most importantly these institutions should be involved in village level arsenic mitigation programs that groundwater arsenic may not be a priority among poor communities should not be seen as a discouraging finding on the contrary it should be seen as an affirmation of the fact that environmental and health perceptions are related to socio economic problems like lack of jobs lack of land lack of schools or lack of health facilities understanding these linkages could be very useful for understanding how people perceive risks what the predictors are and how decisions are made for ultimately delivering better social or environmental services the results of this study suggest that severity of groundwater soil or food arsenic contamination while necessary should not be the only control on mitigation policies people s risk perception plays a vital role in the adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions caste broad measures of economic well being and markers of social status within the community are essential drivers of the different risk perceptions however it appears that social marginality which is a relative social position as determined by the compounding effect of education landholding arsenic awareness among other factors is a crucial factor perhaps more so than absolute measures of income and education therefore socioeconomic and demographic factors awareness institutional trust social trust and social capital etc should necessarily be evaluated before implementing any arsenic mitigation policy this approach would help increase adoption of arsenic mitigation interventions and achieve their sustainable use 5 future directions the identified predictors of the three risk perceptions to groundwater arsenic contamination will help us model the risk perceptions of arsenic contamination due to the limitation of the scope of the paper we have only presented the significant predictors of the three kinds of risk perceptions studied an appropriate logistic regression model would be applied to model the perceived risks to health income economy and social discrimination we have also captured the geographical coordinates of each surveyed household households level of risk perceptions could be mapped which will help identify the target communities that are ready to adopt arsenic mitigation technology since awareness was found to be a contributing factor to both higher health risk perception and economic risk perception at the village level arsenic awareness campaigns with an emphasis on the health risks and potential economic risks should be given priority additionally to cover a large population a cellphone based arsenic health risk assessment application can be used singh 2017 arsenic mitigation programs should be promoted among the communities that perceive higher social discrimination risk highlighting the potential social discrimination because of the risk of arsenicosis advanced machine learning techniques can be used to develop prediction models of individuals perceived risks to arsenic contamination and the complex association with the socioeconomic demographic and other factors can be investigated singh et al 2018 appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this

12224,the problem of water shortage has always been one of the most principle issues in the world due to the seasonality of the surface water drainages and subsurface structures in semi arid and arid regions it is necessary to use structures like underground dams underground dams are structures that are constructed on the waterways of the groundwater and cause the water to rise and store in its reservoir due to the costly and timely location of underground dams the use of gis techniques along with decision making methods is considered as one of the tools used in these studies the study area is located on the northwest of semnan province in iran the purpose of this study was to determine the proper location of underground dam with using decision making methods in this research at the first step the necessity of selecting a subsurface water drainage structure that stores and controls flow of water in semi arid and arid areas are reviewed at second step a number of criteria influence upon the decision making process during the identification of the most suitable site is concerned step three was applying ahp technique to prioritize eight different locations concerning diverse aspects including economic environmental technical and social at the fourth step the techniques of topsis and edas are applied resulting in prioritizations that appear to have approximately ranked the same finally four axes as the best ones were able to be offered as agreed upon by all groups regarding the sites of underground dam construction graphical abstract image 1 keywords underground dams geographic information system analytical hierarchy process 1 introduction the untapped use of groundwater resources in the world on the one hand and the climate change that the planet faces on the other hand has caused the world s population to be seriously threatened by the lack of water resources in 2050 danilenko et al 2010 for this reason one of the ways in which groundwater storage has been considered in recent years is the construction of underground dams constructed in the form of vertical walls in the direction of the bedding of alluvial rivers onder and yilmaz 2005 in this case the flow of groundwater is blocked in the earth s layers and causes the water to be stored in the upper alluvium and the water accumulates in the underground drainage reservoir therefore underground dams are an obstacle to build up groundwater currents for water storage and use when needed behrangi 2001 underground dams have fewer construction costs compared to dams constructed on the ground and evaporation and loss of moisture in them due to their structure and location in the basement is much less than dams constructed on the surface the ground also the risks and risks associated with environmental pollution are reduced which for these reasons can have many benefits for arid and semi arid areas jamali et al 2013 generally dam site selection is performed by traditional methods of decision making or by political interests cost and resource availability are two important factors in the traditional decision making approach accordingly a location near to a mine or water source may be selected without making a holistic and systematic analysis furthermore political factors may also affect the location decision resulting in high operational and transmission costs low productivity and significant negative impact on society due to increased environmental pollution choudhary and shankar 2012 there are numerous traditional methods that are costly and time consuming nowadays with advances in computing and information technologies determining competitive solutions in terms of cost time and a variety of other objective variables is greatly facilitated a powerful tool that can play a critical role in this process is gis1 techniques for hydrology gis is a computer based system which can handle the attribute data as well as spatial data where geographical information is a key characteristic it can provide large volumes of valuable data in spatial and temporal resolutions for areas where ground data are not otherwise readily available although the technologies such as gis are now helping the planning design and construction of dams the use of technology in this sector compared to the buildings and other infrastructure is still behind and this has still remained as a challenge in the lifecycle management of dams jozaghi et al 2018 since the location of underground dams requires the consideration of special circumstances and factors that all need to be carefully and scientifically scrutinized inefficient methods make it difficult costly and time consuming for the project on the one hand in order to accelerate this the ahp method is used as part of the mcdm technique farokhzadeh et al 2015 the mcdm technique is a well known methodology and is commonly used by researchers rahman et al 2015 the first mcdm technique was developed in 1960 to reduce difficulties in accommodating diverse opinions and large complex datasets in the decision making process afshari et al 2016 the ahp approach developed by saaty 1980 is an effective tool for system analysis and solves decision problems by reducing complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons ahp technique has been favored by a large number of researchers because it has advantageous mathematical properties and it is easy to determine the required input data in this method rajesh and malliga 2013 in this method the interrelations between criteria weights goals and alternatives are shown in a hierarchy structure and evaluated according to their importance jagtap and bewoor 2017 decision making supportive systems are models which receive vast majority of data and deliver many solutions which are specifically designed to overcome the existing problem klosterman 1997 experts personal preferences and judgments make the process of decision making complicated where a hierarchy structure can ease model aggregation in different layers forman and peniwati 1998 the assignment of identifying suitable sites for underground dams happens to be the most significant problem in establishment and development of the underground dams mishra et al 2015 used ahp technique and gis software for identifying the suitable sites of organic farming in uttarakhand state of india similarly raju et al 2006 also properly emphasized ahp as a suitable hierarchical technique for the prioritization of weights furthermore in this research this technique is used to prioritize the proper sites of underground dam construction the precise positioning of underground dams with the help of the ahp method combined with satellite imagery aerial photos and underlying controls can be easily quickly and precisely of course considering some of the physical conditions in the area under study such as geology of upstream areas slope less than 5 and distance of fault and qanat have a significant impact on this and it is imperative that special attention be paid to achieving the best results farokhzadeh et al 2015 in this research the main criteria of evaluation including water axis reservoir socio economic criteria are targeted at the highest range while placing indicators and incidental criteria at the other categories of ahp then the proper sites for underground dam establishment are prioritized in this regard ahp technique is broadly used for decision making according to the insights of several groups of decision maker s opinions that do not agree on different interest stakeholders owners managers ecologists and public may have comparable or definite goals singh and nachtnebel 2016 there are different scales for identifying sites and prioritizing to assign the most suitable place where underground dam establishment should occur indicating ahp technique as the most proper one in analysis and evaluation of non locative and locative mcdm forzieri et al 2008 there are many techniques that have been invented integrated and expanded in this area of study merging different decision making algorithms to establish a unique approach kahraman et al 2017 keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2015 have developed edas 1 1 evaluation of distance from average solution technique out of the most widespread technique of mcdm this technique tries to determine the optimal solution according to the maximum distance from negative ideal alongside minimum solution using the positive ideal nevertheless the best substitute in edas technique seems to be determining the distance from av 2 2 average solution technique of topsis 3 3 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is a simple and common technique for ranking it chooses the alternatives having the shortest distance from the positive ideal choice and farthest distance from the negative ideal choice simultaneously hwang and masud 1979 iran has a semi arid climate and more than half of it is desert and semi desert iran is placed in the semi arid to dry conditions and its average annual precipitation is less than global which is mainly due to spring and winter season in the form of rainy weather and rainfall for the country in iran as with other parts of the world there is a lot of research on precise locations and the construction of underground dams in areas with this potential among these investigations are dams constructed in cities such as kandar kohnuj kuhzard and tuyehdavar dorfeshan et al 2014 according to the above since iran has been suffering from extreme water scarcity for many years and in light of the earlier articles about the advantages of underground dams construction this research aims at locating suitable ground for the construction of an underground dam with application decision making methods in the semi arid region of iranian semnan plain was carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 the geographical and geological status of the studied region the target area is located in the iranian semnan province this province is located on the southern slopes of the alborz dynasty its height decreases from north to south and ends in the desert in this province atmospheric precipitation is very low and often occurs in the form of rain falling and reaches an average of 145 mm per year due to the relative proportion of relative humidity with rainfall the moisture content increases from west to east of the province and from south to north it is neighbored by 216467 ha area with the coordinates of 53d 81m to 53d 15m eastern length and 35d 13m to 35d 85m northern width in terms of station climates as reported by demarten and emberger the target area has a semi dry cold climate at heights reaching cold arid climate of lower height areas fig 1 in the term of the climatic conditions there are many syllabic flows throughout the side hills of the area where underground dam establishment is a proper way to control aridity problem in arid seasons of this area 2 2 research methodology to carry out this research and to obtain the most accurate results we needed a series of information from the area in question such as area maps water level in piezo metric wells and regional geophysical properties that were prepared before the work and carefully examined the most significant data of this study are related to topography geology and underground and qanat resources software s used in this research include both the expert choice ver 11 0 and gis ver 10 3 to prioritize and combine data respectively microsoft office excel ver 2013 was used for calculating the algorithms of topsis and edas techniques 2 3 determining the evaluation criteria 2 3 1 ahp technique mcdm appropriately prioritizes areas in a descending order and then aims at choosing the best and most precedent option decision making principals are a set of the most known and precedent mcdm method used in this research which are based on the gis and ahp saaty 1994 based on the first dissociation principal a complicated problem has been subsequently divided into subdivisions considering the mentioned criteria that solve the problem and the structure of decision making tree shapes in this order based on second principal the criteria are compared mutually and weighted saaty 1980 table 1 indicates the mutually compared criteria calculated by saaty 2000 in this step choices priority is sorted out based on criteria kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 comparison matrix development in the main stage belongs to every single component of hierarchy process that estimates incompatibility rate of decision making in every single hierarchical weight comparing category vector method commonly specialized to deliver weights of parameters stems from a mutually comparing matrix in this method weights calculation w is assigned to the course of these stages calculation of matrix a matrix of mutual comparison is defined based on the assignment of matrix a λ i in which λ is a specific quantity to matrix a then determinant of matrix a λ i is calculated and equaled to zero to deliver the amount of λmax which is called the maximal value of λ and this value is numbered in the equation a λmaxi w 0 in order that it calculates w from the equation 7 26 in regards to weight calculation saaty has proven a theory which makes it easier saaty 1994 accordingly a positive and reverse matrix which resembles a mutual comparing matrix vector can be made from eq a 1 a 1 w lim k e a k e t e a k et 1 1 1 1 and et is the transposed matrix of matrix e incompatibility indicator of i i should be first calculated through eq a 2 in order that it provides total incompatibility rate a 2 i i λ m a x n n 1 in this equation n is either the number of criteria or the dimensions of matrix a and as well λ m a x is termed as the specific maximal value of lambda incompatibility rate ir is reached through eq a 3 ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 a 3 i r i i i i r in this equation i i r is the random indicator which depends on the comprehension that is presented through table 2 as well malczewski 2006 if the eq a 3 is less than one incompatibility rate cr will consequently have the desirable rate of incompatibility compared with the mutual comparisons this rate otherwise will indicate an incompatible judgment ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 2 3 2 topsis technique in this method m options are assessed by n indices and any problem can be set as a geometric system made by m points in an n dimensional space the steps of this technique are presented as follows step 0 determining the decision matrix b 1 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x m n where x stands for the decision matrix and x i j shows the numerical value from the i t h option with the j t h index in this matrix the index with positive desirability and the index with negative desirability are the profit and cost indices respectively step 1 normalization b 2 v v 11 v 1 n v m 1 v m n b 3 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 where v and v i j show the normal matrix and the normalized matrix s entries in the respective order step 2 weighing the normalized matrix as the normalized matrix v is of m n dimension weighing is performed through a n n diagonal matrix with the criteria weight w i s determined from the previous step as the key diagonal entries of the matrix then weighted normal matrix is obtained by multiplying the normal matrix through the diagonal weight matrix b 4 w v w 1 0 0 w n w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w n n step 3 determining the solutions of the positive and negative ideals b 5 j is for profit index j j 1 2 n b 6 j is for cost index j j 1 2 n b 7 a max i w i j j ε j min i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m i a 1 a 2 a j a n b 8 a min i w i j j ε j max i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m a 1 a 2 a j a n step 4 determining the distances in this step the distance between n dimensional points can be obtained from negative and positive ideal options by applying the euclidean method b 9 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m b 10 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m step 5 calculating the relative proximity to the ideal solution b 11 c i s i s i s i i 1 2 3 m 0 c i 1 where w and wij show the normal weighted matrix and its entries respectively a represents the positive ideal option and a j is the jth entry of a vector a indicates the negative ideal option and a j is the jth entry of a vector s j is the ith option distance from the positive ideal option s i is the ith option distance from the negative ideal option ci is the relative proximity of the ith option to the ideal solution thus if the ith option is equal to a then ci will be 1 and if the ith option is equal to a then ci will be zero this means that the less the distance of the option from the ideal is considered the higher the relative proximity will be azimifard et al 2018 2 3 3 edas technique a novel and effective mcdm method called edas has been introduced by keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2015 two measures namely 2pda 4 4 positive distance from average and nda 5 5 negative distance from average are presented in edas technique these two measures are capable of showing the optimal solution based on the higher values of pda and or lower values of nda that outperforms the average solution the steps of edas technique are presented as follows step 0 selecting the most pertinent

the candidate alternatives performing stages of research is drawn in the fig 2 3 results and discussion dss 6 6 decision support systems used in identifying proper sites for underground dam establishment considers ahp technique and compares topsis with edas in the final stage given the fact that both techniques belong to the community of decision making approaches a comparison driven of the approaches results can provide the most suitable sites for the underground dam establishment among the other sites already included the four stages are as follows stage 1 limits recognition is capable of potential underground dam establishment and elimination of improper areas by boolean logic technique in the first stage limitations potentially capable of underground dam establishment are identified using the eliminating criteria considerably the criteria identified from a group of infinitely existing sites eliminate the unsuitable locations and put forth those of potentially valued in the first stage stage 2 potential area recognition in the limits is capable of potential underground establishment stage 3 evolution of axis to one another and prioritizing them to underground dam establishment are derived using ahp technique kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 stage 4 a comparison is driven using topsis and edas approaches to show how differently they prioritize the eight sites which in this case both resulted in slightly similar prioritization as the best site obtained is ranked first in both 3 1 boolean logic technique the key eliminating criteria including slope the range of qanat spring well and earthquake zone do not commonly enjoy capsule in their herbaceous textures in identifying the most suitable sites for the underground dam establishment in this research we added an innovative and new effect of stone effects and stone formation as a measure of relevance to other factors associated with locating the underground dams accordingly it can be stated that hydro chemical features of alluvial and karst aquifers or the effects of stone formations over the quality of underground resources depends on several factors such as the tank stone flooring stone stone units of transiting underground routs as well as the pace of flowing water information regarding the effects of stone formations over the quality of water resources was provided on behalf of the regional water organization of semnan province which particularly accounts for a semi descriptive research study and added as a new influencing factor in the first step of location finding process afterwards unsuitable areas considering the effects of stone formations over the quality of underground resources are scored 1 and other areas are assigned 0 in the decision making process using the eliminating criteria at the first stage the limits capable of potential underground dam establishment are assigned considering the criteria of so many that may not have existed improper areas are eliminated and potential areas are assigned as well mentioned criteria are provided in the shape of information layers and transmitted to parallel environments these criteria form parallel layers with a pixel size of 10 m prepared in accordance with boolean logic zero pixels and pixel perfect moreover they are unsuitable for underground dam construction being the number one factor having converted the sites from raster file to vector files through gis software and set it on the google earth these sites are visually studied moreover the polygons that are spotted inconveniently and out of reach by the gis software are eliminated finally the remaining polygons are identified as the most suitable sites to underground dam establishment in the first step of decision making process in the meantime some of the sites selected for the construction of the underground dam were either eliminated by the actual factors involved or were classified as inappropriate places in this paper at the first step the necessity of selecting a subsurface water drainage structure that stores and controls flow of water in semi arid and arid areas is reviewed research results farokhzadeh et al 2015 showed that the precision of underground dams location is higher when both ahp and boolean logic methods are used together and can be more accurate than the results obtained from the application of each of these methods alone and more acceptable for this reason we can say that in the boolean logic method the area we are examining is subdivided into appropriate and inappropriate areas but in the ahp method valuation of each region is based on the consideration of the priority of the factors so the use of both of these methods can provide researchers with more accuracy when evaluating and choosing the best places to build an underground dam absolute factors such as slopes sharper than 5 road boundary and rural boundary be determined and remove the appropriate places for this purpose dorfeshan et al 2014 in the results farokhzadeh et al 2015 in their research they stated that the most suitable places for the construction of underground dams the catchment areas of the watershed hamedan bahar and the outflows to underground water resources the researchers cited this option as low tidal streams in the area as well as the proper use of the area the results obtained in this study are in line with the results of other researchers such as chezge et al 2010 and esavi et al 2012 and on the one hand 3 2 second step identification of suitable axes at the second stage of decision making process the most suitable river flood way is assigned to underground dam establishment in each limit the shorter the axis length is the lesser the bulk of working structure becomes and the faster the operation moves forward furthermore the most suitable axes are those of short length that have a high expansion of fountain over them kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 in addition they possess straits features in highly expanded surface and low width axis as the most appropriate kinds of them to choose the tank surface indicator is derived from the multiplication of river width and the length of the water saved at the axis this length is directly proportional to the alluvium and conversely in relation with the slope of river slope obtaining from the formulation eq d 1 as follows d 1 l b 1 a l tank length meter b thickness of alluvium meter a river slope percent to completing the data set of the equation mentioned above the river slope is first calculated through the canal using the map of the regional slope proper areas used at first and second stage in the identifying suitable sites process of the semnan plain were shown in fig 3 at second step a number of criteria influence upon the decision making process during the identification of the most suitable site is concerned dorfeshan et al 2014 with the help of satellite imagery from their area were able to identify 27 locations with potential for the construction of an underground dam to finally identify the location of the underground dam at a specific point in a waterway in the meantime as the first alternatives with satellite imagery and aerial photos the places that were considered to have the highest accumulation of sediment along the waterways of the region were considered and eventually they were able to select 15 suitable places for this goal giovanni et al 2008 presented a methodology for the implementation of a small underground dams in the kidal region of mali in this methodology the criteria for doing this were selected quantitatively and qualitatively and based on the methods of field analysis and using data from satellites hydrological information as well as climatology were defined using this method 66 locations suitable for the construction of small underground dams were obtained finally 17 locations were matched with the criteria considered in this research a dam is naturally connected to an environment accordingly the morphology of the river valley plays a crucial role in the choice of a dam site if we ignore the use of reservoirs for recreational purposes the main criterion influencing the dam location is reservoir capacity thus the best site will be a narrow site where the valley widens upstream of the proposed dam jozaghi et al 2018 3 3 prioritization of axes using ahp at the third stage the average of statistical information achieved from the area was used in the 11th version of expert choice software package in this step proper sites for underground dam establishment relating to stage 2 were prioritized through ahp based on proportionality of indicator in this research based on literature review on previous studies specific conditions of semnan plain and data availability four main criteria considered as main factor are chosen for this research including socio economic reservoir axis and water factors are at the top row while criteria and indicators are placed at the bottom of decision making tree as well fig 4 the criteria that are chosen for such research work are different for example farokhzadeh et al 2015 in their studies seven criteria were considered as the main factors that were geology distances of fault springs well and qanat land use slope and aquifer thickness the results indicated that the most effective criterion in this research geology and the least effective ones distance of well spring and qanat also in research dorfeshan et al 2014 the main criteria selected for subsequent evaluations were two major factors reservoir names and economic criteria each containing several sub criteria namely decline hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and foundation permeability for the reservoir and location of dam and distance of dam from usage place for economic conditions the results of this study indicated that given the high weight and importance of each of the main criteria different options were prioritized for each of the criteria since each major study criterion had the same value and weight this could also be considered by decision makers to prioritize potential sites for underground dams based on the fact that the study area in these investigations was dehydrated and on the other hand the construction of these dams is also relatively inexpensive therefore from the two main criteria discussed the reservoir factor is more attractive than economic factors as the decision making tree shows the average evaluation of each plan shown as data was added to the expert choice software and each main criterion was assigned with a final value given experts opinion for weighing criteria subdivisions and indicators topically in present study the main criterion of water is divided into quality and quantity criteria quantity plan is obtained from the information provided by the local water organization of semnan province and soil conservation service of usa it obtains the amount of run off resulted from the rain fall and approximately the run off mass of underside flows for each district spreading less than 100 square kilometers the data on the quantity criterion of water is provided by the semnan province water organization which was categorized through wilcox s method in three grades water contaminating sources such as salt domes and evapotranspiration in the water quantity section were eliminated due to negative impacts on water resources in order to estimate the subsurface flow rate in the rivers of the study area the volume of flowing water was calculated first and then the volume of rainfall in the area was deducted based on the results obtained in this research and expert opinion the water criterion is prioritized in comparison with other criteria since it has the highest weight in hierarchical decision making due to the climatic conditions affecting the studied area and the existence of numerous problems the construction of an underground dam has a significant effect on the improvement of yield and balance in groundwater harvesting expert opinions have shown that water quantity is more important than its quality because in case of lack of or lack of subsurface flows the reservoir of the underground dam is not fully dewatered and with many problems including supply of water needs of right owners we will conclude with the results of nilsson 1988 regarding the collection of water using an underground dam with an emphasis on water quantity in african countries the more aqueducts have more discharge the more important it is to other aqueducts other main criteria to be considered are the status of the reservoir the sub criteria that are used to investigate the reservoir s state are reservoir depth surface expansion of the reservoir infiltration and slope the importance of penetrability is more than other factors affecting the volume of the reservoir and the reservoir slope is second to none suitable reservoirs are usually found in rivers that have an alluvial bed and permeability and depth identification of bedrock depth requires geophysical surveys which were not possible at this stage of the study due to the large area and cost and significant time for doing these explorations therefore from the depths of the first vertical access shaft of qanat it was tried to assume that the first vertical access shaft was drilled in the alluvial deposits of the region and can be used to approximate the depth of the subsoil sub criteria in axial position analysis include axial depth axle length and axial bearing lithology the cause of the top axis score is the ratio of other sub axis limits which creates a depth of excavation in the construction of an underground dam economic and social factors including the current water requirement in the area around the axis the access to the location of the axis of the underground dam and the impact of the axis on the amount of downstream water resources are the specific causes of the qanats due to the high importance of qanats for water supply the right to water in arid and semi arid areas is more important than the other two criteria in the prioritization table and this can be attributed to the dryness of the studied area it is more important and more valuable than anything else in the places where underground dams are built the economic conditions are such that it is necessary to use participatory or low level methods in the construction of such structures in these places existing local inputs can be used to advance the construction of underground dams for example you can use local materials or labourers in the same locations to reduce both the cost of construction and the efficiency of the dam s operation and its lifespan underground dams can have many benefits in improving the quality of life of people in these areas in addition it can lead to an increase in the variety and quality of food produced in these areas in addition providing water for irrigation of domesticated livestock and their dry fodder production has a significant role to play which can be a great achievement for this purpose foster and tuinhof 2004 based on the above the ahp method is a method that is very well designed to score and categorize before selecting appropriate locations by constructing underground dams in arid areas this process has included different choices in decision making process and is capable of analyzing sensitivity on criteria and sub criteria raju et al 2006 in addition it is based on mutual comparisons that ease both judgment and calculations given a broad applicability of decision making approaches there are many methods to prioritize the most identifying suitable sites alternatives of underground dams particularly either developing or developed nevertheless the reasons that ahp technique is used in this research are because of the simplification of analysis high accuracy and the capability of blending it into local experts opinions noticeably an important issue to study in natural resources field take the local experts opinions into it because they always have sufficient information on the elimination of cumbrous resources and fill in the questionnaire with most logical scores according to the environmental circumstances and scientific information moreover regarding the prioritization of underground dams and suitable sites there are many criteria according to them the weights are differently assigned archwichai et al 2005 briefly step three was applying ahp technique to prioritize eight different locations concerning diverse aspects including economic environmental technical and social shirani et al 2017 in an investigation to locate an underground dam in the ardestan region of northern isfahan province in iran studied the interaction between the gis and the spatial multi criterion evaluation method in this research geological engineering criteria were used using ahp method the main parameters were divided into several more detailed stages based on ahp higher factor factors were chosen and used arcgis for each indicator the vector layers were used for ease of operation as well as greater accuracy and less time according to the results obtained by the researchers in the ardestan region the best place to construct the underground dam was the locations in the west north and northwest of the area that had the most favored alluvium in these areas also dorfeshan et al 2014 in a research conducted in the andika region of khuzestan province in iran conducted an ahp methodology to locate suitable areas for underground dam construction in this study two major factors reservoir names and economic criteria were carefully considered finally 15 suitable sites were selected and the results showed that for the construction of an underground dam there are many important factors such as physical social and economic factors all of which must be carefully investigated in order to determine the difference between them what is clear is that achieving these goals using traditional and traditional methods is time consuming and costly and in this case the importance of using gis and its methods such as ahp can be found which is to a very specialized face designed to achieve these goals to which extent researchers can do so regarding the above issues there are many arid and semi arid regions around the world that have low environmental social and economic impacts on these areas and the presence of water and water resources can generally be the face of this change the areas for this reason the construction of underground dams can be an ideal solution for achieving this goal of course selecting the exact location for these dams is very important farokhzadeh et al 2015 in the research dorfeshan et al 2014 as discussed earlier the criteria that were considered include the reservoir and economic factors since water in the andika region plays a vital role in the lives of people in this area according to the results the reservoir criterion was of higher importance in the studies in a survey haidari and shahriari 2011 on the location of underground dams in the garmab basin in the golestan province of iran three areas were identified for this purpose although sediment accumulation across the main river affected this 3 4 ranking the suitable sites through comparing topsis with edas technique in this study the best sites among other suitable locations is obtained using topsis and edas techniques approaches for prioritization purposes in the forth step of decision making process consequently driving a comparison between topsis and edas cause those alternatives enjoy the highest similarity to the ideal solution to make it to the top places of water priority problem in semnan plain according to the authors knowledge there is a five step approach to rank location finding alternatives that is previously mentioned in this research study noticeably a novel idea has been used to interpret final location finding rank which is unlike other similar researches in this research the best and most suitable places for construction of underwater dams have been found comparing topsis and edas approaches in the fourth step of decision making process the resulting sorts provided by topsis and edas are significant from different aspects since the exact location of the underground dam is very important for the site and the socio economic criterion in this area such as access and distance from village road and source of building materials is important this comparison was drawn to achieve the best results in the first scenario priority of all criteria was the same to one another and absolute priority was given to a main criterion in other scenarios moreover other criteria and values are equal in second scenario for instance the main criterion water was assigned 9 and other main criteria were given 1 in accordance with saaty mutual comparing table accordingly the fountain criterions in the third scenario axis in fourth scenario and socio economic issues in fifth scenario have absolute priorities by increasing the accuracy of ranking and substituting topsis and edas algorithms for fixed scenarios interfering experts opinions each alternative is assigned a weight in both algorithms and the locations which achieve the highest score are the most proper locations for underground dam establishment during this step the ahp prioritized 8 axes are divided into seven alternatives and the initial numbers are normalized afterwards the most suitable sites obtained from both approaches results namely topsis and edas outcomes are driven by considering the seven experts opinions as to pre determined numbers in the questionnaire thus the alternative weights are placed in their proper gis software positions adapting the weight information to the final map of suitable sites in dam establishment map pixels take three different colours including red green and grey to demonstrate those of highly ranked locations in the gis software easily describing the colouring process red colour shows the highest potentiality of dam establishment expressing the most suitable sites of both approaches in the gis map as it is graphically shown in fig 5 the final weighing maps of the axes are presented according to the topsis and edas techniques of prioritization respectively next topsis and edas were compared and the results showed that the novel model yielded dependable and stable results providing more data on the uncertainty of decision makers the prioritizations as well as the determined prioritizing numbers are presented as follows 1 edas values e 0 848 a 0 761 d 0 609 c 0 447 b 0 218 h 0 160 f 0 141 g 0 087 2 topsis values d 0 619 a 0 527 c 0 523 e 0 482 b 0 461 h 0 435 g 0 422 f 0 320 according to the numerically prioritized sites e d c and a axes rank the first to forth furthermore these four axes as the best ones can be offered as agreed upon by all groups regarding the sites of underground dam construction fig 5 at the fourth step the techniques of topsis and edas are applied resulting in prioritizations that appear to have approximately ranked the same the most and least effective criteria are geology and distance of well spring and qanat in research of farokhzadeh et al 2015 confirming unequal importance of the criteria and sub criteria in ahp method for the construction of underground dams there is a major need for the geological features of the area under study which indicates its key role for this purpose and it is confirmed in study by researchers such as chezge et al 2010 and esavi et al 2012 in a study conducted by jozaghi et al 2018 in sistan and baluchestan province one of the driest provinces in iran a comparison was made between ahp and topsis techniques to select an appropriate underground ditch using gis and to verify the accuracy the results of this experiment were taken from real places of dams constructed in this area the results indicated that both methods provided high performance in this regard but the topsis technique was better than ahp and provided more accurate and reliable results ahp method was also used to locate underground dams in another study conducted by karimi mobarakabadi 2012 in khomein city in markazi province iran this method was able to provide four potential locations for the construction of an underground dam and the precision of the weight of the criteria according to their importance could be evaluated accurately by using 0 01148 as the adjustment rate finally it can be noted that studies on the construction of underground dams in arid and semi arid regions and in particular on surface reservoirs indicate that the use of new and effective methods for the construction of underground dams and in integrated watershed management has far more accurate results offers less costly and faster than traditional methods dorfeshan et al 2014 these new techniques and technologies in this section that are used to achieve the desired goals significantly reduce the risk of underground dams and associated environmental hazards at inappropriate locations 4 conclusions in recent years the construction of underground dams has grown with the use of new and up to date techniques due to the numerous benefits that water resources management and the economic and social conditions of arid areas have made in areas such as semnan province which is one of the driest and least rainy provinces in iran and there are few water resources in it the construction of underground dams can be an appropriate and very useful solution to overcome the adverse effects of dehydration in the area locating and constructing underground dams as well as dams constructed on the surface of the earth require a variety of studies that require in all respects technical economic social and environmental issues to be studied accurately and to achieve the desired results and achieve the desired goal for this target the best way to use geographic information systems is to apply functions and data coverage and satellite images and ultimately to interpret their results which is more cost effective faster than traditional ones is more precise and has far fewer environmental hazards and is also used at very large scales in addition to gis mcdm techniques help decision makers select between alternative solutions in this case sites for construction of dams where there are many criteria and there are many types of mcdm model three of the most widely used mcdm techniques are ahp edas and topsis that were used in this study comparing the methodology results of edas topsis and ahp as established in this research

12224,the problem of water shortage has always been one of the most principle issues in the world due to the seasonality of the surface water drainages and subsurface structures in semi arid and arid regions it is necessary to use structures like underground dams underground dams are structures that are constructed on the waterways of the groundwater and cause the water to rise and store in its reservoir due to the costly and timely location of underground dams the use of gis techniques along with decision making methods is considered as one of the tools used in these studies the study area is located on the northwest of semnan province in iran the purpose of this study was to determine the proper location of underground dam with using decision making methods in this research at the first step the necessity of selecting a subsurface water drainage structure that stores and controls flow of water in semi arid and arid areas are reviewed at second step a number of criteria influence upon the decision making process during the identification of the most suitable site is concerned step three was applying ahp technique to prioritize eight different locations concerning diverse aspects including economic environmental technical and social at the fourth step the techniques of topsis and edas are applied resulting in prioritizations that appear to have approximately ranked the same finally four axes as the best ones were able to be offered as agreed upon by all groups regarding the sites of underground dam construction graphical abstract image 1 keywords underground dams geographic information system analytical hierarchy process 1 introduction the untapped use of groundwater resources in the world on the one hand and the climate change that the planet faces on the other hand has caused the world s population to be seriously threatened by the lack of water resources in 2050 danilenko et al 2010 for this reason one of the ways in which groundwater storage has been considered in recent years is the construction of underground dams constructed in the form of vertical walls in the direction of the bedding of alluvial rivers onder and yilmaz 2005 in this case the flow of groundwater is blocked in the earth s layers and causes the water to be stored in the upper alluvium and the water accumulates in the underground drainage reservoir therefore underground dams are an obstacle to build up groundwater currents for water storage and use when needed behrangi 2001 underground dams have fewer construction costs compared to dams constructed on the ground and evaporation and loss of moisture in them due to their structure and location in the basement is much less than dams constructed on the surface the ground also the risks and risks associated with environmental pollution are reduced which for these reasons can have many benefits for arid and semi arid areas jamali et al 2013 generally dam site selection is performed by traditional methods of decision making or by political interests cost and resource availability are two important factors in the traditional decision making approach accordingly a location near to a mine or water source may be selected without making a holistic and systematic analysis furthermore political factors may also affect the location decision resulting in high operational and transmission costs low productivity and significant negative impact on society due to increased environmental pollution choudhary and shankar 2012 there are numerous traditional methods that are costly and time consuming nowadays with advances in computing and information technologies determining competitive solutions in terms of cost time and a variety of other objective variables is greatly facilitated a powerful tool that can play a critical role in this process is gis1 techniques for hydrology gis is a computer based system which can handle the attribute data as well as spatial data where geographical information is a key characteristic it can provide large volumes of valuable data in spatial and temporal resolutions for areas where ground data are not otherwise readily available although the technologies such as gis are now helping the planning design and construction of dams the use of technology in this sector compared to the buildings and other infrastructure is still behind and this has still remained as a challenge in the lifecycle management of dams jozaghi et al 2018 since the location of underground dams requires the consideration of special circumstances and factors that all need to be carefully and scientifically scrutinized inefficient methods make it difficult costly and time consuming for the project on the one hand in order to accelerate this the ahp method is used as part of the mcdm technique farokhzadeh et al 2015 the mcdm technique is a well known methodology and is commonly used by researchers rahman et al 2015 the first mcdm technique was developed in 1960 to reduce difficulties in accommodating diverse opinions and large complex datasets in the decision making process afshari et al 2016 the ahp approach developed by saaty 1980 is an effective tool for system analysis and solves decision problems by reducing complex decisions to a series of pairwise comparisons ahp technique has been favored by a large number of researchers because it has advantageous mathematical properties and it is easy to determine the required input data in this method rajesh and malliga 2013 in this method the interrelations between criteria weights goals and alternatives are shown in a hierarchy structure and evaluated according to their importance jagtap and bewoor 2017 decision making supportive systems are models which receive vast majority of data and deliver many solutions which are specifically designed to overcome the existing problem klosterman 1997 experts personal preferences and judgments make the process of decision making complicated where a hierarchy structure can ease model aggregation in different layers forman and peniwati 1998 the assignment of identifying suitable sites for underground dams happens to be the most significant problem in establishment and development of the underground dams mishra et al 2015 used ahp technique and gis software for identifying the suitable sites of organic farming in uttarakhand state of india similarly raju et al 2006 also properly emphasized ahp as a suitable hierarchical technique for the prioritization of weights furthermore in this research this technique is used to prioritize the proper sites of underground dam construction the precise positioning of underground dams with the help of the ahp method combined with satellite imagery aerial photos and underlying controls can be easily quickly and precisely of course considering some of the physical conditions in the area under study such as geology of upstream areas slope less than 5 and distance of fault and qanat have a significant impact on this and it is imperative that special attention be paid to achieving the best results farokhzadeh et al 2015 in this research the main criteria of evaluation including water axis reservoir socio economic criteria are targeted at the highest range while placing indicators and incidental criteria at the other categories of ahp then the proper sites for underground dam establishment are prioritized in this regard ahp technique is broadly used for decision making according to the insights of several groups of decision maker s opinions that do not agree on different interest stakeholders owners managers ecologists and public may have comparable or definite goals singh and nachtnebel 2016 there are different scales for identifying sites and prioritizing to assign the most suitable place where underground dam establishment should occur indicating ahp technique as the most proper one in analysis and evaluation of non locative and locative mcdm forzieri et al 2008 there are many techniques that have been invented integrated and expanded in this area of study merging different decision making algorithms to establish a unique approach kahraman et al 2017 keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2015 have developed edas 1 1 evaluation of distance from average solution technique out of the most widespread technique of mcdm this technique tries to determine the optimal solution according to the maximum distance from negative ideal alongside minimum solution using the positive ideal nevertheless the best substitute in edas technique seems to be determining the distance from av 2 2 average solution technique of topsis 3 3 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is a simple and common technique for ranking it chooses the alternatives having the shortest distance from the positive ideal choice and farthest distance from the negative ideal choice simultaneously hwang and masud 1979 iran has a semi arid climate and more than half of it is desert and semi desert iran is placed in the semi arid to dry conditions and its average annual precipitation is less than global which is mainly due to spring and winter season in the form of rainy weather and rainfall for the country in iran as with other parts of the world there is a lot of research on precise locations and the construction of underground dams in areas with this potential among these investigations are dams constructed in cities such as kandar kohnuj kuhzard and tuyehdavar dorfeshan et al 2014 according to the above since iran has been suffering from extreme water scarcity for many years and in light of the earlier articles about the advantages of underground dams construction this research aims at locating suitable ground for the construction of an underground dam with application decision making methods in the semi arid region of iranian semnan plain was carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 the geographical and geological status of the studied region the target area is located in the iranian semnan province this province is located on the southern slopes of the alborz dynasty its height decreases from north to south and ends in the desert in this province atmospheric precipitation is very low and often occurs in the form of rain falling and reaches an average of 145 mm per year due to the relative proportion of relative humidity with rainfall the moisture content increases from west to east of the province and from south to north it is neighbored by 216467 ha area with the coordinates of 53d 81m to 53d 15m eastern length and 35d 13m to 35d 85m northern width in terms of station climates as reported by demarten and emberger the target area has a semi dry cold climate at heights reaching cold arid climate of lower height areas fig 1 in the term of the climatic conditions there are many syllabic flows throughout the side hills of the area where underground dam establishment is a proper way to control aridity problem in arid seasons of this area 2 2 research methodology to carry out this research and to obtain the most accurate results we needed a series of information from the area in question such as area maps water level in piezo metric wells and regional geophysical properties that were prepared before the work and carefully examined the most significant data of this study are related to topography geology and underground and qanat resources software s used in this research include both the expert choice ver 11 0 and gis ver 10 3 to prioritize and combine data respectively microsoft office excel ver 2013 was used for calculating the algorithms of topsis and edas techniques 2 3 determining the evaluation criteria 2 3 1 ahp technique mcdm appropriately prioritizes areas in a descending order and then aims at choosing the best and most precedent option decision making principals are a set of the most known and precedent mcdm method used in this research which are based on the gis and ahp saaty 1994 based on the first dissociation principal a complicated problem has been subsequently divided into subdivisions considering the mentioned criteria that solve the problem and the structure of decision making tree shapes in this order based on second principal the criteria are compared mutually and weighted saaty 1980 table 1 indicates the mutually compared criteria calculated by saaty 2000 in this step choices priority is sorted out based on criteria kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 comparison matrix development in the main stage belongs to every single component of hierarchy process that estimates incompatibility rate of decision making in every single hierarchical weight comparing category vector method commonly specialized to deliver weights of parameters stems from a mutually comparing matrix in this method weights calculation w is assigned to the course of these stages calculation of matrix a matrix of mutual comparison is defined based on the assignment of matrix a λ i in which λ is a specific quantity to matrix a then determinant of matrix a λ i is calculated and equaled to zero to deliver the amount of λmax which is called the maximal value of λ and this value is numbered in the equation a λmaxi w 0 in order that it calculates w from the equation 7 26 in regards to weight calculation saaty has proven a theory which makes it easier saaty 1994 accordingly a positive and reverse matrix which resembles a mutual comparing matrix vector can be made from eq a 1 a 1 w lim k e a k e t e a k et 1 1 1 1 and et is the transposed matrix of matrix e incompatibility indicator of i i should be first calculated through eq a 2 in order that it provides total incompatibility rate a 2 i i λ m a x n n 1 in this equation n is either the number of criteria or the dimensions of matrix a and as well λ m a x is termed as the specific maximal value of lambda incompatibility rate ir is reached through eq a 3 ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 a 3 i r i i i i r in this equation i i r is the random indicator which depends on the comprehension that is presented through table 2 as well malczewski 2006 if the eq a 3 is less than one incompatibility rate cr will consequently have the desirable rate of incompatibility compared with the mutual comparisons this rate otherwise will indicate an incompatible judgment ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 2 3 2 topsis technique in this method m options are assessed by n indices and any problem can be set as a geometric system made by m points in an n dimensional space the steps of this technique are presented as follows step 0 determining the decision matrix b 1 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x m n where x stands for the decision matrix and x i j shows the numerical value from the i t h option with the j t h index in this matrix the index with positive desirability and the index with negative desirability are the profit and cost indices respectively step 1 normalization b 2 v v 11 v 1 n v m 1 v m n b 3 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 where v and v i j show the normal matrix and the normalized matrix s entries in the respective order step 2 weighing the normalized matrix as the normalized matrix v is of m n dimension weighing is performed through a n n diagonal matrix with the criteria weight w i s determined from the previous step as the key diagonal entries of the matrix then weighted normal matrix is obtained by multiplying the normal matrix through the diagonal weight matrix b 4 w v w 1 0 0 w n w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w n n step 3 determining the solutions of the positive and negative ideals b 5 j is for profit index j j 1 2 n b 6 j is for cost index j j 1 2 n b 7 a max i w i j j ε j min i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m i a 1 a 2 a j a n b 8 a min i w i j j ε j max i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m a 1 a 2 a j a n step 4 determining the distances in this step the distance between n dimensional points can be obtained from negative and positive ideal options by applying the euclidean method b 9 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m b 10 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m step 5 calculating the relative proximity to the ideal solution b 11 c i s i s i s i i 1 2 3 m 0 c i 1 where w and wij show the normal weighted matrix and its entries respectively a represents the positive ideal option and a j is the jth entry of a vector a indicates the negative ideal option and a j is the jth entry of a vector s j is the ith option distance from the positive ideal option s i is the ith option distance from the negative ideal option ci is the relative proximity of the ith option to the ideal solution thus if the ith option is equal to a then ci will be 1 and if the ith option is equal to a then ci will be zero this means that the less the distance of the option from the ideal is considered the higher the relative proximity will be azimifard et al 2018 2 3 3 edas technique a novel and effective mcdm method called edas has been introduced by keshavarz ghorabaee et al 2015 two measures namely 2pda 4 4 positive distance from average and nda 5 5 negative distance from average are presented in edas technique these two measures are capable of showing the optimal solution based on the higher values of pda and or lower values of nda that outperforms the average solution the steps of edas technique are presented as follows step 0 selecting the most pertinent attribute describing decision alternatives for definite decision problems step 1 if xij is the performance rating of jth alternative a1 a2 a3 an i 1 2 3 n considering the jth criterion c1 c2 c3 cn j 1

the candidate alternatives performing stages of research is drawn in the fig 2 3 results and discussion dss 6 6 decision support systems used in identifying proper sites for underground dam establishment considers ahp technique and compares topsis with edas in the final stage given the fact that both techniques belong to the community of decision making approaches a comparison driven of the approaches results can provide the most suitable sites for the underground dam establishment among the other sites already included the four stages are as follows stage 1 limits recognition is capable of potential underground dam establishment and elimination of improper areas by boolean logic technique in the first stage limitations potentially capable of underground dam establishment are identified using the eliminating criteria considerably the criteria identified from a group of infinitely existing sites eliminate the unsuitable locations and put forth those of potentially valued in the first stage stage 2 potential area recognition in the limits is capable of potential underground establishment stage 3 evolution of axis to one another and prioritizing them to underground dam establishment are derived using ahp technique kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 stage 4 a comparison is driven using topsis and edas approaches to show how differently they prioritize the eight sites which in this case both resulted in slightly similar prioritization as the best site obtained is ranked first in both 3 1 boolean logic technique the key eliminating criteria including slope the range of qanat spring well and earthquake zone do not commonly enjoy capsule in their herbaceous textures in identifying the most suitable sites for the underground dam establishment in this research we added an innovative and new effect of stone effects and stone formation as a measure of relevance to other factors associated with locating the underground dams accordingly it can be stated that hydro chemical features of alluvial and karst aquifers or the effects of stone formations over the quality of underground resources depends on several factors such as the tank stone flooring stone stone units of transiting underground routs as well as the pace of flowing water information regarding the effects of stone formations over the quality of water resources was provided on behalf of the regional water organization of semnan province which particularly accounts for a semi descriptive research study and added as a new influencing factor in the first step of location finding process afterwards unsuitable areas considering the effects of stone formations over the quality of underground resources are scored 1 and other areas are assigned 0 in the decision making process using the eliminating criteria at the first stage the limits capable of potential underground dam establishment are assigned considering the criteria of so many that may not have existed improper areas are eliminated and potential areas are assigned as well mentioned criteria are provided in the shape of information layers and transmitted to parallel environments these criteria form parallel layers with a pixel size of 10 m prepared in accordance with boolean logic zero pixels and pixel perfect moreover they are unsuitable for underground dam construction being the number one factor having converted the sites from raster file to vector files through gis software and set it on the google earth these sites are visually studied moreover the polygons that are spotted inconveniently and out of reach by the gis software are eliminated finally the remaining polygons are identified as the most suitable sites to underground dam establishment in the first step of decision making process in the meantime some of the sites selected for the construction of the underground dam were either eliminated by the actual factors involved or were classified as inappropriate places in this paper at the first step the necessity of selecting a subsurface water drainage structure that stores and controls flow of water in semi arid and arid areas is reviewed research results farokhzadeh et al 2015 showed that the precision of underground dams location is higher when both ahp and boolean logic methods are used together and can be more accurate than the results obtained from the application of each of these methods alone and more acceptable for this reason we can say that in the boolean logic method the area we are examining is subdivided into appropriate and inappropriate areas but in the ahp method valuation of each region is based on the consideration of the priority of the factors so the use of both of these methods can provide researchers with more accuracy when evaluating and choosing the best places to build an underground dam absolute factors such as slopes sharper than 5 road boundary and rural boundary be determined and remove the appropriate places for this purpose dorfeshan et al 2014 in the results farokhzadeh et al 2015 in their research they stated that the most suitable places for the construction of underground dams the catchment areas of the watershed hamedan bahar and the outflows to underground water resources the researchers cited this option as low tidal streams in the area as well as the proper use of the area the results obtained in this study are in line with the results of other researchers such as chezge et al 2010 and esavi et al 2012 and on the one hand 3 2 second step identification of suitable axes at the second stage of decision making process the most suitable river flood way is assigned to underground dam establishment in each limit the shorter the axis length is the lesser the bulk of working structure becomes and the faster the operation moves forward furthermore the most suitable axes are those of short length that have a high expansion of fountain over them kheirkhah zarkesh 2008 in addition they possess straits features in highly expanded surface and low width axis as the most appropriate kinds of them to choose the tank surface indicator is derived from the multiplication of river width and the length of the water saved at the axis this length is directly proportional to the alluvium and conversely in relation with the slope of river slope obtaining from the formulation eq d 1 as follows d 1 l b 1 a l tank length meter b thickness of alluvium meter a river slope percent to completing the data set of the equation mentioned above the river slope is first calculated through the canal using the map of the regional slope proper areas used at first and second stage in the identifying suitable sites process of the semnan plain were shown in fig 3 at second step a number of criteria influence upon the decision making process during the identification of the most suitable site is concerned dorfeshan et al 2014 with the help of satellite imagery from their area were able to identify 27 locations with potential for the construction of an underground dam to finally identify the location of the underground dam at a specific point in a waterway in the meantime as the first alternatives with satellite imagery and aerial photos the places that were considered to have the highest accumulation of sediment along the waterways of the region were considered and eventually they were able to select 15 suitable places for this goal giovanni et al 2008 presented a methodology for the implementation of a small underground dams in the kidal region of mali in this methodology the criteria for doing this were selected quantitatively and qualitatively and based on the methods of field analysis and using data from satellites hydrological information as well as climatology were defined using this method 66 locations suitable for the construction of small underground dams were obtained finally 17 locations were matched with the criteria considered in this research a dam is naturally connected to an environment accordingly the morphology of the river valley plays a crucial role in the choice of a dam site if we ignore the use of reservoirs for recreational purposes the main criterion influencing the dam location is reservoir capacity thus the best site will be a narrow site where the valley widens upstream of the proposed dam jozaghi et al 2018 3 3 prioritization of axes using ahp at the third stage the average of statistical information achieved from the area was used in the 11th version of expert choice software package in this step proper sites for underground dam establishment relating to stage 2 were prioritized through ahp based on proportionality of indicator in this research based on literature review on previous studies specific conditions of semnan plain and data availability four main criteria considered as main factor are chosen for this research including socio economic reservoir axis and water factors are at the top row while criteria and indicators are placed at the bottom of decision making tree as well fig 4 the criteria that are chosen for such research work are different for example farokhzadeh et al 2015 in their studies seven criteria were considered as the main factors that were geology distances of fault springs well and qanat land use slope and aquifer thickness the results indicated that the most effective criterion in this research geology and the least effective ones distance of well spring and qanat also in research dorfeshan et al 2014 the main criteria selected for subsequent evaluations were two major factors reservoir names and economic criteria each containing several sub criteria namely decline hydraulic conductivity effective porosity and foundation permeability for the reservoir and location of dam and distance of dam from usage place for economic conditions the results of this study indicated that given the high weight and importance of each of the main criteria different options were prioritized for each of the criteria since each major study criterion had the same value and weight this could also be considered by decision makers to prioritize potential sites for underground dams based on the fact that the study area in these investigations was dehydrated and on the other hand the construction of these dams is also relatively inexpensive therefore from the two main criteria discussed the reservoir factor is more attractive than economic factors as the decision making tree shows the average evaluation of each plan shown as data was added to the expert choice software and each main criterion was assigned with a final value given experts opinion for weighing criteria subdivisions and indicators topically in present study the main criterion of water is divided into quality and quantity criteria quantity plan is obtained from the information provided by the local water organization of semnan province and soil conservation service of usa it obtains the amount of run off resulted from the rain fall and approximately the run off mass of underside flows for each district spreading less than 100 square kilometers the data on the quantity criterion of water is provided by the semnan province water organization which was categorized through wilcox s method in three grades water contaminating sources such as salt domes and evapotranspiration in the water quantity section were eliminated due to negative impacts on water resources in order to estimate the subsurface flow rate in the rivers of the study area the volume of flowing water was calculated first and then the volume of rainfall in the area was deducted based on the results obtained in this research and expert opinion the water criterion is prioritized in comparison with other criteria since it has the highest weight in hierarchical decision making due to the climatic conditions affecting the studied area and the existence of numerous problems the construction of an underground dam has a significant effect on the improvement of yield and balance in groundwater harvesting expert opinions have shown that water quantity is more important than its quality because in case of lack of or lack of subsurface flows the reservoir of the underground dam is not fully dewatered and with many problems including supply of water needs of right owners we will conclude with the results of nilsson 1988 regarding the collection of water using an underground dam with an emphasis on water quantity in african countries the more aqueducts have more discharge the more important it is to other aqueducts other main criteria to be considered are the status of the reservoir the sub criteria that are used to investigate the reservoir s state are reservoir depth surface expansion of the reservoir infiltration and slope the importance of penetrability is more than other factors affecting the volume of the reservoir and the reservoir slope is second to none suitable reservoirs are usually found in rivers that have an alluvial bed and permeability and depth identification of bedrock depth requires geophysical surveys which were not possible at this stage of the study due to the large area and cost and significant time for doing these explorations therefore from the depths of the first vertical access shaft of qanat it was tried to assume that the first vertical access shaft was drilled in the alluvial deposits of the region and can be used to approximate the depth of the subsoil sub criteria in axial position analysis include axial depth axle length and axial bearing lithology the cause of the top axis score is the ratio of other sub axis limits which creates a depth of excavation in the construction of an underground dam economic and social factors including the current water requirement in the area around the axis the access to the location of the axis of the underground dam and the impact of the axis on the amount of downstream water resources are the specific causes of the qanats due to the high importance of qanats for water supply the right to water in arid and semi arid areas is more important than the other two criteria in the prioritization table and this can be attributed to the dryness of the studied area it is more important and more valuable than anything else in the places where underground dams are built the economic conditions are such that it is necessary to use participatory or low level methods in the construction of such structures in these places existing local inputs can be used to advance the construction of underground dams for example you can use local materials or labourers in the same locations to reduce both the cost of construction and the efficiency of the dam s operation and its lifespan underground dams can have many benefits in improving the quality of life of people in these areas in addition it can lead to an increase in the variety and quality of food produced in these areas in addition providing water for irrigation of domesticated livestock and their dry fodder production has a significant role to play which can be a great achievement for this purpose foster and tuinhof 2004 based on the above the ahp method is a method that is very well designed to score and categorize before selecting appropriate locations by constructing underground dams in arid areas this process has included different choices in decision making process and is capable of analyzing sensitivity on criteria and sub criteria raju et al 2006 in addition it is based on mutual comparisons that ease both judgment and calculations given a broad applicability of decision making approaches there are many methods to prioritize the most identifying suitable sites alternatives of underground dams particularly either developing or developed nevertheless the reasons that ahp technique is used in this research are because of the simplification of analysis high accuracy and the capability of blending it into local experts opinions noticeably an important issue to study in natural resources field take the local experts opinions into it because they always have sufficient information on the elimination of cumbrous resources and fill in the questionnaire with most logical scores according to the environmental circumstances and scientific information moreover regarding the prioritization of underground dams and suitable sites there are many criteria according to them the weights are differently assigned archwichai et al 2005 briefly step three was applying ahp technique to prioritize eight different locations concerning diverse aspects including economic environmental technical and social shirani et al 2017 in an investigation to locate an underground dam in the ardestan region of northern isfahan province in iran studied the interaction between the gis and the spatial multi criterion evaluation method in this research geological engineering criteria were used using ahp method the main parameters were divided into several more detailed stages based on ahp higher factor factors were chosen and used arcgis for each indicator the vector layers were used for ease of operation as well as greater accuracy and less time according to the results obtained by the researchers in the ardestan region the best place to construct the underground dam was the locations in the west north and northwest of the area that had the most favored alluvium in these areas also dorfeshan et al 2014 in a research conducted in the andika region of khuzestan province in iran conducted an ahp methodology to locate suitable areas for underground dam construction in this study two major factors reservoir names and economic criteria were carefully considered finally 15 suitable sites were selected and the results showed that for the construction of an underground dam there are many important factors such as physical social and economic factors all of which must be carefully investigated in order to determine the difference between them what is clear is that achieving these goals using traditional and traditional methods is time consuming and costly and in this case the importance of using gis and its methods such as ahp can be found which is to a very specialized face designed to achieve these goals to which extent researchers can do so regarding the above issues there are many arid and semi arid regions around the world that have low environmental social and economic impacts on these areas and the presence of water and water resources can generally be the face of this change the areas for this reason the construction of underground dams can be an ideal solution for achieving this goal of course selecting the exact location for these dams is very important farokhzadeh et al 2015 in the research dorfeshan et al 2014 as discussed earlier the criteria that were considered include the reservoir and economic factors since water in the andika region plays a vital role in the lives of people in this area according to the results the reservoir criterion was of higher importance in the studies in a survey haidari and shahriari 2011 on the location of underground dams in the garmab basin in the golestan province of iran three areas were identified for this purpose although sediment accumulation across the main river affected this 3 4 ranking the suitable sites through comparing topsis with edas technique in this study the best sites among other suitable locations is obtained using topsis and edas techniques approaches for prioritization purposes in the forth step of decision making process consequently driving a comparison between topsis and edas cause those alternatives enjoy the highest similarity to the ideal solution to make it to the top places of water priority problem in semnan plain according to the authors knowledge there is a five step approach to rank location finding alternatives that is previously mentioned in this research study noticeably a novel idea has been used to interpret final location finding rank which is unlike other similar researches in this research the best and most suitable places for construction of underwater dams have been found comparing topsis and edas approaches in the fourth step of decision making process the resulting sorts provided by topsis and edas are significant from different aspects since the exact location of the underground dam is very important for the site and the socio economic criterion in this area such as access and distance from village road and source of building materials is important this comparison was drawn to achieve the best results in the first scenario priority of all criteria was the same to one another and absolute priority was given to a main criterion in other scenarios moreover other criteria and values are equal in second scenario for instance the main criterion water was assigned 9 and other main criteria were given 1 in accordance with saaty mutual comparing table accordingly the fountain criterions in the third scenario axis in fourth scenario and socio economic issues in fifth scenario have absolute priorities by increasing the accuracy of ranking and substituting topsis and edas algorithms for fixed scenarios interfering experts opinions each alternative is assigned a weight in both algorithms and the locations which achieve the highest score are the most proper locations for underground dam establishment during this step the ahp prioritized 8 axes are divided into seven alternatives and the initial numbers are normalized afterwards the most suitable sites obtained from both approaches results namely topsis and edas outcomes are driven by considering the seven experts opinions as to pre determined numbers in the questionnaire thus the alternative weights are placed in their proper gis software positions adapting the weight information to the final map of suitable sites in dam establishment map pixels take three different colours including red green and grey to demonstrate those of highly ranked locations in the gis software easily describing the colouring process red colour shows the highest potentiality of dam establishment expressing the most suitable sites of both approaches in the gis map as it is graphically shown in fig 5 the final weighing maps of the axes are presented according to the topsis and edas techniques of prioritization respectively next topsis and edas were compared and the results showed that the novel model yielded dependable and stable results providing more data on the uncertainty of decision makers the prioritizations as well as the determined prioritizing numbers are presented as follows 1 edas values e 0 848 a 0 761 d 0 609 c 0 447 b 0 218 h 0 160 f 0 141 g 0 087 2 topsis values d 0 619 a 0 527 c 0 523 e 0 482 b 0 461 h 0 435 g 0 422 f 0 320 according to the numerically prioritized sites e d c and a axes rank the first to forth furthermore these four axes as the best ones can be offered as agreed upon by all groups regarding the sites of underground dam construction fig 5 at the fourth step the techniques of topsis and edas are applied resulting in prioritizations that appear to have approximately ranked the same the most and least effective criteria are geology and distance of well spring and qanat in research of farokhzadeh et al 2015 confirming unequal importance of the criteria and sub criteria in ahp method for the construction of underground dams there is a major need for the geological features of the area under study which indicates its key role for this purpose and it is confirmed in study by researchers such as chezge et al 2010 and esavi et al 2012 in a study conducted by jozaghi et al 2018 in sistan and baluchestan province one of the driest provinces in iran a comparison was made between ahp and topsis techniques to select an appropriate underground ditch using gis and to verify the accuracy the results of this experiment were taken from real places of dams constructed in this area the results indicated that both methods provided high performance in this regard but the topsis technique was better than ahp and provided more accurate and reliable results ahp method was also used to locate underground dams in another study conducted by karimi mobarakabadi 2012 in khomein city in markazi province iran this method was able to provide four potential locations for the construction of an underground dam and the precision of the weight of the criteria according to their importance could be evaluated accurately by using 0 01148 as the adjustment rate finally it can be noted that studies on the construction of underground dams in arid and semi arid regions and in particular on surface reservoirs indicate that the use of new and effective methods for the construction of underground dams and in integrated watershed management has far more accurate results offers less costly and faster than traditional methods dorfeshan et al 2014 these new techniques and technologies in this section that are used to achieve the desired goals significantly reduce the risk of underground dams and associated environmental hazards at inappropriate locations 4 conclusions in recent years the construction of underground dams has grown with the use of new and up to date techniques due to the numerous benefits that water resources management and the economic and social conditions of arid areas have made in areas such as semnan province which is one of the driest and least rainy provinces in iran and there are few water resources in it the construction of underground dams can be an appropriate and very useful solution to overcome the adverse effects of dehydration in the area locating and constructing underground dams as well as dams constructed on the surface of the earth require a variety of studies that require in all respects technical economic social and environmental issues to be studied accurately and to achieve the desired results and achieve the desired goal for this target the best way to use geographic information systems is to apply functions and data coverage and satellite images and ultimately to interpret their results which is more cost effective faster than traditional ones is more precise and has far fewer environmental hazards and is also used at very large scales in addition to gis mcdm techniques help decision makers select between alternative solutions in this case sites for construction of dams where there are many criteria and there are many types of mcdm model three of the most widely used mcdm techniques are ahp edas and topsis that were used in this study comparing the methodology results of edas topsis and ahp as established in this research provides better vision of decision making method when it comes to finding the most suitable locations for underground dams over the semnan plain according to the first approach location a is the second most suitable location for constructing an underwater dam while locations e d and c are the first third and forth more suitable locations respectively with respect to the second approach location a remains the second most suitable location while location while locations d c and e are the first third and forth more suitable locations respectively furthermore the results are trustworthy to any future construction of underground dams in semi arid and arid regions of semnan province appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia
