5835,the paper presents the results of long term 1996 2017 studies of the chemical composition of rain snow and sleet in one of the cities with the highest concentrations of particulate matter in the air in europe the study included measurements of 45 chemical constituents of precipitation as well as its ph and ec concentrations of pm10 so2 and meteorological parameters were also analysed differences in cl and na concentrations were found depending on the type of precipitation snow or rain these differences are most probably caused by anthropogenic factors however to a small extent 18 19 they are associated with the total variability of the concentrations of these chemical constituents the differences between the concentrations of the remaining constituents of precipitation analysed are of lesser or negligible importance the main processes affecting the chemical composition of precipitation are the chemical weathering of suspended dust and the formation of mineral acid aerosols these processes shape the chemical composition of both rain and snow in a similar manner the differences between the chemical composition of rain and snow are the result of the concentrations of and mutual relations between selected chemical constituents and precipitation ph an important factor affecting the ph of precipitation is the effectiveness of the chemical weathering of suspended dust which may make the precipitation more alkaline it is very likely that ph buffering will occur which can prevent the ph of precipitation from decreasing especially in cold periods long term observations of variability in the concentrations of the chemical constituents indicate a slight but rather constant decrease in concentrations of most of the chemical constituents analysed as well as in the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in the air in krakow the directions of these changes reflect to a certain extent the complex transformations of industrial economic and social conditions in krakow within that period the typical ranges of variability of the recorded values of concentrations measurement values of 22 chemical constituents and the physical characteristics of rain sleet and snow presented in the paper can be used as reference ranges of these parameters typical for an area with a significant degree of atmospheric dust pollution keywords chemical composition of precipitation air pollutants multidimensional statistical methods urban area 1 introduction the chemical composition of precipitation is the result of complex dynamic interactions between cloud formation processes microphysical processes and a number of chemical reactions in the atmosphere however the concentration and origin of suspended dust as well as anthropogenic gaseous atmospheric constituents have a major influence on the chemical composition of precipitation seinfeld and pandis 2006 motor vehicles industry mineral extraction and broadly defined agriculture constantly emit various chemical substances into the atmosphere mayer 1999 kuttler and strassburger 1999 allen et al 2001 flemming et al 2005 due to high traffic volumes and industrialisation urban areas are responsible for the emission of various types of particulate air pollutants to a greater degree than rural areas kim and shon 2011 kim et al 2012 sharma et al 2014 the use of fossil fuels as a power source for industry and internal combustion engines increases the emission of air pollutants such as so2 nox volatile organic compounds vocs and various aerosols sillman 1999 atkinson 2000 marr and harley 2002 murphy et al 2007 teixiera et al 2008 wang et al 2013 masiol et al 2014 the combustion of petrol and diesel in vehicle engines results in the formation of particles with aerodynamic diameters ranging from below 0 1 to 2 μm lodge et al 1981 harrison et al 1996 as a result traffic related aerosols are particularly visible in fine particulate matter as a result of oxidation of so2 and nox contained in the exhaust gases from heating systems and vehicles high concentrations of so4 and no3 can be found in precipitation kellman et al 1982 stockwell and calvert 1983 in densely industrialised areas this has led to the large scale occurrence of acid rain and or photochemical smog lickens et al 1976 lickens and butler 1981 daum et al 1984 low et al 1991 wang and wang 1995 lickens et al 1996 hadi et al 1999 castillo et al 1983 galloway et al 1976 the results from stable sulphur isotopes confirm that so4 in precipitation primarily originates from high temperature minimum mean over sampling period 680 c combustion of fuels with δ34s signatures 4 4 górka et al 2017 according to the above mentioned authors the stable oxygen isotope composition of sulphates and precipitation water indicates that the contribution of sulphate generated directly by industrial processes was 49 during the long term observation period with a mean of 20 during the non heating and 40 during the heating periods heavy metals are also important contaminants related to industrial processes heavy metals emitted in combustion processes are mostly soluble and reactive due to the small size of the transporting particles thus they dissolve readily in the rain especially under conditions of low ph herrera et al 2009 a significant percentage of the total content of heavy metal particles falls with rain at the location where they were generated as a result of their high relative masses nurnberg et al 1984 lighter aerosols containing smaller particles of heavy metals with low precipitation velocity are easily carried by the wind smirnioudi et al 1998 they remain in the atmosphere until they are removed by various purification processes including dry and wet deposition hamilton taylor and willis 1990 yoo et al 2014 some of the heavy metals contained in the precipitation are taken up by the plant root systems and also by the leaf blades and introduced into the food chain chaney et al 1998 some of these metals are essential for the proper functioning of living organisms e g cu and zn while others such as cd pb as are dangerous caussy et al 2003 adamus et al 2004 heavy metals introduced into the soil through wet and dry deposition inhibit the growth of local microorganisms disturbing the processes of decomposition and transformation of organic matter hander et al 2001 becker et al 2006 understanding the mechanisms governing the chemical composition of the atmosphere is important for its short and long term impact on the ecosystem as a whole and on human health in particular steinnea 1990 kanellopoulo 2001 ostro 2004 perera and emmanuel 2005 samoli et al 2008 cooper et al 2010 apte et al 2015 lee et al 2015 the load of chemical constituents carried by precipitation may have a significant impact on the natural environment including animals and humans bytnerowicz et al 2005 studies of the chemical composition of precipitation can provide detailed data on the changes and other characteristics of local and or regional atmospheric air pollution calvo et al 2010 budhavant et al 2011 cerqueira et al 2014 wu et al 2015 due to the large spatial and seasonal variability of meteorological conditions the quantity of pollutants transferred by precipitation varies greatly this differentiation results from among other things differing areas of origin of the pollutants changing altitude for cloud formation and the direction of movement of air masses the dynamics of changes in air pollutant contents close to the earth s surface 1 0 km are high the average aerosol residence time in the air is one to six days stefan et al 2010 at the same time it is estimated that in moderate latitudes rain removes 70 80 of the mass of aerosols from the atmosphere falkowska and lewandowska 2009 the analysis of the chemical composition of precipitation is used to evaluate and estimate the impact of anthropogenic and natural emission sources on the atmosphere wet deposition of toxic inorganic compounds the weathering and dissolution of particulate matter pm as well as the long distance transport of suspended dust studies analysing these aspects of the chemical composition of precipitation in urban areas were presented by multiple researchers e g kanellopoulo 2001 hu et al 2003 moulia et al 2005 song and gao 2009 huang et al 2010 abdus salam et al 2014 mehr et al 2019 the aim of this study is to identify dependencies shaping the chemical composition and to determine the sources of origin of the chemical constituents in various types of precipitation rain snow sleet in krakow one of the cities with the highest level of particulate matter air pollution in europe the research can help to better understand the complex processes affecting the chemical composition of different types of precipitation and to determine the potential load of chemical compounds introduced into the environment in this manner it is also important to determine the typical most frequently occurring ranges of variation in the concentrations of selected chemical constituents and the values of the measurements of the physical characteristics of rain snow and sleet another significant consideration is the analysis of the temporal variability of concentrations of selected constituents of precipitation in order to enable the general directions of changes in the concentrations of these constituents over the 1996 2017 period to be determined this will provide grounds for an analysis of research results over time and the formulation of predictions regarding the potential directions and dynamics of changes in the recorded concentrations of the chemical constituents and the values of the measurements of the physical characteristics of precipitation krakow is a medium sized european city about 770 thousand residents and a regional transport hub with a well developed road and rail network large industrial plants located directly in krakow and its immediate vicinity include arcelormittal poland sa steelworks roasting or sintering installations and power plants edf krakow ec jaworzno ec skawina chp plants and other combustion installations in 2000 2017 the average annual values of pm10 and pm2 5 in the centre of krakow reached the following ranges respectively 56 96 and 38 61 μg m 3 during this period average annual concentrations of pm10 50 μg m 3 were observed from 132 to 262 days per year the characteristic feature of the air polluting dust in krakow is the high content of carbon particles soot and very high content of fine particles pm2 5 and very fine particles pm0 1 wilczynska michalik et al 2015 this is typical of the aerosols found in urban areas buseck and adachi 2008 as a rule the pm2 5 concentration in krakow is 60 80 of the value of the pm10 concentration wilczynska michalik et al 2015 very dusty air also leads to significant soil contamination in krakow the level of heavy metals in the soils within the city centre is significantly higher than the natural level of these elements in soils gąsiorek et al 2017 ciarkowska et al 2019 air pollution in krakow shows a clear seasonal variability and reaches its highest levels in the cold period this is largely due to the heating systems found in most of the buildings in krakow low calorific coal 25 kj wood coal waste with a high content of non flammable dusts and iron sulphides and in extreme cases even municipal waste are often used as fuel the occurrence of episodes of high concentrations of air pollutants in krakow in the cold period may indicate that this phenomenon is similar to the london type of smog but a significant difference is the relatively low concentration of so2 the annual average winter so2 concentrations in the years 2007 2017 did not exceed 20 μg m 3 juda rezler et al 2011 indicate that episodes of high concentrations of pm10 in cold periods in the cities of southern poland including krakow are more strongly associated with local pollutant emissions than in cities in central and northern poland where particles from distant sources long range transport and regional transport constitute a more significant element of the pm10 composition dense urban development and its location in a deep river valley which reduces the possibility of natural ventilation and favours the formation of fogs have a negative impact on the air conditions in krakow according to some authors the main factor contributing to the high concentrations of particulate matter in krakow is not usually a sharp increase in emissions although this may indirectly be related to a decrease in temperature but a deterioration in conditions conducive to the dispersion of pollutants in the near ground layer of the atmosphere pietras 2013 irrespective of the negative impact on human and animal health atmospheric pollution also affects inanimate elements of the environment long lasting high concentrations of sulphur compounds but also of other gaseous constituents and dusts in the air in krakow have caused significant damage to the stone elements of many valuable historical structures the process of destruction of the stone elements was associated primarily with the crystallisation of gypsum and other salts in the pore spaces of rocks causing so called salt weathering wilczyńska michalik 2004 2 sampling and measurements the precipitation sampling site is located in the centre of krakow within an area populated by blocks of flats 4 storeys in close proximity 50 m to a very busy traffic route road and tram traffic the ciep chief inspectorate for environmental protection data are from the jpoat 2 0 air quality database monitoring point for air pollution information is also located in the city centre approximately 2 km from the precipitation sampling site it is located in very similar conditions in relation to topography building development and urban traffic by one of the main traffic routes of the city meteorological parameters were recorded at the airport meteorological station in balice located approx 8 km from the place of precipitation sampling the samples of precipitation were collected in polyethylene hd vessels with a volume of 100 cm3 only the samples for which a sufficient amount of precipitation was obtained i e at least 25 30 cm3 of precipitation were used for the titration and spectrometric analysis in case of sleet or snow approximately 100 500 cm3 of precipitation was collected respectively so that after melting of the snow a sufficient amount of water was obtained for the test only fresh snow which had lain no longer than 6 h was collected for the study if precipitation episodes events occurred several times during the day samples were taken from individual precipitation episodes and examined independently from each other the precipitation collected was divided into 4 separate samples for the analysis of cations anions alkalinity and other measurements electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ wtw indicator samples collected for chemical analysis were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles samples for cation analysis were acidified using a few drops of concentrated hno3 that had been purified by redistillation chemical analyses were conducted in 1996 2017 by the accredited laboratory of the university of science and technology in krakow poland major dissolved elements were analysed by the icp aes method with an optima 7300dv perkin elmer and by the icp ms method with a elan 6100 perkin elmer an icp aes emission spectrometer with inductive coupled plasma plasma 40 perkin elmer was used to measure the contents of s ca mg na k fe sr zn and si the remaining microelements were measured using an icp ms mass spectrometer elan 6100 perkin elmer the content of total sulphur and total phosphorus was converted to so4 and po4 concentrations respectively the cl concentration was determined by the argentometric method an automatic micropipette was used for titration alkalinity was determined in the laboratory following the volumetric method and using a mixed indicator at ph values up to 8 6 in practice the alkalinity reflects the hco3 concentration 3 database the database contains physical chemical and meteorological data two research sub periods can be distinguished in the dataset in the period from 1996 04 03 to 1998 01 31 57 cases were listed in the database then there was no data until 2002 in addition in the period from 2002 09 24 to 2017 07 11 985 cases were listed in the database the data refers to rain r snow s and sleet rs samples physical and chemical analyses include the measurements of 47 parameters these include ph and ec

significantly exceed 50 table 1 the exceptions are so4 and partially hco3 which were used for further analysis despite a significant number of measurements loq as omission of these constituents makes

the small number of measurements of nitrogen compound concentrations these results were not used for further analysis average and median concentrations of no3 no2 and nh4 together with the number of measurements taken of them in particular types of precipitation are presented in table 1 the quality of individual results of the physical chemical analyses of precipitation was evaluated by calculating the ion difference id expressed as the following relationship 1 id σ c σ a σ c σ a 100 where σa sum of anions eq dm 3 σc sum of cations eq dm 3 the following constituents were used to calculate the id ca mg na k h3o hco3 so4 cl and po4 concentrations of h3o ions were calculated on the basis of the ph concentrations of po4 were calculated on the basis of the concentrations of phosphorus p measured in spectrometric tests due to absence of measurements of nitrogen compounds concentration the calculated id values should be treated as approximate the id may also be affected by taking into account the uncertainty u which determines with a probability of 95 the concentration range of the chemical constituent analysed in the range x u where x is the actual concentration of the constituent analysed the potential values of id increase decrease resulting from the inclusion of u for the selected chemical constituents are presented in table 2 taking into account the above it was decided that the results of physical and chemical analyses with the id in the range 30 will be used to conduct the tests to some extent 15 of cases this exceeds the recommendations of global atmosphere watch or european monitoring and evaluation programme regarding permissible errors in physical and chemical analyses of precipitation however the data set defined in this manner does not limit the possibility of applying statistical methods by significantly reducing the number of cases analysed the reduced database compiled as described contains 833 cases significant part of the data are cases with an id ranging from 30 to 20 fig 1 which results from significant problems with the precise measurements of anion concentrations in the ranges characteristic for precipitation it is difficult to determine the impact of these measurements errors on study results and conclusions among others thing they can cause interpretation difficulties and reduce the quality of statistical inference they can also cause the apparent strengthening of the anion influence because most likely these errors come actually from overestimating the concentrations these ions for about 100 cases from different time periods the measurements of trace element concentration are missing these deficiencies are usually the result of a breakdown or the periodic inspection of the measuring equipment and the ensuing inability to perform the measurements meteorological parameters characterised by high local variability are an important element of the database this applies in particular to the range direction and movement speed of precipitation zones the complex nature of precipitation in the city overlapping of several precipitation zones and variable movement speed of precipitation zones are frequently observed these factors are a result of the cyclonic character of the weather in southern poland in particular seasons of the year additionally there are no trends in the directions of changes in precipitation levels for this region of poland młyński et al 2018 precipitation zones are often only observed in certain parts of the city while there is no precipitation at all in other parts of the city therefore meteorological data which are parameters with a potential error of a magnitude that is difficult to determine should be treated as estimates 4 methods 4 1 the initial analysis and preparation of data the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to analyse the normality of data the results of the k s test showed that all the parameters tested were characterised by a distribution different from normal an attempt was made to normalise the distribution of these parameters using different types of transformations logarithmic fisher and box cox the best results were achieved for the box cox transformation however there are still many parameters with abnormal distributions table s1 levene s test was performed in order to check the homogeneity of variance for parameters with normal distribution the results obtained indicate that only some of the parameters analysed are characterised by the same variance p 0 05 table s2 this pertains to na so4 cl al fe cu rb wdsp and pm10 4 2 statistical analysis 4 2 1 anova one way anova analysis was applied in order to identify any possible variability in the concentrations or measurement values of the selected parameters in particular types of precipitation the parameters analysed were those that met the assumptions needed for parametric methods to apply i e those that have both a normal distribution and homogeneous variance tables s1 and s2 these include so4 cl na al fe cu rb wdsp and pm10 precipitation type rain r snow s and sleet rs were considered as independent variables in order to determine the percentage of the variance of the parameters being analysed that is directly related to the type of precipitation the following relationship was applied 2 ω 2 s s effect d f effect m s error m s error

degrees of freedom associated with an effect mserror mean square of an error sstotal total sum of squares a post hoc test was used to interpret the results of the analysis of variance tukey s extended test for uneven sets unequal n hsd was selected as the most suitable tukey s test is more conservative than the lsd test and is recommended for the comparison of pairs of averages in order to analyse the regularity of the distribution of the selected parameters over time an analysis of variance for factorial designs factorial anova was performed parameters with normal distributions and homogeneous variances were selected for analysis these include so4 cl ca and na the first set of independent variables are time criteria the cold and warm periods it is usually assumed that the cold period in poland lasts from 24 october to 29 march while the warm period lasts from 30 march to 23 october this division reflects the variability of weather conditions in krakow with a good approximation the second set of independent variables are two temperature ranges corresponding to the average daily temperature on the day of the occurrence of a rain episode 10 c and 10 c respectively the adopted boundary point temp 10 c is one of the criteria for the start of the heating season in krakow by multi family housing managers this is a contractual criterion and does not include single family houses and buildings with individual heating systems which constitute a significant proportion of the buildings in krakow in order to determine the percentage of the variance of the parameters under analysis that is directly related to the cold warm period and or the adopted temperature ranges relationship 2 was applied 4 2 2 pca in order to determine the processes shaping the chemical composition of various types of precipitation principal component analysis pca was used this method does not require normal distributions for large data sets two data sets were used for pca set r n 590 contains the results of physical and chemical analyses of rain as well as metrological parameters and concentrations of pm10 and so2 measured on the days of rainfall set s n 203 contains the results of physical and chemical analyses of snow as well as metrological parameters and concentrations of pm10 and so2 measured on the days of snowfall pca was not conducted for sleet rs due to the low volume of data n 40 for this type of precipitation in order to determine the adequacy of pca application and the selection of parameters for the analysis bartlett s test of sphericity was carried out and kaiser meyer olkin coefficients kmo were determined for kmo values below 0 6 the use of pca is ineffective and therefore the parameters for which kmo 0 6 were selected for further analysis the kaiser and cattell criteria were selected as the methods of determining the optimal number of pca factors in determining the number of factors the factors in the factorial scree and factors with a value of 1 6 were rejected given that the data analysed often have significantly different values and are expressed in different units a correlation matrix was used to carry out the pca 4 2 3 time variability time variability of so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb concentrations and the ph observed in rain samples r were analysed furthermore the variability of pm10 and so2 concentrations in days covering precipitation episodes was presented the remaining data sets i e s and rs were not analysed as there was an insufficient number of cases for a reliable assessment of long term variability time variability was studied in the periods from 1996 04 03 to 1998 01 31 and from 2002 09 24 to 2017 07 11 all cases were used in the study without excluding cases with anomalous values the occurrence of a trend was identified by examining the correlation between the selected parameters and time variables for this purpose the non parametric kendall tau coefficient was applied which as a rank method is resistant to the occurrence of anomalous observations 5 results the chemical composition of particular types of precipitation is presented in graphic form as fig 2 table 3 shows the ranges of variability in the recorded concentrations of selected chemical constituents and the measured values of the physical markers of rain snow and sleet table 3 the criteria for selecting the parameters are described in chapter 3 the results of the analysis of variance table s3 indicate that there are significant differences between the mean concentrations or measured values of most of the parameters analysed this pertains to so4 cl na al fe and pm10 however no such differentiation was found for cu rb and wdsp using the relationship 2 it was calculated what percentage of the variance of the parameters analysed is related to the type of precipitation table 4 the results of the hsd test are presented in the expected means ls means chart in fig 3 the use of a more conservative test scheffe test leads to similar results fig 4 presents the own values of the factors principal component analysis the cumulative percentage of variance explained by particular factors is reported in parentheses the results of the pca are presented in table 5 the variability of the concentrations of selected chemical constituents so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb and ph in rain samples occurring in the years 1996 1998 and 2002 2017 is presented in figs 5 and 6 the variability of the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in shorter observation periods 2002 2017 and 2002 2012 respectively is also presented the results of trend analysis using the non parametric kendall s tau coefficient τ are presented in table 6 6 discussion 6 1 chemical composition of precipitation and its range of variation the fig 2 shows general relationships in the chemical composition of particular types of precipitation snow and sleet are generally characterised as a population with a lower ph and an increased content of cl and na compared to rain despite their high variability the results of the studies are grouped into partially overlapping clusters which differ in shape this is particularly true for rain and snow therefore despite the changing conditions shaping the chemical composition of precipitation in the years 1996 2017 increase in the number of cars closure of industrial plants change in household heating technology etc it can be assumed that the factors affecting the chemical composition of particular types of atmospheric precipitation are similar furthermore these factors are similar irrespective of the large time interval between the studies taking into account the observations described above and a very large number of test results it was assumed that the range of 1σ from the mean value should as a good approximation reflect the typical most frequent range of variation in concentrations values of the individual precipitation constituents see table 3 68 of the data population is within the range between the 16th and 84th percentiles and this range is the same as the range of x 1 σ due to the large number of measurements particularly for rain and snow that average and reduce the impact of anomalous values the information provided may be used as reference ranges for other areas with high air dustiness 6 2 analysis of variance the values ω2 obtained table 4 indicate that only a small part of the variation in the concentrations or measured values of the parameters analysed is related to the type of precipitation the largest values of the variance related to the type of precipitation are observed for na and cl 19 and 18 respectively a similar value of variance that is explained 16 is also observed for pm10 therefore it can be assumed that in other cases of the study parameters the variability of their variance is related to other sources that were not analysed taking into account the observations discussed above the multiple comparison test post hoc was conducted only for na cl and pm10 the results of the hsd test table s4 show that there are differences in average na concentrations and pm10 values between rain r and snow s for cl however there are differences in the means between rain r and snow s and between rain r and sleet rs but here the differences are close to the limit of statistical insignificance 0 04 the results of the hsd test are presented in the expected means chart in fig 3 the resulting dependencies most probably indicate the relationship between na and cl and the de icing of traffic routes in cold periods using brine or a mixture of crystalline inorganic salts primarily nacl as a result of car and tram traffic aerosols with an increased content of na and cl are formed in such periods this effect can later be seen as the occurrence of snow and or sleet or occasionally rainfall during the thaw period with an increased content of na and cl this observation is somewhat in contradiction with the results obtained by other researchers wróbel et al 2000 who indicate that the spatial variation of cl in coarse aerosol 1 9 μm related to traffic is substantially different from the other constituents of this aerosol and the origin of cl is not related to traffic however according to the authors of this paper this does not exclude the relationship of cl with road traffic and rather indicates different processes controlling the concentration or recrystallisation of this element in aerosols chlorides in aerosols mainly occur in ionic form and do not undergo sorption or ion exchange processes while in solid form they occur sporadically mainly as secondary nacl crystals wilczynska michalik et al 2015 according to wróbel et al 2000 studies on the chemical composition of aerosols carried out in the centre of krakow near one of the main traffic routes in the city indicate that the share of road traffic in the concentration of coarse particles 1 9 μm is from 20 to 80 respectively between 1500 and 150 m from the road the share of road traffic in the concentration of fine particles 1 9 μm of individual elements was 50 70 close to the road 5 m however the fine aerosol pollution associated with road traffic affects the entire city there is a small but noticeable variation in mean concentrations of al and fe which is most probably related to the different concentrations and different chemical composition of pm10 in the warm and cold periods for so4 it can be assumed that the variation in concentrations of these ions dependent on the type of precipitation is negligible and of little significance the case of pm10 is different as pm10 is not measured directly in precipitation samples but is important as an indicator of air pollution by particulate matter on the day of precipitation the chemical composition of precipitation is largely dependent on the chemical composition and form of pm10 as well as the smaller fractions of particulate matter in the atmosphere it was found that there were differences in average concentrations of pm10 between the days of rainfall and the days of snowfall the highest pm10 values occur on the days with snow and or sleet i e in the cold period high values of correlation between pm10 and so2 are also observed on the days of occurrence of particular types of precipitation rain r 0 73 for n 336 snow r 0 73 for n 140 and sleet r 0 72 for n 18 this confirms that a significant proportion of the concentration of pm10 is associated with low emissions and the combustion of fossil fuels often containing sulphides mainly pyrite and or marcasite 6 3 principal component analysis the results of the bartlett s test of sphericity p values are 1 0 10 5 for sets r and s indicate that the application of pca to study the relationships between parameters in these sets is fully justified table s5 the sets of parameters that can be analysed with pca were determined using kmo coefficients table s6 these sets include ph ca mg na k hco3 so4 cl sio2 al ba fe mn sr zn cu pb sb po4 rb temp visib wdsp snow only and prcp rain only as well as pm10 pca was carried out for the thus selected parameters of the 793 cases used 378 cases r and 157 cases s respectively were processed during the pca the optimal number of factors was determined as three for set r and three for set s in the sets r and s the following factors were distinguished r1 r2 and r3 and s1 s2 and s3 table 5 the criterion for grouping parameters in factors was exceeding the value of 0 6 by the factor coordinates of these parameters the grouping of particular parameters in the factors identified is to a large extent the result of processes common to these parameters shaping their occurrence in the environment parameters with lower factor coordinates i e 0 5 0 6 show similar dependencies but their relationship with the factor identified is weaker or occurs only episodically more clearly the separate factors only explain the variance of the parameters under analysis to a certain extent for example the r1 factor explains 28 8 of the variance while the s1 factor explains 36 2 of the variance in the data sets analysed fig 3 this means that the remaining variance is related to sources and or processes other than those described below 6 3 1 r1 and s1 factors within the r1 and s1 factors several processes overlap which are common to both rain and snow affecting the chemical composition of these types of precipitation the key process is the chemical weathering of mineral particles floating in the atmosphere and dusts of anthropogenic origin according to wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2015 the particulate matter in the air of krakow is mainly composed of quartz aluminosilicates as well as carbonates and sulphates occasionally pure chlorides according to the authors cited above fe oxides metallic iron and other metal rich particles are common and carbonaceous particles soot are particularly abundant in the cold period as a result of the chemical weathering of these particles and dusts atmospheric precipitation is enriched with major ca mg and hco3 and minor ba sr mn and rb constituents other important processes are the reactions of inorganic anhydrides with water molecules and the formation of aerosols of mineral acids with the input of accompanying photochemical processes these processes enrich the atmospheric precipitation in so4 and partly also in hco3 aerosols of marine origin which provide a significant load of cl and na and the use of road salt for de icing traffic routes in the cold period are also a significant factor in the shaping of the chemical composition of precipitation road salt may contain small amounts of carnallite kcl mgcl2 6h2o which is a mineral with a relatively high rb content it is also worth noting that the effect of the volume of precipitation prcp on the chemical composition of rainwater is hardly noticeable however this may in part be the result of the distance between the rainfall sampling points and the rainfall volume measurement points see more section 2 pm10 is important for the r1 factor as it reflects the concentration of particles being an important source of the chemical constituents occurring in precipitation sio2 is more important in the s1 factor which probably indicates the effect associated with another form of sio2 and or si occurrence which in cold periods may be more closely related to the emission of ashes and furnace slag than to particles of quartz and aluminosilicates in statistical terms a clear proportional relationship between pm10 and the main chemical constituents exists only for rain the effect of pm10 on the concentration of these constituents in snowfall periods is practically unnoticeable despite higher concentrations of pm10 and generally lower ph in these periods which may increase the effectiveness of chemical weathering these observations indirectly indicate a different chemical composition of pm10 in the cold period this is confirmed by the results of other authors wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2015 who report that in krakow the aerosol suspended dust composition shows significant seasonal variation 6 3 2 r2 and s2 factors the r2 factor shows a directly proportional relationship between ph and hco3 which indicates the influence of the effectiveness of chemical weathering of mineral particles on hco3 concentrations and the ph of rainwater in the case of snow factor s2 i e in cold periods the relationship is much weaker this is due to the occurrence of snow cover and or frozen soil during these periods in such conditions it is much more difficult to deflate mineral particles containing numerous carbonates and aluminosilicates from the soil the bedrock of krakow and its surroundings is largely composed of limestones and marls so carbonate particles are common in soils and found in significant concentrations this is confirmed by the fact that the proportional relationship between ph and hco3 in relation to temperature is not very strong however noticeable and it does not occur in the case of snow the most likely explanation is that the more pronounced temperature effect is more pronounced only episodically in anomalous air temperatures in this case a greater influence of temperature on the solubility of mineral substances can also be observed in a similar way there may be a tendency to increase al and fe concentrations as the ph of precipitation decreases in the case of the s2 factor an inversely proportional relationship occurs between ph and most of the precipitation constituents fe zn cu pb as well as secondary al indicating an increase in concentrations of these elements with decreasing ph of precipitation the ph values of the cold precipitation are the lowest which allows more effective chemical weathering of the particles suspended in air and increases the concentrations of these elements the highest value of factor coordinates for fe may be the result of chemical weathering of particles that are the products of the combustion of fossil fuels with high pyrite and or marcasite content these particles are rich in iron compounds and are more abundant in the atmosphere in the cold compared to the warm period in both the r2 and s2 factors the factor values of pm10 are not high which indicates the lack of a significant influence of pm10 on the variability of parameters grouped in these factors in krakow spatial variability of the average metal content in pm10 zn ca and k mn and fe is observed depending on the distance from the arcelormittal steelworks samek 2012 which in the context of variable wind direction and strength may further complicate the pattern of the observed dependencies the ph value of both factors is not significantly dependent on so4 the correlation between so4 concentration and so2 content in the atmosphere is also very low r 0 12 p 0 006 n 530 this information supplements previous observations on the relationship between ph and other precipitation constituents and collectively indicates the buffering of the ph of precipitation this buffering is a result of numerous precipitation alkalising substances mainly carbonates and aluminosilicates in the atmosphere a similar situation has already been observed in krakow in 1970 80s apart from the high concentration of particulate matter very high concentrations of so2 in the atmospheric air were recorded at the same time there were significant emissions of rainfall alkalising constituents from numerous industrial and power plants cement plant in pleszew solvay sodium plant arcelormittal steelworks formerly the lenin steelworks chp plant in łęg etc therefore typical acid rains with ph 5 1 appeared sporadically in krakow in the 1970s and 1980s for example between 1987 and 1989 the ph of precipitation ranged from 4 81 to 7 42 while precipitation had high ec values of 100 or more μs m 1 turzański 1995 the ph of precipitation is also affected by other factors that were not analysed in our paper these are mainly nitrogen compounds nox and nh3 the concentrations of no3 or nh4 in precipitation are similar to the concentrations of the main chemical constituents table 1 in krakow between 2009 and 2013 increased concentrations of nitrogen compounds were observed in the cold period especially nh4 usually 0 5 0 8 mg dm 3 depending on the measurement point particularly in regions with intensive low level emissions from heating systems żurek et al 2013 nox and nh3 have a different effect on ph as they can acidify or alkalise precipitation respectively therefore it is difficult to estimate the effect of nitrogen compounds on the ph of different types of precipitation 6 3 3 r3 and s3 factors the r3 factor indicates a direct proportional correlation between cu and pb and reflects the common source of these metals and or the process shaping their occurrence in rainwater that is difficult to identify temperature may also have some influence on the variability of cu and pb concentrations table 5 however this effect is most probably episodic in anomalous air temperatures the s3 factor show the clear influence of an increased pm10 concentration on the reduction of transparency of the atmosphere and the influence of increased wind speed on the reduction of pm10 concentration this reflects the well known physical phenomenon of removing atmospheric pollution by wind however the pm10 concentration in the atmosphere is not only related to wind speed and the s3 factor explains only a small percentage 8 8 of the overall variability of these parameters it is also important that all these parameters can be characterised by high variability on an hourly scale their values used for pca were averaged over 24 h 6 4 time variability the variability of the concentrations of selected chemical constituents so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb and ph in rain samples occurring in the years 1996 1998 and 2002 2017 is showed in figs 5 and 6 the results of trend analysis using the non parametric kendall s tau coefficient τ are presented in table 6 all statistically significant values of τ are negative which reflects the occurrence of decreasing trends with a probability of 95 values of τ are not high which indicates that there are noticeable but in some cases very weak trends the strongest trend is for ca which may indicate a general decrease in the content of mineral particles mainly carbonates and aluminosilicates and or anthropogenic dusts in the atmosphere of krakow these observations are confirmed by a similar although slightly weaker correlation for pm10 indicating a trend of decreasing air dustiness on days of precipitation episodes the analysis of long term variability of pm10 concentration regardless of precipitation episodes also indicates a decrease in the pm10 concentration in krakow similar observations apply to zn and pb as well as so2 in the case of pb the downward trend in concentrations of this element may indicate a connection with the total withdrawal of leaded petrol which had added lead tetraethyl c2h5 4pb from sale in poland from 2005 onwards the decrease in so2 concentrations observed independently of the occurrence of precipitation events is also indicated by other authors wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2017 a certain regularity of distribution in time is visible for all the parameters analysed in order to examine this regularity a factorial anova analysis was performed parameters with normal distributions and homogeneous variance were selected for the study these include so4 cl ca and na the first set of independent variables are time criteria cold and warm periods the second set of independent variables are two temperature ranges corresponding to the average daily temperature on the day of precipitation 10 c and 10 c respectively in general the time and temperature ranges adopted reflect periods during which the use of fossil fuels for heating purposes may decrease or increase significantly the results of the analysis of variance indicate that despite statistically significant results table s7 only a negligible part of the variation in concentrations of chemical constituents under analysis is related to the variability of the weather season and or temperature in the ranges examined for all the chemical constituents analysed the parameter ω2 changes in the range of 0 6 1 4 selecting other independent variables for example other temperature limits 0 c 5 c etc leads to similar results there were no interactions found between the independent variables 7 conclusions the research completed permitted a better understanding of the processes shaping the chemical composition of different types of precipitation in one of the most polluted cities in europe it was found that the concentrations of chemical constituents differed depending on the type of precipitation this conclusion applies mainly to rain and snow and is observed primarily for na and cl but is only to a small extent associated with the total variability in concentrations of these chemical constituents for the remaining chemical constituents analysed i e al fe and so4 the variation of concentrations depending on the type of precipitation is even less significant or negligible the observed variation can be largely attributed to anthropogenic factors such as the use of road salt or brine for de icing the traffic routes the main processes affecting the chemical composition of rain and snow are the chemical weathering of suspended dust and the formation of mineral acid aerosols these processes shape the chemistry of both rain and snow in a similar manner however one can observe a different effect of pm10 on the chemical composition of these types of precipitation indirectly this indicates differences in the chemical composition of particulate matter in the atmosphere between the warm period and the cold period when solid fuels are used for heating on a large scale the different relationship between ph and the chemical constituents of rain and snow is also derived from the differences in the chemical composition of pm10 it was found that the effectiveness of chemical weathering of particles and dusts suspended in the air which may buffer the ph of precipitation has a significant influence on the ph of rain and snow in other words high concentrations of dusts in the air of krakow may paradoxically to some extent prevent a decrease in the ph of atmospheric precipitation especially in the cold period however it should be noted that this interpretation does not take into account the effect of gaseous nitrogen compounds on the ph of precipitation which undoubtedly occurs therefore the description of the factors shaping the variation in the ph of precipitation although we consider it to be reliable cannot be treated as complete the interpretation presented above concerns only a part about one third or less of the analysed data set this interpretation is characterized by high credibility and refers to processes whose occurrence was determined with a probability of 95 confidence level of statistical methods used it is also possible that the same or very similar interpretation is also true for the rest of the analysed data set however with a lower probability that is difficult to determine in addition it cannot be excluded that the remaining part of the variability of the parameters under analysis may be theoretically related to sources and or processes different from those presented in our paper this state of affairs is a result of many factors one of them is the need to significantly simplify the description of different meteorological conditions very large errors typical for the physical chemical analyses of precipitation are also an important factor it is likely that even a significant increase in the number of cases analysed and or an extension of the study period will not lead to significantly better results in the studies of the chemical composition of precipitation the temporal variability of the study parameters is largely oscillatory seasonal however general directions of variability of these parameters over time can be noticed in the years 1996 2017 we observed a slight but noticeable and basically constant decrease in the concentrations of most of the chemical constituents of precipitation as well as in the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in the air to a large extent this indicates a connection with the closure of industrial plants in or near krakow and a reduction in emissions of exhaust fumes and industrial dust a gradual change in the method of heating mainly using natural gas or fuel oil and or the use of better quality coal which is the result of the economic and social development of the city may also be important a very weak but noticeable trend towards a decrease in the ph of rainwater can generally be attributed to a decrease in the amount of particulate matter buffering the ph of rainwater most probably this effect may still be observable for some time although given the reduced emission of so2 from industrial sources and the anti smog activities carried out in krakow a total ban on solid fuels for heating mainly coal and wood from 2019 typical acid rains with a ph significantly lower than currently observed should not be expected since other factors gaseous nitrogen compounds affect the ph of precipitation a comprehensive description of these relationships seems to pose an important task for the immediate future particularly in view of the significant development of road traffic and the increase in the number of cars which are significant new sources of gaseous nitrogen compounds credit authorship contribution statement

5835,the paper presents the results of long term 1996 2017 studies of the chemical composition of rain snow and sleet in one of the cities with the highest concentrations of particulate matter in the air in europe the study included measurements of 45 chemical constituents of precipitation as well as its ph and ec concentrations of pm10 so2 and meteorological parameters were also analysed differences in cl and na concentrations were found depending on the type of precipitation snow or rain these differences are most probably caused by anthropogenic factors however to a small extent 18 19 they are associated with the total variability of the concentrations of these chemical constituents the differences between the concentrations of the remaining constituents of precipitation analysed are of lesser or negligible importance the main processes affecting the chemical composition of precipitation are the chemical weathering of suspended dust and the formation of mineral acid aerosols these processes shape the chemical composition of both rain and snow in a similar manner the differences between the chemical composition of rain and snow are the result of the concentrations of and mutual relations between selected chemical constituents and precipitation ph an important factor affecting the ph of precipitation is the effectiveness of the chemical weathering of suspended dust which may make the precipitation more alkaline it is very likely that ph buffering will occur which can prevent the ph of precipitation from decreasing especially in cold periods long term observations of variability in the concentrations of the chemical constituents indicate a slight but rather constant decrease in concentrations of most of the chemical constituents analysed as well as in the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in the air in krakow the directions of these changes reflect to a certain extent the complex transformations of industrial economic and social conditions in krakow within that period the typical ranges of variability of the recorded values of concentrations measurement values of 22 chemical constituents and the physical characteristics of rain sleet and snow presented in the paper can be used as reference ranges of these parameters typical for an area with a significant degree of atmospheric dust pollution keywords chemical composition of precipitation air pollutants multidimensional statistical methods urban area 1 introduction the chemical composition of precipitation is the result of complex dynamic interactions between cloud formation processes microphysical processes and a number of chemical reactions in the atmosphere however the concentration and origin of suspended dust as well as anthropogenic gaseous atmospheric

responsible for the emission of various types of particulate air pollutants to a greater degree than rural areas kim and shon 2011 kim et al 2012 sharma et al 2014 the use of fossil fuels as a power

diameters ranging from below 0 1 to 2 μm lodge et al 1981 harrison et al 1996 as a result traffic related aerosols are particularly visible in fine particulate matter as a result of oxidation of so2 and nox contained in the exhaust gases from heating systems and vehicles high concentrations of so4 and no3 can be found in precipitation kellman et al 1982 stockwell and calvert 1983 in densely industrialised areas this has led to the large scale occurrence of acid rain and or photochemical smog lickens et al 1976 lickens and butler 1981 daum et al 1984 low et al 1991 wang and wang 1995 lickens et al 1996 hadi et al 1999 castillo et al 1983 galloway et al 1976 the results from stable sulphur isotopes confirm that so4 in precipitation primarily originates from high temperature minimum mean over sampling period 680 c combustion of fuels with δ34s signatures 4 4 górka et al 2017 according to the above mentioned authors the stable oxygen isotope composition of sulphates and precipitation water indicates that the contribution of sulphate generated directly by industrial processes was 49 during the long term observation period with a mean of 20 during the non heating and 40 during the heating periods heavy metals are also important contaminants related to industrial processes heavy metals emitted in combustion processes are mostly soluble and reactive due to the small size of the transporting particles thus they dissolve readily in the rain especially under conditions of low ph herrera et al 2009 a significant percentage of the total content of heavy metal particles falls with rain at the location where they were generated as a result of their high relative masses nurnberg et al 1984 lighter aerosols containing smaller particles of heavy metals with low precipitation velocity are easily carried by the wind smirnioudi et al 1998 they remain in the atmosphere until they are removed by various purification processes including dry and wet deposition hamilton taylor and willis 1990 yoo et al 2014 some of the heavy metals contained in the precipitation are taken up by the plant root systems and also by the leaf blades and introduced into the food chain chaney et al 1998 some of these metals are essential for the proper functioning of living organisms e g cu and zn while others such as cd pb as are dangerous caussy et al 2003 adamus et al 2004

data on the changes and other characteristics of local and or regional atmospheric air pollution calvo et al 2010 budhavant et al 2011 cerqueira et al 2014 wu et al 2015 due to the large spatial and seasonal variability of meteorological conditions the quantity of pollutants transferred by precipitation varies greatly this differentiation results from among other things differing areas of origin of the pollutants changing altitude for cloud formation and the direction of movement of air masses the dynamics of changes in air pollutant contents close to the earth s surface 1 0 km are high the average aerosol residence time in the air is one to six days stefan et al 2010 at the same time it is estimated that in moderate latitudes rain removes 70 80 of the mass of aerosols from the atmosphere falkowska and lewandowska 2009 the analysis of the chemical composition of precipitation is used to evaluate and estimate the impact of anthropogenic and natural emission sources on the atmosphere wet deposition of toxic inorganic compounds the weathering and dissolution of particulate matter pm as well as the long distance transport of suspended dust studies analysing these aspects of the chemical composition of precipitation in urban areas were presented by multiple researchers e g kanellopoulo 2001 hu et al 2003 moulia et al 2005 song and gao 2009 huang et al 2010 abdus salam et al 2014 mehr et al 2019 the aim of this study is to identify dependencies shaping the chemical composition and to determine the sources of origin of the chemical constituents in various types of precipitation rain snow sleet in krakow one of the cities with the highest level of particulate matter air pollution in europe the research can help to better understand the complex processes affecting the chemical composition of different types of precipitation and to determine the potential load of chemical compounds introduced into the environment in this manner it is also important to determine the typical most frequently occurring ranges of variation in the concentrations of selected chemical constituents and the values of the measurements of the physical characteristics of rain snow and sleet another significant consideration is the analysis of the temporal variability of concentrations of selected constituents of precipitation in order to enable the general directions of changes in the concentrations of these constituents over the 1996 2017 period to be determined this will provide grounds for an analysis of research results over time and the formulation of predictions regarding the potential directions and dynamics of changes in the recorded concentrations of the chemical constituents and the values of the measurements of the physical characteristics of precipitation krakow is a medium sized european city about 770 thousand residents and a regional transport hub with a well developed road and rail network large industrial plants located directly in krakow and its immediate vicinity include arcelormittal poland sa steelworks roasting or sintering installations and power plants edf krakow ec jaworzno ec skawina chp plants and other combustion installations in 2000 2017 the average annual values of pm10 and pm2 5 in the centre of krakow reached the following ranges respectively 56 96 and 38 61 μg m 3 during this period average annual concentrations of pm10 50 μg m 3 were observed from 132 to 262 days per year the characteristic feature of the air polluting dust in krakow is the high content of carbon particles soot and very high content of fine particles pm2 5 and very fine particles pm0 1 wilczynska michalik et al 2015 this is typical of the aerosols found in urban areas buseck and adachi 2008 as a rule the pm2 5 concentration in krakow is 60 80 of the value of the pm10 concentration wilczynska michalik et al 2015 very dusty air also leads to significant soil contamination in krakow the level of heavy metals in the soils within the city centre is significantly higher than the natural level of these elements in soils gąsiorek et al 2017 ciarkowska et al 2019 air pollution in krakow shows a clear seasonal variability and reaches its highest levels in the cold period this is largely due to the heating systems found in most of the buildings in krakow low calorific coal 25 kj wood coal waste with a high content of non flammable dusts and iron sulphides and in extreme cases even municipal waste are often used as fuel the occurrence of episodes of high concentrations of air pollutants in krakow in the cold period may indicate that this phenomenon is similar to the london type of smog but a significant difference is the relatively low concentration of so2 the annual average winter so2 concentrations in the years 2007 2017 did not exceed 20 μg m 3 juda rezler et al 2011 indicate that episodes of high concentrations of pm10 in cold periods in the cities of southern poland including krakow are more strongly associated with local pollutant emissions than in cities in central and northern poland where particles from distant sources long range transport and regional transport constitute a more significant element of the pm10 composition dense urban development and its location in a deep river valley which reduces the possibility of natural ventilation and favours the formation of fogs have a negative impact on the air conditions in krakow according to some authors the main factor contributing to the high concentrations of particulate matter in krakow is not usually a sharp increase in emissions although this may indirectly be related to a decrease in temperature but a deterioration in conditions conducive to the dispersion of pollutants in the near ground layer of the atmosphere pietras 2013 irrespective of the negative impact on human and animal health atmospheric pollution also affects inanimate elements of the environment long lasting high concentrations of sulphur compounds but also of other gaseous constituents and dusts in the air in krakow have caused significant damage to the stone elements of many valuable historical structures the process of destruction of the stone elements was associated primarily with the crystallisation of gypsum and other salts in the pore spaces of rocks causing so called salt weathering wilczyńska michalik 2004 2 sampling and measurements the precipitation sampling site is located in the centre of krakow within an area populated by blocks of flats 4 storeys in close proximity 50 m to a very busy traffic route road and tram traffic the ciep chief inspectorate for environmental protection data are from the jpoat 2 0 air quality database monitoring point for air pollution information is also located in the city centre approximately 2 km from the precipitation sampling site it is located in very similar conditions in relation to topography building development and urban traffic by one of the main traffic routes of the city meteorological parameters were recorded at the airport meteorological station in balice located approx 8 km from the place of precipitation sampling the samples of precipitation were collected in polyethylene hd vessels with a volume of 100 cm3 only the samples for which a sufficient amount of precipitation was obtained i e at least 25 30 cm3 of precipitation were used for the titration and spectrometric analysis in case of sleet or snow approximately 100 500 cm3 of precipitation was collected respectively so that after melting of the snow a sufficient amount of water was obtained for the test only fresh snow which had lain no longer than 6 h was collected for the study if precipitation episodes events occurred several times during the day samples were taken from individual precipitation episodes and examined independently from each other the precipitation collected was divided into 4 separate samples for the analysis of cations anions alkalinity and other measurements electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ wtw indicator samples collected for chemical analysis were immediately passed through a 0 45 μm membrane filter into polyethylene bottles samples for cation analysis were acidified using a few drops of concentrated hno3 that had been purified by redistillation chemical analyses were conducted in 1996 2017 by the accredited laboratory of the university of science and technology in krakow poland major dissolved elements were analysed by the icp aes method with an optima 7300dv perkin elmer and by the icp ms method with a elan 6100 perkin elmer an icp aes emission spectrometer with inductive coupled plasma plasma 40 perkin elmer was used to measure the contents of s ca mg na k fe sr zn and si the remaining microelements were measured using an icp ms mass spectrometer elan 6100 perkin elmer the content of total sulphur and total phosphorus was converted to so4 and po4 concentrations respectively the cl concentration was determined by the argentometric method an automatic micropipette was used for titration alkalinity was determined in the laboratory following the volumetric method and using a mixed indicator at ph values up to 8 6 in practice the alkalinity reflects the hco3 concentration 3 database the database contains physical chemical and meteorological data two research sub periods can be distinguished in the dataset in the period from 1996 04 03 to 1998 01 31 57 cases were listed in the database then there was no data until 2002 in addition in the period from 2002 09 24 to 2017 07 11

calculating the ion difference id expressed as the following relationship 1 id σ c σ a σ c σ a 100 where σa sum of anions eq dm 3 σc sum of cations eq dm 3 the following constituents were used to calculate the id ca mg na k h3o hco3 so4 cl and po4 concentrations of h3o ions were calculated on the basis of the ph concentrations of po4 were calculated on the basis of the concentrations of phosphorus p measured in spectrometric tests due to absence of measurements of nitrogen compounds concentration the calculated id values should be treated as approximate the id may also be affected by taking into account the uncertainty u which determines with a probability of 95 the concentration range of the chemical constituent analysed in the range x u where x is the actual concentration of the constituent analysed the potential values of id increase decrease resulting from the inclusion of u for the selected chemical constituents are presented in table 2 taking into account the above it was decided that the results of physical and chemical analyses with the id in the range 30 will be used to conduct the tests to some extent 15 of cases this exceeds the recommendations of global atmosphere watch or european monitoring and evaluation programme regarding permissible errors in physical and chemical analyses of precipitation however the data set defined in this manner does not limit the possibility of applying statistical methods by significantly reducing the number of cases analysed the reduced database compiled as described contains 833 cases significant part of the data are cases with an id ranging from 30 to 20 fig 1 which results from significant problems with the precise measurements of anion concentrations in the ranges characteristic for precipitation it is difficult to determine the impact of these measurements errors on study results and conclusions among others thing they can cause interpretation difficulties and reduce the quality of statistical inference they can also cause the apparent strengthening of the anion influence because most likely these errors come actually from overestimating the concentrations these ions for about 100 cases from different time periods the measurements of trace element concentration are missing these deficiencies are usually the result of a breakdown or the periodic inspection of the measuring equipment and the ensuing inability to perform the measurements meteorological parameters characterised by high local variability are an important element of the database this applies in particular to the range direction and movement speed of precipitation zones the complex nature of precipitation in the city overlapping of several precipitation zones and variable movement speed of precipitation zones are frequently observed these factors are a result of the cyclonic character of the weather in southern poland in particular seasons of the year additionally there are no trends in the directions of changes in precipitation levels for this region of poland młyński et al 2018 precipitation zones are often only observed in certain parts of the city while there is no precipitation at all in other parts of the city therefore meteorological data which are parameters with a potential error of a magnitude that is difficult to determine should be treated as estimates 4 methods 4 1 the initial analysis and preparation of data the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to analyse the normality of data the results of the k s test showed that all the parameters tested were characterised by a distribution different from normal an attempt was made to normalise the distribution of these parameters using different types of transformations logarithmic fisher and box cox the best results were achieved for the box cox transformation however there are still many parameters with abnormal distributions table s1 levene s test was performed in order to check the homogeneity of variance for parameters with normal distribution the results obtained indicate that only some of the parameters analysed are characterised by the same variance p 0 05 table s2 this pertains to na so4 cl al fe cu

the regularity of the distribution of the selected parameters over time an analysis of variance for factorial designs factorial anova was performed parameters with normal distributions and homogeneous variances were selected for analysis these include so4 cl ca and na the first set of independent variables are time criteria the cold and warm periods it is usually assumed that the cold period in poland lasts from 24 october to 29 march while the warm period lasts from 30 march to 23 october this division reflects the variability of weather conditions in krakow with a good approximation the second set of independent variables are two temperature ranges corresponding to the average daily temperature on the day of the occurrence of a rain episode 10 c and 10 c respectively the adopted boundary point temp 10 c is one of the criteria for the start of the heating season in krakow by multi family housing managers this is a contractual criterion and does not include single family houses and buildings with individual heating systems which constitute a significant proportion of the buildings in krakow in order to determine the percentage of the variance of the parameters under analysis that is directly related to the cold warm period and or the adopted temperature ranges relationship 2 was applied 4 2 2 pca in order to determine the processes shaping the chemical composition of various types of precipitation principal component analysis pca was used this method does not require normal distributions for large data sets two data sets were used for pca set r n 590 contains the results of physical and chemical analyses of rain as well as metrological parameters and concentrations of pm10 and so2 measured on the days of rainfall set s n 203 contains the results of physical and chemical analyses of snow as well as metrological parameters and concentrations of pm10 and so2 measured on the days of snowfall pca was not conducted for sleet rs due to the low volume of data n 40 for this type of precipitation in order to determine the adequacy of pca application and the selection of parameters for the analysis bartlett s test of sphericity was carried out and kaiser meyer olkin coefficients kmo were determined for kmo values below 0 6 the use of pca is ineffective and therefore the parameters for which kmo 0 6 were selected for further analysis the kaiser and cattell criteria were selected as the methods of determining the optimal number of pca factors in determining the number of factors the factors in the factorial scree and factors with a value of 1 6 were rejected given that the data analysed often have significantly different values and are expressed in different units a correlation matrix was used to carry out the pca 4 2 3 time variability time variability of so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb concentrations and the ph observed in rain samples r were analysed furthermore the variability of pm10 and so2 concentrations in days covering precipitation episodes was presented the remaining data sets i e s and rs were not analysed as there was an insufficient number of cases for a reliable assessment of long term variability time variability was studied in the periods from 1996 04 03 to 1998 01 31 and from 2002 09 24 to 2017 07 11 all cases were used in the study without excluding cases with anomalous values the occurrence of a trend was identified by examining the correlation between the selected parameters and time variables for this purpose the non parametric kendall tau coefficient was applied which as a rank method is resistant to the occurrence of anomalous observations 5 results the chemical composition of particular types of precipitation is presented in graphic form as fig 2 table 3 shows the ranges of variability in the recorded concentrations of selected chemical constituents and the measured values of the physical markers of rain snow and sleet table 3 the criteria for selecting the parameters are described in chapter 3 the results of the analysis of variance table s3 indicate that there are significant differences between the mean concentrations or measured values of most of the parameters analysed this pertains to so4 cl na al fe and pm10 however no such differentiation was found for cu rb and wdsp using the relationship 2 it was calculated what percentage of the variance of the parameters analysed is related to the type of precipitation table 4 the results of the hsd test are presented in the expected means ls means chart in fig 3 the use of a more conservative test scheffe test leads to similar results fig 4 presents the own values of the factors principal component analysis the cumulative percentage of variance explained by particular factors is reported in parentheses the results of the pca are presented in table 5 the variability of the concentrations of selected chemical constituents so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb and ph in rain samples occurring in the years 1996 1998 and 2002 2017 is presented in figs 5 and 6 the variability of the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in shorter observation periods 2002 2017 and 2002 2012 respectively is also presented the results of trend analysis using the non parametric kendall s tau coefficient τ are presented in table 6 6 discussion 6 1 chemical composition of precipitation and its range of variation the fig 2 shows general relationships in the chemical composition of particular types of precipitation snow and sleet are generally characterised as a population with a lower ph and an increased content of cl and na compared to rain despite their high variability the results of the studies are grouped into partially overlapping clusters which differ in shape this is particularly true for rain and snow therefore despite the changing conditions shaping the chemical composition of precipitation in the years 1996 2017 increase in the number of cars closure of industrial plants change in household heating technology etc it can be assumed that the factors affecting the chemical composition of particular types of atmospheric precipitation are similar furthermore these factors are similar irrespective of the large time interval between the studies taking into account the observations described above and a very large number of test results it was assumed that the range of 1σ from the mean value should as a good approximation reflect the typical most frequent range of variation in concentrations values of the individual precipitation constituents see table 3 68 of the data population is within the range between the 16th and 84th percentiles and this range is the same as the range of x 1 σ due to the large number of measurements particularly for rain and snow that average and reduce the impact of anomalous values the information provided may be used as reference ranges for other areas with high air dustiness 6 2 analysis of variance the values ω2 obtained table 4 indicate that only a small part of the variation in the concentrations or measured values of the parameters analysed is related to the type of precipitation the largest values of the variance related to the type of precipitation are observed for na and cl 19 and 18 respectively a similar value of variance that is explained 16 is also observed for pm10 therefore it can be assumed that in other cases of the study parameters the variability of their variance is related to other sources that were not analysed taking into account the observations discussed above the multiple comparison test post hoc was conducted only for na cl and pm10 the results of the hsd test table s4 show that there are differences in average na concentrations and pm10 values between rain r and snow s for cl however there are differences in the means between rain r and snow s and between rain r and sleet rs but here the differences are close to the limit of statistical insignificance 0 04 the results of the hsd test are presented in the expected means chart in fig 3 the resulting dependencies most probably indicate the relationship between na and cl and the de icing of traffic routes in cold periods using brine or a mixture of crystalline inorganic salts primarily nacl as a result of car and tram traffic aerosols with an increased content of na and cl are formed in such periods this effect can later be seen as the occurrence of snow and or sleet or occasionally rainfall during the thaw period with an increased content of na and cl this observation is somewhat in contradiction with the results obtained by other researchers wróbel et al 2000 who indicate that the spatial variation of cl in coarse aerosol 1 9 μm related to traffic is substantially different from the other constituents of this aerosol and the origin of cl is not related to traffic however according to the authors of this paper this does not exclude the relationship of cl with road traffic and rather indicates different processes controlling the concentration or recrystallisation of this element in aerosols chlorides in aerosols mainly occur in ionic form and do not undergo sorption or ion exchange processes while in solid form they occur sporadically mainly as secondary nacl crystals wilczynska michalik et al 2015 according to wróbel et al 2000 studies on the chemical composition of aerosols carried out in the centre of krakow near one of the main traffic routes in the city indicate that the share of road traffic in the concentration of coarse particles 1 9 μm is from 20 to 80 respectively between 1500 and 150 m from the road the share of road traffic in the concentration of fine particles 1 9 μm of individual elements was 50 70 close to the road 5 m however the fine aerosol pollution associated with road traffic affects the entire city there is a small but noticeable variation in mean concentrations of al and fe which is most probably related to the different concentrations and different chemical composition of pm10 in the warm and cold periods for so4 it can be assumed that the variation in concentrations of these ions dependent on the type of precipitation is negligible and of little significance the case of pm10 is different as pm10 is not measured directly in precipitation samples but is important as an indicator of air pollution by particulate matter on the day of precipitation the chemical composition of precipitation is largely dependent on the chemical composition and form of pm10 as well as the smaller fractions of particulate matter in the atmosphere it was found that there were differences in average concentrations of pm10 between the days of rainfall and the days of snowfall the highest pm10 values occur on the days with snow and or sleet i e in the cold period high values of correlation between pm10 and so2 are also observed on the days of occurrence of particular types of precipitation rain r 0 73 for n 336 snow r 0 73 for n 140 and sleet r 0 72 for n 18 this confirms that a significant proportion of the concentration of pm10 is associated with low emissions and the combustion of fossil fuels often containing sulphides mainly pyrite and or marcasite 6 3 principal component analysis the results of the bartlett s test of sphericity p values are 1 0 10 5 for sets r and s indicate that the application of pca to study the relationships between parameters in these sets is fully justified table s5 the sets of parameters that can be analysed with pca were determined using kmo coefficients table s6 these sets include ph ca mg na k hco3 so4 cl sio2 al ba fe mn sr zn cu pb sb po4 rb temp visib wdsp snow only and prcp rain only as well as pm10 pca was carried out for the thus selected parameters of the 793 cases used 378 cases r and 157 cases s respectively were processed during the pca the optimal number of factors was determined as three for set r and three for set s in the sets r and s the following factors were distinguished r1 r2 and r3 and s1 s2 and s3 table 5 the criterion for grouping parameters in factors was exceeding the value of 0 6 by the factor coordinates of these parameters the grouping of particular parameters in the factors identified is to a large extent the result of processes common to these parameters shaping their occurrence in the environment parameters with lower factor coordinates i e 0 5 0 6 show similar dependencies but their relationship with the factor identified is weaker or occurs only episodically more clearly the separate factors only explain the variance of the parameters under analysis to a certain extent for example the r1 factor explains 28 8 of the variance while the s1 factor explains 36 2 of the variance in the data sets analysed fig 3 this means that the remaining variance is related to sources and or processes other than those described below 6 3 1 r1 and s1 factors within the r1 and s1 factors several processes overlap which are common to both rain and snow affecting the chemical composition of these types of precipitation the key process is the chemical weathering of mineral particles floating in the atmosphere and dusts of anthropogenic origin according to wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2015 the particulate matter in the air of krakow is mainly composed of quartz aluminosilicates as well as carbonates and sulphates occasionally pure chlorides according to the authors cited above fe oxides metallic iron and other metal rich particles are common and carbonaceous particles soot are particularly abundant in the cold period as a result of the chemical weathering of these particles and dusts atmospheric precipitation is enriched with major ca mg and hco3 and minor ba sr mn and rb constituents other important processes are the reactions of inorganic anhydrides with water molecules and the formation of aerosols of mineral acids with the input of accompanying photochemical processes these processes enrich the atmospheric precipitation in so4 and partly also in hco3 aerosols of marine origin which provide a significant load of cl and na and the use of road salt for de icing traffic routes in the cold period are also a significant factor in the shaping of the chemical composition of precipitation road salt may contain small amounts of carnallite kcl mgcl2 6h2o which is a mineral with a relatively high rb content it is also worth noting that the effect of the volume of precipitation prcp on the chemical composition of rainwater is hardly noticeable however this may in part be the result of the distance between the rainfall sampling points and the rainfall volume measurement points see more section 2 pm10 is important for the r1 factor as it reflects the concentration of particles being an important source of the chemical constituents occurring in precipitation sio2 is more important in the s1 factor which probably indicates the effect associated with another form of sio2 and or si occurrence which in cold periods may be more closely related to the emission of ashes and furnace slag than to particles of quartz and aluminosilicates in statistical terms a clear proportional relationship between pm10 and the main chemical constituents exists only for rain the effect of pm10 on the concentration of these constituents in snowfall periods is practically unnoticeable despite higher concentrations of pm10 and generally lower ph in these periods which may increase the effectiveness of chemical weathering these observations indirectly indicate a different chemical composition of pm10 in the cold period this is confirmed by the results of other authors wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2015 who report that in krakow the aerosol suspended dust composition shows significant seasonal variation 6 3 2 r2 and s2 factors the r2 factor shows a directly proportional relationship between ph and hco3 which indicates the influence of the effectiveness of chemical weathering of mineral particles on hco3 concentrations and the ph of rainwater in the case of snow factor s2 i e in cold periods the relationship is much weaker this is due to the occurrence of snow cover and or frozen soil during these periods in such conditions it is much more difficult to deflate mineral particles containing numerous carbonates and aluminosilicates from the soil the bedrock of krakow and its surroundings is largely composed of limestones and marls so carbonate particles are common in soils and found in significant concentrations this is confirmed by the fact that the proportional relationship between ph and hco3 in relation to temperature is not very strong however noticeable and it does not occur in the case of snow the most likely explanation is that the more pronounced temperature effect is more pronounced only episodically in anomalous air temperatures in this case a greater influence of temperature on the solubility of mineral substances can also be observed in a similar way there may be a tendency to increase al and fe concentrations as the ph of precipitation decreases in the case of the s2 factor an inversely proportional relationship occurs between ph and most of the precipitation constituents fe zn cu pb as well as secondary al indicating an increase in concentrations of these elements with decreasing ph of precipitation the ph values of the cold precipitation are the lowest which allows more effective chemical weathering of the particles suspended in air and increases the concentrations of these elements the highest value of factor coordinates for fe may be the result of chemical weathering of particles that are the products of the combustion of fossil fuels with high pyrite and or marcasite content these particles are rich in iron compounds and are more abundant in the atmosphere in the cold compared to the warm period in both the r2 and s2 factors the factor values of pm10 are not high which indicates the lack of a significant influence of pm10 on the variability of parameters grouped in these factors in krakow spatial variability of the average metal content in pm10 zn ca and k mn and fe is observed depending on the distance from the arcelormittal steelworks samek 2012 which in the context of variable wind direction and strength may further complicate the pattern of the observed dependencies the ph value of both factors is not significantly dependent on so4 the correlation between so4 concentration and so2 content in the atmosphere is also very low r 0 12 p 0 006 n 530 this information supplements previous observations on the relationship between ph and other precipitation constituents and collectively indicates the buffering of the ph of precipitation this buffering is a result of numerous precipitation alkalising substances mainly carbonates and aluminosilicates in the atmosphere a similar situation has already been observed in krakow in 1970 80s apart from the high concentration of particulate matter very high concentrations of so2 in the atmospheric air were recorded at the same time there were significant emissions of rainfall alkalising constituents from numerous industrial and power plants cement plant in pleszew solvay sodium plant arcelormittal steelworks formerly the lenin steelworks chp plant in łęg etc therefore typical acid rains with ph 5 1 appeared sporadically in krakow in the 1970s and 1980s for example between 1987 and 1989 the ph of precipitation ranged from 4 81 to 7 42 while precipitation had high ec values of 100 or more μs m 1 turzański 1995 the ph of precipitation is also affected by other factors that were not analysed in our paper these are mainly nitrogen compounds nox and nh3 the concentrations of no3 or nh4 in precipitation are similar to the concentrations of the main chemical constituents table 1 in krakow between 2009 and 2013 increased concentrations of nitrogen compounds were observed in the cold period especially nh4 usually 0 5 0 8 mg dm 3 depending on the measurement point particularly in regions with intensive low level emissions from heating systems żurek et al 2013 nox and nh3 have a different effect on ph as they can acidify or alkalise precipitation respectively therefore it is difficult to estimate the effect of nitrogen compounds on the ph of different types of precipitation 6 3 3 r3 and s3 factors the r3 factor indicates a direct proportional correlation between cu and pb and reflects the common source of these metals and or the process shaping their occurrence in rainwater that is difficult to identify temperature may also have some influence on the variability of cu and pb concentrations table 5 however this effect is most probably episodic in anomalous air temperatures the s3 factor show the clear influence of an increased pm10 concentration on the reduction of transparency of the atmosphere and the influence of increased wind speed on the reduction of pm10 concentration this reflects the well known physical phenomenon of removing atmospheric pollution by wind however the pm10 concentration in the atmosphere is not only related to wind speed and the s3 factor explains only a small percentage 8 8 of the overall variability of these parameters it is also important that all these parameters can be characterised by high variability on an hourly scale their values used for pca were averaged over 24 h 6 4 time variability the variability of the concentrations of selected chemical constituents so4 hco3 cl ca na zn cu pb and ph in rain samples occurring in the years 1996 1998 and 2002 2017 is showed in figs 5 and 6 the results of trend analysis using the non parametric kendall s tau coefficient τ are presented in table 6 all statistically significant values of τ are negative which reflects the occurrence of decreasing trends with a probability of 95 values of τ are not high which indicates that there are noticeable but in some cases very weak trends the strongest trend is for ca which may indicate a general decrease in the content of mineral particles mainly carbonates and aluminosilicates and or anthropogenic dusts in the atmosphere of krakow these observations are confirmed by a similar although slightly weaker correlation for pm10 indicating a trend of decreasing air dustiness on days of precipitation episodes the analysis of long term variability of pm10 concentration regardless of precipitation episodes also indicates a decrease in the pm10 concentration in krakow similar observations apply to zn and pb as well as so2 in the case of pb the downward trend in concentrations of this element may indicate a connection with the total withdrawal of leaded petrol which had added lead tetraethyl c2h5 4pb from sale in poland from 2005 onwards the decrease in so2 concentrations observed independently of the occurrence of precipitation events is also indicated by other authors wilczyńska michalik and michalik 2017 a certain regularity of distribution in time is visible for all the parameters analysed in order to examine this regularity a factorial anova analysis was performed parameters with normal distributions and homogeneous variance were selected for the study these include so4 cl ca and na the first set of independent variables are time criteria cold and warm periods the second set of independent variables are two temperature ranges corresponding to the average daily temperature on the day of precipitation 10 c and 10 c respectively in general the time and temperature ranges adopted reflect periods during which the use of fossil fuels for heating purposes may decrease or increase significantly the results of the analysis of variance indicate that despite statistically significant results table s7 only a negligible part of the variation in concentrations of chemical constituents under analysis is related to the variability of the weather season and or temperature in the ranges examined for all the chemical constituents analysed the parameter ω2 changes in the range of 0 6 1 4 selecting other independent variables for example other temperature limits 0 c 5 c etc leads to similar results there were no interactions found between the independent variables 7 conclusions the research completed permitted a better understanding of the processes shaping the chemical composition of different types of precipitation in one of the most polluted cities in europe it was found that the concentrations of chemical constituents differed depending on the type of precipitation this conclusion applies mainly to rain and snow and is observed primarily for na and cl but is only to a small extent associated with the total variability in concentrations of these chemical constituents for the remaining chemical constituents analysed i e al fe and so4 the variation of concentrations depending on the type of precipitation is even less significant or negligible the observed variation can be largely attributed to anthropogenic factors such as the use of road salt or brine for de icing the traffic routes the main processes affecting the chemical composition of rain and snow are the chemical weathering of suspended dust and the formation of mineral acid aerosols these processes shape the chemistry of both rain and snow in a similar manner however one can observe a different effect of pm10 on the chemical composition of these types of precipitation indirectly this indicates differences in the chemical composition of particulate matter in the atmosphere between the warm period and the cold period when solid fuels are used for heating on a large scale the different relationship between ph and the chemical constituents of rain and snow is also derived from the differences in the chemical composition of pm10 it was found that the effectiveness of chemical weathering of particles and dusts suspended in the air which may buffer the ph of precipitation has a significant influence on the ph of rain and snow in other words high concentrations of dusts in the air of krakow may paradoxically to some extent prevent a decrease in the ph of atmospheric precipitation especially in the cold period however it should be noted that this interpretation does not take into account the effect of gaseous nitrogen compounds on the ph of precipitation which undoubtedly occurs therefore the description of the factors shaping the variation in the ph of precipitation although we consider it to be reliable cannot be treated as complete the interpretation presented above concerns only a part about one third or less of the analysed data set this interpretation is characterized by high credibility and refers to processes whose occurrence was determined with a probability of 95 confidence level of statistical methods used it is also possible that the same or very similar interpretation is also true for the rest of the analysed data set however with a lower probability that is difficult to determine in addition it cannot be excluded that the remaining part of the variability of the parameters under analysis may be theoretically related to sources and or processes different from those presented in our paper this state of affairs is a result of many factors one of them is the need to significantly simplify the description of different meteorological conditions very large errors typical for the physical chemical analyses of precipitation are also an important factor it is likely that even a significant increase in the number of cases analysed and or an extension of the study period will not lead to significantly better results in the studies of the chemical composition of precipitation the temporal variability of the study parameters is largely oscillatory seasonal however general directions of variability of these parameters over time can be noticed in the years 1996 2017 we observed a slight but noticeable and basically constant decrease in the concentrations of most of the chemical constituents of precipitation as well as in the concentrations of pm10 and so2 in the air to a large extent this indicates a connection with the closure of industrial plants in or near krakow and a reduction in emissions of exhaust fumes and industrial dust a gradual change in the method of heating mainly using natural gas or fuel oil and or the use of better quality coal which is the result of the economic and social development of the city may also be important a very weak but noticeable trend towards a decrease in the ph of rainwater can generally be attributed to a decrease in the amount of particulate matter buffering the ph of rainwater most probably this effect may still be observable for some time although given the reduced emission of so2 from industrial sources and the anti smog activities carried out in krakow a total ban on solid fuels for heating mainly coal and wood from 2019 typical acid rains with a ph significantly lower than currently observed should not be expected since other factors gaseous nitrogen compounds affect the ph of precipitation a comprehensive description of these relationships seems to pose an important task for the immediate future particularly in view of the significant development of road traffic and the increase in the number of cars which are significant new sources of gaseous nitrogen compounds credit authorship contribution statement

5836,wetland hydrology differs by landscapes and thus a modeling structure that best characterize wetland hydrological processes may vary however structural uncertainty of wetland modeling has been assessed in few landscapes limited understanding of structural uncertainty remains for a landscape dominated by groundwater this study used soil and water assessment tool swat to assess structural uncertainty in catchment scale wetland hydrology on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed where landscape hydrology is greatly affected by groundwater this study investigated the differences in streamflow prediction and quantification of wetland loss impacts on streamflow among three wetland modeling structures two lumped structures ss and rs and one semi spatial structure rg were examined in this study bayesian model averaging bma was used to generate the ensemble of three model structures to reduce parameter uncertainty on model outputs streamflow parameters were constrained by using the same streamflow parameter set that was mutually acceptable for the three wetland modeling structures results showed that the three model structures exhibited different streamflow predictions and hydrologic changes by wetland loss the rg structure provided the best streamflow simulation results due to its accurate prediction on low flow conditions relative to the two other structures ss and rs the bma results also indicated less accurate model prediction of streamflow compared to the rg hydrologic changes resulting from wetland loss were best captured by the rg structure that mimicked wetland water storage functions such as peak flow changes and annual streamflow variation in contrast the results from the two other structures and bma did not accurately reflect those functions in responses to wetlands loss the rg structure showed superior simulation of wetland hydrology due to its semi spatial model structure in contrast poor bma results were attributed to poor predictions from lumped model structures ss and rs these results suggest that a spatial model structure is critical to simulate wetland hydrologic processes in a landscape with a high dependency on groundwater processes and wetland modeling development should be toward an explicit spatial characterization of wetlands keywords wetland hydrology structural uncertainty bayesian model averaging spatial model structure lumped model structure 1 introduction watershed managers are challenged to determine suitable actions for specific locations and management goals to obtain environmental endpoints pullin and knight 2003 allocation of suitable conservation practices to a specific location is an effective way to achieve conservation goals while taking into consideration the trade offs between cost and efficiency pionke et al 2000 wilson et al 2007 lee et al 2018a hydrologic models have been widely applied in decision making processes as an efficient tool for implementing conservation practices because of models capability to predict their effectiveness under different simulation conditions munoz carpena et al 2006 credible simulation results should be confirmed prior to prediction of conservation practice impacts and thus model calibration and validation are performed using observations at the initial stage reckhow 2003 however predictive uncertainty always exists because hydrologic models cannot fully account for actual physical processes arnold et al 2012 following klein et al 2016 this study defined predictive uncertainty as the probability of occurrence of an observed value conditional on all knowledge and information in the context of hydrologic modeling four predictive uncertainty sources are well known beven 2006 renard et al 2010 hublart et al 2015 højberg and refsgaard 2005 input uncertainty e g measurement or sampling errors in rainfall or streamflow collection structural uncertainty i e oversimplified

when multiple sources of uncertainty influence a model s credibility soil and water assessment tool swat is a hydrologic model commonly used for assessing the effectiveness of conservation practices gassman et al 2014 numerous studies have investigated predictive uncertainty embedded in swat input data model parameter structure and output uncertainties are generally explored shirmohammadi et al 2006 swat model requires geospatial e g digital elevation model dem soil and land use and climate data for model simulation depending on the spatial resolutions of dem cotter et al 2003 chaubey et al 2005 dixon and earls 2009 beeson et al 2014 and climate data sexton et al 2010 strauch et al 2012 model outputs differed similar to other process based models swat model consists of numerous equations and parameters accounting for physical processes neitsch et al 2011 limited observations force model users to determine most model parameter values through model calibration procedures shirmohammadi et al 2006 the parameter values gained from the calibration procedure include predictive uncertainty because discrepancies between calibrated and actual values are present arabi et al 2007 shen et al 2008 sexton et al 2011 multiple parameter sets tend to exhibit acceptable model outputs i e equifinality beven 2006 hydrologic models include multiple structures defined by mathematical equations depicting physical processes however those structures are one source of uncertainty source due to incomplete capture of actual processes shirmohammadi et al 2006 renard et al 2010 model improvement has been undertaken to reduce structural uncertainty qi et al 2016 2017 2019 swat provides multiple structures accounting for physical processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration et channel routing process and other hydrological processes neitsch et al 2011 an approach using multiple structures has been recommended to assess structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015a in addition an ensemble of multiple simulations from different structures using bayesian model averaging bma has been found to be an effective and most commonly used method to evaluate structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015b wagena et al 2019 lastly model outputs vary depending on the selection of model input data parameters and structures multiple data parameter sets and model structures were used to assess output uncertainty beeson et al 2014 ficklin and barnhart 2014 zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015a with heightened recognition of the importance of ecosystem services provided by wetlands cohen et al 2016 numerous studies employed swat to assess the cumulative impacts of wetlands on water quantity and quality wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 2016 records et al 2014 lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a along with advances in wetland modeling studies using swat model wetland modules embedded in or compatible with swat have been developed to simulate wetland hydrologic processes liu et al 2008 feng et al 2013 evenson et al 2015 2016 2018b rahman et al 2016 qi et al 2019 for example the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 allowed bi directional interactions between riparian wetlands rws and nearby streams studies by evenson et al 2015 2016 2018b modified swat for enhancing representation of the impacts of geographically isolated wetlands giws on landscape hydrology so called geographically isolated wetland module gimw these improvements provide an opportunity to evaluate wetland modeling structural uncertainty within swat muhammad et al 2019 compared multiple swat structures with different wetland modeling approaches on the prairie pothole region ppr and found that modified swat that well reflects spatially explicit wetland hydrological processes depicted well the aggregated impacts of giws on large and peak flows wetland hydrological processes are different for different landscapes and thus a suitable wetland modeling structure may vary for instance in the ppr the wetland budget is greatly influenced by et and the groundwater contribution is minimal due to low hydraulic conductivity van der kamp and hayashi 2009 in contrast wetlands on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw have strong interactions with groundwater exerting substantial impacts on downstream baseflow lee et al 2019b yeo et al 2019a b a spatial model structure was shown to have less structural uncertainty for wetland modeling on the ppr relative to simplified structures because of a more physically realistic representation of wetland hydrology muhammad et al 2019 however such studies have not been conducted for the coastal plain of the cbw even though wetlands are an important hydrologic component in this region the questions which model structure best work for this region and how does the best model structure differs with landscape remain therefore it is necessary to test model structural uncertainty in varying landscapes to fully grasp the implications of wetland model structure on model outcomes the objective of this study is to assess structural uncertainty of swat model in simulating catchment scale wetland hydrology in a watershed where wetland hydrology is modulated by groundwater section 2 1 this study focused on structural uncertainty caused by a selection of wetland processes in swat we prepared three wetland modeling structures by addition of wetland modules to swat section 2 3 specifically the following objectives are set in this study 1 explore the differences in swat performance on predicting streamflow with three wetland modeling structures and 2 compare wetland loss impacts on streamflow depending on wetland model structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study

counties md according to theköppen climate classification scheme kottek et al 2006 the study site is classified as having a subtropical highland climate with an annual average precipitation of 1200 mm precipitation is seasonally uniform while et is high during dry seasons and low during wet seasons ator et al 2005 half of all precipitation is lost to et and the remaining precipitation infiltrates to groundwater stores ator et al 2005 the choptank river watershed is an important wetland research site due to its abundant depressional wetlands mccarty et al 2008 lee et al 2019a wetland benefits have been explored in this region peak flow mitigation lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a b pollutant removal angier et al 2002 denver et al 2014 natural habitats yepsen et al 2014 mitchell 2016 and water storage capacitance jones et al 2018 this region is known to have substantial dependence of groundwater flows on water and soluble matter transport due to soil and hydrogeologic characteristics lowrance et al 1997 ator et al 2005 thus wetlands actively interact with groundwater and a wetland water level is dependent on groundwater conditions denver et al 2014 lee et al 2019b according to the us fish and wildlife services usfws national wetlands inventory nwi geospatial dataset wetlands accounts for 15 5 of the tcw fig 1e and table 1 riparian wetlands rws and geographically isolated wetlands giws classified based on riparian wetland module rwm classification scheme see section 2 3 occupy 1 360 and 2 080 ha respectively the tcw is primarily covered by croplands followed by forest pasture water bodies and urban land uses fig 1d and table 1 well and poorly drained soils are evenly distributed on the tcw fig 1b and table 1 2 2 description of the swat model swat is a semi distributed continuous time step hydrologic model developed to evaluate the impacts of human activities on water and nutrient cycling within a watershed neitsch et al 2011 this model has been widely applied to support decision making by u s federal agencies e g usda and us environmental protection agency usepa due to its ability to predict the long term effectiveness of conservation practices to reduce pollutant loads at the watershed scale van liew et al 2007 usepa 2010 the spatial unit for model simulation is determined by the source geospatial data dem land use and soil map a watershed is divided into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus hydrologic variables are simulated at the individual hru level and then outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed level neitsch et al 2011 swat input data used for this study are shown in table 2 daily precipitation and temperature records were acquired from three local stations chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 operated by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa s national climate data center ncdc we used swat s built in weather generator to generate daily solar radiation mj m2 relative humidity and wind speed m s due to the unavailability of these observations neitsch et al 2011 monthly streamflow data m3 s were acquired from the us geological survey usgs gauge 01491500 dem data collected by maryland department of natural resources md dnr were processed by the usda ars beltsville for use in swat input soil data were downloaded from the soil survey geographical database ssurgo detailed soil information obtained from the ssurgo is provided in table s1 land use data were prepared using multiple geospatial data and details about these land use data are available in lee et al 2016 2 3 three wetland modeling structures 2 3 1 ss structure swat model only the ss structure used only the default swat wetland module to simulate wetland processes fig 2 the default swat wetland module assumes that all wetlands within a sub watershed are aggregated and located at the sub watershed outlet i e a single lumped wetland structure is assumed the water balance of the one aggregated wetland increases via precipitation and inflow from contributing areas inflow is computed as an areal fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within a sub watershed a decrease in the water balance is represented as outflow et and seepage outflow occurs when the total water storage volume exceeds the wetland volume at normal and maximum water level outflow is directly routed into the stream and the reverse water transport i e flow from streams to wetlands is not simulated the water balance equation is calculated by using eq 1 refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details 1 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the volume of water stored in the wetland at the end of the day mm h2o vstored is the volume of water stored in the wetland at the beginning of the day vflowin is the volume of water entering the wetland during the day vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling on the wetland during the day vevap is the volume of water removed from the wetland by et during the day and vseep v s e e p is the volume of water lost from the wetland by seepage during the day vflowin is calculated based on the fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within the sub watershed this fraction is set by the parameter indicating the areal proportion of the wetland contributing area to the sub watershed 2 3 2 rs structure rwm and swat the rs structure used both the default swat wetland module and the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 and adapted by lee et al 2019c rwm classifies wetland polygons into two groups based on their spatial location input wetland polygons that directly intersect with the stream map are regarded as rw and others as giw rwm allows rws to have bi directional water exchange with the stream segment at the sub watershed scale the rs structure distinguished rws from giws and two wetland types are simulated at the sub watershed scale however individual wetlands within a sub watershed are aggregated into either one rw or giw and lumped values for one rw and giw should be set i e a lumped structure is assumed the rs structure used the default swat wetland module to simulate hydrologic processes for the giws in the ss structure rws and giws were not classified and all wetlands were simulated using only the default swat wetland module as an external module rwm adopted swat outputs as input data to simulate the water balance and hydrologic impacts of rws fig 2 the water balance equation for rwm is similar to the default swat wetland module with additional consideration given to surface and sub surface water exchanges between the rw and the stream eq 2 surface water exchange takes place if the water levels of the rw and the stream are different when the water level is between the bottom and bankfull depths for the wetland and the river reach subsurface water exchange continues to take place the water exchange is ended when the water levels of two water bodies reach an equilibrium further details are available in liu et al 2008 2 v r v r s t o r e d v r f l o w i n v r p c p v r e v a p v r s e e p v r r c h f l o w all the components in eq 2 are identical to eq 1 except that eq 2 excludes vr flowout and includes vr rchflow indicating the volume of surface and sub surface water exchange between the riparian wetland and the reach the subscript r denotes simulation of a riparian wetland vr flowin is calculated based on the fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the riparian wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within the sub watershed this fraction is set by the parameter indicating the areal proportion of the riparian wetland contributing area to the sub watershed 2 3 3 rg structure rwm and giwm the rg structure simulated the hydrologic processes of rws and giws using rwm and geographically isolated wetland module giwm respectively lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a giwm developed by evenson et al 2015 is a modification of the default swat pothole module to represent giws and their contributing areas with spatial information giwm defines giws and their contributing areas as individual hrus and directs outflow from giw contributing areas i e contributing hrus to giws i e giw hrus unique parameters for individual giws were set for this structure but lumped parameters were assigned for rws as rws are combined at the sub basin scale semi spatial structure in addition giwm represents both surface runoff and sub surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow as inflow from contributing areas to wetlands while only surface runoff is regarded as inflow in the default swat pothole rev 488 these improvements lead to enhanced representation of spatial locations and hydrologic processes of giws across a landscape the water balance of a giw is computed using inflow outflow precipitation et and seepage eq 3 unlike rwm giwm is an internal module and therefore giw processes are first considered and then the rwm is executed fig 2 in other words swat outputs that reflect giw processes are used as input data for rwm to simulate rw processes for a giw outflow is simulated when the water storage volume of a giw exceeds its maximum storage volume refer to evenson et al 2015 and lee et al 2018b for further details 3 v g v g s t o r e d v g f l o w i n v g f l o w o u t v g p c p v g e v a p v g s e e p all the components in eq 3 are identical to eq 1 vg flowin is further described in eq s1 the subscript g denotes simulation of giw 2 4 parameters for wetland modules wetland parameters were set prior to model calibration and validation table 3 the values used in lee et al 2019c 2018b were directly adopted for the rs and rg structures two geospatial datasets were used for wetland parameterization 1 nwi geospatial dataset was employed to set up the maximum volume and area for the ss rs and rg structures and 2 an inundation map developed from remotely sensed data was used for the normal volume and area of a wetland for the three modeling structures huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 refer to lee et al 2018b 2019c for further details about wetland parameter preparation the three parameters i e normal volume normal area and maximum areas were not required for giwm table 3 following the study by lee et al 2018b 2019c we used the modified version of the volume calculation method suggested by lane and d amico 2010 this method computes the water volume below the elevation plane set as the median value of wetland perimeter elevation determined using the arcgis 3d analyst tool the evaporation coefficient and hydraulic conductivity mm hr were set at model default values 2 5 model calibration and validation model simulations were calibrated and validated against observed streamflow collected at the outlet of the tcw at a monthly time step over 16 years 2 year warm up 1999 2000 9 year calibration 2001 2009 and 5 year validation 2010 2014 three wetland modeling structures with the same streamflow parameter sets were calibrated in this study 11 streamflow parameters were chosen based on previous swat modeling studies table 4 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2018b 2019c yeo et al 2019b the latin hypercube sampling lhs approach was used to generate 3000 parameter sets fig 2 the lhs method partitions a sampling range of individual parameters into several non overlapping ranges only one parameter value is forced to be randomly selected from each range for individual parameter set ficklin and barnhart 2014 by preparing parameter sets using the lhs method an acceptable parameter set can be efficiently determined objective functions for each parameter set for the three wetland modeling structures were evaluated three objective functions proposed by moriasi et al 2007 were used in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias the equations for these statistics are shown below eqs 4 6 in this study the behavior parameter set bps is defined as one that meets the satisfactory model performance measure defined in moriasi et al 2007 nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and p bias 25 only two behavior parameter sets referred to as bps1 and bps2 hereafter were identified through the calibration process

observed mean value and n equals the number of observations 2 6 bayesian model averaging bma in this study structural uncertainty among different modules within the same model was evaluated to evaluate non default wetland modules and the corresponding model performance the statistical scheme of bma implemented in this study involves integration of predictive distributions among models or modules the probability density function of posterior distribution in bma can be shown as hoeting et al 1999 7 p δ y n 1 n p m n y p δ m n y where δ is the quantity of prediction n is the total number of samples y is observation data mn n 1 n are the model predictions p δ mn y is the posterior distribution of δ given mn and y p mn y is the predicted posterior distribution and also likelihood of mn given prediction quantities from y the sum of the likelihood function is one 8 n 1 n p m n y n 1 n w n 1 where w n is the posterior probability function of prediction in this case posterior probabilities are the weighting factor for each model or module the posterior mean e and variance v of δ are as follow 9 e δ y n 1 n p m n y e p δ m n y n 1 n w n m n 10 v δ y n 1 n w n m n i 1 n w i m n 2 n 1 n w n σ n 2 an additional transformation is required since the basic assumption for p δ m n y is a gaussian distribution however it is impossible to find streamflow sediment or nutrient loads in this format a log likelihood function is then derived as follows 11 l l w 1 w n σ 2 l o g n 1 n w n p δ m n y bma weights can be calculated using optimization methods in this case the expectation maximization em algorithm was used to derive final weights duan et al 2007 details of bma can also be found in the literature raftery et al 2005 wöhling and vrugt 2008 2 7 structural uncertainty of wetland loss benefits to assess the hydrologic role of wetlands in regulating water quantity this study compared simulated streamflow according to the presence or absence of wetlands using three wetland modeling structures and two behavior parameter sets i e bps1 and bps2 all wetlands including rws and giws were removed in the wetland loss scenario eight simulation scenarios with and without wetlands were tested to investigate structural uncertainty on wetland benefits indicated by changes in streamflow depending on the absence and presence of wetlands table 5 annual streamflow and peak flow reduction rate were analyzed the peak flow reduction rate was computed as 6 p e a k f l o w r d u c t i o n r a t e sim without sim with sim without 100 where sim without and sim with are simulations without and with wetlands 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural uncertainty on streamflow prediction calibration and validation results for the three wetland modeling structures with two behavior parameter sets are shown in fig 3 and table 6 the differences between observations and simulations are represented as a density plot in fig 3 overall the rg structure demonstrated higher prediction accuracy with greater nse lower rsr and smaller absolute p bias relative to ss and rs structures during the calibration period table 6 in contrast the ss structure outperformed the rs and rg structures during the validation period a notable difference between calibration and validation periods was p bias fig 3 positive and negative p bias values indicate under and over estimated simulations relative to observations moriasi et al 2007 compared to observations simulations from the ss and rs structures were substantially underestimated during the calibration period but those were moderately overestimated during the validation period the rg structure showed moderate underestimation and substantial overestimation of streamflow for the calibration and validation periods respectively fig 3 and table 6 the three wetland modeling structures exhibited similar results during high flow conditions but differed substantially during low flow conditions fig 4 during the calibration period observed low flow conditions were well captured by the rg structure while the ss and rs structures were substantially underestimated fig 4a and c the opposite results were found during the validation period fig 4b and d if the hydraulic conductivity of the wetland bottom is high wetlands have higher infiltration capacity and lower water loss potential by et relative to wetlands with low hydraulic conductivity lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a b in the rg structure geographically isolated wetlands giw s with high hydraulic conductivity promoted water infiltration into the subsurface layer and reduced water loss by et leading to increased contribution of groundwater to streamflow compared to the ss and rs structures with low hydraulic conductivity of giws the ss and rs results showed 6 11 mm greater annual et and 85 87 mm lower annual groundwater flow relative to the rg results tables s2 and s3 in the supplement the climatic conditions for calibration average precipitation 1190 249 mm see fig s1 in the supplement and validation average precipitation 1333 153 mm fig s1 in the supplement were dry and wet respectively accordingly dry climatic conditions over the calibration period promoted et driven water loss in ss and rs results causing a larger gap between simulations and observation during low flow conditions fig 4a and c during the dry calibration period the rg results showed moderate water loss by et due to high infiltration and thus simulated streamflow agreed well with observations although extremely low flow i e lower than flow percentiles at a 95 threshold was not well represented by the rg structure in contrast wet climatic conditions over the validation period resulted in overestimation of rg driven streamflow due to substantial groundwater contribution to streamflow high water loss potential of the two structures i e ss and rs led to moderate differences between observations and simulations during the validation period the bma results indicated good or very good performances measures for the two bps during calibration and validation periods table 6 p bias values of bma results were moderately underestimated and overestimated during calibration and validation periods respectively overall the bma results were closer to the rg structure relative to the ss and rs structures figs 3 and 4 because of the high weight given to the rg structure table 7 shows bma weights of individual wetland modeling structures as indicated by the high weight 0 6 the rg structure had more influence on the bma model than the ss and rs structures this higher weight is assigned because the reference is more similar to observations than those less similar to observations using the bma posterior processor yen et al 2015b overall the rg structure outperformed the two other structures as well as the bma model on predicting streamflow during the entire simulation period table 6 careful simulation of the major wetland type i e giw likely led to the most reliable results in particular a representation of wetland hydrological processes with some spatial information was an important contributing factor poor simulations from the ss and rs structures caused lower accuracy of bma results than the rg structure differences among wetland modeling structures were evident during low flow conditions the semi spatial model structure i e rg provided a good depiction of wetland impacts on streamflow relative to lumped structures i e ss and rs these findings were consistent with a previous study that a discretized structure model exhibited improved model capacity to simulate wetland hydrology muhammad et al 2019 these results support a conclusion that a spatial model structure can better represent wetland hydrological processes on various landscapes and that future wetland modeling studies should move toward characterizing spatially heterogeneous wetland hydrology 3 2 structural uncertainty on wetland loss impact differences in annual streamflow between simulations with and without wetlands were calculated using the results from the three modeling structures ss rs and rg as well as bma to quantify structural uncertainty in simulating wetland loss impact fig 5 wetland loss impacts derived from ss rs and bma showed that wetland loss induced greater annual streamflow by 0 3 0 8 m3 s ss bps1 and ss bps2 0 2 0 5 m3 s rs bps1 and rs bps2 and 0 1 0 5 m3 s bma bps1 and bma bps2 than in the simulations with wetlands the increased rate of annual streamflow varied by high and low precipitation years wetland loss substantially increased annual streamflow ss 0 7 0 8 m3 s rs 0 3 0 5 m3 s and bma 0 2 0 5 m3 s when annual precipitation was high 2003 2009 2011 and 2013 2014 while the increased rate of annual streamflow ss 0 3 0 5 m3 s rs 0 2 0 3 m3 s and bma 0 1 0 2 m3 s was relatively small during the years with low annual precipitation fig 5 the rg results were consistent with the three results i e ss rs and bma during high precipitation years but they were different at low precipitation years wetland loss caused decreases in annual streamflow by 0 01 0 1 m3 s in low precipitation years relative to the simulations with wetlands for the case of the ss and rs results only wetland water storage function was removed with wetland loss as water infiltration that contributes to downstream streamflow was rarely taken into account in the ss and rs structures thus the increased rate of annual streamflow by wetland loss was directly proportional to precipitation however wetland loss simulation with the rg structure removed wetland contributions to streamflow via infiltration the rg simulation showed that groundwater flows decreased from 357 mm with wetlands to 270 mm without wetlands groundwater contributions are particularly important during dry conditions since the majority of streamflow during these periods that stems from groundwater thus the rs results showed that wetland loss decreased streamflow during dry years by reducing or eliminating wetland contribution to downstream streamflow to compare the peak flow reduction rate among different wetland modeling structures the ten largest streamflow events were considered when wetlands were removed fig 6 the three wetland modeling structures predicted different peak flow reduction rates the range of peak flow reduction rate was 5 31 median 27 ss bps1 22 79 median 31 rs bps1 25 67 median 36 rg bps1 and 25 55 median 32 bma bps1 for bps1 fig 6a and 4 30 median 27 ss bps2 54 87 median 60 rs bps2 49 77 median 55 rg bps2 and 25 55 median 53 bma bps2 for bps2 fig 6b the ss results included extremely low peak flow reduction rates e g 4 5 and the reduction range was smaller than other structures while the rs results exhibited the greatest peak flow reduction rate 79 87 and the widest reduction range moderate reduction rates and ranges were observed in the rg and bma results for the series of heavy rainfall events 6 24 2016 6 26 2016 in fig 7 a the ss structure predicted a low reduction rate for the following rainfall event while other structures predicted moderate reductions to the peak flow the ss structure only allows one directional flow from wetlands to streams and when wetlands reach their maximum capacity wetlands have limited storage functions in this case the first rainfall event likely led wetlands reaching full capacity with little additional water capable of being held by wetland in the ss structure the rs structure simulated bi directional flow between riparian wetlands rws and nearby streams until equilibrium conditions are reach liu et al 2008 therefore the rs results exhibited moderate reduction rates for the following rainfall event as high water level of streams caused flow from streams to rws in the rg structure the first rainfall stored in giws was quickly infiltrated due to high infiltration capacity and giws could hold the substantial amount of following rainfall indicating moderate reduction rate of two serial rainfall events the greatest peak flow reduction rate predicted by the rs structure was found when the greatest amount of rainfall occurred 8 28 2011 in fig 7b it is noteworthy that streamflow was greater one day after the rainfall event than the day of rainfall occurrence similar patterns were observed for other extreme heavy rainfall events results not shown here the rs and rg structures transported the majority of water in giws to nearby streams via surface and groundwater respectively since model structures characterized different hydraulic conductivities at the wetland bottom and thus rws and streams in the rs structure received a substantial amount of inflow from upland areas during the heavy rainfall events at the same time a substantial amount of water flew from upgradient to downgradient streams the bi directional equilibrium process drove a great amount of water to be moved from streams into rws at the heavy rainfall date and those to be moved from rws to streams at the following day leading to temporal mismatch between peak streamflow and precipitation in addition to the selection of model structure peak flow reduction rates varied with the selection of acceptable parameter sets fig 6 parameter uncertainty in wetland loss prediction should be tested as a future study to provide insight on catchment level wetland hydrologic functions wetland loss impacts differed by wetland modeling structures used overall the rg structure most accurately represented wetland loss impacts considering annual streamflow variation and peak flow responses further the rg structure also well depicted the wetland water storage function that reduces peak flow by holding water initially and then slowly release water lee et al 2018b evenson et al 2018a ameli and creed 2019 after peak flow has been reach streamflow from a wetland landscape receded more slowly relative to one without wetlands the gradual decrease in streamflow was best represented in the rg results fig 7b streamflow variations from the ss results were almost identical to simulations without wetlands except for the level of peak flow as would expected the bma results were closer to the rg results due to the highest weight being assigned to the rg structure table 7 being compliant with section 3 2 the rg structure was the most suitable way to assess wetland loss impacts on streamflow for this study region as previously mentioned the semi spatial model structure did a better job of capturing the hydrologic interactions of wetlands with surrounding upland areas and groundwater and thus the adverse impacts from wetland loss were simulated more accurately a multi model ensemble approach has been recommended to minimize model structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015b sharifi et al 2017 wagena et al 2019 however our ensemble approach i e bma provided less accurate outputs relative to the single model approach i e rg structure because of the substantially poor performance of the other structures in the ensemble i e ss and rs structures 3 3 implications and limitations this study compared the model results of the three wetland modeling processes in swat to examine structural uncertainty wetland area and volume values were carefully set using geospatial and remote sensing driven data however other parameter values e g evaporation and hydraulic conductivity were adopted from the default values following common parameterization practices this common parameterization led to a large difference in hydraulic conductivity between lumped and semi spatial structures this distinctive parameter values substantially influenced water infiltration within a wetland a lumped model structure might have simulations similar to a semi spatial one by modifying the hydraulic conductivity this might bring up the issue that parameter uncertainty is more critical than structural uncertainty in this study however the spatialized hydraulic conductivity values should be aggregated at the sub watershed scale for lumped structures this aggregation could not inadequately represent infiltration processes in a spatial structure further model algorithms and associated parameters vary depending on model structure a limited model structure leads to limited parameterization thus this difference in parameter value should be viewed as a part of model structural uncertainty if a lumped structure has to be used adjustment of a hydraulic conductivity would be recommended rather than use of default values to represent wetland hydrologic impact within a landscape with strong wetland groundwater communication the results found that the rg structure provided more reasonable outputs relative to two other structures due to better representation of groundwater contributions to streamflow however the rg structure is still inadequate to simulate surface groundwater interactions that depend on a default swat soil moisture module an existing soil moisture module in swat simply simulates soil moisture dynamics based on a tipping bucket approach which leads to inaccurate vertical soil moisture movement and thus inaccurate deep soil moisture conditions chen et al 2011 qi et al 2018 the wetland module developed by qi et al 2019 modified the soil moisture module by incorporating the richards equation into swat and also improved the representation of the groundwater discharge process using darcy s law this module approximated accurate wetland water dynamics for individual giws located within our study region qi et al 2019 in addition evenson et al 2018b also developed a wetland module that considers groundwater exchanges between a giw and its upland area for our study region this effort further improves giw water dynamics in response to groundwater inflow outflow evenson et al 2018b future studies should include these improved modules to advance our understanding of wetland hydrology in this region with strong interactions between wetlands and groundwater previous efforts to improve wetland modeling structural uncertainty also provided several lessons for future directions although wetland modules in hydrologic models were enhanced improved models often exhibited inexplicable wetland hydrology or did not show substantial improvements relative to existing models hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 fleischmann et al 2018 the major structural shortage of improved models was limited representation of wetlands soil groundwater interactions rahman et al 2016 considered riparian wetland groundwater interactions in swat but the seepage process resulting from poor soil moisture predictions led to inaccurate interactions a similar issue was reported in hughes et al 2014 that disregarding wetland groundwater processes contributed to inaccurate wetland hydrology in an improved pitman model and in fleischmann et al 2018 that an improved hydrological hydrodynamic model mgb remained imperfect due to poor soil water dynamics careful wetland parameterization and accurate representation of local land use conditions in models were highlighted as the way to improve wetland predictions hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 fleischmann et al 2018 model improvements were rarely captured by streamflow data hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 fleischmann et al 2018 additional validation data such as remotely sensed wetland surface area or in situ observations would be useful to clearly demonstrate improvements this study has important implications on watershed managers the results showed that a semi spatial model is the most suitable wetland modeling structure for the landscape with strong wetland groundwater interaction this structure was already found to be most suitable for the landscape characterized by limited groundwater impacts muhammad et al 2019 through comparative approaches those studies informed the most credible method to use modeling wetland hydrological processes in the two different landscapes the proposed findings can assist watershed managers to efficiently choose and employ an appropriate modeling tool i e a spatial model for wetland conservation and protection similar tests should be executed in various landscapes to gain broader insights into modeling structural uncertainty in wetland hydrology 4 conclusions this study compared three modeling structures to assess structural uncertainty in simulating wetland hydrology in the coastal plain of the cbw where groundwater processes and wetland hydrology are significant in particular differences in streamflow prediction and quantification of wetland loss impacts among three structures were examined bma was applied to generate an ensemble of outputs from the three wetland modeling structures used two mutually acceptable parameter sets for the three modeling structures were identified and the two parameter sets were used to minimize model differences due to parameterization the results from three model structures examined showed that simulated streamflow varied by model structures and that there were notable differences in modeled low flow conditions between different models the results also illustrated that wetland loss impacts on annual streamflow and peak flow reduction were differently represented depending on the model structure overall the semi spatial model structure i e rg structure outperformed lumped model structures i e ss and rs structures on streamflow predictions and depiction of changes in hydrological processes as a function of wetland loss the bma results assigned a higher weight to the semi spatial structure than the other model structures considered indicating that simulations from the semi spatial structure were the most similar to observations in particular lumped model structures were not sufficient to depict wetland hydrologic benefits mainly due to misrepresentation of hydrological processes e g wetland groundwater interactions the semi spatial model structure effectively characterized local wetland hydrological processes and enabled wetlands to exert impacts on streamflow via groundwater in contrast lumped model structures simulated water within wetlands to be lost primarily via et limiting groundwater contribution to streamflow specifically wetland contribution to low flow conditions were poorly estimated by the lumped model structures the bma results did not show improved model predictions relative to the single model structure due to poor predictions from the lumped model structures these results lead to the conclusion that a spatial model is a reliable tool for predicting wetland hydrology and associated hydrologic processes e g wetland loss or gain to demonstrate catchment scale wetland impacts on local hydrology model development and application has been previously discussed to suggest suitable wetland decision making tools and provide recommendations for wetland algorithm enhancement golden et al 2017 jones et al 2019 by assessing model structural uncertainty this study shows that a physically realistic model structure provides better insights on hydrologic benefits conferred by wetlands studies such as this

5836,wetland hydrology differs by landscapes and thus a modeling structure that best characterize wetland hydrological processes may vary however structural uncertainty of wetland modeling has been assessed in few landscapes limited understanding of structural uncertainty remains for a landscape dominated by groundwater this study used soil and water assessment tool swat to assess structural uncertainty in catchment scale wetland hydrology on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed where landscape hydrology is greatly affected by groundwater this study investigated the differences in streamflow prediction and quantification of wetland loss impacts on streamflow among three wetland modeling structures two lumped structures ss and rs and one semi spatial structure rg were examined in this study bayesian model averaging bma was used to generate the ensemble of three model structures to reduce parameter uncertainty on model outputs streamflow parameters were constrained by using the same streamflow parameter set that was mutually acceptable for the three wetland modeling structures results showed that the three model structures exhibited different streamflow predictions and hydrologic changes by wetland loss the rg structure provided the best streamflow simulation results due to its accurate prediction on low flow conditions relative to the two other structures ss and rs the bma results also indicated less accurate model prediction of streamflow compared to the rg hydrologic changes resulting from wetland loss were best captured by the rg structure that mimicked wetland water storage functions such as peak flow changes and annual streamflow variation in contrast the results from the two other structures and bma did not accurately reflect those functions in responses to wetlands loss the rg structure showed superior simulation of wetland hydrology due to its semi spatial model structure in contrast poor bma results were attributed to poor predictions from lumped model structures ss and rs these results suggest that a spatial model structure is critical to simulate wetland hydrologic processes in a landscape with a high dependency on groundwater processes and wetland modeling development should be toward an explicit spatial characterization of wetlands keywords wetland hydrology structural uncertainty bayesian model averaging spatial model structure lumped model structure 1 introduction watershed managers are challenged to determine suitable actions for specific locations and management goals to obtain environmental endpoints pullin and knight 2003 allocation of suitable conservation practices to a specific location is an effective way to achieve conservation goals while taking into consideration the trade offs between cost and efficiency pionke et al 2000 wilson et al 2007 lee et al 2018a hydrologic models have been widely applied in decision making processes as an efficient tool for implementing conservation practices because of models capability to predict their effectiveness under different simulation conditions munoz carpena et al 2006 credible simulation results should be confirmed prior to prediction of conservation practice impacts and thus model calibration and validation are performed using observations at the initial stage reckhow 2003 however predictive uncertainty always exists because hydrologic models cannot fully account for actual physical processes arnold et al 2012 following klein et al 2016 this study defined predictive uncertainty as the probability of occurrence of an observed value conditional on all knowledge and information in the context of hydrologic modeling four predictive uncertainty sources are well known beven 2006 renard

gassman et al 2014 numerous studies have investigated predictive uncertainty embedded in swat input data model parameter structure and output uncertainties are generally explored shirmohammadi et al 2006 swat model requires geospatial e g digital elevation model dem soil and land use and climate data for model simulation depending on the spatial resolutions of dem cotter et al 2003 chaubey et al 2005 dixon and earls 2009 beeson et al 2014 and climate data sexton et al 2010 strauch et al 2012 model outputs differed similar to other process based models swat model consists of numerous equations and parameters accounting for physical processes neitsch et al 2011 limited observations force model users to determine most model parameter values through model calibration procedures shirmohammadi et al 2006 the parameter values gained from the calibration procedure include predictive uncertainty because discrepancies between calibrated and actual values are present arabi et al 2007 shen et al 2008 sexton et al 2011 multiple parameter sets tend to exhibit acceptable model outputs i e equifinality beven 2006 hydrologic models include multiple structures defined by mathematical equations depicting physical processes however those structures are one source of uncertainty source due to incomplete capture of actual processes shirmohammadi et al 2006 renard et al 2010 model improvement has been undertaken to reduce structural uncertainty qi et al 2016 2017 2019 swat provides multiple structures accounting for physical processes such as surface runoff evapotranspiration et channel routing process and other hydrological processes neitsch et al 2011 an approach using multiple structures has been recommended to assess structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015a in addition an ensemble of multiple simulations from different structures using bayesian model averaging bma has been found to be an effective and most commonly used method to evaluate structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015b wagena et al 2019 lastly model outputs vary depending on the selection of model input data parameters and structures multiple data parameter sets and model structures were used to assess output uncertainty beeson et al 2014 ficklin and barnhart 2014 zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015a with heightened recognition of the importance of ecosystem services provided by wetlands cohen et al 2016 numerous studies employed swat to assess the cumulative impacts of wetlands on water quantity and quality wang et al 2010 yang et al 2010 2016 records et al 2014 lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a along with advances in wetland modeling studies using swat model wetland modules embedded in or compatible with swat have been developed to simulate wetland hydrologic processes liu et al 2008 feng et al 2013 evenson et al 2015 2016 2018b rahman et al 2016 qi et al 2019 for example the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 allowed bi directional interactions between riparian wetlands rws and nearby streams studies by evenson et al 2015 2016 2018b modified swat for enhancing representation of the impacts of geographically isolated wetlands giws on landscape hydrology so called geographically isolated wetland module gimw these improvements provide an opportunity to evaluate wetland modeling structural uncertainty within swat muhammad et al 2019 compared multiple swat structures with different wetland modeling approaches on the prairie pothole region ppr and found that modified swat that well reflects spatially explicit wetland hydrological processes depicted well the aggregated impacts of giws on large and peak flows wetland hydrological processes are different for different landscapes and thus a suitable wetland modeling structure may vary for instance in the ppr the wetland budget is greatly influenced by et and the groundwater contribution is minimal due to low hydraulic conductivity van der kamp and hayashi 2009 in contrast wetlands on the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw have strong interactions with groundwater exerting substantial impacts on downstream baseflow lee et al 2019b yeo et al 2019a b a spatial model structure was shown to have less structural uncertainty for wetland modeling on the ppr relative to simplified structures because of a more physically realistic representation of wetland hydrology muhammad et al 2019 however such studies have not been conducted for the coastal plain of the cbw even though wetlands are an important hydrologic component in this region the questions which model structure best work for this region and how does the best model structure differs with landscape remain therefore it is necessary to test model structural uncertainty in varying landscapes to fully grasp the implications of wetland model structure on model outcomes the objective of this study is to assess structural uncertainty of swat model in simulating catchment scale wetland hydrology in a watershed where wetland hydrology is modulated by groundwater section 2 1 this study focused on structural uncertainty caused by a selection of wetland processes in swat we prepared three wetland modeling structures by addition of wetland modules to swat section 2 3 specifically the following objectives are set in this study 1 explore the differences in swat performance on predicting streamflow with three wetland modeling structures and 2 compare wetland loss impacts on streamflow depending on wetland model structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was undertaken on the tuckahoe creek watershed tcw a sub basin of the choptank river watershed within the coastal plain of the chesapeake bay watershed fig 1 a the tcw spans caroline and queen anne s counties md according to theköppen climate classification scheme kottek et al 2006 the study site is classified as having a subtropical highland climate with an annual average precipitation of 1200 mm precipitation is seasonally uniform while et is high during dry seasons and low during wet seasons ator et al 2005 half of all precipitation is lost to et and the remaining precipitation infiltrates to groundwater stores ator et al 2005 the choptank river watershed is an important wetland research site due to its abundant depressional wetlands mccarty et al 2008 lee et al 2019a wetland benefits have been explored in this region peak flow mitigation lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a b pollutant removal angier et al 2002 denver et al 2014 natural habitats yepsen et al 2014 mitchell 2016 and water storage capacitance jones et al 2018 this region is known to have substantial dependence of groundwater flows on water and soluble matter transport due to soil and hydrogeologic characteristics lowrance et al 1997 ator et al 2005 thus wetlands actively interact with groundwater and a wetland water level is dependent on groundwater conditions denver et al 2014 lee et al 2019b according to the us fish and wildlife services usfws national wetlands inventory nwi geospatial dataset wetlands accounts for 15 5 of the tcw fig 1e and table 1 riparian wetlands rws and geographically isolated wetlands giws classified based on riparian wetland module rwm classification scheme see section 2 3 occupy 1 360 and 2 080 ha respectively the tcw is primarily covered by croplands followed by forest pasture water bodies and urban land uses fig 1d and table 1 well and poorly drained soils are evenly distributed on the tcw fig 1b and table 1 2 2 description of the swat model swat is a semi distributed continuous time step hydrologic model developed to evaluate the impacts of human activities on water and nutrient cycling within a watershed neitsch et al 2011 this model has been widely applied to support decision making by u s federal agencies e g usda and us environmental protection agency usepa due to its ability to predict the long term effectiveness of conservation practices to reduce pollutant loads at the watershed scale van liew et al 2007 usepa 2010 the spatial unit for model simulation is determined by the source geospatial data dem land use and soil map a watershed is divided into sub watersheds and further into hydrologic response units hrus hydrologic variables are simulated at the individual hru level and then outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed level neitsch et al 2011 swat input data used for this study are shown in table 2 daily precipitation and temperature records were acquired from three local stations chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 operated by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa s national climate data center ncdc we used swat s built in weather generator to generate daily solar radiation mj m2 relative humidity and wind speed m s due to the unavailability of these observations neitsch et al 2011 monthly streamflow data m3 s were acquired from the us geological survey usgs gauge 01491500 dem data collected by maryland department of natural resources md dnr were processed by the usda ars beltsville for use in swat input soil data were downloaded from the soil survey geographical database ssurgo detailed soil information obtained from the ssurgo is provided in table s1 land use data were prepared using multiple geospatial data and details about these land use data are available in lee et al 2016 2 3 three wetland modeling structures 2 3 1 ss structure swat model only the ss structure used only the default swat wetland module to simulate wetland processes fig 2 the default swat wetland module assumes that all wetlands within a sub watershed are aggregated and located at the sub watershed outlet i e a single lumped wetland structure is assumed the water balance of the one aggregated wetland increases via precipitation and inflow from contributing areas inflow is computed as an areal fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within a sub watershed a decrease in the water balance is represented as outflow et and seepage outflow occurs when the total water storage volume exceeds the wetland volume at normal and maximum water level outflow is directly routed into the stream and the reverse water transport i e flow from streams to wetlands is not simulated the water balance equation is calculated by using eq 1 refer to neitsch et al 2011 for further details 1 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the volume of water stored in the wetland at the end of the day mm h2o vstored is the volume of water stored in the wetland at the beginning of the day vflowin is the volume of water entering the wetland during the day vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the wetland during the day vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling on the wetland during the day vevap is the volume of water removed from the wetland by et during the day and vseep v s e e p is the volume of water lost from the wetland by seepage during the day vflowin is calculated based on the fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within the sub watershed this fraction is set by the parameter indicating the areal proportion of the wetland contributing area to the sub watershed 2 3 2 rs structure rwm and swat the rs structure used both the default swat wetland module and the riparian wetland module rwm developed by liu et al 2008 and adapted by lee et al 2019c rwm classifies wetland polygons into two groups based on their spatial location input wetland polygons that directly intersect with the stream map are regarded as rw and others as giw rwm allows rws to have bi directional water exchange with the stream segment at the sub watershed scale the rs structure distinguished rws from giws and two wetland types are simulated at the sub watershed scale however individual wetlands within a sub watershed are aggregated into either one rw or giw and lumped values for one rw and giw should be set i e a lumped structure is assumed the rs structure used the default swat wetland module to simulate hydrologic processes for the giws in the ss structure rws and giws were not classified and all wetlands were simulated using only the default swat wetland module as an external module rwm adopted swat outputs as input data to simulate the water balance and hydrologic impacts of rws fig 2 the water balance equation for rwm is similar to the default swat wetland module with additional consideration given to surface and sub surface water exchanges between the rw and the stream eq 2 surface water exchange takes place if the water levels of the rw and the stream are different when the water level is between the bottom and bankfull depths for the wetland and the river reach subsurface water exchange continues to take place the water exchange is ended when the water levels of two water bodies reach an equilibrium further details are available in liu et al 2008 2 v r v r s t o r e d v r f l o w i n v r p c p v r e v a p v r s e e p v r r c h f l o w all the components in eq 2 are identical to eq 1 except that eq 2 excludes vr flowout and includes vr rchflow indicating the volume of surface and sub surface water exchange between the riparian wetland and the reach the subscript r denotes simulation of a riparian wetland vr flowin is calculated based on the fraction of the total water fluxes transported to the riparian wetland by surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow within the sub watershed this fraction is set by the parameter indicating the areal proportion of the riparian wetland contributing area to the sub watershed 2 3 3 rg structure rwm and giwm the rg structure simulated the hydrologic processes of rws and giws using rwm and geographically isolated wetland module giwm respectively lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a giwm developed by evenson et al 2015 is a modification of the default swat pothole module to represent giws and their contributing areas with spatial information giwm defines giws and their contributing areas as individual hrus and directs outflow from giw contributing areas i e contributing hrus to giws i e giw hrus unique parameters for individual giws were set for this structure but lumped parameters were assigned for rws as rws are combined at the sub basin scale semi spatial structure in addition giwm represents both surface runoff and sub surface flow lateral flow and groundwater flow as inflow from contributing areas to wetlands while only surface runoff is regarded as inflow in the default swat pothole rev 488 these improvements lead to enhanced representation of spatial locations and hydrologic processes of giws across a landscape the water balance of a giw is computed using inflow outflow precipitation et and seepage eq 3 unlike rwm giwm is an internal module and therefore giw processes are first considered and then the rwm is executed fig 2 in other words swat outputs that reflect giw processes are used as input data for rwm to simulate rw processes for a giw outflow is simulated when the water storage volume of a giw exceeds its maximum storage volume refer to evenson et al 2015 and lee et al 2018b for further details 3 v g v g s t o r e d v g f l o w i n v g f l o w o u t v g p c p v g e v a p v g s e e p all the components in eq 3 are identical to eq 1 vg flowin is further described in eq s1 the subscript g denotes simulation of giw 2 4 parameters for wetland modules wetland parameters were set prior to model calibration and validation table 3 the values used in lee et al 2019c 2018b were directly adopted for the rs and rg structures two geospatial datasets were used for wetland parameterization 1 nwi geospatial dataset was employed to set up the maximum volume and area for the ss rs and rg structures and 2 an inundation map developed from remotely sensed data was used for the normal volume and area of a wetland for the three modeling structures huang et al 2014 jin et al 2017 refer to lee et al 2018b 2019c for further details about wetland parameter preparation the three parameters i e normal volume normal area and maximum areas were not required for giwm table 3 following the study by lee et al 2018b 2019c we used the modified version of the volume calculation method suggested by lane and d amico 2010 this method computes the water volume below the elevation plane set as the median value of wetland perimeter elevation determined using the arcgis 3d analyst tool the evaporation coefficient and hydraulic conductivity mm hr were set at model default values 2 5 model calibration and validation model simulations were calibrated and validated against observed streamflow collected at the outlet of the tcw at a monthly time step over 16 years 2 year warm up 1999 2000 9 year calibration 2001 2009 and 5 year validation 2010 2014 three wetland modeling structures with the same streamflow parameter sets were calibrated in this study 11 streamflow parameters were chosen based on previous swat modeling studies table 4 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2018b 2019c yeo et al 2019b the latin hypercube sampling lhs approach was used to generate 3000 parameter sets fig 2 the lhs method partitions a sampling range of individual parameters into several non overlapping ranges only one parameter value is forced to be randomly selected from each range for individual parameter set ficklin and barnhart 2014 by preparing parameter sets using the lhs method an acceptable parameter set can be efficiently determined objective functions for each parameter set for the three wetland modeling structures were evaluated three objective functions proposed by moriasi et al 2007 were used in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias p bias the equations for these statistics are shown below eqs 4 6 in this study the behavior parameter set bps is defined as one that meets the satisfactory model performance measure defined in moriasi et al 2007 nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 and p bias 25 only two behavior parameter sets referred to as bps1 and bps2 hereafter were identified through the calibration process

observed mean value and n equals the number of observations 2 6 bayesian model averaging bma in this study structural uncertainty among different modules within the same model was evaluated to evaluate non default wetland modules and the corresponding model performance the statistical scheme of bma implemented in this study involves integration of predictive distributions among models or modules the probability density function of posterior distribution in bma can be shown as hoeting et al 1999 7 p δ y n 1 n p m n y p δ m n y where δ is the quantity of prediction n is the total number of samples y is observation data mn n 1 n are the model predictions p δ mn y is the posterior distribution of δ given mn and y p mn y is the predicted posterior distribution and also likelihood of mn given prediction quantities from y the sum of the likelihood function is one 8 n 1 n p m n y n 1 n w n 1 where w n is the posterior probability function of prediction in this case posterior probabilities are the weighting factor for each model or module the posterior mean e and variance v of δ are as follow 9 e δ y n 1 n p m n y e p δ m n y n 1 n w n m n 10 v δ y n 1 n w n m n i 1 n w i m n 2 n 1 n w n σ n 2 an additional transformation is required since the basic assumption for p δ m n y is a gaussian distribution however it is impossible to find streamflow sediment or nutrient loads in this format a log likelihood function is then derived as follows 11 l l w 1 w n σ 2 l o g n 1 n w n p δ m n y bma weights can be calculated using optimization methods in this case the expectation maximization em algorithm was used to derive final weights duan et al 2007 details of bma can also be found in the literature raftery et al 2005 wöhling and vrugt 2008 2 7 structural uncertainty of wetland loss benefits to assess the hydrologic role of wetlands in regulating water quantity this study compared simulated streamflow according to the presence or absence of wetlands using three wetland modeling structures and two behavior parameter sets i e bps1 and bps2 all wetlands including rws and giws were removed in the wetland loss scenario eight simulation scenarios with and without wetlands were tested to investigate structural uncertainty on wetland benefits indicated by changes in streamflow depending on the absence and presence of wetlands table 5 annual streamflow and peak flow reduction rate were analyzed the peak flow reduction rate was computed as 6 p e a k f l o w r d u c t i o n r a t e sim without sim with sim without 100 where sim without and sim with are simulations without and with wetlands 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural uncertainty on streamflow prediction calibration and validation results for the three wetland modeling structures with two behavior parameter sets are shown in fig 3 and table 6 the differences between observations and simulations are represented as a density plot in fig 3 overall the rg structure demonstrated higher prediction accuracy with greater nse lower rsr and smaller absolute p bias relative to ss and rs structures during the calibration period table 6 in contrast the ss structure outperformed the rs and rg structures during the validation period a notable difference between calibration and validation periods was p bias fig 3 positive and negative p bias values indicate under and over estimated simulations relative to observations moriasi et al 2007 compared to observations simulations from the ss and rs structures were substantially underestimated during the calibration period but those were moderately overestimated during the validation period the rg structure showed moderate underestimation and substantial overestimation of streamflow for the calibration and validation periods respectively fig 3 and table 6 the three wetland modeling structures exhibited similar results during high flow conditions but differed substantially during low flow conditions fig 4 during the calibration period observed low flow conditions were well captured by the rg structure while the ss and rs structures were substantially underestimated fig 4a and c the opposite results were found during the validation period fig 4b and d if the hydraulic conductivity of the wetland bottom is high wetlands have higher infiltration capacity and lower water loss potential by et relative to wetlands with low hydraulic conductivity lee et al 2018b yeo et al 2019a b in the rg structure geographically isolated wetlands giw s with high hydraulic conductivity promoted water infiltration into the subsurface layer and reduced water loss by et leading to increased contribution of groundwater to streamflow compared to the ss and rs structures with low hydraulic conductivity of giws the ss and rs results showed 6 11 mm greater annual et and 85 87 mm lower annual groundwater flow relative to the rg results tables s2 and s3 in the supplement the climatic conditions for calibration average precipitation 1190 249 mm see fig s1 in the supplement and validation average precipitation 1333 153 mm fig s1 in the supplement were dry and wet respectively accordingly dry climatic conditions over the calibration period promoted et driven water loss in ss and rs results causing a larger gap between simulations and observation during low flow conditions fig 4a and c during the dry calibration period the rg results showed moderate water loss by et due to high infiltration and thus simulated streamflow agreed well with observations although extremely low flow i e lower than flow percentiles at a 95 threshold was not well represented by the rg structure in contrast wet climatic conditions over the validation period resulted in overestimation of rg driven streamflow due to substantial groundwater contribution to streamflow high water loss potential of the two structures i e ss and rs led to moderate differences between observations and simulations during the validation period the bma results indicated good or very good performances measures for the two bps during calibration and validation periods table 6 p bias values of bma results were moderately underestimated and overestimated during calibration and validation periods respectively overall the bma results were closer to the rg structure relative to the ss and rs structures figs 3 and 4 because of the high weight given to the rg structure table 7 shows bma weights of individual wetland modeling structures as indicated by the high weight 0 6 the rg structure had more influence on the bma model than the ss and rs structures this higher weight is assigned because the reference is more similar to observations than those less similar to observations using the bma posterior processor yen et al 2015b overall the rg structure outperformed the two other structures as well as the bma model on predicting streamflow during the entire simulation period table 6 careful simulation of the major wetland type i e giw likely led to the most reliable results in particular a representation of wetland hydrological processes with some spatial information was an important contributing factor poor simulations from the ss and rs structures caused lower accuracy of bma results than the rg structure differences among wetland modeling structures were evident during low flow conditions the semi spatial model structure i e rg provided a good depiction of wetland impacts on streamflow relative to lumped structures i e ss and rs these findings were consistent with a previous study that a discretized structure model exhibited improved model capacity to simulate wetland hydrology muhammad et al 2019 these results support a conclusion that a spatial model structure can better represent wetland hydrological processes on various landscapes and that future wetland modeling studies should move toward characterizing spatially heterogeneous wetland hydrology 3 2 structural uncertainty on wetland loss impact differences in annual streamflow between simulations with and without wetlands were calculated using the results from the three modeling structures ss rs and rg as well as bma to quantify structural uncertainty in simulating wetland loss impact fig 5 wetland loss impacts derived from ss rs and bma showed that wetland loss induced greater annual streamflow by 0 3 0 8 m3 s ss bps1 and ss bps2 0 2 0 5 m3 s rs bps1 and rs bps2 and 0 1 0 5 m3 s bma bps1 and bma bps2 than in the simulations with wetlands the increased rate of annual streamflow varied by high and low precipitation years wetland loss substantially increased annual streamflow ss 0 7 0 8 m3 s rs 0 3 0 5 m3 s and bma 0 2 0 5 m3 s when annual precipitation was high 2003 2009 2011 and 2013 2014 while the increased rate of annual streamflow ss 0 3 0 5 m3 s rs 0 2 0 3 m3 s and bma 0 1 0 2 m3 s was relatively small during the years with low annual precipitation fig 5 the rg results were consistent with the three results i e ss rs and bma during high precipitation years but they were different at low precipitation years wetland loss caused decreases in annual streamflow by 0 01 0 1 m3 s in low precipitation years relative to the simulations with wetlands for the case of the ss and rs results only wetland water storage function was removed with wetland loss as water infiltration that contributes to downstream streamflow was rarely taken into account in the ss and rs structures thus the increased rate of annual streamflow by wetland loss was directly proportional to precipitation however wetland loss simulation with the rg structure removed wetland contributions to streamflow via infiltration the rg simulation showed that groundwater flows decreased from 357 mm with wetlands to 270 mm without wetlands groundwater contributions are particularly important during dry conditions since the majority of streamflow during these periods that stems from groundwater thus the rs results showed that wetland loss decreased streamflow during dry years by reducing or eliminating wetland contribution to downstream streamflow to compare the peak flow reduction rate among different wetland modeling structures the ten largest streamflow events were considered when wetlands were removed fig 6 the three wetland modeling structures predicted different peak flow reduction rates the range of peak flow reduction rate was 5 31 median 27 ss bps1 22 79 median 31 rs bps1 25 67 median 36 rg bps1 and 25 55 median 32 bma bps1 for bps1 fig 6a and 4 30 median 27 ss bps2 54 87 median 60 rs bps2 49 77 median 55 rg bps2 and 25 55 median 53 bma bps2 for bps2 fig 6b the ss results included extremely low peak flow reduction rates e g 4 5 and the reduction range was smaller than other structures while the rs results exhibited the greatest peak flow reduction rate 79 87 and the widest reduction range moderate reduction rates and ranges were observed in the rg and bma results for the series of heavy rainfall events 6 24 2016 6 26 2016 in fig 7 a the ss structure predicted a low reduction rate for the following rainfall event while other structures predicted moderate reductions to the peak flow the ss structure only allows one directional flow from wetlands to streams and when wetlands reach their maximum capacity wetlands have limited storage functions in this case the first rainfall event likely led wetlands reaching full capacity with little additional water capable of being held by wetland in the ss structure the rs structure simulated bi directional flow between riparian wetlands rws and nearby streams until equilibrium conditions are reach liu et al 2008 therefore the rs results exhibited moderate reduction rates for the following rainfall event as high water level of streams caused flow from streams to rws in the rg structure the first rainfall stored in giws was quickly infiltrated due to high infiltration capacity and giws could hold the substantial amount of following rainfall indicating moderate reduction rate of two serial rainfall events the greatest peak flow reduction rate predicted by the rs structure was found when the greatest amount of rainfall occurred 8 28 2011 in fig 7b it is noteworthy that streamflow was greater one day after the rainfall event than the day of rainfall occurrence similar patterns were observed for other extreme heavy rainfall events results not shown here the rs and rg structures transported the majority of water in giws to nearby streams via surface and groundwater respectively since model structures characterized different hydraulic conductivities at the wetland bottom and thus rws and streams in the rs structure received a substantial amount of inflow from upland areas during the heavy rainfall events at the same time a substantial amount of water flew from upgradient to downgradient streams the bi directional equilibrium process drove a great amount of water to be moved from streams into rws at the heavy rainfall date and those to be moved from rws to streams at the following day leading to temporal mismatch between peak streamflow and precipitation in addition to the selection of model structure peak flow reduction rates varied with the selection of acceptable parameter sets fig 6 parameter uncertainty in wetland loss prediction should be tested as a future study to provide insight on catchment level wetland hydrologic functions wetland loss impacts differed by wetland modeling structures used overall the rg structure most accurately represented wetland loss impacts considering annual streamflow variation and peak flow responses further the rg structure also well depicted the wetland water storage function that reduces peak flow by holding water initially and then slowly release water lee et al 2018b evenson et al 2018a ameli and creed 2019 after peak flow has been reach streamflow from a wetland landscape receded more slowly relative to one without wetlands the gradual decrease in streamflow was best represented in the rg results fig 7b streamflow variations from the ss results were almost identical to simulations without wetlands except for the level of peak flow as would expected the bma results were closer to the rg results due to the highest weight being assigned to the rg structure table 7 being compliant with section 3 2 the rg structure was the most suitable way to assess wetland loss impacts on streamflow for this study region as previously mentioned the semi spatial model structure did a better job of capturing the hydrologic interactions of wetlands with surrounding upland areas and groundwater and thus the adverse impacts from wetland loss were simulated more accurately a multi model ensemble approach has been recommended to minimize model structural uncertainty zhang et al 2009 yen et al 2015b sharifi et al 2017 wagena et al 2019 however our ensemble approach i e bma provided less accurate outputs relative to the single model approach i e rg structure because of the substantially poor performance of the other structures in the ensemble i e ss and rs structures 3 3 implications and limitations this study compared the model results of the three wetland modeling processes in swat to examine structural uncertainty wetland area and volume values were carefully set using geospatial and remote sensing driven data however other parameter values e g evaporation and hydraulic conductivity were adopted from the default values following common parameterization practices this common parameterization led to a large difference in hydraulic conductivity between lumped and semi spatial structures this distinctive parameter values substantially influenced water infiltration within a wetland a lumped model structure might have simulations similar to a semi spatial one by modifying the hydraulic conductivity this might bring up the issue that parameter uncertainty is more critical than structural uncertainty in this study however the spatialized hydraulic conductivity values should be aggregated at the sub watershed scale for lumped structures this aggregation could not inadequately represent infiltration processes in a spatial structure further model algorithms and associated parameters vary depending on model structure a limited model structure leads to limited parameterization thus this difference in parameter value should be viewed as a part of model structural uncertainty if a lumped structure has to be used adjustment of a hydraulic conductivity would be recommended rather than use of default values to represent wetland hydrologic impact within a landscape with strong wetland groundwater communication the results found that the rg structure provided more reasonable outputs relative to two other structures due to better representation of groundwater contributions to streamflow however the rg structure is still inadequate to simulate surface groundwater interactions that depend on a default swat soil moisture module an existing soil moisture module in swat simply simulates soil moisture dynamics based on a tipping bucket approach which leads to inaccurate vertical soil moisture movement and thus inaccurate deep soil moisture conditions chen et al 2011 qi et al 2018 the wetland module developed by qi et al 2019 modified the soil moisture module by incorporating the richards equation into swat and also improved the representation of the groundwater discharge process using darcy s law this module approximated accurate wetland water dynamics for individual giws located within our study region qi et al 2019 in addition evenson et al 2018b also developed a wetland module that considers groundwater exchanges between a giw and its upland area for our study region this effort further improves giw water dynamics in response to groundwater inflow outflow evenson et al 2018b future studies should include these improved modules to advance our understanding of wetland hydrology in this region with strong interactions between wetlands and groundwater previous efforts to improve wetland modeling structural uncertainty also provided several lessons for future directions although wetland modules in hydrologic models were enhanced improved models often exhibited inexplicable wetland hydrology or did not show substantial improvements relative to existing models hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 fleischmann et al 2018 the major structural shortage of improved models was limited representation of wetlands soil groundwater interactions rahman et al 2016 considered riparian wetland groundwater interactions in swat but the seepage process resulting from poor soil moisture predictions led to inaccurate interactions a similar issue was reported in hughes et al 2014 that disregarding wetland groundwater processes contributed to inaccurate wetland hydrology in an improved pitman model and in fleischmann et al 2018 that an improved hydrological hydrodynamic model mgb remained imperfect due to poor soil water dynamics careful wetland parameterization and accurate representation of local land use conditions in models were highlighted as the way to improve wetland predictions hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 fleischmann et al 2018 model improvements were rarely captured by streamflow data hughes et al 2014 fossey et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 fleischmann et al 2018 additional validation data such as remotely sensed wetland surface area or in situ observations would be useful to clearly demonstrate improvements this study has important implications on watershed managers the results showed that a semi spatial model is the most suitable wetland modeling structure for the landscape with strong wetland groundwater interaction this structure was already found to be most suitable for the landscape characterized by limited groundwater impacts muhammad et al 2019 through comparative approaches those studies informed the most credible method to use modeling wetland hydrological processes in the two different landscapes the proposed findings can assist watershed managers to efficiently choose and employ an appropriate modeling tool i e a spatial model for wetland conservation and protection similar tests should be executed in various landscapes to gain broader insights into modeling structural uncertainty in wetland hydrology 4 conclusions this study compared three modeling structures to assess structural uncertainty in simulating wetland hydrology in the coastal plain of the cbw where groundwater processes and wetland hydrology are significant in particular differences in streamflow prediction and quantification of wetland loss impacts among three structures were examined bma was applied to generate an ensemble of outputs from the three wetland modeling structures used two mutually acceptable parameter sets for the three modeling structures were identified and the two parameter sets were used to minimize model differences due to parameterization the results from three model structures examined showed that simulated streamflow varied by model structures and that there were notable differences in modeled low flow conditions between different models the results also illustrated that wetland loss impacts on annual streamflow and peak flow reduction were differently represented depending on the model structure overall the semi spatial model structure i e rg structure outperformed lumped model structures i e ss and rs structures on streamflow predictions and depiction of changes in hydrological processes as a function of wetland loss the bma results assigned a higher weight to the semi spatial structure than the other model structures considered indicating that simulations from the semi spatial structure were the most similar to observations in particular lumped model structures were not sufficient to depict wetland hydrologic benefits mainly due to misrepresentation of hydrological processes e g wetland groundwater interactions the semi spatial model structure effectively characterized local wetland hydrological processes and enabled wetlands to exert impacts on streamflow via groundwater in contrast lumped model structures simulated water within wetlands to be lost primarily via et limiting groundwater contribution to streamflow specifically wetland contribution to low flow conditions were poorly estimated by the lumped model structures the bma results did not show improved model predictions relative to the single model structure due to poor predictions from the lumped model structures these results lead to the conclusion that a spatial model is a reliable tool for predicting wetland hydrology and associated hydrologic processes e g wetland loss or gain to demonstrate catchment scale wetland impacts on local hydrology model development and application has been previously discussed to suggest suitable wetland decision making tools and provide recommendations for wetland algorithm enhancement golden et al 2017 jones et al 2019 by assessing model structural uncertainty this study shows that a physically realistic model structure provides better insights on hydrologic benefits conferred by wetlands studies such as this

5837,we propose a visualisation framework for data exploration analysis and presentation of complex hydrological studies in large catchments this furthers a deeper understanding of the interrelations between the included datasets allows for discussions among researchers from different disciplines and is the basis for illustrating complex phenomena to stakeholders or the interested public based on the 162 000 km2 catchment of poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china we developed a virtual geographic environment that combines a wide range of 2d and 3d observation data sets with simulation results from both an opengeosys groundwater model and a coast2d hydrodynamic model visualising water and solute dynamics within and across hydrologic reservoirs the system aims for a realistic presentation of the investigation area and implements approaches of scientific visualisation to illustrate interesting aspects of multi variate data in intuitive ways it employs easy to learn interaction techniques for navigation animation and access to linked data sets from external sources such as time series data or websites to function as an environmental information system for any region of interest keywords environmental information system virtual reality opengeosys water resources management poyang lake 1 motivation for complex environmental studies there is a considerable number of data sets required for setting up models and providing sufficient context for reliable predictions and recommendations however usually not all datasets can be visualised in a unified context researchers need to view a certain subset in geographic information systems gis view time series data from observation sites online or using a dedicated plotting software and one or more modelling frameworks to view their modelling data and simulation results any cross connections between these subsets have to be made mentally or manually such a workflow is not only prone to result in mistakes it also complicates presenting results to stakeholders or the public in an intuitive way in addition considering the complex hydrological cycle and its numerous parameters and subprocesses as one typical area of application state of the art monitoring and modelling activities as well as sophisticated visualisation and data integration systems are required together to facilitate system understanding and water resources management particularly on the scale of entire catchments which is appropriate for integrated management of water resources jaspers 2003 the large amount of available output datasets from models and remote sensing products are challenging for the development of efficient and informative visualization approaches we propose integrating all datasets relevant for the analysis of a given region of interest into one unified framework that serves as an environmental information system eis for data exploration interdisciplinary research and knowledge transfer we presented a first prototype for such a framework in rink et al 2018 for the work presented here we use this eis for a hydrological multi compartment study of the poyang lake basin in china its large size of about 162 000 km2 and the complex hydrological processes within the highly dynamic lake river wetland system influenced by numerous drivers in the catchment are making it an ideal study site for developing an integrated environmental information system for large basins considering that about 94 of jiangxi province is located within poyang lake basin an improved holistic representation of the overall hydrological system and its interconnected compartments is beneficial for both the pursuit of sustainable water resources management and for the economic construction and development at the provincial level the current management system of poyang lake is based on the jiangxi poyang lake wetland protection ordinance issued by the provincial people s congress the resulting system consists of a large number of authorities working independently from each other which weakens the power of both management and law enforcement fan and hu 2018 as a response to this situation china is fully establishing a river chief mechanism which assigns each part of a surface waterbody to an appointed official in order to improve the comprehensive management and public supervision of each basin consequently integrating the relevant mechanisms and dynamics in the poyang lake basin into a single visualisation framework has advantages with respect to evaluating future hydraulic constructions forecasting future water quality delineating protection zones and mitigating environmental issues there have been previous initiatives to integrate data from different sources into a holistic visualisation platform for poyang lake basin zhao et al 2018 set up a prototype system for analysing ecosystem simulation results obtained with the high accuracy surface modelling method hasm yue 2011 yue et al 2015 the platform allows for the spatial temporal analysis of raster files in the thematic areas climate change forest carbon storage and population distribution gu et al 2017 proposed a watershed ecological virtual simulation and decision support platform that combines gis data with a 2d watlac hydrological model into a virtual geographical environment to be presented on large displays chen et al 2015 integrated gis database management systems results from a numerical soil model and a 3d visualisation framework into a virtual hydrologic environment vhe for meijiang subcatchment zhu 2011 developed a 2d gis environment to display hydrological data from webgis services and a postgis database with the aim to validate the results of a two dimensional hydrodynamic water and pollutant transport model for poyang lake similar approaches of using 2d gis based visualization schemes for wetland data visualisation at poyang lake have been utilized by zhong 2008 xiang and zhou 2009 and zhao 2012 with the latter adding spatial relationship operations and their graphic representations into the developed framework focussing on flood inundation chen et al 2012 set up a 3d gis system for the poyang wetlands embedding 3d structures and hydrodynamic simulation results as well as geographic objects from a object relational database yan et al 2018 developed a basic 3d environmental information system for poyang lake basin a large number of data sets based on observation and simulation have been included in this case study examples include temperature precipitation or ecosystem quality as well as water dynamics however from an implementation point of view the technical contribution is limited as all data sets are imported as raster files and texture mapped onto a 3d model of a digital elevation model for the region the environmental information system eis proposed here aims at creating suitable representations for all included data sets such that the nature or certain aspects of the data are intuitively recognisable by users examples include the integration of precipitation data as point clouds or the simulated changes to the groundwater head as an actual triangulated plane within the 3d finite element model this has the added advantage of being able to potentially display more data or simply remove colour as an indicator for a parameter in favour of alternative means of visualisation in addition we have extended the functionality of our eis considerably and chose this case study to demonstrate both its portability to arbitrary regions of interest as well as the scalability for large volumes of data after a short introduction to virtual geographic environments in section 2 section 3 gives an overview of the poyang lake basin including the multiple compartments included in this study it presents details about specific data sets modelling and simulation approaches as well as necessary modifications during pre and postprocessing section 4 gives an overview of the environmental information system for the catchment it shows workflows lists extensions to the previously presented prototype and gives examples for data integration and visualisation based on specific data sets 2 virtual geographic environments the holistic representation of all available data sets for a given region of interest is currently beyond the capabilities of established geographical information systems gis such as arcgis or qgis cox et al 2013 tian et al 2016 such frameworks have been originally designed for displaying vector and raster data sets though approaches for displaying data in 3d exist the software is usually lacking both interfaces and methods for advanced visualisation of complex three or four dimensional data examples include the representation of climate or subsurface models the colour coded display of vector data to represent locally varying parameters or measurements or the handling of time variant data in general on the other hand all purpose visualisation software such as paraview ahrens et al 2005 or visit childs et al 2012 includes state of the art visualisation techniques but lacks interfaces to domain specific software such as gis or modelling frameworks to close this gap we have developed the opengeosys dataexplorer rink et al 2013 rink et al 2014 in recent years this software serves as a graphical user interface to the open source modelling software opengeosys kolditz et al 2012 and implements interfaces to various gis data formats a wide range of free and commercial modelling frameworks for instance feflow diersch 2014 petrel schlumberger 2018 swmm rossman 2014 openfoam weller and tabor 1998 as well as all purpose formats such as netcdf rew and davis 1990 and vtk schroeder et al 2006 the data explorer allows for the 3d visualisation of data via the open source library vtk visualization toolkit the data explorer has been designed for the preprocessing and evaluation for numerical thm c models its functionality is insufficient for complex collaborative research projects where the handling of large numbers of data sets can become confusing for unexperienced users and the implemented visualisation algorithms can be insufficient for collections of complex possibly multi variate or multi modal data sets therefore we recently started developing virtual geographic environments vge specifically for the purpose of integrating large collections of heterogenous data sets for the visualisation of complex environmental processes and interrelation of parameters of interest to researchers from a wide range of domains within the environmental sciences based on the definition by ellis 1994 the term virtual environment refers to an immersive interactive experience inside a synthetic space in recent years the term has been adapted for computer mediated communication in various domains with virtual learning environments probably being the most often cited application in the media virtual geographic environments have been first proposed as an extension of gis into 3d and vr batty 2008 yin 2010 later the concept has been extended to include data from numerical models and simulation results as well as web based data and collaborative approaches for data interaction lu 2011 lin et al 2013 kolditz et al 2019 however our definition of a virtual geographic environment slightly differs from the previously proposed framework lin et al 2013 and lin et al 2013 subdivide a vge into four components data environment modelling and simulation environment interactive environment and collaborative environment in contrast a diagram of our framework is depicted in fig 1 the data life cycle starts with data added to some kind of data storage e g a database or file storage this data is preprocessed to remove artifacts calculate derived parameter sets or project it into another coordinate system that modified version of the data is either stored or forwarded into the vge depending on the complexity of the selected algorithms and the use of the processed data for other users or subsequent stages of the workflow not integrating the data processing component within the vge is debatable as it includes pre and postprocessing algorithms for general data modification e g for the removal of artefacts specific algorithms for the modelling and simulation e g for the assessment of mesh element quality for the finite element method specific algorithms for a subsequent visualisation e g data reduction methods for high dimensional multivariate data as well as algorithms required for both modelling and visualisation e g the projection of data into a unified coordinate system both data storage and preprocessing are what is called data environment in lin et al 2013 if modelling or simulation data is part of the vge the preprocessed data serves as input for a suitable simulation software and results are written back to the data storage this simulation software might be opengeosys but as mentioned before interfaces for files from a multitude of other software products have been implemented as well while this modelling simulation component corresponds to the modelling environment it is explicitly not part of the vge but simulation results are instead accessed via an interface just like any other dataset the vge is agnostic to the origin of any dataset as long as there is an interface to read the data it does not matter if it is research or observation data from scientific partners state departments companies or data openly available on the net moreover the data storage preprocessing and modelling components would work just as well without a vge accessing the data afterwards instead our interpretation of a vge consists only of a visualisation and a presentation component roughly corresponding to what lin et al 2013 call interactive environment and collaborative environment the visualisation component is used to create tesselated 3d objects out of environmental data sets in the form of suitable metaphors or expressions such as glyphs streamlines or surfaces the presentation component includes everything required for the user experience in virtual reality starting from the choice of shaders for 3d object and the lighting of the scene but also animations predefined viewpoints picking objects to access additional information or switching objects or parameter sets live during a presentation it is worth pointing out that the workflow described above is not definitive as the immersive user experience is impaired if frame rates drop below 20 30 frames per second it is common for complex and computationally expensive forms of visualisation to store pre rendered representations of datasets on a file server or database to guarantee fast rendering at all times thus creating a direct connection of the vge to the data storage also the vge might access the simulation component directly if in situ visualisation bauer et al 2016 is part of the study however this requires that the simulation software includes interfaces specifically designed for in situ visualisation we have previously implemented the above concept for a vge for the catchment of chao lake in the anhui province of china rink et al 2018 using the opengeosys data explorer for preprocessing data sets and employing unity unity technologies 2018 a cross plattform game engine for implementation since both pre processing algorithms as well as the necessary extensions of unity have been deliberately designed to be re usable for future case studies we were able to apply and extend the existing framework to build an application for the catchment of poyang lake presented here 3 case study poyang lake basin 3 1 catchment characteristics poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china by maximum annual extension is located in the southeastern part of china fig 2 a annual precipitation rates in the poyang lake basin show a distinct wet and a dry season with a short transition period in between although precipitation rates are highest in june fig 2b tropical cyclones regularly cause thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the basin in late summer the distribution of rainfall in its catchment controls runoff generation in the five large river systems ganjiang xinjiang xiushui raohe and fuhe river entering poyang lake with an basin averaged runoff coefficient of about 0 6 huang et al 2008 in addition ungauged river systems may contribute between 12 li et al 2019 and 15 6 du et al 2018 of total water inflow to the lake poyang lake drains into the yangtze river at a rate of about 150 bn m3 per year which takes about 15 5 of the rivers total runoff zhao et al 2011 see fig 3 seasonal water level variations of the lake also depend on the discharge characteristics of yangtze river and can reach more than 10 m at hukou and xingzi station between dry and wet season at maximum extension the water surface of the lake expands up to 3 800 km2 filled by a water volume of 32 bn m3 in addition the fairly late yearly high water levels in yangtze river fig 2b periodically cause a water blockage at the outflow of poyang lake which contributes to high water levels in the lake system ye et al 1960 yao et al 2018 in contrast the lake shrinks to little more than a river during the dry winter months the corresponding change in inundation area hui et al 2008 forms a unique system of water areas wetlands and mudflats for more details on the hydrology of the system the interested reader is referred to the relevant publications e g li et al 2014 and guo et al 2008 according to the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 poyang lake has an overall water quality that is better than most other large chinese lakes such as tai lake or chao lake fig 9 however water quality is continuously deteriorating as the lake and the wetland system face several pollution pressures such as an continuous inflow of nutrients and fertiliser residuals from its extensively cultivated shorelines duan et al 2016 soldatova et al 2018 as well as acidity and heavy metals from mining areas he et al 1998 and industrial sites xu and wang 2016 additionally the hydrological system is increasingly disturbed by hydraulic construction measures the opening of the three gorges dam tgd is considered one reason for generally decreasing water levels in poyang lake during the last decade li et al 2017 furthermore prevalent sand mining activities increase water turbidity restrict phytoplankton growth and have contributed to an annual water level decrease of 1 2 2 m at the outflow of poyang lake during dry season lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 apart from its large size the ecosystem of poyang lake is of international importance due its wide range of wetland habitats that support rich biodiversity huang et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 for instance many migratory birds coming from siberia mongolia japan korea northeast and northwest china rely on these diverse habitats for overwintering giving the ecological importance of poyang lake an supranational component yang et al 2016 3 2 preprocessing of input datasets as motivated in section 2 we are able to integrate a large variety of data formats into the virtual geographic environment by using the opengeosys data explorer as a preprocessing tool and exporting the data representations subsequently into unity for the hydrological study presented in this paper we focussed on integrating data available on the internet possible sources included both websites providing monitoring data and publications providing data sets bibliographic studies showed that a total of about 9 600 chinese and 1 300 english articles touching the topic poyang lake were published in scientific journals between 1983 and 2017 zhou 2018 this includes a considerable number of publications in the field of hydrology and earth sciences however many of the published datasets lack precise information on time and location of data acquisition or have an insufficient resolution both are necessary requirements for a meaningful representation within an environmental information system in addition accessibility of official environmental datasets provided by local or provincial authorities in the poyang lake basin is limited therefore open data from remote sensing sources as well as data produced by physically based models of parts of the hydrological system was used to fill data gaps in the visualisation of spatio temporal dynamics in the poyang lake basin consequently a mix of data sets from open databases articles remote sensing information and official data have been integrated into the eis an overview of integrated data sets is given in table 1 3 2 1 surface mapping the catchment boundary of poyang lake basin was obtained by applying a gis catchment analysis on the digital elevation model dem dataset provided by the hydrosheds project lehner et al 2008 this dataset is based on data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which has been processed for hydrological purposes hydrosheds dem defines the elevation of the lake s water level as constant we modified the derived dem for poyang lake basin for pixels actually covered by water from the lake and replaced those values with available bathymetry data comparing the elevation in the non flooded wetland areas provided by both the hydrosheds and the bathymetry dataset the average difference of elevation values was not more than 2 m i e less than the vertical height accuracy of the srtm sensors https www2 jpl nasa gov srtm statistics html due to the large size of the poyang lake basin and the requirement for a detailed reconstruction of comparatively small areas within the catchment such as subcatchments of tributaries or the lake region itself the resulting surface mesh is very large when considering typically used data in unity the complete surface of the catchment consists of 1 8 10 6 nodes and 3 75 10 6 triangles with an average edge length of 500 m this surface mesh has then been partitioned into smaller meshes to allow for performance optimisation such as view frustum culling technical details on suitable visualisation techniques for large geoscientific data in unity have been presented by rink et al 2017 in addition to the regular surface representation a number of refined meshes have been created for certain areas of interest most data acquisition simulation and visualisation efforts focus on the poyang core region which is defined as the area of a dozen counties around poyang lake with a total area of about 19 833 km 2 tang et al 2016 poyang lake is located in this core region as well as nanchang the largest city in the catchment with a population of about 3 million subsequently the core region is in the focus of this case study the surface mesh for the core region consists of roughly 10 6 triangles 0 5 10 5 nodes with an average edge length of 250 m a second much smaller region of interest is the dexing copper and gold mining area located about 100 km east of poyang lake which is represented by a surface representation using just 20 000 triangles textures for these meshes have been acquired from google earth in varying resolutions for the dexing mining area we made use of google s historical view functionality to create a texture series and show the expansion of the mines from 2009 to 2018 3 2 2 meteorological and hydrological datasets for the visualisation of precipitation two heavy rainfall events were selected from the precipitation datasets of the gpm satellite mission hou et al 2014 the first event covers the heavy rainfall caused by typhoon soudelor in southern china between 06 and 11 august 2015 a total of 287 global datasets in hdf5 format represent the time interval at a 30 min temporal resolution these datasets were automatically downloaded clipped to the investigation area and converted into ascii grids in the epsg 16050 coordinate reference system using python a similar processing scheme was applied for 527 precipitation grids in the time interval between the 20 and 30 june 2017 which represent the heavy rainfall causing the 2017 china floods in june 2017 in addition the location of all river gauging stations reservoir gauging stations and weather stations maintained by the jiangxi water resources department as well as the related hydrographs were included in the eis the stream network of five main tributaries of poyang lake was obtained from openstreetmaps osm and classified into three orders each all observation sites and river geometries have been mapped onto the triangulated three dimensional surface generated from the dem using a linear interpolation algorithm proposed in rink et al 2014 in addition the results of a two dimensional hydrodynamic lake model du et al 2018 were integrated into the eis to visualise inundation changes as well as water and matter transport in poyang lake see fig 5 the provided dataset consist of 186 rasters representing the temporal dynamics in the lake between september 2009 to february 2011 with a temporal resolution of 2 1 days we implemented a reader to convert the coast2d simulation output into the vtk unstructured grid format specifically each time step would be written to a separate file with each parameter represented by an array within that file as a result we ended up 186 mesh files each consisting of 47 000 quad elements and containing information on flow direction flow velocity and four chemical concentrations for each cell given that representation it is straightforward to display a temporal sequence for any of the included parameters and use vtk for subsequently applying visualisation algorithms to the data set to represent the groundwater flow system the distribution of hydraulic heads groundwater velocities and stream path trajectories in the poyang lake basin has been visualised in the eis based on the results of the groundwater model developed by nixdorf 2018 see fig 6 the groundwater regime was simulated in two dimensional planar direction for low and high water levels in poyang lake using the open source thmc fem code opengeosys kolditz et al 2012 which has been applied for groundwater flow simulations on the regional scale under various scientific objectives in previous studies e g walther et al 2014 wu et al 2011 nixdorf et al 2017 the two dimensional triangular fem mesh used for the simulation consists of about 150 000 elements with a spatial resolution of about 500 m inside and about 10 km outside of the poyang lake core region for details of the model pre and postprocessing see nixdorf 2018 the groundwater flow model computes hydraulic head fig 6 and groundwater velocity vectors fig 6b at each node element of the fem mesh for december 1999 low lake water level and september 2000 high water level in vtk format for subsequent integration into the eis system 3 2 3 hydrochemistry in general public information on water quality of surface waters including meta data on sampling location and time are difficult to obtain for chinese water bodies accessible datasets are rarely available in a sufficient spatial resolution particularly if the investigation aims to focus on large river networks nixdorf et al 2015 however recently a number of studies has been published providing data on surface water pollution caused by mining activities monitored along tributaries of poyang lake he et al 2018 measured surface water contents of arsenic chromium copper uranium and thorium at 13 sampling sites in fu river as well as in its tributary lin river jian 2018 investigated seasonal changes of heavy metal concentration copper lead and cadmium in the water soil and sediments at 13 sampling sites of le an river which is a tributary of xin river in order to reveal the impact of the dexing mining area on the stream ecosystem the results of this study were included in the eis together with the study of li et al 2018 who measured dissolved concentrations of 15 different heavy metals at 37 locations covering the entire gan river network for the eis we limited ourselves to two prototypical representations for the chemical data 1 for le an river we display a spatio temporal distribution for the concentration of copper in the river during various seasons the pollution during wet season is shown in fig 9c 2 for the gan river network we included a multivariate dataset for a fixed point in time allowing the user to switch through a linearly interpolated mapping of the 15 metal concentrations see fig 7 the visualisation of chemical concentration in 3d river representations has been kept simple on purpose to allow domain scientists to intuitively understand the displayed data the combination of both temporal and multivariate data is not a technical issue but the two dimensional parameter space compound vs time becomes difficult to navigate without a specifically designed user interface likewise a concurrent visualisation of multivariate data such as via glyphs or small multiples is not straightforward to understand without being given instructions hydrochemical data for poyang lake were integrated in the eis based on the two dimensional lake model of du et al 2018 the simulation includes information on the distribution and dynamics of total phosphorus total nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen and the permanganate index in poyang lake in a spatial temporal resolution of 100 m and 2 1 days respectively this is identical to the hydrodynamic dataset mentioned previously see conversion details in section 3 2 2 4 construction of the poyang lake vge in rink et al 2018 we proposed a framework for creating virtual geographic environments using unity as well as a workflow for preparing the data to be included an illustration of the workflow is shown in fig 8 and we will give a brief outline in the following based on the intended purpose of the vge datasets to be included are selected based on availability and their usefulness in the scope of the case study datasets often require preprocessing for fitting seamlessly together with other available datasets while modification of the data or their graphical representation is possible at a later stage of the workflow it is recommended to use the software products the datasets have been created with as much as possible to preserve the data s inherent structure and parameters and avoid the creation of processing artefacts a typical example is using a geographical information system for the projection of all datasets into the same coordinate system once prepared all datasets are imported into a vtk based processing software such as the ogs data explorer or paraview where graphical representations of each dataset are created while paraview is an all purpose software for scientific visualisation the data explorer offers a number of interfaces and algorithms specifically developed for the handling of environmental datasets either framework is used to modify the data in ways that have either not been supported in the original software or which are specific to the graphical representation of the data an example of this is the mapping of a raster file e g remote sensing imagery onto a warped surface representing the region of interest also at this stage artefacts are handled and data reduction algorithms are used to adequately prepare datasets for visualisation during the visualisation stage suitable representations for each of the datasets will be selected and visualisation algorithms are applied so the interesting aspects of each datasets will become visible or emphasised suitable colours and transfer functions are selected if possible in such a way that the colours will help users to understand the data finally the finished graphical objects representing the original datasets will be imported into the unity framework where parameters concerning the rendering within the scene will be set at the lowest level this includes selecting light sources for the scene or assigning specific shaders to a datasets bailey and cunningham 2011 i e defining how the dark shiny or colourful the object will appear as well as setting more elaborate rendering effects in addition presentation specific functionality is set up this includes viewpoints of positions in 3d space the user can select from a menu and will automatically be guided to picking objects to receive additional information we can link images fig 4 movies or documents or even interactive graphs to any 3d object selecting and controlling animations via control menu or switching simulation scenarios as an specific example we would like to illustrate the above workflow based on the dataset for le an river the course of the 280 km long river is part of the chinese river network dataset acquired from openstreetmap the data is imported into qgis the river has been extracted and projected into the epsg 16050 utm zone 50 n coordinate system used for this case study fig 9 a the river dataset has then been saved into the shapefile vector format and imported into the opengeosys data explorer here adjacent points with a distance of less than 100 m to each other have been removed this reduces the size of the dataset by more than 50 without the difference being visible to the human eye due to the size of study area and the final representation of the river now the dataset is mapped onto the 3d representation of the dem so it fits into the geographic context of the case study fig 9b we applied a vtktubefilter changing the representation of the polyline vector data into a triangulated pipe like structure with a radius of 50 m this is required because the original line structure will always be rendered at a width of one pixel and is thus too inconspicuous to be noticed the dataset was assigned the colour blue a colour that is typically associated with water at each point of the dataset we now added scalar values representing the copper concentration at different times of the year acquired via jian 2018 the higher the concentration the more the colour of the associated river segment will turn red this colour is especially suitable here not only because red is usually associated as a warning or sign of danger but the severely high concentration of the copper actually gives the river a reddish brown colour the transfer function we applied turns yellow at a concentration of 1 mg l red at 2 mg l and violet at 3 mg l we then exported the dataset into the autodesk fbx format which can be employed to import data into unity location mapping and colour are automatically adopted during this process in unity we parameterised the dataset such that it is rendered using a simply gouraud shader without casting shadows which is not necessary as it is being located on the catchment surface and rendering backfaces located at the inner side of the tube in order to save computing power an animation was defined to change the colour of the dataset based on the copper concentration during different times of the year fig 9c in addition the user can access images of river to get a less abstract view of the situation a viewpoint was set near dexing mine where the copper enters the river as a result that particular point of view can be set automatically during a presentation and an interpolated path along the river will guide the user from dexing mine to poyang lake depending on the complexity of each of the included datasets some of the steps described above may not be necessary or other algorithms might need to be applied instead it s important to note that all of the required algorithms are implemented in ogs paraview or unity and can be executed via user dialogues in the respective software programme thus significantly reducing the time required for each of the steps it is worth pointing out that the workflow shown in fig 8 is a subset of the data workflow introduced by kolditz et al 2012 based on the structure shown in fig 1 in addition to what had been presented in rink et al 2018 the functionality of our framework has been expanded for handling a number of types of datasets that will be presented here briefly previously it has only been possible to assign transfer functions based on spatial temporal parameters of fem based simulation results these transfer functions assign and can interpolate colour values to encode additional information during the presentation a generalisation of that algorithm now also allows the assignment of data to geometrical data in opengeosys and has been used as described above to visualise the changing concentration of various chemical compounds in poyang lake and its tributary rivers as demonstrated by samsel et al 2017 and more generalised in zhou and hansen 2016 suitable colour maps and transfer functions are of vital importance for an intuitive understanding of visually presented data as such we are using applications such as paraview ahrens et al 2005 or colorbrewer harrower and brewer 2011 to generate colour lookup tables lut that are either based on specific values or ranges such as the luts in fig 7 and 9c based on permissable critical values for copper concentration in drinking water or that can be adequately discriminated with human perception we also created animations from remote sensing data acquired over multiple years google earth imagery from 2009 to 2018 is used as texture for the dexing mining area it shows topographical changes of area and adds to the visualisation of the water pollution in le an river discussed above as such it enriches the understanding for a user exploring the data via the environmental information system and serves the holistic approach of the framework to visualise the hydrological processes simulated via coast2d and opengeosys and discussed in section 3 2 we applied and adjusted algorithms provided by vtk for the groundwater simulation triangle nodes have been mapped to the elevation of the groundwater head thus creating a warped surface of the simulated water level in addition arrow glyphs have been generated where the direction of arrow indicates flow direction and the colour the simulated velocity a total of 10 000 arrows positioned on an equilateral grid have been calculated and mapped onto the surface representing the groundwater head for low and higher water level each see fig 6b for the surface water hydraulics of the poyang lake a streamline representation of the flow was selected given the complex and drastically changing area covered by the lake and large variations in velocity representing flow via arrow glyphs as with the groundwater model results in a confusing visualisation where glyphs are not necessarily located on the lake surface and larger glyphs may conceal smaller ones in contrast streamlines preserve the shape of the original graphical object and are a suitable way to visualise eddies in the water see fig 5a during a concurrent visualisation of both surface and groundwater flow the different modes of representation also allow to easily differentiate between data sets integrating surface and subsurface water flow fields in one visualisation helps to reveal the complex spatio temporal pattern of gaining and losing conditions along the lake s shoreline and subsequently may facilitate the understanding of cross compartment interaction in the poyang lake basin in previous studies we have relied on the visualisation of diagrams for time series of weather and climate data here the occurrence of large storms and extreme rain events required a different representation to meet the request for a multi compartment approach for hydrological processes exemplary data from two extreme weather events see section 3 2 2 have been used to implement an algorithm for the 3d representation of precipitation data given 288 528 raster data sets of precipitation intensity per rain event we created a point cloud representation for visualising rain each pixel p i from the raster data is given an adjustable height parameter and thus forms a bounding box b i in 3d space within b i n ij points are randomly seeded with n i j being dependent on the amount of precipitation on pixel p i at timestep t j colours can be adjusted based on height intensity or any other parameter derived from the dataset the result is a vivid impression of rain clouds moving over the region of interest see fig 10 while such animations are very intuitive we did also include diagrams showing time series data from observation sites to allow experts to verify numbers and assess the development of the observed events for intuitive access the available timeseries data is linked to the representation of observation sites in the 3d scenes if these objects are picked via mouse or flystick a 2d overlay window opens displaying the time series for that particular site as a diagram for this case study we also added an interface to the al vis timeseries framework developed by the wisutec umwelttechnik gmbh one of our cooperation partners during the project this interface allows online access to the al vis database and shows current measurements at the selected observation site fig 11 al vis timeseries is able to import data from different sources for quality assurance research analysis and exporting the used database model is very flexible and can process very long time series with more than 106 measured values very fast multiple diagrams linked to observation sites in the vge can be opened concurrently and allow users to investigate the time series data interactively via pan and zoom functionality due to the large extent of the poyang lake basin we encountered a number of new challenges concerning the vge for this region the most challenging issue was related to data volume a sufficiently fine resolution is necessary to realistically depict areas of interest and to ensure that geographic features such as river valleys are rendered correctly this was of special importance due to the requirement for spatio temporal visualisation of rivers and their pollution in the correct geographical context given the size of the catchment both surface grids and texture data is reasonably large however for an interactive and immersive vr application a sufficiently high frame rate is required so users won t experience stuttering during animations or missing time steps in the rendering of simulation results fortunately recent versions of the unity engine support not only very large texture sizes but also level of detail approaches where multiple resolutions of surface grids are assembled into a tree structure and cross fading between data sets is automatically handled by unity itself in addition we included river network representations with a varying number of tributaries included as well as varying diameter of tube representations of rivers in addition we use standard procedures for saving rendering time by making use of backface culling i e only the front faces of triangles are rendered or view frustum culling i e only currently visible objects are rendered another issue is related to the visibility of small or thin structures within a large context we have addressed this issue before but due to the size of the catchment it was of special importance in this case study for an overview of the river network it required different representations of rivers as mentioned before a large diameter of tube structures in required for the objects to be clearly visible when showing the whole catchment however a much smaller representation is needed when zooming in on certain regions of interest here we solved the issue by linking specific representations of datasets to given predefined viewpoints if the user is selecting a viewpoint that will show large parts of the catchment larger representations of the rivers with fewer tributaries are shown if a viewpoint close to the surface is selected those datasets become transparent and instead a finer resolution with more tributaries is rendered the same approach is used for small regions of interest such as the dexing mining area we have used the proposed framework to present complex data collections to a wide range of audiences the 3d visualisation of multi compartment data has proven to be an excellent means to present research questions and progress to both stakeholders and the interested public allowing to present complex processes and relationships in an easy to understand and engaging way the virtual reality approach fosters discussions between collaborating scientists by allowing an in depth look at data characteristics with a complex context in our lab bilke et al 2014 we use middlevr as a unity plug in to present this case study in our virtual reality environment using 6 3 m video wall with additional projections on both sides as well as the floor fig 12 the system is powered by 13 beamers and users are tracked via an array of nine infrared cameras thus providing an immersive environment during presentations users can interact with the scene via a flystick or a gamepad however middlevr also supports a multitude of other platforms and we have built our applications for regular pcs as well as for head mounted displays such as the htc vive or the oculus rift 5 conclusions we presented a holistic analysis of water and solute dynamics in a large catchment highlighting the importance of visualisation for analysing and understanding complex data collections and simulation results a wide range of observation data in vector and raster format have been converted into 3d models and are complemented by previously published simulation results of a groundwater flow model for the poyang lake basin as well as a solute transport model of the lake itself all data sets have been projected into a unified geographical context for a complementary visualisation within a virtual geographic environment highlighting points of interest and visualising phenomena relevant to a hydrological analysis of the region facilitates a deeper understanding of the underlying processes and allows a visual correlation of the integrated data additional information such as time series imagery or websites is linked to corresponding objects in the scene creating a 3d environmental information system for the poyang lake basin the application allows for interactive data exploration in virtual reality both in cave like environments or using head mounted displays but can also be run on regular personal computers the software frameworks used and the algorithms developed are in no way limiting the application to the presented case study and can be easily applied to other regions of interest this form of presentation gives researchers a comprehensive view of all relevant data sets for any given case study allows for interdisciplinary discussions between collaborating scientists

5837,we propose a visualisation framework for data exploration analysis and presentation of complex hydrological studies in large catchments this furthers a deeper understanding of the interrelations between the included datasets allows for discussions among researchers from different disciplines and is the basis for illustrating complex phenomena to stakeholders or the interested public based on the 162 000 km2 catchment of poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china we developed a virtual geographic environment that combines a wide range of 2d and 3d observation data sets with simulation results from both an opengeosys groundwater model and a coast2d hydrodynamic model visualising water and solute dynamics within and across hydrologic reservoirs the system aims for a realistic presentation of the investigation area and implements approaches of scientific visualisation to illustrate interesting aspects of multi variate data in intuitive ways it employs easy to learn interaction techniques for navigation animation and access to linked data sets from external sources such as time series data or websites to function as an environmental information system for any region of interest keywords environmental information system virtual reality opengeosys water resources management poyang lake 1 motivation for complex environmental studies there is a considerable number of data sets required for setting up models and providing sufficient context for reliable predictions and recommendations however usually not all datasets can be visualised in a unified context researchers need to view a certain subset in geographic information systems gis view time series data from observation sites online or using a dedicated plotting software and one or more modelling frameworks to view their modelling data and simulation results any cross connections between these subsets have to be made mentally or manually such a workflow is not only prone to result in mistakes it also complicates presenting results to stakeholders or the public in an intuitive way in addition considering the complex hydrological cycle and its numerous parameters and subprocesses as one typical area of application state of the art monitoring and modelling activities as well as sophisticated visualisation and data integration systems are required together to facilitate system understanding and water resources management particularly on the scale of entire catchments which is appropriate for integrated management of water resources jaspers 2003 the large amount of available output datasets from models and remote sensing products are challenging for the development of efficient and informative visualization approaches we propose integrating all datasets relevant for the analysis of a given region of interest into one unified framework that serves as an environmental information system eis for data exploration interdisciplinary research and knowledge transfer we presented a first prototype for such a framework in rink et al 2018 for the work presented here we use this eis for a hydrological multi compartment study of the poyang lake basin in china its large size of about 162 000 km2 and the complex hydrological processes within the highly dynamic lake river wetland system influenced by numerous drivers in the catchment are making it an ideal study site for developing an integrated environmental information system for large basins considering that about 94 of jiangxi province is located within poyang lake basin an improved holistic representation of the overall hydrological system and its interconnected compartments is beneficial for both the pursuit of sustainable water resources management and for the economic construction and development at the provincial level the current management system of poyang lake is based on the jiangxi poyang lake wetland protection ordinance issued by the provincial people s congress the resulting system consists of a large number of authorities working independently from each other which weakens the power of both management and law enforcement fan and hu 2018 as a response to this situation china is fully establishing a river chief mechanism which assigns each part of a surface waterbody to an appointed official in order to improve the comprehensive management and public supervision of each basin consequently integrating the relevant mechanisms and dynamics in the poyang lake basin into a single visualisation framework has advantages with respect to evaluating future hydraulic constructions forecasting future water quality delineating protection zones and mitigating environmental issues there have been previous initiatives to integrate data from different sources into a holistic visualisation platform for poyang lake basin zhao et al 2018 set up a prototype system for analysing ecosystem simulation results obtained with the high accuracy surface modelling method hasm yue 2011 yue et al 2015 the platform allows for the spatial temporal analysis of raster files in the thematic areas climate change forest carbon storage and population distribution gu et al 2017 proposed a watershed ecological virtual simulation and decision support platform that combines gis data with a 2d watlac hydrological model into a virtual geographical environment to be presented on large displays chen et al 2015 integrated gis database management systems results from a numerical soil model and a 3d visualisation framework into a virtual hydrologic environment vhe for meijiang subcatchment zhu 2011 developed a 2d gis environment to display hydrological data from webgis services and a postgis database with the aim to validate the results of a two dimensional hydrodynamic water and pollutant transport model for poyang lake similar approaches of using 2d gis based visualization schemes for wetland data visualisation at poyang lake have been utilized by zhong 2008 xiang and zhou 2009 and zhao 2012 with the latter adding spatial relationship operations and their graphic representations into the developed framework focussing on flood inundation chen et al 2012 set up a 3d gis system for the poyang wetlands embedding 3d structures and hydrodynamic simulation results as well as geographic objects from a object relational database yan et al 2018 developed a basic 3d environmental information system for poyang lake basin a large number of data sets based on observation and simulation have been included in this case study examples include temperature precipitation or ecosystem quality as well as water dynamics however from an implementation point of view the technical contribution is limited as all data sets are imported as raster files and texture mapped onto a 3d model of a digital elevation model for the region the environmental information system eis proposed here aims at creating suitable representations for all included data sets such that the nature or certain aspects of the data are intuitively recognisable by users examples include the integration of precipitation data as point clouds or the simulated changes to the groundwater head as an actual triangulated plane within the 3d finite element model this has the added advantage of being able to potentially display more data or simply remove colour as an indicator for a parameter in favour of alternative means of visualisation in addition we have extended the functionality of our eis considerably and chose this case study to demonstrate both its portability to arbitrary regions of interest as well as the scalability for large volumes of data after a short introduction to virtual geographic environments in section 2 section 3 gives an overview of the poyang lake basin including the multiple compartments included in this study it presents details about specific data sets modelling and simulation approaches as well as necessary modifications during pre and postprocessing section 4 gives an overview of the environmental information system for the catchment it shows workflows lists extensions to the previously presented prototype and gives examples for data integration and visualisation based on specific data sets 2 virtual geographic environments the holistic representation of all available data sets for a given region of interest is currently beyond the capabilities of established geographical information systems gis such as arcgis or qgis cox et al 2013 tian et al 2016 such frameworks have been originally designed for displaying vector and raster data sets though approaches for displaying data in 3d exist the software is usually lacking both interfaces and methods for advanced visualisation of complex three or four dimensional data examples include the representation of climate or subsurface models the colour coded display of vector data to represent locally varying parameters or measurements or the handling of time variant data in general on the other hand all purpose visualisation software such as paraview ahrens et al 2005 or visit childs et al 2012 includes state of the art visualisation techniques but lacks interfaces to domain specific software such as gis or modelling frameworks to close this gap we have developed the opengeosys dataexplorer rink et al 2013 rink et al 2014 in recent years this software serves as a graphical user interface to the open source modelling software opengeosys kolditz et al 2012 and implements interfaces to various gis data formats a wide range of free and commercial modelling frameworks for instance feflow diersch 2014 petrel schlumberger 2018 swmm rossman 2014 openfoam weller and tabor 1998 as well as all purpose formats such as netcdf rew and davis 1990 and vtk schroeder et al 2006 the data explorer allows for the 3d visualisation of data via the open source library vtk visualization toolkit the data explorer has been designed for the preprocessing and evaluation for numerical thm c models its functionality is insufficient for complex collaborative research projects where the handling of large numbers of data sets can become confusing for unexperienced users and the implemented visualisation algorithms can be insufficient for collections of complex possibly multi variate or multi modal data sets therefore we recently started developing virtual geographic environments vge specifically for the purpose of integrating large collections of heterogenous data sets for the visualisation of complex environmental processes and interrelation of parameters of interest to researchers from a wide range of domains within the environmental sciences based on the definition by ellis 1994 the term virtual environment refers to an immersive interactive experience inside a synthetic space in recent years the term has been adapted for computer mediated communication in various domains with virtual learning environments probably being the most often cited application in the media virtual geographic environments have been first proposed as an extension of gis into 3d and vr batty 2008 yin 2010 later the concept has been extended to include data from numerical models and simulation results as well as web based data and collaborative approaches for data interaction lu 2011 lin et al 2013 kolditz et al 2019 however our definition of a virtual geographic environment slightly differs from the previously proposed framework lin et al 2013 and lin et al 2013 subdivide a vge into four components data environment modelling and simulation environment interactive environment and collaborative environment in contrast a diagram of our framework is depicted in fig 1 the data life cycle starts with data added to some kind of data storage e g a database or file storage this data is preprocessed to remove artifacts calculate derived parameter sets or project it into another coordinate system that modified version of the data is either stored or forwarded into the vge depending on the complexity of the selected algorithms and the use of the processed data for other users or subsequent stages of the workflow not integrating the data processing component within the vge is debatable as it includes pre and postprocessing algorithms for general data modification e g for the removal of artefacts specific algorithms for the modelling and simulation e g for the assessment of mesh element quality for the finite element method specific algorithms for a subsequent visualisation e g data reduction methods for high dimensional multivariate data as well as algorithms required for both modelling and visualisation e g the projection of data into a unified coordinate system both data storage and preprocessing are what is called data environment in lin et al 2013 if modelling or simulation data is part of the vge the preprocessed data serves as input for a suitable simulation software and results are written back to the data storage this simulation software might be opengeosys but as mentioned before interfaces for files from a multitude of other software products have been implemented as well while this modelling simulation component corresponds to the modelling environment it is explicitly not part of the vge but simulation results are instead accessed via an interface just like any other dataset the vge is agnostic to the origin of any dataset as long as there is an interface to read the data it does not matter if it is research or observation data from scientific partners state departments companies or data openly available on the net moreover the data storage preprocessing and modelling components would work just as well without a vge accessing the data afterwards instead our interpretation of a vge consists only of a visualisation and a presentation component roughly corresponding to what lin et al 2013 call interactive environment and collaborative environment the visualisation component is used to create tesselated 3d objects out of environmental data sets in the form of suitable metaphors or expressions such as glyphs streamlines or surfaces the presentation component includes everything required for the user experience in virtual reality starting from the choice of shaders for 3d object and the lighting of the scene but also animations predefined viewpoints picking objects to access additional information or switching objects or parameter sets live during a presentation it is worth pointing out that the workflow described above is not definitive as the immersive user experience is impaired if frame rates drop below 20 30 frames per second it is common for complex and computationally expensive forms of visualisation to store pre rendered representations of datasets on a file server or database to guarantee fast rendering at all times thus creating a direct connection of the vge to the data storage also the vge might access the simulation component directly if in situ visualisation bauer et al 2016 is part of the study however this requires that the simulation software includes interfaces specifically designed for in situ visualisation we have previously implemented the above concept for a vge for the catchment of chao lake in the anhui province of china rink et al 2018 using the opengeosys data explorer for preprocessing data sets and employing unity unity technologies 2018 a cross plattform game engine for implementation since both pre processing algorithms as well as the necessary extensions of unity have been deliberately designed to be re usable for future case studies we were able to apply and extend the existing framework to build an application for the catchment of poyang lake presented here 3 case study poyang lake basin 3 1 catchment characteristics poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china by maximum annual extension is located in the southeastern part of china fig 2 a annual precipitation rates in the poyang lake basin show a distinct wet and a dry season with a short transition period in between although precipitation rates are highest in june fig 2b tropical cyclones regularly cause thunderstorms and heavy rainfall in the basin in late summer the distribution of rainfall in its catchment controls runoff generation in the five large river systems ganjiang xinjiang xiushui raohe and fuhe river entering poyang lake with an basin averaged runoff coefficient of about 0 6 huang et al 2008 in addition ungauged river systems may contribute between 12 li et al 2019 and 15 6 du et al 2018 of total water inflow to the lake poyang lake drains into the yangtze river at a rate of about 150 bn m3 per year which takes about 15 5 of the rivers total runoff zhao et al 2011 see fig 3 seasonal water level variations of the lake also depend on the discharge characteristics of yangtze river and can reach more than 10 m at hukou and xingzi station between dry and wet season at maximum extension the water surface of the lake expands up to 3 800 km2 filled by a water volume of 32 bn m3 in addition the fairly late yearly high water levels in yangtze river fig 2b periodically cause a water blockage at the outflow of poyang lake which contributes to high water levels in the lake system ye et al 1960 yao et al 2018 in contrast the lake shrinks to little more than a river during the dry winter months the corresponding change in inundation area hui et al 2008 forms a unique system of water areas wetlands and mudflats for more details on the hydrology of the system the interested reader is referred to the relevant publications e g li et al 2014 and guo et al 2008 according to the chinese environmental quality standards for surface water gb3838 2002 poyang lake has an overall water quality that is better than most other large chinese lakes such as tai lake or chao lake fig 9 however water quality is continuously deteriorating as the lake and the wetland system face several pollution pressures such as an continuous inflow of nutrients and fertiliser residuals from its extensively cultivated shorelines duan et al 2016 soldatova et al 2018 as well as acidity and heavy metals from mining areas he et al 1998 and industrial sites xu and wang 2016 additionally the hydrological system is increasingly disturbed by hydraulic construction measures the opening of the three gorges dam tgd is considered one reason for generally decreasing water levels in poyang lake during the last decade li et al 2017 furthermore prevalent sand mining activities increase water turbidity restrict phytoplankton growth and have contributed to an annual water level decrease of 1 2 2 m at the outflow of poyang lake during dry season lai et al 2014 yao et al 2018 apart from its large size the ecosystem of poyang lake is of international importance due its wide range of wetland habitats that support rich biodiversity huang et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 for instance many migratory birds coming from siberia mongolia japan korea northeast and northwest china rely on these diverse habitats for overwintering giving the ecological importance of poyang lake an supranational component yang et al 2016 3 2 preprocessing of input datasets as motivated in section 2 we are able to integrate a large variety of data formats into the virtual geographic environment by using the opengeosys data explorer as a preprocessing tool and exporting the data representations subsequently into unity for the hydrological study presented in this paper we focussed on integrating data available on the internet possible sources included both websites providing monitoring data and publications providing data sets bibliographic studies showed that a total of about 9 600 chinese and 1 300 english articles touching the topic poyang lake were published in scientific journals between 1983 and 2017 zhou 2018 this includes a considerable number of publications in the field of hydrology and earth sciences however many of the published datasets lack precise information on time and location of data acquisition or have an insufficient resolution both are necessary requirements for a meaningful representation within an environmental information system in addition accessibility of official environmental datasets provided by local or provincial authorities in the poyang lake basin is limited therefore open data from remote sensing sources as well as data produced by physically based models of parts of the hydrological system was used to fill data gaps in the visualisation of spatio temporal dynamics in the poyang lake basin consequently a mix of data sets from open databases articles remote sensing information and official data have been integrated into the eis an overview of integrated data sets is given in table 1 3 2 1 surface mapping the catchment boundary of poyang lake basin was obtained by applying a gis catchment analysis on the digital elevation model dem dataset provided by the hydrosheds project lehner et al 2008 this dataset is based on data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which has been processed for hydrological purposes hydrosheds dem defines the elevation of the lake s water level as constant we modified the derived dem for poyang lake basin for pixels actually covered by water from the lake and replaced those values with available bathymetry data comparing the elevation in the non flooded wetland areas provided by both the hydrosheds and the bathymetry dataset the average difference of elevation values was not more than 2 m i e less than the vertical height accuracy of the srtm sensors https www2 jpl nasa gov srtm statistics html due to the large size of the poyang lake basin and the requirement for a detailed reconstruction of comparatively small areas within the catchment such as subcatchments of tributaries or the lake region itself the resulting surface mesh is very large when considering typically used data in unity the complete surface of the catchment consists of 1 8 10 6 nodes and 3 75 10 6 triangles with an average edge length of 500 m this surface mesh has then been partitioned into smaller meshes to allow for performance optimisation such as view frustum culling technical details on suitable visualisation techniques for large geoscientific data in unity have been presented by rink et al 2017 in addition to the regular surface representation a number of refined meshes have been created for certain areas of interest most data acquisition simulation and visualisation efforts focus on the poyang core region which is defined as the area of a dozen counties around poyang lake with a total area of about 19 833 km 2 tang et al 2016 poyang lake is located in this core region as well as nanchang the largest city in the catchment with a population of about 3 million subsequently the core region is in the focus of this case study the surface mesh for the core region consists of roughly 10 6 triangles 0 5 10 5 nodes with an average edge length of 250 m a second much smaller region of interest is the dexing copper and gold mining area located about 100 km east of poyang lake which is represented by a surface representation using just 20 000 triangles textures for these meshes have been acquired from google earth in varying resolutions for the dexing mining area we made use of google s historical view functionality to create a texture series and show the expansion of the mines from 2009 to 2018 3 2 2 meteorological and hydrological datasets for the visualisation of precipitation two heavy rainfall events were selected from the precipitation datasets of the gpm satellite mission hou et al 2014 the first event covers the heavy rainfall caused by typhoon soudelor in southern china between 06 and 11 august 2015 a total of 287 global datasets in hdf5 format represent the time interval at a 30 min temporal resolution these datasets were automatically downloaded clipped to the investigation area and converted into ascii grids in the epsg 16050 coordinate reference system using python a similar processing scheme was applied for 527 precipitation grids in the time interval between the 20 and 30 june 2017 which represent the heavy rainfall causing the 2017 china floods in june 2017 in addition the location of all river gauging stations reservoir gauging stations and weather stations maintained by the jiangxi water resources department as well as the related hydrographs were included in the eis the stream network of five main tributaries of poyang lake was obtained from openstreetmaps osm and classified into three orders each all observation sites and river geometries have been mapped onto the triangulated three dimensional surface generated from the dem using a linear interpolation algorithm proposed in rink et al 2014 in addition the results of a two dimensional hydrodynamic lake model du et al 2018 were integrated into the eis to visualise inundation changes as well as water and matter transport in poyang lake see fig 5 the provided dataset consist of 186 rasters representing the temporal dynamics in the lake between september 2009 to february 2011 with a temporal resolution of 2 1 days we implemented a reader to convert the coast2d simulation output into the vtk unstructured grid format specifically each time step would be written to a separate file with each parameter represented by an array within that file as a result we ended up 186 mesh files each consisting of 47 000 quad elements and containing information on flow direction flow velocity and four chemical concentrations for each cell given that representation it is straightforward to display a temporal sequence for any of the included parameters and use vtk for subsequently applying visualisation algorithms to the data set to represent the groundwater flow system the distribution of hydraulic heads groundwater velocities and stream path trajectories in the poyang lake basin has been visualised in the eis based on the results of the groundwater model developed by nixdorf 2018 see fig 6 the groundwater regime was simulated in two dimensional planar direction for low and high water levels in poyang lake using the open source thmc fem code opengeosys kolditz et al 2012 which has been applied for groundwater flow simulations on the regional scale under various scientific objectives in previous studies e g walther et al 2014 wu et al 2011 nixdorf et al 2017 the two dimensional triangular fem mesh used for the simulation consists of about 150 000 elements with a spatial resolution of about 500 m inside and about 10 km outside of the poyang lake core region for details of the model pre and postprocessing see nixdorf 2018 the groundwater flow model computes hydraulic head fig 6 and groundwater velocity vectors fig 6b at each node element of the fem mesh for december 1999 low lake water level and september 2000 high water level in vtk format for subsequent integration into the eis system 3 2 3 hydrochemistry in general public information on water quality of surface waters including meta data on sampling location and time are difficult to obtain for chinese water bodies accessible datasets are rarely available in a sufficient spatial resolution particularly if the investigation aims to focus on large river networks nixdorf et al 2015 however recently a number of studies has been published providing data on surface water pollution caused by mining activities monitored along tributaries of poyang lake he et al 2018 measured surface water contents of arsenic chromium copper uranium and thorium at 13 sampling sites in fu river as well as in its tributary lin river jian 2018 investigated seasonal changes of heavy metal concentration copper lead and cadmium in the water soil and sediments at 13 sampling sites of le an river which is a tributary of xin river in order to reveal the impact of the dexing mining area on the stream ecosystem the results of this study were included in the eis together with the study of li et al 2018 who measured dissolved concentrations of 15 different heavy metals at 37 locations covering the entire gan river network for the eis we limited ourselves to two prototypical representations for the chemical data 1 for le an river we display a spatio temporal distribution for the concentration of copper in the river during various seasons the pollution during wet season is shown in fig 9c 2 for the gan river network we included a multivariate dataset for a fixed point in time allowing the user to switch through a linearly interpolated mapping of the 15 metal concentrations see fig 7 the visualisation of chemical concentration in 3d river representations has been kept simple on purpose to allow domain scientists to intuitively understand the displayed data the combination of both temporal and multivariate data is not a technical issue but the two dimensional parameter space compound vs time becomes difficult to navigate without a specifically designed user interface likewise a concurrent visualisation of multivariate data such as via glyphs or small multiples is not straightforward to understand without being given instructions hydrochemical data for poyang lake were integrated in the eis based on the two dimensional lake model of du et al 2018 the simulation includes information on the distribution and dynamics of total phosphorus total nitrogen ammoniacal nitrogen and the permanganate index in poyang lake in a spatial temporal resolution of 100 m and 2 1 days respectively this is identical to the hydrodynamic dataset mentioned previously see conversion details in section 3 2 2 4 construction of the poyang lake vge in rink et al 2018 we proposed a framework for creating virtual geographic environments using unity as well as a workflow for preparing the data to be included an illustration of the workflow is shown in fig 8 and we will give a brief outline in the following based on the intended purpose of the vge datasets to be included are selected based on availability and their usefulness in the scope of the case study datasets often require preprocessing for fitting seamlessly together with other available datasets while modification of the data or their graphical representation is possible at a later stage of the workflow it is recommended to use the software products the datasets have been created with as much as possible to preserve the data s inherent structure and parameters and avoid the creation of processing artefacts a typical example is using a geographical information system for the projection of all datasets into the same coordinate system once prepared all datasets are imported into a vtk based processing software such as the ogs data explorer or paraview where graphical representations of each dataset are created while paraview is an all purpose software for scientific visualisation the data explorer offers a number of interfaces and algorithms specifically developed for the handling of environmental datasets either framework is used to modify the data in ways that have either not been supported in the original software or which are specific to the graphical representation of the data an example of this is the mapping of a raster file e g remote sensing imagery onto a warped surface representing the region of interest also at this stage artefacts are handled and data reduction algorithms are used to adequately prepare datasets for visualisation during the visualisation stage suitable representations for each of the datasets will be selected and visualisation algorithms are applied so the interesting aspects of each datasets will become visible or emphasised suitable colours and transfer functions are selected if possible in such a way that the colours will help users to understand the data finally the finished graphical objects representing the original datasets will be imported into the unity framework where parameters concerning the rendering within the scene will be set at the lowest level this includes selecting light sources for the scene or assigning specific shaders to a datasets bailey and cunningham 2011 i e defining how the dark shiny or colourful the object will appear as well as setting more elaborate rendering effects in addition presentation specific functionality is set up this includes viewpoints of positions in 3d space the user can select from a menu and will automatically be guided to picking objects to receive additional information we can link images fig 4 movies or documents or even interactive graphs to any 3d object selecting and controlling animations via control menu or switching simulation scenarios as an specific example we would like to illustrate the above workflow based on the dataset for le an river the course of the 280 km long river is part of the chinese river network dataset acquired from openstreetmap the data is imported into qgis the river has been extracted and projected into the epsg 16050 utm zone 50 n coordinate system used for this case study fig 9 a the river dataset has then been saved into the shapefile vector format and imported into the opengeosys data explorer here adjacent points with a distance of less than 100 m to each other have been removed this reduces the size of the dataset by more than 50 without the difference being visible to the human eye due to the size of study area and the final representation of the river now the dataset is mapped onto the 3d representation of the dem so it fits into the geographic context of the case study fig 9b we applied a vtktubefilter changing the representation of the polyline vector data into a triangulated pipe like structure with a radius of 50 m this is required because the original line structure will always be rendered at a width of one pixel and is thus too inconspicuous to be noticed the dataset was assigned the colour blue a colour that is typically associated with water at each point of the dataset we now added scalar values representing the copper concentration at different times of the year acquired via jian 2018 the higher the concentration the more the colour of the associated river segment will turn red this colour is especially suitable here not only because red is usually associated as a warning or sign of danger but the severely high concentration of the copper actually gives the river a reddish brown colour the transfer function we applied turns yellow at a concentration of 1 mg l red at 2 mg l and violet at 3 mg l we then exported the dataset into the autodesk fbx format which can be employed to import data into unity location mapping and colour are automatically adopted during this process in unity we parameterised the dataset such that it is rendered using a simply gouraud shader without casting shadows which is not necessary as it is being located on the catchment surface and rendering backfaces located at the inner side of the tube in order to save computing power an animation was defined to change the colour of the dataset based on the copper concentration during different times of the year fig 9c in addition the user can access images of river to get a less abstract view of the situation a viewpoint was set near dexing mine where the copper enters the river as a result that particular point of view can be set automatically during a presentation and an interpolated path along the river will guide the user from dexing mine to poyang lake depending on the complexity of each of the included datasets some of the steps described above may not be necessary or other algorithms might need to be applied instead it s important to note that all of the required algorithms are implemented in ogs paraview or unity and can be executed via user dialogues in the respective software programme thus significantly reducing the time required for each of the steps it is worth pointing out that the workflow shown in fig 8 is a subset of the data workflow introduced by kolditz et al 2012 based on the structure shown in fig 1 in addition to what had been presented in rink et al 2018 the functionality of our framework has been expanded for handling a number of types of datasets that will be presented here briefly previously it has only been possible to assign transfer functions based on spatial temporal parameters of fem based simulation results these transfer functions assign and can interpolate colour values to encode additional information during the presentation a generalisation of that algorithm now also allows the assignment of data to geometrical data in opengeosys and has been used as described above to visualise the changing concentration of various chemical compounds in poyang lake and its tributary rivers as demonstrated by samsel et al 2017 and more generalised in zhou and hansen 2016 suitable colour maps and transfer functions are of vital importance for an intuitive understanding of visually presented data as such we are using applications such as paraview ahrens et al 2005 or colorbrewer harrower and brewer 2011 to generate colour lookup tables lut that are either based on specific values or ranges such as the luts in fig 7 and 9c based on permissable critical values for copper concentration in drinking water or that can be adequately discriminated with human perception we also created animations from remote sensing data acquired over multiple years google earth imagery from 2009 to 2018 is used as texture for the dexing mining area it shows topographical changes of area and adds to the visualisation of the water pollution in le an river discussed above as such it enriches the understanding for a user exploring the data via the environmental information system and serves the holistic approach of the framework to visualise the hydrological processes simulated via coast2d and opengeosys and discussed in section 3 2 we applied and adjusted algorithms provided by vtk for the groundwater simulation triangle nodes have been mapped to the elevation of the groundwater head thus creating a warped surface of the simulated water level in addition arrow glyphs have been generated where the direction of arrow indicates flow direction and the colour the simulated velocity a total of 10 000 arrows positioned on an equilateral grid have been calculated and mapped onto the surface representing the groundwater head for low and higher water level each see fig 6b for the surface water hydraulics of the poyang lake a streamline representation of the flow was selected given the complex and drastically changing area covered by the lake and large variations in velocity representing flow via arrow glyphs as with the groundwater model results in a confusing visualisation where glyphs are not necessarily located on the lake surface and larger glyphs may conceal smaller ones in contrast streamlines preserve the shape of the original graphical object and are a suitable way to visualise eddies in the water see fig 5a during a concurrent visualisation of both surface and groundwater flow the different modes of representation also allow to easily differentiate between data sets integrating surface and subsurface water flow fields in one visualisation helps to reveal the complex spatio temporal pattern of gaining and losing conditions along the lake s shoreline and subsequently may facilitate the understanding of cross compartment interaction in the poyang lake basin in previous studies we have relied on the visualisation of diagrams for time series of weather and climate data here the occurrence of large storms and extreme rain events required a different representation to meet the request for a multi compartment approach for hydrological processes exemplary data from two extreme weather events see section 3 2 2 have been used to implement an algorithm for the 3d representation of precipitation data given 288 528 raster data sets of precipitation intensity per rain event we created a point cloud representation for visualising rain each pixel p i from the raster data is given an adjustable height parameter and thus forms a bounding box b i in 3d space within b i n ij points are randomly seeded with n i j being dependent on the amount of precipitation on pixel p i at timestep t j colours can be adjusted based on height intensity or any other parameter derived from the dataset the result is a vivid impression of rain clouds moving over the region of interest see fig 10 while such animations are very intuitive we did also include diagrams showing time series data from observation sites to allow experts to verify numbers and assess the development of the observed events for intuitive access the available timeseries data is linked to the representation of observation sites in the 3d scenes if these objects are picked via mouse or flystick a 2d overlay window opens displaying the time series for that particular site as a diagram for this case study we also added an interface to the al vis timeseries framework developed by the wisutec umwelttechnik gmbh one of our cooperation partners during the project this interface allows online access to the al vis database and shows current measurements at the selected observation site fig 11 al vis timeseries is able to import data from different sources for quality assurance research analysis and exporting the used database model is very flexible and can process very long time series with more than 106 measured values very fast multiple diagrams linked to observation sites in the vge can be opened concurrently and allow users to investigate the time series data interactively via pan and zoom functionality due to the large extent of the poyang lake basin we encountered a number of new challenges concerning the vge for this region the most challenging issue was related to data volume a sufficiently fine resolution is necessary to realistically depict areas of interest and to ensure that geographic features such as river valleys are rendered correctly this was of special importance due to the requirement for spatio temporal visualisation of rivers and their pollution in the correct geographical context given the size of the catchment both surface grids and texture data is reasonably large however for an interactive and immersive vr application a sufficiently high frame rate is required so users won t experience stuttering during animations or missing time steps in the rendering of simulation results fortunately recent versions of the unity engine support not only very large texture sizes but also level of detail approaches where multiple resolutions of surface grids are assembled into a tree structure and cross fading between data sets is automatically handled by unity itself in addition we included river network representations with a varying number of tributaries included as well as varying diameter of tube representations of rivers in addition we use standard procedures for saving rendering time by making use of backface culling i e only the front faces of triangles are rendered or view frustum culling i e only currently visible objects are rendered another issue is related to the visibility of small or thin structures within a large context we have addressed this issue before but due to the size of the catchment it was of special importance in this case study for an overview of the river network it required different representations of rivers as mentioned before a large diameter of tube structures in required for the objects to be clearly visible when showing the whole catchment however a much smaller representation is needed when zooming in on certain regions of interest here we solved the issue by linking specific representations of datasets to given predefined viewpoints if the user is selecting a viewpoint that will show large parts of the catchment larger representations of the rivers with fewer tributaries are shown if a viewpoint close to the surface is selected those datasets become transparent and instead a finer resolution with more tributaries is rendered the same approach is used for small regions of interest such as the dexing mining area we have used the proposed framework to present complex data collections to a wide range of audiences the 3d visualisation of multi compartment data has proven to be an excellent means to present research questions and progress to both stakeholders and the interested public allowing to present complex processes and relationships in an easy to understand and engaging way the virtual reality approach fosters discussions between collaborating scientists by allowing an in depth look at data characteristics with a complex context in our lab bilke et al 2014 we use middlevr as a unity plug in to present this case study in our virtual reality environment using 6 3 m video wall with additional projections on both sides as well as the floor fig 12 the system is powered by 13 beamers and users are tracked via an array of nine infrared cameras thus providing an immersive environment during presentations users can interact with the scene via a flystick or a gamepad however middlevr also supports a multitude of other platforms and we have built our applications for regular pcs as well as for head mounted displays such as the htc vive or the oculus rift 5 conclusions we presented a holistic analysis of water and solute dynamics in a large catchment highlighting the importance of visualisation for analysing and understanding complex data collections and simulation results a wide range of observation data in vector and raster format have been converted into 3d models and are complemented by previously published simulation results of a groundwater flow model for the poyang lake basin as well as a solute transport model of the lake itself all data sets have been projected into a unified geographical context for a complementary visualisation within a virtual geographic environment highlighting points of interest and visualising phenomena relevant to a hydrological analysis of the region facilitates a deeper understanding of the underlying processes and allows a visual correlation of the integrated data additional information such as time series imagery or websites is linked to corresponding objects in the scene creating a 3d environmental information system for the poyang lake basin the application allows for interactive data exploration in virtual reality both in cave like environments or using head mounted displays but can also be run on regular personal computers the software frameworks used and the algorithms developed are in no way limiting the application to the presented case study and can be easily applied to other regions of interest this form of presentation gives researchers a comprehensive view of all relevant data sets for any given case study allows for interdisciplinary discussions between collaborating scientists

5838,growing sphagnum moss for peatland restoration and fibre farming requires the proper moisture regime be maintained thus there is a desire to optimize growth by creating ideal hydrological conditions however it is uncertain which parameterization method is most suitable to describe field scale processes and which soil water retention model and hydraulic conductivity curve approach is the most acceptable to use parameterizations of the van genuchten mualem vgm equation were done using retc curve fitting to direct measurements of the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves and hydrus 1d inverse modelling to field observations of soil moisture the acceptability of each parameterization was tested by comparing soil moisture estimates based on forward simulations to observed soil moisture in two regenerated moss profiles established in 1970 and 2006 cases respectively the transient field model simulated soil moisture well and had an rmse of 0 05 and 0 06 for 1970 and 2006 respectively the most error occurred during the wettest and driest periods of the simulations simulated soil moisture was consistently drier than the observed soil moisture in the steady state laboratory simulation and had markedly higher rmse 0 14 and 0 27 for the 1970 and 2006 profiles respectively the estimate of the vgm α parameter an approximately the inverse of the air entry pressure fit to direct measurements of the retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves was an order of magnitude higher than that fit to field observation the results of the simulation suggest that inverse modelling to field soil moisture should be used to estimate vgm parameters to more accurately represent field scale soil moisture dynamics keywords hydrus retc sphagnum unsaturated properties curve fitting inverse modelling 1 introduction unsaturated zone hydrological process in peat and sphagnum mosses have become a topic of increased interest over the past two decades because of their importance to horticultural applications da silva et al 1993 climate change resilience moore and waddington 2015 restoration mccarter and price 2015 and carbon dynamics plant growth strack and price 2010 unsaturated zone properties control the ability of a porous media to retain and conduct water under negative pressure head which is dictated by morphology of the pore network and water distribution within it jerauld and salter 1990 the wettability and saturation history of the media man and jing 1999 and the pore size distribution of the media mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 sphagnum mosses are the dominant species in many peatlands and the pore network is the space between overlapping leaves and branches hayward and clymo 1982 sphagnum mosses are bryophytes that have no roots which rely on water conveyed through the pore network under capillary force thus understanding unsaturated process and properties is important to understand how peatlands develop function and persist recently sphagnum fibre farming is being considered as an alternate management plan to restoring peatlands after they have been disturbed for peat harvesting brown et al 2017 or agriculture gaudig et al 2018 the objective of fibre farming is to maximize sphagnum biomass accumulation by optimizing water availability which can be done with a variety of irrigation systems e g brown et al 2017 gaudig et al 2018 the optimum water content for sphagnum moss is available to maximize carbon uptake through photosynthesis flanagan 1996 silvola 1990 but not restrict gas exchange silvola 1990 furthermore water table stability of the peatland is an important factor in moss photosynthesis and biomass production brown et al 2017 pouliot et al 2015 hydrological models are a useful tool for assessing the scalability of an operation and how moss growth and species composition may change the water demand and irrigation strategies simulations which use unsaturated hydrological models can be used to assess water availability the models are defined by the relationships between pressure head ψ soil moisture θ and hydraulic conductivity k for organic soils retention curves θ ψ and hydraulic conductivity curves k ψ have typically been derived by parameterizing soil hydraulic property functions to laboratory observations da silva et al 1993 gnatowski et al 2002 price et al 2008 parameters describing soil hydraulic properties have usually been used to compare the retention capacity of different soils gnatowski et al 2010 moore et al 2015 or assess the functional differences of mosses gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter and price 2014 furthermore hydrological models have also been used to characterize unsaturated zone contaminant transport gharedaghloo et al 2018 simhayov et al 2018 plant stress moore and waddington 2015 and evaporation from peatlands dixon et al 2017 very little work has been done to predict soil hydraulic parameters which describe field scale soil moisture schwärzel et al 2006a 2006b the use of soil water characteristic and hydraulic conductivity curves in models requires that a function is fit to the θ ψ and k ψ observations traditionally multi step outflow experiments using pressure cells e g weiss et al 1998 were only able to generate the data to fit the retention curve more recently the tension disk method was developed which allows for the direct observation of the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves price et al 2008 numerous studies have measured the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves but have not used the data for curve fitting e g goetz and price 2015 mccarter and price 2015 an alternative approach to directly fitting the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves is inverse modelling which is the process of iteratively solving richards equation to best match transient observations of soil moisture and or pressure head vrugt et al 2008 weber et al 2017a inverse modelling for organic soils has been done in the laboratory using multi step outflow gnatowski et al 2010 evaporation weber et al 2017a and unsteady state displacement experiments gharedaghloo and price 2019 additionally inverse modelling can be done using observations from field experiments schwärzel et al 2006a 2006b parameters determined using direct curve fitting differed from those determined with inverse modelling the modelled curve suggests that drainage occurs closer to 0 cm of pressure schwärzel et al 2006a these differences will be discussed later studies with mineral soils have found that parameterization with inverse modelling produced more accurate retention curves than parameters fit with direct curve fitting lier 2019 morvannou et al 2013 despite the large volume of work done to characterize unsaturated properties in the laboratory virtually no attempts have been made to assess their validity in field conditions e g schwärzel et al 2006b furthermore several laboratory measurement methods have been presented and the evidence suggests that they can result in different parameter estimates schelle et al 2013 and that there can be large discrepancies in their performance in a field setting schwärzel et al 2006b an improved understanding of unsaturated properties can be gained by assessing how different parameter fitting methods can simulate water retention and transport in a soil column the intent of this study is to determine the vgm parameters that accurately describe soil moisture dynamics in the field therefore the objectives are a to determine vgm parameters for regenerated sphagnum moss profiles using direct curve fitting and inverse modelling and b assess how effective each parameter set is at simulating soil moisture during the summer field season using a one dimensional hydraulic model 2 methods 2 1 study site and sample preparation data for this study were originally collected and published by taylor and price 2015 for a full description of methods consult the original publication the study site was a cutover peatland located south of shippagan new brunswick 47 40 n 64 43 w and it is characterized by alternating raised baulks and lowered trenches as a result of traditional block cut peat harvesting since abandonment in 1970 sphagnum mosses spontaneously recolonized the trenches additionally the site was selected for research in sphagnum fibre farming beginning in 2004 plots of vegetation were removed and replanted with sphagnum mosses every two years until 2010 landry and rochefort 2009 plot names indicate the year of abandonment 1970 or the year where sphagnum was planted the profile at each plot was old cut over peat overlain by moss layers of varying thickness reflecting the time since moss re establishment taylor and price 2015 to measure soil moisture triplicate cs605 tdr probes were installed at depths of 2 5 7 5 12 5 and 17 5 cm and 2 5 7 5 and 12 5 cm for the 2006 and 1970 c plots respectively soil moisture was measured hourly with the exception of tdrs installed at 12 5 and 17 5 cm below the surface in the 2006 profile which were manually measured several times a week taylor and price 2015 calibration of the tdrs was done gravimetrically for more information see taylor and price 2015 for a full description of the calibration process meteorological soil moisture and water table data were collected hourly at the 1970 c and 2006 plots although the 2010 plot was instrumented the moss layer was not thick enough to be instrumented or adequately sampled thus it was not used in this study several experimental plots were established in regions with moss growth starting in 1970 taylor and price 2015 since only the 1970 c plot was instrumented it will be referred to as 1970 in this study samples of sphagnum moss n 2 per profile and cut over peat n 1 per profile were taken from the top 10 cm the base of the moss profile and the cut over peat of each plot depths represent the midpoint of samples that had a height of 5 cm fig 1 soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were determined in the laboratory taylor and price 2015 using the modified tension disk method described by mccarter et al 2017 following that bulk density porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured taylor and price 2015 the depth of samples and tdr probes will define the layers used in later model domains 2 2 model setup hydrus 1d was used to numerically simulate soil moisture dynamics in the 2006 and 1970 plots for an 82 day period between may and august 2013 using the parameters estimated from two different techniques described later the model domains were 0 58 and 0 47 m tall and contained three and four layers for the 2006 and 1970 plots respectively fig 1 node spacing was 0 005 m a variable pressure head was defined as the lower boundary condition typically the vertical hydraulic gradient is very low in northern bogs reeve et al 2000 as such the lower boundary was determined from observed water table measurements observed precipitation and estimated potential evaporation from taylor and price 2015 were used to characterize the atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer at the top of the domain potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the priestley taylor method the priestley taylor alpha value was set to 1 26 as defined by priestley and taylor 1972 and previously used in peatlands by petrone et al 2008 and price 1992 the soil water atmospheric vapour equilibrium hcrita defines the pressure head at which evaporation capacity is exceeded evaporation becomes limited when pressure head of the top node reaches hcrita actual evaporation will be less than potential evaporation šimůnek et al 2009 numerically hcrita is used to increase model stability it is a lower bound for pressure head to prevent it from changing dramatically when there are small changes in the water content near residual an hcrita of 10 000 cm was used it is the pressure head at which thompson and waddington 2008 and goetz and price 2015 suggest soil vapour equilibrium occurs in a cut over bog at mid day during the summer and in a sphagnum profile when the water table is 10 cm below the surface respectively initial soil moisture conditions were determined by linearly interpolating between tdr observations and water table a spin up period was not needed because the initial conditions were well defined 2 3 determination of soil hydraulic parameters the van genuchten mualem equation vgm is the most widely used soil hydraulic property model within peatland literature gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter et al 2017 mccarter and price 2014 moore and waddington 2015 price et al 2008 price and whittington 2010 the vgm model is defined as 1 s e 1 1 α ψ n m 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 3 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation ψ is the pressure head l ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and θ θr and θs cm3 cm 3 are the water content residual water content and saturated water content respectively the parameters α l 1 n and l are fitting parameters that are related to the inverse of the approximate air entry pressure width of the pore size distribution and the pore connectivity respectively the parameter m is calculated as 1 1 n the vgm parameters α n l and m 1 1 n were determined using two methods the first was using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 based on the hydraulic conductivity and retention data measured by taylor and price 2015 in steady state laboratory experiments for each layer hereafter referred to ssl parameters moreover any model which used the ssl parameters will be referred to as an ssl model all measured water content and conductivity measurements at each pressure step were used for fitting unless there was clear evidence of measurement error to assess for potential measurement error in the laboratory retention experiment error the water content and hydraulic conductivity observations for the same pressure step were plotted on a log log plot and fit with a linear trend line hydraulic conductivity decreases with water content due to less smaller and more tortuous pathways as such the expected trend is linear or concave down if the points trended upward or horizontally with decreasing water content suggesting that the hydraulic conductivity is maintained or increases for decreasing water content the points were removed approximately 7 of observations were removed for cut over peat and moss layers below 15 cm and all moss layers above 15 cm θ r was set to 0 05 and 0 11 respectively values were based on averages from weber et al 2017a measured values of total porosity θs and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were used taylor and price 2015 all observations were weighted equally and hydraulic conductivity was log transformed before fitting to reduce the numerical difference between water content and hydraulic conductivity values caused by different units retc uses marquardt s maximum neighbour a local search method to minimize the weighted least squares objective function the objective function in retc simultaneously minimizes the residual sum of squares error for the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves van genuchten et al 1991 several authors have noted that local search methods may converge on a local minimum which is not the global minimum šimůnek and hopmans 2002 van genuchten et al 1991 it is recommended to use multiple initial estimates of the parameters šimůnek et al 2012 van genuchten et al 1991 as such initial estimates were manually changed to find a reasonable fit based on a higher relative r 2 smaller relative confidence intervals and a lower relative objective function value tables b 1 b 2 confidence intervals for ssl parameters were calculated by retc during the curve fitting process the second method was inverse modelling using hydrus 1d v 4 16 šimůnek et al 2009 to fit the soil hydraulic parameters α n l and m 1 1 n simultaneously to the observed field soil moisture data from taylor and price 2015 similar to retc hydrus uses marquardt s maximum neighbour method to minimize the weighted least squares objective function of the simulated and observed soil moisture šimůnek et al 2009 however the objective function only considers water content and not its relationship with pressure head see šimůnek et al 2009 for more detailed description of the objective function confidence intervals were calculated by hydrus after parameters were estimated inverse modelling was done with data from a transient field experiment and hereafter the parameters so derived will be referred to as tf parameters additionally models that use tf parameters will be referred to as tf models observation nodes were set at depths corresponding to tdr locations in the field a 20 day subset between hour 800 and 1280 of the observation period was selected for the calibration period between hour 800 and 1280 of the observation period was selected for the calibration period to be used for inverse modelling the model domain as described below was used layers 1 3 in the 1970 profile and layer 1 in the 2006 profile had 480 observations whereas layers 2 and 3 in the 2006 profile had 446 and 30 respectively the calibration period was selected to encompass a large range of soil moisture initial estimates of the fitting parameters were those determined from ssl parameterization the bounds of the parameters space were informed by literature values fig a 1 a 3 in the 1970 profile no water content observations were made in the peat layer so that no soil hydraulic properties could be determined for this layer therefore the parameters of the peat layer for 2006 were used soil hydraulic parameters from the calibration period were then used to simulate soil moisture for the entire 82 day period the values used for θr θs and ks were the same as the ssl model 2 4 model performance several error metrics were calculated to assess whether the ssl or tf parameterization was better at representing the soil moisture observed in the 1970 and 2006 profiles calculations were done using simulated and observed soil moisture for 62 days of the 82 day observation period to exclude the calibration period model performance was assessed using five statistical metrics mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean bias error me nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and modified kling gupta efficiency kge such that 4 mae 1 n x s x o 5 rmse 1 n x s x o 2 6 me x s x o n 7 nse 1 x o x s 2 x o x o 2 8 k g e 1 cov so σ s σ o 1 2 σ s x s σ o x o 1 2 x s x o 1 2 where n is the number of observed and simulated water content pairs and x x and σ are the samples means and standard deviations respectively for the corresponding subscript simulated s and observed o data covso is the covariance between the simulated and the observed mae is a measure of average error magnitude while rmse is a more conservative quantification of error where larger errors have more influence the me indicates whether the simulations tends to over positive or under negative predict the observations and is expressed as in original units lower values of mae rmse and me indicate a better fit the nse is a measures of overall model performance that compares the performance of the simulation to the performance of the mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 kge is a multi objective approach that combines correlation simulated observed mean ratio and variability kling et al 2012 ideal values of nse and kge are unity and have no lower limit simulations with values above 0 7 were considered acceptable the threshold of 0 7 was selected based on what is commonly used in the literature crochemore et al 2015 moriasi et al 2015 for further discussion on the difficulty defining error metrics see gupta et al 2012 all error metrics were computed in r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 with the hydrogof package zambrano bigiarini 2017 a residual plot was created to assess the appropriateness of the unimodal vgm model model performance was only calculated for the validation period 2 5 sensitivity analysis a one at a time sensitivity analysis was done to assess which parameters had the greatest impact on model accuracy by individually increasing and decreasing α n and l by 10 steps incremented by log 0 15 0 03 and 0 5 respectively intervals were selected to represent a large portion of the parameter space presented by literature values figs a 1 a 2 a 3 the sensitivity analysis was done on both profiles and fitting methods for all fitting parameters on each layer furthermore a sensitivity analysis on the evaporative boundary condition was done during inverse modelling to assess how a different priestley taylor alpha value would influence parameter estimation the priestly taylor alpha value was increased and decreased by 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 to represent a range of values that have previously been used in bogs humphreys et al 2006 petrone et al 2004 price et al 1998 the tf parameterization was repeated with an alternate set of initial estimates alt to assess how final parameter estimates would change and the impact it would have on the overall model fit the alternate estimates came from the average value of their equivalent depth form weber et al 2017a initial estimates of the 1970 and 2006 peat layers were from the 37 5 cm layer 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation the parameterization using ssl data produced curves that agreed well with the laboratory observations all ssl curves had an r 2 above 0 8 with the exception of the 1970 17 5 layer which had an r 2 of 0 73 with decreasing pressure head the water content decreased sharply in the moss layers whereas the water content in the peat layers decreased gradually fig 2 curves produced from tf data fig 2 do not have comparable points against which to visually judge the fit however the 2 5 and 7 5 cm retention curves from tf model showed that drainage would start at a lower pressure head than the ssl curves similarly the lowest layers in the tf models 1970 17 5 and 2006 12 5 started to drain at a higher pressure head and drained substantially quicker than their ssl model counterpart fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity curves from the tf parameterization were higher than those of the ssl parameterization however the 7 5 and 17 5 cm layers for the 1970 profile decreased sharply around 10 cm of pressure head fig 2 the estimates of the vgm parameters for the 1970 and 2006 ssl and tf model parameters differed table 1 despite both retc and hydrus reporting a good fit during direct curve fitting and inverse modelling respectively the parameter α decreased with depth for both curve fitting methods and profiles table 1 additionally parameterization with tf data yielded α values that had smaller confidence intervals 0 05 cm 1 as such they were well defined ssl values of n were higher in moss layers 1 32 than cut over peat 1 16 whereas from the trend for tf modelling was the opposite the 1970 and 2006 ssl and 2006 tf parameterizations had l values that increased with depth 4 11 to 0 16 no trends were present for the 1970 tf parameters the 2006 and 1970 ssl peat layers and 1970 tf 17 5 layer all had very large l values 5 based on the confidence intervals parameter n was generally well defined for all fitting methods 0 01 0 23 whereas l values fit with the tf data or the lower layers fit with ssl data were poorly defined 5 92 141 79 an exception to the trends presented for the confidence intervals of α and n was the 2006 tf peat layer both of which were poorly defined 3 2 model performance fig 3 depicts simulated and observed soil moisture over the simulated period for the 1970 and 2006 profiles fit with both methods visually the tf model fit better than the ssl model with the poorest fit in the top two layers of each profile notably the peat layer of the 2006 ssl model started to drain hours 1000 1500 yet it did not in the tf simulation the tf simulations visually matched the observed much better however both profiles underestimate soil moisture during the initial period with large soil moisture fluctuations and overestimate during the driest period the mass balance error calculated by hydrus was less than 1 for all simulations within each model the rmse and mae were similar as such there were no large outliers in model table 2 as mentioned earlier the ssl parameters resulted in simulations that poorly matched the observed data the rmse of the tf models was similar to the threshold of probe error a water content of 0 05 the ssl models had large negative me and indicates bias in the model whereas the me of tf models was approximately 0 indicating no bias the poor performance of the ssl models is reflected in low nse and kge although both metrics were below 0 7 the kge is notably higher than the nse conversely the nse and kge scores for the tf models were both above 0 7 visually the residual plots were not randomly distributed fig 4 suggesting that the model may not account for all processes or properties daniel and woods 1980 the 2006 profiles had a distinct peak in the 2 5 cm layer all profiles had a distinct pattern in the residuals which resembles a hysteresis fig 4 the forward simulation for both profiles and fitting methods were most sensitive to changes in α and least sensitive to l fig 6 adjusting α parameters of the upper layers in the ssl models and the 1970 tf model reduced the rmse by up to 0 01 and 0 075 from the original parameterization changes in the parameter l increased or decreased the rmse of the tf forward simulation by less than 0 01 additionally the estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters exhibited little sensitivity to the choice of the priestley taylor alpha within the range of 0 86 1 66 fig 7 changes in α for the 2006 profile for a priestley taylor alpha of 0 96 and 1 66 are likely an artefact of the minimization process during inverse modelling 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of fitting method on parameters based on model performance parameters fitted using empirical curves from laboratory experiments ssl parameters were not able to simulate soil moisture in the field despite good agreement with laboratory curves the majority of observed soil moisture values in all moss layers occurred above the highest moisture measurement used when fitting ssl data in retc fig 5 as such the ssl model under predicted soil moisture which is reflected in the low me and the large number of negative residuals fig 4 it is possible that the laboratory parameters poorly represent field conditions because a laboratory sample may drain beyond the first pressure step of hysteretic effects on soil moisture when preparing the sample for the experiment such that the soil moisture is no longer on the main drying curve for the first pressure step but between the main drying and wetting curve on a scanning curve a similar discrepancy was proposed by schelle et al 2013 when comparing retention curves from evaporation experiments and suction plates in sandy soils when laboratory observations of the θ ψ curve are overlain on θ ψ curve from the field where pressure head is estimated from water table depth generally laboratory observations align with the wetting scanning curves of the estimated field retention curve fig 5 this suggests that the modified retention disk method captured a scanning curve far removed from the main drying curve it would not be unreasonable to assume similar limitations using pressure cells e g moore et al 2015 although pressure head in the field was not measured it can be estimated from the water table level as a linear 1 1 decrease with height above the water table pressure head may deviate from the 1 1 equilibrium line by increasing and decreasing during precipitation and evaporation respectively during precipitation field observations which represent wetting would shift towards that the observed laboratory observation whereas those representing drying would further deviate from laboratory observations alternatively the samples taken may not be representative of field conditions due to the small sample size however other studies that parameterized α using data from the original and modified retention disk experiment had vgm parameter estimates similar to this study gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter and price 2015 price et al 2008 price and whittington 2010 the α parameter consistently decreased with depth for both fitting methods and profiles which matches virtually all literature trends fig a 1 moore et al 2015 although α is strictly a fitting parameter peters et al 2011 it approximates the inverse of the air entry pressure larger values result in drainage occurring at pressures closer to zero decomposition and compression decreases the number of large pores and increase bulk density which has been found to be inversely related to α as such a smaller α value is expected with depth especially in the older cutover peat because it is highly decomposed and much denser bloemen 1983 moore et al 2015 sherwood et al 2013 weiss et al 1998 additionally the α parameter was notably different depending on the method of parameterization the α values from ssl parameterization were higher than those from tf parameterization because soil moisture observations in the ssl experiment were lower than those of tf experiment at equivalent pressure head fig 5 however they were well within the range of literature values fig a 1 this is due largely to the difference in water content at equivalent pressure head in the data used for parameterization between the two methods fig 5 if other steady state experiments reported in the literature were also subject to large drainage after saturation and before the experiment began α may be overestimated because the curve was fit to observations akin to a scanning curve rather than the main drying curve although the parameter estimations were not unreasonable the ssl α values had large confidence intervals table 1 conversely the moisture content during the tf calibration period included saturation for all layers with the exception of 1970 2 5 which would suggest that α should be more reliable the confidence intervals for all tf layers were very small suggesting that the parameters are more identifiable the 2006 tf peat layer 12 5 cm layer was the exception this is most likely due to the extremely narrow range of soil moisture that it experienced the water table was on average 14 and 17 cm below the surface with a standard deviation of 6 7 and 8 9 cm for the 1970 and 2006 plots respectively as such the large me for ssl models is most likely due to drainage occurring close to zero pressure head the superior fit to tf experiments for the parameter α was further demonstrated during rain events fig 3 the simulated soil moisture in the tf models is generally maintained after a precipitation event and matches the observed drying whereas the simulation with ssl derived parameters shows ad immediate desaturation after precipitation stops fig 3 the quick drainage associated with α after precipitation in the ssl models is likely what contributes to the low me values model fit has been found to be most sensitive to α in this study fig 6 and others kettridge et al 2016 weiss et al 1998 as such accurate characterization of α is important unlike α the parameter n was very well defined for the ssl models fig 6 this is most likely due to the majority of the laboratory observations being within the moisture range where drainage occurs assuming that the ssl experiment captured a scanning curve rather than the main drying curve there is reason to believe that the parameter n should still be reasonably accurate implementations of models that include hysteresis assume that n is equal for the wetting and drying branch of the retention curve šimůnek et al 2009 thus it is reasonable to extend the assumption of n being the same during wetting and drying conditions to include scanning curves as well the appropriate rate of drainage is reflected in the high r 2 for the retc models 0 9 and 0 82 for 1970 and 2006 respectively the parameter n is associated with the range of the pore size distribution larger values represent a narrower pore size distribution which results in rapid drainage after air entry peters et al 2011 literature values for n from direct curve fitting and inverse modelling generally decreased with depth values from both ssl parameterizations were consistent with the trends fig a 1 despite the tf model fitting well and values within range of the literature it produced n values that were inconsistent with depth likely due to an insufficient soil moisture range during calibration the function of the parameter l in the vgm is to control how quickly hydraulic conductivity decreases with pressure beyond air entry mualem 1976 peters et al 2011 where negative values result in a more gradual decrease in hydraulic conductivity gnatowski et al 2010 the parameter l is related to pore connectivity and tortuosity under unsaturated conditions but is widely believed to have no meaning ghanbarian et al 2013 peters et al 2011 schaap and leij 2000 the forward simulations were not sensitive to changes in l especially in lower layers which was generally a poorly defined parameter fig 6 in particular ssl estimates for 1970 and 2006 peat layers and the 17 5 cm layer form the 1970 profile were far beyond what has previously been reported in the literature 5 to 5 fig a 1 it is likely that the range of measurements does not contain the required information to accurately predict l additionally the majority of literature values from direct curve fitting were all negative fig a 3 notably foundational work done by price et al 2008 and mccarter and price 2014 dettmann et al 2014 suggests that l is not a sensitive parameter during saturated conditions where the pressure head of a sphagnum moss profile is above 200 cm the range of pressure head experienced during the calibration period was greater than the 200 cm threshold which supports the idea that inadequate information was available as such l should simply be considered a fitting parameter regardless if it is positive or negative given its low sensitivity it would be reasonable to fix l to reduce complexity of direct curve fitting or inverse modelling 4 2 did the model actually fit the parameters fit with data from an ssl experiment were not able to simulate the observed soil moisture well at any depth fig 3 furthermore the rmse mae and me of each ssl model is approximately the same within each profile which suggests that the simulation of soil moisture was poorly predicted systematically table 2 as in the study by schwärzel et al 2006a the ssl models under predict soil moisture which is most likely a consequence of the high α parameter values furthermore α was found to be a sensitive parameter in this study and by weiss et al 1998 discussion by schelle et al 2013 and golubev 2018 suggest that samples may not be fully saturated for all steady state laboratory experiments tension disk and pressure cell because drainage may occur before the sample is in the measurement device this is supported by the difference between α estimates fit to steady state and transient experiments fig a 1 the rmse of the tf models matched the error threshold of the tdr probes 0 05 which was substantially better than the ssl models inverse modelling of field lysimeter experiments conducted by schwärzel et al 2006a also estimated parameters that were better able to simulate field observations of soil moisture than parameters from laboratory derived retention curves their parameters from inverse modelling of transient laboratory tl evaporation experiments also performed substantially better than steady state experiments tf tl ssl schwärzel et al 2006a the tf model used here did not perform well during rain events e g hours 1400 1600 and under predicted soil moisture although schwärzel et al 2006b had the opposite problem soil moisture was over estimated it was possible that this could be due to the difference in estimates of α which reflects an air entry pressure that is not representative of wetting and drying processes parameters from inverse modelling were also unable to describe soil moisture beyond the calibration range schwärzel et al 2006a reported similar difficulties predicting beyond the calibration the observed shortfalls may be a result of missing soil hydraulic processes or properties as is suggested by non random distribution of the residuals distinct patterns were observed fig 4 the tf simulation over estimate moisture in the dry range and under estimated moisture near saturation furthermore the distribution of points where soil moisture was over estimated below the dashed line appeared to follow a looped pattern in a clockwise direction fig 4 additional process and properties such as hysteresis and dual porosity respectively may need to be accounted for hayward and clymo 1982 have remarked on the dramatic effect that hysteresis can have on water content since then several authors have observed it when building retention curves from laboratory experiments da silva et al 1993 londra 2010 mccarter and price 2014 naasz et al 2005 price and whittington 2010 likewise taylor and price 2015 observed hysteresis with the dataset used for this study when plotting soil moisture in the top 5 cm against water table depth if hysteresis is a process that is not accounted for within the calibration period then α would represent an aggregate of the wetting and drying cycles rather than the actual main drying curve hayward and clymo 1982 highlight two major pore systems the matrix created by overlapping branches and the pores of individual cells as such the assumption of unimodality of the pore size distribution in the vgm would be violated as suggested by price et al 2008 dettmann et al 2014 found evidence of a second pore domain at 400 cm of pressure which coincides with the range of pressures at which hyaline cells drain lewis 1988 pressures observed in this study are insufficient to drain hyaline cells which would suggest a single porosity model should suffice alternatively weber et al 2017b found evidence of a triple porosity model where the first pore domain was encompassed by a pressure head between 0 and 10 cm the non normal distribution of the residual from the 2006 tf model notably the 2 5 cm layer could suggest that a dual porosity model may better describe the soil water retention curve fig 4 further investigation is required the methods used for the ssl experiment did not produce a dataset which was granular enough to assess bimodality near saturation 4 3 limitations and error parameterization from ssl and tf modeling experiments can be restricted by a limited observation range to which they were fit compromising realism and accuracy šimůnek et al 2009 van genuchten et al 1991 the narrow range of θ ψ observation was a major limitation to confidently estimating parameters in this study aside from potential methodological errors in steady state laboratory experiments the pressure head is limited to a range where moss is not stressed hayward and clymo 1982 a restricted pressure head range is not an issue for managed systems e g sphagnum fibre farming however it would be important for predictions where the pressure head range is unknown e g drought similarly curve fitting in the lower layers of the tf models suffered from being fit to a small range of observations and was reflected in the increasing magnitude of the confidence intervals with depth laboratory evaporation experiments may be best suited to build retention curves because large portions dettmann et al 2014 or the entire moisture range can be captured schelle et al 2013 weber et al 2017b curve fitting using retc and hydrus is limited by the estimation algorithm it is recommended that several initial conditions are used to properly estimate parameters šimůnek et al 2009 van genuchten et al 1991 a thorough exploration of the impact of initial conditions was not done due to the complexity associated with estimating parameters for a multi layered system daniel and woods 1980 recommend when using a local solver initial parameter estimates should approximate the real value as such different initial conditions based on newly and previously estimated parameters were compared two sets of initial estimates were assessed the first were the parameter estimates from retc the second were from inverse modelling of evaporation experiments alt by weber et al 2017b estimates of α remained similar between the alt and tf parameterizations however alt values had more uncertainty table 1 additionally the estimates of n from the alt model were more realistic and decreased with depth as is expected with an increase in bulk density moore et al 2015 sherwood et al 2013 the largest difference was in the pore connectivity parameter l alt parameters were all positive and had a much smaller range notably the 1970 profile despite the alt parameters being more reasonable than the tf parameters the confidence intervals were equally large the mae me rmse nse and kge of the 2006 alt model were virtually identical to the 2006 tf model alternatively the error metrics of the 1970 alt model showed that it performed worse than 1970 tf model table 2 multiple sets of parameter sets which result in an acceptable fit supports the idea that the model is ill posed as is suggested by šimůnek et al 2009 when simultaneously fitting 15 parameters in the absence of additional evidence several parameter sets may produce an acceptable prediction beven 2006 1993 as such model predictions would be acceptable within the calibrated range using global search methods would better be able to explore the parameter space e g weber et al 2017a b 5 conclusion the objective of this study was to determine which method led to a parameter set which most accurately described the soil moisture dynamics at the field scale when determined by direct curve fitting to ssl experiments or inverse modelling to tf observations ssl parameters consistently underestimated soil moisture in the field despite being in agreement with literature values parameters estimated using inverse modelling were adequately able to describe field scale soil moisture however the fit was generally poor when simulated soil moisture exceeded the observed range used for calibration as such the use of parameters determined with tf simulations would be more useful for predicting soil moisture in managed peatlands where extreme conditions are not allowed to go beyond the calibration such as sphagnum fibre farming in order to predict soil moisture in a more robust manner a different model that accounts for other processes and properties may be required the non random distribution of the residuals alludes to other processes and properties that should be considered such as hysteresis and multiple pore domains parameterization of peatland soil water retention with the goal of predicting soil moisture under a large variety of condition should be done with deliberate laboratory or field evaporation experiments where a large range of soil moisture can be observed however if the intended use of the model is for managing sphagnum fibre farming operations or other scenarios where the water table is maintained near the surface a limited calibration like the one used in this study is acceptable james elliott and jonathan price conceptualized

5838,growing sphagnum moss for peatland restoration and fibre farming requires the proper moisture regime be maintained thus there is a desire to optimize growth by creating ideal hydrological conditions however it is uncertain which parameterization method is most suitable to describe field scale processes and which soil water retention model and hydraulic conductivity curve approach is the most acceptable to use parameterizations of the van genuchten mualem vgm equation were done using retc curve fitting to direct measurements of the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves and hydrus 1d inverse modelling to field observations of soil moisture the acceptability of each parameterization was tested by comparing soil moisture estimates based on forward simulations to observed soil moisture in two regenerated moss profiles established in 1970 and 2006 cases respectively the transient field model simulated soil moisture well and had an rmse of 0 05 and 0 06 for 1970 and 2006 respectively the most error occurred during the wettest and driest periods of the simulations simulated soil moisture was consistently drier than the observed soil moisture in the steady state laboratory simulation and had markedly higher rmse 0 14 and 0 27 for the 1970 and 2006 profiles respectively the estimate of the vgm α parameter an approximately the inverse of the air entry pressure fit to direct measurements of the retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves was an order of magnitude higher than that fit to field observation the results of the simulation suggest that inverse modelling to field soil moisture should be used to estimate vgm parameters to more accurately represent field scale soil moisture dynamics keywords hydrus retc sphagnum unsaturated properties curve fitting inverse modelling 1 introduction unsaturated zone hydrological process in peat and sphagnum mosses have become a topic of increased interest over the past two decades because of their importance to horticultural applications da silva et al 1993 climate change resilience moore and waddington 2015 restoration mccarter and price 2015 and carbon dynamics plant growth strack and price 2010 unsaturated zone properties control the ability of a porous media to retain and conduct water under negative pressure head which is dictated by morphology of the pore network and water distribution within it jerauld and salter 1990 the wettability and saturation history of the media man and jing 1999 and the pore size distribution of the media mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 sphagnum mosses are the dominant species in many peatlands and the pore network is the space between overlapping leaves and branches hayward and clymo 1982 sphagnum mosses are bryophytes that have no roots which rely on water conveyed through the pore network under capillary force thus understanding unsaturated process and properties is important to understand how peatlands develop function and persist recently sphagnum fibre farming is being considered as an alternate management plan to restoring peatlands after they have been disturbed for peat harvesting brown et al 2017 or agriculture gaudig et al 2018 the objective of fibre farming is to maximize sphagnum biomass accumulation by optimizing water availability which can be done with a variety of irrigation systems e g brown et al 2017 gaudig et al 2018 the optimum water content for sphagnum moss is available to maximize carbon uptake through photosynthesis flanagan 1996 silvola 1990 but not restrict gas exchange silvola 1990 furthermore water table stability of the peatland is an important factor in moss photosynthesis and biomass production brown et al 2017 pouliot et al 2015 hydrological models are a useful tool for assessing the scalability of an operation and how moss growth and species composition may change the water demand and irrigation strategies simulations which use unsaturated hydrological models can be used to assess water availability the models are defined by the relationships between pressure head ψ soil moisture θ and hydraulic conductivity k for organic soils retention curves θ ψ and hydraulic conductivity curves k ψ have typically been derived by parameterizing soil hydraulic property functions to laboratory observations da silva et al 1993 gnatowski et al 2002 price et al 2008 parameters describing soil hydraulic properties have usually been used to compare the retention capacity of different soils gnatowski et al 2010 moore et al 2015 or assess the functional differences of mosses gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter and price 2014 furthermore hydrological models have also been used to characterize unsaturated zone contaminant transport gharedaghloo et al 2018 simhayov et al 2018 plant stress moore and waddington 2015 and evaporation from peatlands dixon et al 2017 very little work has been done to predict soil hydraulic parameters which describe field scale soil moisture schwärzel et al 2006a 2006b the use of soil water characteristic and hydraulic conductivity curves in models requires that a function is fit to the θ ψ and k ψ observations traditionally multi step outflow experiments using pressure cells e g weiss et al 1998 were only able to generate the data to fit the retention curve more recently the tension disk method was developed which allows for the direct observation of the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves price et al 2008 numerous studies have measured the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves but have not used the data for curve fitting e g goetz and price 2015 mccarter and price 2015 an alternative approach to directly fitting the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves is inverse modelling which is the process of iteratively solving richards equation to best match transient observations of soil moisture and or pressure head vrugt et al 2008 weber et al 2017a inverse modelling for organic soils has been done in the laboratory using multi step outflow gnatowski et al 2010 evaporation weber et al 2017a and unsteady state displacement experiments gharedaghloo and price 2019 additionally inverse modelling can be done using observations from field experiments schwärzel et al 2006a 2006b parameters determined using direct curve fitting differed from those determined with inverse modelling the modelled curve suggests that drainage occurs closer to 0 cm of pressure schwärzel et al 2006a these differences will be discussed later studies with mineral soils have found that parameterization with inverse modelling produced more accurate retention curves than parameters fit with direct curve fitting lier 2019 morvannou et al 2013 despite the large volume of work done to characterize unsaturated properties in the laboratory virtually no attempts have been made to assess their validity in field conditions e g schwärzel et al 2006b furthermore several laboratory measurement methods have been presented and the evidence suggests that they can result in different parameter estimates schelle et al 2013 and that there can be large discrepancies in their performance in a field setting schwärzel et al 2006b an improved understanding of unsaturated properties can be gained by assessing how different parameter fitting methods can simulate water retention and transport in a soil column the intent of this study is to determine the vgm parameters that accurately describe soil moisture dynamics in the field therefore the objectives are a to determine vgm parameters for regenerated sphagnum moss profiles using direct curve fitting and inverse modelling and b assess how effective each parameter set is at simulating soil moisture during the summer field season using a one dimensional hydraulic model 2 methods 2 1 study site and sample preparation data for this study were originally collected and published by taylor and price 2015 for a full description of methods consult the original publication the study site was a cutover peatland located south of shippagan new brunswick 47 40 n 64 43 w and it is characterized by alternating raised baulks and lowered trenches as a result of traditional block cut peat harvesting since abandonment in 1970 sphagnum mosses spontaneously recolonized the trenches additionally the site was selected for research in sphagnum fibre farming beginning in 2004 plots of vegetation were removed and replanted with sphagnum mosses every two years until 2010 landry and rochefort 2009 plot names indicate the year of abandonment 1970 or the year where sphagnum was planted the profile at each plot was old cut over peat overlain by moss layers of varying thickness reflecting the time since moss re establishment taylor and price 2015 to measure soil moisture triplicate cs605 tdr probes were installed at depths of 2 5 7 5 12 5 and 17 5 cm and 2 5 7 5 and 12 5 cm for the 2006 and 1970 c plots respectively soil moisture was measured hourly with the exception of tdrs installed at 12 5 and 17 5 cm below the surface in the 2006 profile which were manually measured several times a week taylor and price 2015 calibration of the tdrs was done gravimetrically for more information see taylor and price 2015 for a full description of the calibration process meteorological soil moisture and water table data were collected hourly at the 1970 c and 2006 plots although the 2010 plot was instrumented the moss layer was not thick enough to be instrumented or adequately sampled thus it was not used in this study several experimental plots were established in regions with moss growth starting in 1970 taylor and price 2015 since only the 1970 c plot was instrumented it will be referred to as 1970 in this study samples of sphagnum moss n 2 per profile and cut over peat n 1 per profile were taken from the top 10 cm the base of the moss profile and the cut over peat of each plot depths represent the midpoint of samples that had a height of 5 cm fig 1 soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity were determined in the laboratory taylor and price 2015 using the modified tension disk method described by mccarter et al 2017 following that bulk density porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured taylor and price 2015 the depth of samples and tdr probes will define the layers used in later model domains 2 2 model setup hydrus 1d was used to numerically simulate soil moisture dynamics in the 2006 and 1970 plots for an 82 day period between may and august 2013 using the parameters estimated from two different techniques described later the model domains were 0 58 and 0 47 m tall and contained three and four layers for the 2006 and 1970 plots respectively fig 1 node spacing was 0 005 m a variable pressure head was defined as the lower boundary condition typically the vertical hydraulic gradient is very low in northern bogs reeve et al 2000 as such the lower boundary was determined from observed water table measurements observed precipitation and estimated potential evaporation from taylor and price 2015 were used to characterize the atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer at the top of the domain potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the priestley taylor method the priestley taylor alpha value was set to 1 26 as defined by priestley and taylor 1972 and previously used in peatlands by petrone et al 2008 and price 1992 the soil water atmospheric vapour equilibrium hcrita defines the pressure head at which evaporation capacity is exceeded evaporation becomes limited when pressure head of the top node reaches hcrita actual evaporation will be less than potential evaporation šimůnek et al 2009 numerically hcrita is used to increase model stability it is a lower bound for pressure head to prevent it from changing dramatically when there are small changes in the water content near residual an hcrita of 10 000 cm was used it is the pressure head at which thompson and waddington 2008 and goetz and price 2015 suggest soil vapour equilibrium occurs in a cut over bog at mid day during the summer and in a sphagnum profile when the water table is 10 cm below the surface respectively initial soil moisture conditions were determined by linearly interpolating between tdr observations and water table a spin up period was not needed because the initial conditions were well defined 2 3 determination of soil hydraulic parameters the van genuchten mualem equation vgm is the most widely used soil hydraulic property model within peatland literature gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter et al 2017 mccarter and price 2014 moore and waddington 2015 price et al 2008 price and whittington 2010 the vgm model is defined as 1 s e 1 1 α ψ n m 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 3 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation ψ is the pressure head l ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and θ θr and θs cm3 cm 3 are the water content residual water content and saturated water content respectively the parameters α l 1 n and l are fitting parameters that are related to the inverse of the approximate air entry pressure width of the pore size distribution and the pore connectivity respectively the parameter m is calculated as 1 1 n the vgm parameters α n l and m 1 1 n were determined using two methods the first was using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 based on the hydraulic conductivity and retention data measured by taylor and price 2015 in steady state laboratory experiments for each layer hereafter referred to ssl parameters moreover any model which used the ssl parameters will be referred to as an ssl model all measured water content and conductivity measurements at each pressure step were used for fitting unless there was clear evidence of measurement error to assess for potential measurement error in the laboratory retention experiment error the water content and hydraulic conductivity observations for the same pressure step were plotted on a log log plot and fit with a linear trend line hydraulic conductivity decreases with water content due to less smaller and more tortuous pathways as such the expected trend is linear or concave down if the points trended upward or horizontally with decreasing water content suggesting that the hydraulic conductivity is maintained or increases for decreasing water content the points were removed approximately 7 of observations were removed for cut over peat and moss layers below 15 cm and all moss layers above 15 cm θ r was set to 0 05 and 0 11 respectively values were based on averages from weber et al 2017a measured values of total porosity θs and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks were used taylor and price 2015 all observations were weighted equally and hydraulic conductivity was log transformed before fitting to reduce the numerical difference between water content and hydraulic conductivity values caused by different units retc uses marquardt s maximum neighbour a local search method to minimize the weighted least squares objective function the objective function in retc simultaneously minimizes the residual sum of squares error for the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves van genuchten et al 1991 several authors have noted that local search methods may converge on a local minimum which is not the global minimum šimůnek and hopmans 2002 van genuchten et al 1991 it is recommended to use multiple initial estimates of the parameters šimůnek et al 2012 van genuchten et al 1991 as such initial estimates were manually changed to find a reasonable fit based on a higher relative r 2 smaller relative confidence intervals and a lower relative objective function value tables b 1 b 2 confidence intervals for ssl parameters were calculated by retc during the curve fitting process the second method was inverse modelling using hydrus 1d v 4 16 šimůnek et al 2009 to fit the soil hydraulic parameters α n l and m 1 1 n simultaneously to the observed field soil moisture data from taylor and price 2015 similar to retc hydrus uses marquardt s maximum neighbour method to minimize the weighted least squares objective function of the simulated and observed soil moisture šimůnek et al 2009 however the objective function only considers water content and not its relationship with pressure head see šimůnek et al 2009 for more detailed description of the objective function confidence intervals were calculated by hydrus after parameters were estimated inverse modelling was done with data from a transient field experiment and hereafter the parameters so derived will be referred to as tf parameters additionally models that use tf parameters will be referred to as tf models observation nodes were set at depths corresponding to tdr locations in the field a 20 day subset between hour 800 and 1280 of the observation period was selected for the calibration period between hour 800 and 1280 of the observation period was selected for the calibration period to be used for inverse modelling the model domain as described below was used layers 1 3 in the 1970 profile and layer 1 in the 2006 profile had 480 observations whereas layers 2 and 3 in the 2006 profile had 446 and 30 respectively the calibration period was selected to encompass a large range of soil moisture initial estimates of the fitting parameters were those determined from ssl parameterization the bounds of the parameters space were informed by literature values fig a 1 a 3 in the 1970 profile no water content observations were made in the peat layer so that no soil hydraulic properties could be determined for this layer therefore the parameters of the peat layer for 2006 were used soil hydraulic parameters from the calibration period were then used to simulate soil moisture for the entire 82 day period the values used for θr θs and ks were the same as the ssl model 2 4 model performance several error metrics were calculated to assess whether the ssl or tf parameterization was better at representing the soil moisture observed in the 1970 and 2006 profiles calculations were done using simulated and observed soil moisture for 62 days of the 82 day observation period to exclude the calibration period model performance was assessed using five statistical metrics mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse mean bias error me nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and modified kling gupta efficiency kge such that 4 mae 1 n x s x o 5 rmse 1 n x s x o 2 6 me x s x o n 7 nse 1 x o x s 2 x o x o 2 8 k g e 1 cov so σ s σ o 1 2 σ s x s σ o x o 1 2 x s x o 1 2 where n is the number of observed and simulated water content pairs and x x and σ are the samples means and standard deviations respectively for the corresponding subscript simulated s and observed o data covso is the covariance between the simulated and the observed mae is a measure of average error magnitude while rmse is a more conservative quantification of error where larger errors have more influence the me indicates whether the simulations tends to over positive or under negative predict the observations and is expressed as in original units lower values of mae rmse and me indicate a better fit the nse is a measures of overall model performance that compares the performance of the simulation to the performance of the mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 kge is a multi objective approach that combines correlation simulated observed mean ratio and variability kling et al 2012 ideal values of nse and kge are unity and have no lower limit simulations with values above 0 7 were considered acceptable the threshold of 0 7 was selected based on what is commonly used in the literature crochemore et al 2015 moriasi et al 2015 for further discussion on the difficulty defining error metrics see gupta et al 2012 all error metrics were computed in r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 with the hydrogof package zambrano bigiarini 2017 a residual plot was created to assess the appropriateness of the unimodal vgm model model performance was only calculated for the validation period 2 5 sensitivity analysis a one at a time sensitivity analysis was done to assess which parameters had the greatest impact on model accuracy by individually increasing and decreasing α n and l by 10 steps incremented by log 0 15 0 03 and 0 5 respectively intervals were selected to represent a large portion of the parameter space presented by literature values figs a 1 a 2 a 3 the sensitivity analysis was done on both profiles and fitting methods for all fitting parameters on each layer furthermore a sensitivity analysis on the evaporative boundary condition was done during inverse modelling to assess how a different priestley taylor alpha value would influence parameter estimation the priestly taylor alpha value was increased and decreased by 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 to represent a range of values that have previously been used in bogs humphreys et al 2006 petrone et al 2004 price et al 1998 the tf parameterization was repeated with an alternate set of initial estimates alt to assess how final parameter estimates would change and the impact it would have on the overall model fit the alternate estimates came from the average value of their equivalent depth form weber et al 2017a initial estimates of the 1970 and 2006 peat layers were from the 37 5 cm layer 3 results 3 1 parameter estimation the parameterization using ssl data produced curves that agreed well with the laboratory observations all ssl curves had an r 2 above 0 8 with the exception of the 1970 17 5 layer which had an r 2 of 0 73 with decreasing pressure head the water content decreased sharply in the moss layers whereas the water content in the peat layers decreased gradually fig 2 curves produced from tf data fig 2 do not have comparable points against which to visually judge the fit however the 2 5 and 7 5 cm retention curves from tf model showed that drainage would start at a lower pressure head than the ssl curves similarly the lowest layers in the tf models 1970 17 5 and 2006 12 5 started to drain at a higher pressure head and drained substantially quicker than their ssl model counterpart fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity curves from the tf parameterization were higher than those of the ssl parameterization however the 7 5 and 17 5 cm layers for the 1970 profile decreased sharply around 10 cm of pressure head fig 2 the estimates of the vgm parameters for the 1970 and 2006 ssl and tf model parameters differed table 1 despite both retc and hydrus reporting a good fit during direct curve fitting and inverse modelling respectively the parameter α decreased with depth for both curve fitting methods and profiles table 1 additionally parameterization with tf data yielded α values that had smaller confidence intervals 0 05 cm 1 as such they were well defined ssl values of n were higher in moss layers 1 32 than cut over peat 1 16 whereas from the trend for tf modelling was the opposite the 1970 and 2006 ssl and 2006 tf parameterizations had l values that increased with depth 4 11 to 0 16 no trends were present for the 1970 tf parameters the 2006 and 1970 ssl peat layers and 1970 tf 17 5 layer all had very large l values 5 based on the confidence intervals parameter n was generally well defined for all fitting methods 0 01 0 23 whereas l values fit with the tf data or the lower layers fit with ssl data were poorly defined 5 92 141 79 an exception to the trends presented for the confidence intervals of α and n was the 2006 tf peat layer both of which were poorly defined 3 2 model performance fig 3 depicts simulated and observed soil moisture over the simulated period for the 1970 and 2006 profiles fit with both methods visually the tf model fit better than the ssl model with the poorest fit in the top two layers of each profile notably the peat layer of the 2006 ssl model started to drain hours 1000 1500 yet it did not in the tf simulation the tf simulations visually matched the observed much better however both profiles underestimate soil moisture during the initial period with large soil moisture fluctuations and overestimate during the driest period the mass balance error calculated by hydrus was less than 1 for all simulations within each model the rmse and mae were similar as such there were no large outliers in model table 2 as mentioned earlier the ssl parameters resulted in simulations that poorly matched the observed data the rmse of the tf models was similar to the threshold of probe error a water content of 0 05 the ssl models had large negative me and indicates bias in the model whereas the me of tf models was approximately 0 indicating no bias the poor performance of the ssl models is reflected in low nse and kge although both metrics were below 0 7 the kge is notably higher than the nse conversely the nse and kge scores for the tf models were both above 0 7 visually the residual plots were not randomly distributed fig 4 suggesting that the model may not account for all processes or properties daniel and woods 1980 the 2006 profiles had a distinct peak in the 2 5 cm layer all profiles had a distinct pattern in the residuals which resembles a hysteresis fig 4 the forward simulation for both profiles and fitting methods were most sensitive to changes in α and least sensitive to l fig 6 adjusting α parameters of the upper layers in the ssl models and the 1970 tf model reduced the rmse by up to 0 01 and 0 075 from the original parameterization changes in the parameter l increased or decreased the rmse of the tf forward simulation by less than 0 01 additionally the estimates of the soil hydraulic parameters exhibited little sensitivity to the choice of the priestley taylor alpha within the range of 0 86 1 66 fig 7 changes in α for the 2006 profile for a priestley taylor alpha of 0 96 and 1 66 are likely an artefact of the minimization process during inverse modelling 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of fitting method on parameters based on model performance parameters fitted using empirical curves from laboratory experiments ssl parameters were not able to simulate soil moisture in the field despite good agreement with laboratory curves the majority of observed soil moisture values in all moss layers occurred above the highest moisture measurement used when fitting ssl data in retc fig 5 as such the ssl model under predicted soil moisture which is reflected in the low me and the large number of negative residuals fig 4 it is possible that the laboratory parameters poorly represent field conditions because a laboratory sample may drain beyond the first pressure step of hysteretic effects on soil moisture when preparing the sample for the experiment such that the soil moisture is no longer on the main drying curve for the first pressure step but between the main drying and wetting curve on a scanning curve a similar discrepancy was proposed by schelle et al 2013 when comparing retention curves from evaporation experiments and suction plates in sandy soils when laboratory observations of the θ ψ curve are overlain on θ ψ curve from the field where pressure head is estimated from water table depth generally laboratory observations align with the wetting scanning curves of the estimated field retention curve fig 5 this suggests that the modified retention disk method captured a scanning curve far removed from the main drying curve it would not be unreasonable to assume similar limitations using pressure cells e g moore et al 2015 although pressure head in the field was not measured it can be estimated from the water table level as a linear 1 1 decrease with height above the water table pressure head may deviate from the 1 1 equilibrium line by increasing and decreasing during precipitation and evaporation respectively during precipitation field observations which represent wetting would shift towards that the observed laboratory observation whereas those representing drying would further deviate from laboratory observations alternatively the samples taken may not be representative of field conditions due to the small sample size however other studies that parameterized α using data from the original and modified retention disk experiment had vgm parameter estimates similar to this study gauthier et al 2018 golubev and whittington 2018 mccarter and price 2015 price et al 2008 price and whittington 2010 the α parameter consistently decreased with depth for both fitting methods and profiles which matches virtually all literature trends fig a 1 moore et al 2015 although α is strictly a fitting parameter peters et al 2011 it approximates the inverse of the air entry pressure larger values result in drainage occurring at pressures closer to zero decomposition and compression decreases the number of large pores and increase bulk density which has been found to be inversely related to α as such a smaller α value is expected with depth especially in the older cutover peat because it is highly decomposed and much denser bloemen 1983 moore et al 2015 sherwood et al 2013 weiss et al 1998 additionally the α parameter was notably different depending on the method of parameterization the α values from ssl parameterization were higher than those from tf parameterization because soil moisture observations in the ssl experiment were lower than those of tf experiment at equivalent pressure head fig 5 however they were well within the range of literature values fig a 1 this is due largely to the difference in water content at equivalent pressure head in the data used for parameterization between the two methods fig 5 if other steady state experiments reported in the literature were also subject to large drainage after saturation and before the experiment began α may be overestimated because the curve was fit to observations akin to a scanning curve rather than the main drying curve although the parameter estimations were not unreasonable the ssl α values had large confidence intervals table 1 conversely the moisture content during the tf calibration period included saturation for all layers with the exception of 1970 2 5 which would suggest that α should be more reliable the confidence intervals for all tf layers were very small suggesting that the parameters are more identifiable the 2006 tf peat layer 12 5 cm layer was the exception this is most likely due to the extremely narrow range of soil moisture that it experienced the water table was on average 14 and 17 cm below the surface with a standard deviation of 6 7 and 8 9 cm for the 1970 and 2006 plots respectively as such the large me for ssl models is most likely due to drainage occurring close to zero pressure head the superior fit to tf experiments for the parameter α was further demonstrated during rain events fig 3 the simulated soil moisture in the tf models is generally maintained after a precipitation event and matches the observed drying whereas the simulation with ssl derived parameters shows ad immediate desaturation after precipitation stops fig 3 the quick drainage associated with α after precipitation in the ssl models is likely what contributes to the low me values model fit has been found to be most sensitive to α in this study fig 6 and others kettridge et al 2016 weiss et al 1998 as such accurate characterization of α is important unlike α the parameter n was very well defined for the ssl models fig 6 this is most likely due to the majority of the laboratory observations being within the moisture range where drainage occurs assuming that the ssl experiment captured a scanning curve rather than the main drying curve there is reason to believe that the parameter n should still be reasonably accurate implementations of models that include hysteresis assume that n is equal for the wetting and drying branch of the retention curve šimůnek et al 2009 thus it is reasonable to extend the assumption of n being the same during wetting and drying conditions to include scanning curves as well the appropriate rate of drainage is reflected in the high r 2 for the retc models 0 9 and 0 82 for 1970 and 2006 respectively the parameter n is associated with the range of the pore size distribution larger values represent a narrower pore size distribution which results in rapid drainage after air entry peters et al 2011 literature values for n from direct curve fitting and inverse modelling generally decreased with depth values from both ssl parameterizations were consistent with the trends fig a 1 despite the tf model fitting well and values within range of the literature it produced n values that were inconsistent with depth likely due to an insufficient soil moisture range during calibration the function of the parameter l in the vgm is to control how quickly hydraulic conductivity decreases with pressure beyond air entry mualem 1976 peters et al 2011 where negative values result in a more gradual decrease in hydraulic conductivity gnatowski et al 2010 the parameter l is related to pore connectivity and tortuosity under unsaturated conditions but is widely believed to have no meaning ghanbarian et al 2013 peters et al 2011 schaap and leij 2000 the forward simulations were not sensitive to changes in l especially in lower layers which was generally a poorly defined parameter fig 6 in particular ssl estimates for 1970 and 2006 peat layers and the 17 5 cm layer form the 1970 profile were far beyond what has previously been reported in the literature 5 to 5 fig a 1 it is likely that the range of measurements does not contain the required information to accurately predict l additionally the majority of literature values from direct curve fitting were all negative fig a 3 notably foundational work done by price et al 2008 and mccarter and price 2014 dettmann et al 2014 suggests that l is not a sensitive parameter during saturated conditions where the pressure head of a sphagnum moss profile is above 200 cm the range of pressure head experienced during the calibration period was greater than the 200 cm threshold which supports the idea that inadequate information was available as such l should simply be considered a fitting parameter regardless if it is positive or negative given its low sensitivity it would be reasonable to fix l to reduce complexity of direct curve fitting or inverse modelling 4 2 did the model actually fit the parameters fit with data from an ssl experiment were not able to simulate the observed soil moisture well at any depth fig 3 furthermore the rmse mae and me of each ssl model is approximately the same within each profile which suggests that the simulation of soil moisture was poorly predicted systematically table 2 as in the study by schwärzel et al 2006a the ssl models under predict soil moisture which is most likely a consequence of the high α parameter values furthermore α was found to be a sensitive parameter in this study and by weiss et al 1998 discussion by schelle et al 2013 and golubev 2018 suggest that samples may not be fully saturated for all steady state laboratory experiments tension disk and pressure cell because drainage may occur before the sample is in the measurement device this is supported by the difference between α estimates fit to steady state and transient experiments fig a 1 the rmse of the tf models matched the error threshold of the tdr probes 0 05 which was substantially better than the ssl models inverse modelling of field lysimeter experiments conducted by schwärzel et al 2006a also estimated parameters that were better able to simulate field observations of soil moisture than parameters from laboratory derived retention curves their parameters from inverse modelling of transient laboratory tl evaporation experiments also performed substantially better than steady state experiments tf tl ssl schwärzel et al 2006a the tf model used here did not perform well during rain events e g hours 1400 1600 and under predicted soil moisture although schwärzel et al 2006b had the opposite problem soil moisture was over estimated it was possible that this could be due to the difference in estimates of α which reflects an air entry pressure that is not representative of wetting and drying processes parameters from inverse modelling were also unable to describe soil moisture beyond the calibration range schwärzel et al 2006a reported similar difficulties predicting beyond the calibration the observed shortfalls may be a result of missing soil hydraulic processes or properties as is suggested by non random distribution of the residuals distinct patterns were observed fig 4 the tf simulation over estimate moisture in the dry range and under estimated moisture near saturation furthermore the distribution of points where soil moisture was over estimated below the dashed line appeared to follow a looped pattern in a clockwise direction fig 4 additional process and properties such as hysteresis and dual porosity respectively may need to be accounted for hayward and clymo 1982 have remarked on the dramatic effect that hysteresis can have on water content since then several authors have observed it when building retention curves from laboratory experiments da silva et al 1993 londra 2010 mccarter and price 2014 naasz et al 2005 price and whittington 2010 likewise taylor and price 2015 observed hysteresis with the dataset used for this study when plotting soil moisture in the top 5 cm against water table depth if hysteresis is a process that is not accounted for within the calibration period then α would represent an aggregate of the wetting and drying cycles rather than the actual main drying curve hayward and clymo 1982 highlight two major pore systems the matrix created by overlapping branches and the pores of individual cells as such the assumption of unimodality of the pore size distribution in the vgm would be violated as suggested by price et al 2008 dettmann et al 2014 found evidence of a second pore domain at 400 cm of pressure which coincides with the range of pressures at which hyaline cells drain lewis 1988 pressures observed in this study are insufficient to drain hyaline cells which would suggest a single porosity model should suffice alternatively weber et al 2017b found evidence of a triple porosity model where the first pore domain was encompassed by a pressure head between 0 and 10 cm the non normal distribution of the residual from the 2006 tf model notably the 2 5 cm layer could suggest that a dual porosity model may better describe the soil water retention curve fig 4 further investigation is required the methods used for the ssl experiment did not produce a dataset which was granular enough to assess bimodality near saturation 4 3 limitations and error parameterization from ssl and tf modeling experiments can be restricted by a limited observation range to which they were fit compromising realism and accuracy šimůnek et al 2009 van genuchten et al 1991 the narrow range of θ ψ observation was a major limitation to confidently estimating parameters in this study aside from potential methodological errors in steady state laboratory experiments the pressure head is limited to a range where moss is not stressed hayward and clymo 1982 a restricted pressure head range is not an issue for managed systems e g sphagnum fibre farming however it would be important for predictions where the pressure head range is unknown e g drought similarly curve fitting in the lower layers of the tf models suffered from being fit to a small range of observations and was reflected in the increasing magnitude of the confidence intervals with depth laboratory evaporation experiments may be best suited to build retention curves because large portions dettmann et al 2014 or the entire moisture range can be captured schelle et al 2013 weber et al 2017b curve fitting using retc and hydrus is limited by the estimation algorithm it is recommended that several initial conditions are used to properly estimate parameters šimůnek et al 2009 van genuchten et al 1991 a thorough exploration of the impact of initial conditions was not done due to the complexity associated with estimating parameters for a multi layered system daniel and woods 1980 recommend when using a local solver initial parameter estimates should approximate the real value as such different initial conditions based on newly and previously estimated parameters were compared two sets of initial estimates were assessed the first were the parameter estimates from retc the second were from inverse modelling of evaporation experiments alt by weber et al 2017b estimates of α remained similar between the alt and tf parameterizations however alt values had more uncertainty table 1 additionally the estimates of n from the alt model were more realistic and decreased with depth as is expected with an increase in bulk density moore et al 2015 sherwood et al 2013 the largest difference was in the pore connectivity parameter l alt parameters were all positive and had a much smaller range notably the 1970 profile despite the alt parameters being more reasonable than the tf parameters the confidence intervals were equally large the mae me rmse nse and kge of the 2006 alt model were virtually identical to the 2006 tf model alternatively the error metrics of the 1970 alt model showed that it performed worse than 1970 tf model table 2 multiple sets of parameter sets which result in an acceptable fit supports the idea that the model is ill posed as is suggested by šimůnek et al 2009 when simultaneously fitting 15 parameters in the absence of additional evidence several parameter sets may produce an acceptable prediction beven 2006 1993 as such model predictions would be acceptable within the calibrated range using global search methods would better be able to explore the parameter space e g weber et al 2017a b 5 conclusion the objective of this study was to determine which method led to a parameter set which most accurately described the soil moisture dynamics at the field scale when determined by direct curve fitting to ssl experiments or inverse modelling to tf observations ssl parameters consistently underestimated soil moisture in the field despite being in agreement with literature values parameters estimated using inverse modelling were adequately able to describe field scale soil moisture however the fit was generally poor when simulated soil moisture exceeded the observed range used for calibration as such the use of parameters determined with tf simulations would be more useful for predicting soil moisture in managed peatlands where extreme conditions are not allowed to go beyond the calibration such as sphagnum fibre farming in order to predict soil moisture in a more robust manner a different model that accounts for other processes and properties may be required the non random distribution of the residuals alludes to other processes and properties that should be considered such as hysteresis and multiple pore domains parameterization of peatland soil water retention with the goal of predicting soil moisture under a large variety of condition should be done with deliberate laboratory or field evaporation experiments where a large range of soil moisture can be observed however if the intended use of the model is for managing sphagnum fibre farming operations or other scenarios where the water table is maintained near the surface a limited calibration like the one used in this study is acceptable james elliott and jonathan price conceptualized

5839,repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles were conducted in january 2017 june or november 2017 and february 2018 at 10 observation wells in the kumamoto area japan after the 2016 mw7 0 kumamoto earthquake to evaluate changes in post earthquake subsurface temperature these observation data were compared with pre earthquake temperature data from the same wells measured during 2001 and 2009 2012 by previous studies the observation and analysis of temperature depth profiles are useful for studying groundwater flow but have not been used to determine coseismic changes in groundwater flow this study detected earthquake related changes in groundwater flow using observations and analyses of temperature depth profiles and is the first to report on this type of evaluation of coseismic groundwater flow changes the results indicated a general long term subsurface warming from 2001 to 2018 anomalous decreases and increases occurred in subsurface temperature at the western foot of the aso caldera rim and western takuma plateau respectively the observed temperature decrease can be explained by the post seismic release of mountain groundwater characterized by lower temperatures a type curve match analysis indicated that increasing temperature anomalies were associated with downward groundwater flow these results were consistent with a recently proposed coseismic groundwater drawdown model along new rupture systems although the first measurement was performed nine months after the earthquake the groundwater level change data allowed the temperature measurements to successfully detect anomalies caused by hydrological changes that began immediately after the earthquake however these signals disappeared 14 19 months after the earthquake and were diminished by the original groundwater flow systems that control the local subsurface temperature these results demonstrate the applicability of the observation and analysis of temperature depth profiles to identify post seismic changes in groundwater flow which are required for the management of groundwater resources during earthquake disasters and reconstruction keywords 2016 kumamoto earthquake post seismic groundwater flow change subsurface warming temperature depth profile type curve match analysis 1 introduction subsurface temperatures reflect the effects of heat conduction via terrestrial heat flow and heat advection due to groundwater flow which can be used to illustrate how water flows in an aquifer anderson 2005 in general subsurface temperature data are obtained by measuring the temperature depth profiles of observation wells an analysis of these profiles allows the evaluation of groundwater flux that surrounds these wells bense et al 2017 kurylyk et al 2018 compilations of three dimensional subsurface temperature distributions integrated from temperature depth profiles from multiple observation wells further enables the evaluation of regional groundwater flow patterns across

comparison between pre and post earthquake temperature depth profiles considering previously proposed hydrogeological change models hosono et al 2019 that can demonstrate the issue stated above 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area and 2016 kumamoto earthquake the study area stretches from the western slope of the mountains that form the rim of the aso caldera toward the kumamoto plain in southwestern japan including the shirakawa lowland and takuma plateau fig 1 the shirakawa and kiyama rivers flow through this plain and discharge into the ariake sea the hydrogeological basement in the study area comprises impermeable paleozoic metasedimentary rocks and pliocene quaternary pre aso volcanic rocks the permeable aquifers mainly consist of pyroclastic flow deposits and lava from a large eruption of the aso caldera 90 000 260 000 years ago these deposits were designated as aso 1 aso 2 aso 3 and aso 4 from the oldest eruption event to the most recent hosono et al 2013 additionally togawa lava occurs beneath some areas between aso 1 and aso 2 the geological and hydrogeological settings of the study area are summarized by hosono et al 2013 the aquifers were classified into two systems the first aquifer is unconfined and consists of aso 4 aerial volcanic deposits along with pyroclastic flows and alluvium and the second aquifer is confined and comprises aso 1 to aso 3 pyroclastic volcanic flows the two aquifers are separated by an impermeable aquitard which is not distributed uniformly throughout the study area shimada and ueno 2016 hydrogeological investigations in the kumamoto plain including the study area have reported that groundwater generally flows from northeast to southwest along the regional groundwater flow system ono et al 2013 kagabu et al 2017 okumura et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 the recharge area in the groundwater basin is located in the northeastern mountainous area and plateau and groundwater flows laterally along the topographical gradient mostly discharging within 40 years as springs in lake ezu fig 1 several studies have attempted to identify the spatial distribution of temperature depth profiles at observation wells 1 10 fig 1 taniguchi et al 2003a dong et al 2012 these groundwater wells were classified into three types namely recharge intermediate lateral flow and discharge considering the hydraulic heads wells 8 10 located in the lowland were classified as discharge and intermediate types whereas wells 1 7 located in the plateau were classified mainly as recharge or intermediate types this classification corresponds to the groundwater flow system based on hydraulic heads age determination and geochemical data such as groundwater quality and stable isotopes hosono et al 2013 2014 hossain et al 2016a 2016b zeng et al 2016 kagabu et al 2017 the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence hereafter referred to as the kumamoto earthquake involved a large foreshock of mw 6 2 at 21 26 jst on april 14 2016 and a main shock of mw 7 0 at 1 25 jst on april 16 2016 the intense seismicity of the earthquake sequence occurred along the hinagu and futagawa fault zones these seismic activities involved strike slip and normal displacements and the main shock revealed post seismic rupture systems such as the suizenji fault zone fig 1 fujiwara et al 2016 kato et al 2016 coseismic groundwater drawdown 4 74 m maximum was recognized immediately after the main shock and approximately 106 m3 of water was estimated to have disappeared within 35 min hosono et al 2019 analyses of groundwater level data and three dimensional numerical simulations revealed that this groundwater drawdown was caused neither by static strain driven decreased pore pressure nor by the release of water through structural pathways but most likely by downward water transfer into the deep crust through open cracks hosono et al 2019 2 2 field measurements and data sources measurements of the temperature depth profiles were conducted in january 2017 june or november 2017 and february 2018 at observation wells 1 10 after the kumamoto earthquake fig 1 and table 1 the wells are installed in areas where they are accessible for public use such as parks or schools no major changes in land use were observed around the wells from 2001 to 2018 the well diameters were 10 20 cm and depths were 60 154 5 m a thermistor with a resolution of 0 01 c and accuracy of 0 02 c was used for measurements at 1 2 m intervals from the groundwater level to the well bottom or maximum depth at which the sensor was deployed the measured sections of each observation well are shown in table 1 pre earthquake temperature depth profile data were obtained from previous studies for measurements collected in 2001 taniguchi et al 2003a 2009 2010 tokunaga et al 2010 and 2012 dong et al 2012 these data had been measured using an identical method in the same wells and were compared with data from this study considering the period and number of each measurement the pre earthquake dataset was classified into two groups namely the 2001 a and 2009 2012 b pre earthquake datasets the post earthquake data collected for this study were further classified into three groups namely the january 2017 c june or november 2017 d and february 2018 e post earthquake datasets table 1 2 3 type curve match analysis to evaluate the effects of groundwater flow on temporary subsurface temperature changes the effects of vertical groundwater flux were estimated by comparing the type curves of the solution of the one dimensional conductive advective equation and observed temperature depth profile the steady state vertical one dimensional heat conduction and advection equation was solved by referring to bredehoeft and papadopulos 1965 1 2 t z 2 c w ρ w v z k t z 0 for a subject section from z 0 to z l with exposure to the following boundary conditions namely t t 0 z 0 and t t l z l where t is the temperature z is the depth from z 0 to l in a positive direction c w ρ w is the specific heat and density of groundwater k is the thermal conductivity and vz is the vertical groundwater flux a positive value

groundwater flux was estimated by comparing the type curves i e the correlation between z l and right hand side of eq 2 with parameter β of the calculation obtained from the observed data with the theoretical values of different conditions domenico and schwartz 1997 taniguchi et al 2003b 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal temperature changes to clarify the coseismic subsurface temperature changes from the temperature depth profiles fig 2 spatiotemporal changes in subsurface temperatures were determined and temporary changes associated with earthquakes were distinguished from long term changes the measurement data of temperature depth profiles obtained from 2 m below the groundwater level are not shown in the figure as they were possibly affected by noise from the thermometer in water in the shallow aquifer seasonal changes in surface temperature as reflected by annual changes in air temperature affected the subsurface temperature therefore we focused on the subsurface temperature without seasonal changes since the amplitude of temperature fluctuations decreased with depth the effects of short term surface temperature changes in less than one year such as seasonal changes generally reached a depth of approximately 10 m anderson 2005 the effects of long term surface warming due to global warming and urbanization differ from those of seasonal changes in surfaces temperature in that these effects reach deep areas temperature data from shallower than 25 m were not considered to exclude the effects of seasonal changes in surface temperature comparison of long term 2001 2018 temperature depth profiles revealed time dependent increasing temperature trends of more than 0 1 c at wells 4 5 7 and 9 whereas such changes were less obvious at wells 2 8 and 10 significant changes in the temperature depth profiles were not observed for these wells within the measurement period for post earthquake datasets c d and e similar long term increasing trends in the subsurface temperature were observed at wells 1 3 and 6 except for profiles from post earthquake dataset c which corresponds to measurement data collected nine months after the kumamoto earthquake most remarkably post earthquake dataset c at wells 1 and 3 exhibited much lower temperatures than any other pre or post earthquake datasets for instance the temperature in post earthquake dataset c decreased by 0 3 c at well 1 below a depth of 75 m and by 0 2 c at well 3 below a depth of 100 m in comparison with pre earthquake datasets on the other hand temperatures in post earthquake dataset c at well 6 were the highest among all the measurement datasets e g 0 4 c higher than the second and third highest profiles from post earthquake datasets d and e these temperature change at wells 1 3 and 6 differed from the long term increasing trends and were considered temporary anomalous post earthquake changes fig 3 a shows that the subsurface temperature at a depth of 80 m in well 1 located at the western foot of the aso caldera rim was 19 2 c in 2001 in the takuma plateau wells 3 4 6 and 7 temperatures showed a relatively small range of 18 1 18 4 c at a depth of 80 m in 2001 a comparison between pre earthquake datasets a and b did not show any obvious changes in the subsurface temperature fig 3b because the absolute values of the temperature differences were less than 0 1 c at a depth of 80 m however we did observe slight increases wells 1 4 and 6 and decreases wells 3 and 7 significant changes appeared at wells 1 and 6 nine months after the earthquake fig 3c when the temperature decreased by 0 2 c and increased by 0 5 c at wells 1 and 6 respectively these anomalies however respectively disappeared 14 or 19 months later fig 3d increasing temperature trends 0 1 0 2 c occurred at recharge and intermediate areas of the regional groundwater flow system wells 1 3 4 and 6 we did not observe any distinct changes after this period as shown by the comparison between post earthquake datasets d and e fig 3d and 3e these results suggest that long term subsurface warming generally occurred from 2001 to 2018 observed changes in the annual mean air temperature also suggest a long term warming trend about 3 5 10 2 c year from 1980 to 2018 japan meteorological agency website https www data jma go jp obd stats etrn index php recorded at the kumamoto meteorological observatory fig 1 long term changes in the surface temperature reflect changes in the air temperature smerdon et al 2006 caused by the combined effects of global warming and urbanization subsurface temperature increasing the groundwater recharge area caused by the effects on surface warming has previously been reported as a long term trend in this area taniguchi et al 2003a additionally long term trends in decreased subsurface temperature were recognized at several wells in the discharge area and the probable causes are thought to be the effects of decreased groundwater recharge rates taniguchi et al 2003a slight decreases in temperature occurred at wells 3 and 7 from 2001 to 2009 both wells however are located on the plateau in groundwater recharge or intermediate areas suggesting that this is probably not the cause long term subsurface warming was not confirmed at wells 8 and 10 both wells are located in a groundwater discharge area and subsurface warming may be concealed by other effects thus we assumed that the observed long term increasing trends in subsurface temperature could be attributed to surface warming related to air temperature especially for wells 1 7 in the plateau the anomalous temperature decreases at wells 1 and 3 as well as the temperature increase at well 6 were a post seismic effect since these changes only occurred during the earliest study period following the earthquake 3 2 post seismic changes in subsurface temperature to understand the characteristics of post seismic changes in subsurface temperature vertical distributions along cross section a a fig 1 which includes wells 1 3 and 6 are compared in fig 4 in pre earthquake datasets a and b fig 4a and b the subsurface temperature was relatively low at well 3 on the eastern takuma plateau compared with that at well 5 i e the highest temperature on the central plateau the lowest temperature at well 3 was due to surface water recharge along the middle reaches of the shirakawa river in post earthquake dataset c fig 4c temperatures of 19 c were still observed at well 5 these warm temperatures extended at well 6 at depths of greater than 40 m the 19 0 c isotherm stretched from the shallow zone first aquifer at well 5 to the western and deeper zone i e togawa lava in the second aquifer at well 6 no clear changes were observed at well 4 east of well 5 the occurrence of these high temperature zones nine months after the earthquake suggests that water was transported from shallower to deeper aquifers beneath the plateau following the kumamoto earthquake this zone of increased temperature then shrunk before the next survey 14 19 months after the earthquake fig 4d and 4e sustaining the relatively higher subsurface temperature 19 0 c only in localized areas under the deeper aquifer at well 5 this may have been partly caused by effects of long term increases in subsurface temperature due to surface warming well 6 is located in the suizenji fault zone fig 1 which appeared during the main shock of the kumamoto earthquake goto et al 2017 immediately after the earthquake the groundwater level decreased by 3 53 m due to groundwater drawdown into the deep crust through rupture systems the groundwater level typically returned to normal levels within 45 days of the earthquake hosono et al 2019 measurements for post earthquake dataset c were performed in january 2017 nearly nine months after the earthquake in april 2016 i e a significant time difference between the groundwater level drop and subsurface temperature observations effects from changes in the coseismic groundwater flow were assumed to still be present but diminished in the subsurface temperatures nine months after the earthquake due to the annual hydrological cycle subsurface temperatures at well 1 in post earthquake dataset c were approximately 0 2 c lower than those in pre earthquake dataset b and post earthquake datasets d and e figs 2a 3 and 4 an increase in the coseismic groundwater level was reported at well 1 at the western foot of the aso caldera rim this increase in the water level possibly resulted from coseismic mountain aquifer water released from higher elevations hosono et al 2019 kagabu et al 2020 therefore it can reasonably be assumed that the decrease in temporal temperature observed at well 1 was likely due to the addition of mountain aquifer water with lower temperatures similarly the addition of cooler water caused the temporary decrease in temperature observed at well 3 figs 2c and 3 the shirakawa river was considered the only possible source of this newly added water because there was no other water resource that could have been a source of low temperature upland groundwater we therefore suggest that coseismic enhancement during river water recharge occurred in the localized area near the middle reaches of the shirakawa river which was originally considered one of the major recharge areas for the regional groundwater flow system based on the subsurface temperatures post earthquake changes in groundwater flow likely occurred mainly in the first and second aquifer beneath the upland area which is the regional groundwater flow recharge and intermediate area 3 3 groundwater drawdown from type curve match analysis the temporary anomalous changes in subsurface temperature observed at wells 1 3 and 6 in post earthquake dataset c did not occur in the other datasets the increase and decrease in the coseismic well water level also occurred at wells 1 and 6 respectively suggesting that changes in groundwater flow after the earthquake may have caused the temporary changes in subsurface temperature to determine the effects of groundwater flow on subsurface temperature we further evaluated the groundwater flux using the type curve matching method described in section 2 3 most of the temperature data from wells 1 and 3 were collected at the screen or casing section between the two screens making it difficult to evaluate the vertical changes in temperature thus this evaluation was limited to the shallow zone of the second aquifer at well 6 in aso 3 32 44 m deep fig 5 the type curve match analysis results fig 6 indicate that the observed temperature depth profiles for pre earthquake datasets a and b and post earthquake datasets d and e did not correspond to any theoretical type curves fig 6a b d and e therefore vertical groundwater transportation was unlikely to have occurred during these periods on the other hand the observed temperature depth profile for post earthquake dataset c corresponded well to a type curve with positive β values ranging from 1 to 3 fig 6c which suggests that a downward groundwater flux only occurred before this measurement presumably after the earthquake an impermeable aquitard separating the first and second aquifers is not present beneath certain areas of the takuma plateau shimada and ueno 2016 including well 6 fig 5 the discontinuous nature of this impermeable layer is likely to have enhanced downward groundwater flow from the first to the second aquifers during water drawdown through ruptures in the deep crust hosono et al 2019 subsurface temperatures were originally highest in shallow areas of the central plateau fig 4 the effects of downward water flow on these warmer shallow waters caused the anomalous increase in subsurface temperature in the deep zones the results of this study differ from those of previous studies on coseismic changes in groundwater flow and subsurface temperature in that the data were obtained as temperature depth profiles the temperature depth profile data revealed temperature changes in the aquifers and applied one dimensional type curve match analyses even with limited data at the time of the earthquake the effects of post seismic changes in groundwater flow could be detected by comparing the temperature depth profiles because of the high resolution of these profiles coseismic changes in subsurface temperature with depth which are smaller than those resulting from a large earthquake could be detected this shows the usefulness of this method quantitative evaluation may be difficult with limited data at the time of the disaster but if thermal properties such as aquifer thermal conductivity are known the groundwater flow velocity could be estimated 4 conclusions repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles were conducted at 10 observation wells in january 2017 june or november 2017 and february 2018 after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake to improve understanding of the changes in subsurface temperature in kumamoto regional aquifer systems these observation data were compared with previously reported temperature depth profile datasets from 2001 to 2012 for the same wells allowing the successful identification of temporary anomalous changes in subsurface temperature due to changes in post seismic groundwater flow subsurface temperatures generally increased in both shallow and deep aquifers for nearly all observation wells from 2001 to 2018 which was likely caused by long term subsurface warming across the study area with the exception of measurements taken in january 2017 i e the earliest survey after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake temporary anomalous temperature decreases and increases were found in the vertical temperature profiles at two wells respectively located at the western foot of the aso caldera and on the western slope of the takuma plateau these temporal temperature changes were distinguishable from those explained by long term subsurface warming considering the increases and decreases in the coseismic groundwater level observed for each respective well these changes in subsurface temperature were likely associated with coseismic mountain groundwater release and shallow groundwater drawdown into the deep aquifers respectively the hypothesized shallow groundwater transport into the deep aquifers was further evaluated using a type curve match analysis that compared theoretical index curves with calculation results from the observed data these results corresponded with a downward groundwater flow scenario that occurred only after the earthquake and diminished in subsequent annual hydrological cycles thus it is reasonable to conclude that repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles can be used to evaluate changes in groundwater flow in response to large earthquakes identification of coseismic groundwater flow change is important for effective management of groundwater resources although the number of collected datasets may be constrained at the time of earthquake disasters this method is nonetheless useful because it can easily measure

5839,repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles were conducted in january 2017 june or november 2017 and february 2018 at 10 observation wells in the kumamoto area japan after the 2016 mw7 0 kumamoto earthquake to evaluate changes in post earthquake subsurface temperature these observation data were compared with pre earthquake temperature data from the same wells measured during 2001 and 2009 2012 by previous studies the observation and analysis of temperature depth profiles are useful for studying groundwater flow but have not been used to determine coseismic changes in groundwater flow this study detected earthquake related changes in groundwater flow using observations and analyses of temperature depth profiles and is the first to report on this type of evaluation of coseismic groundwater flow changes the results indicated a general long term subsurface warming from 2001 to 2018 anomalous decreases and increases occurred in subsurface temperature at the western foot of the aso caldera rim and western takuma plateau respectively the observed temperature decrease can be explained by the post seismic release of mountain groundwater characterized by lower temperatures a type curve match analysis indicated that increasing temperature anomalies were associated with downward groundwater flow these results were consistent with a recently proposed coseismic groundwater drawdown model along new rupture systems although the first measurement was performed nine months after the earthquake the groundwater level change data allowed the temperature measurements to successfully detect anomalies caused by hydrological changes that began immediately after the earthquake however these signals disappeared 14 19 months after the earthquake and were diminished by the original groundwater flow systems that control the local subsurface temperature these results demonstrate the applicability of the observation and analysis of temperature depth profiles to identify post seismic changes in groundwater flow which are required for the management of groundwater resources during earthquake disasters and reconstruction keywords 2016 kumamoto earthquake post seismic

taniguchi et al 2003a 2009 2010 tokunaga et al 2010 and 2012 dong et al 2012 these data had been measured using an identical method in the same wells and were compared with data from this study considering the period and number of each measurement the pre earthquake dataset was classified into two groups namely the 2001 a and 2009 2012 b pre earthquake datasets the post earthquake data collected for this study were further classified into three groups namely the january 2017 c june or november 2017 d and february 2018 e post earthquake datasets table 1 2 3 type curve match analysis to evaluate the effects of groundwater flow on temporary subsurface temperature changes the effects of vertical groundwater flux were estimated by comparing the type curves of the solution of the one dimensional conductive advective equation and observed temperature depth profile the steady state vertical one dimensional heat conduction and advection equation was solved by referring to bredehoeft

temperature changes from the temperature depth profiles fig 2 spatiotemporal changes in subsurface temperatures were determined and temporary changes associated with earthquakes were distinguished from long term changes the measurement data of temperature depth profiles obtained from 2 m below the groundwater level are not shown in the figure as they were possibly affected by noise from the thermometer in water in the shallow aquifer seasonal changes in surface temperature as reflected by annual changes in air temperature affected the subsurface temperature therefore we focused on the subsurface temperature without seasonal changes since the amplitude of temperature fluctuations decreased with depth the effects of short term surface temperature changes in less than one year such as seasonal changes generally reached a depth of approximately 10 m anderson 2005 the effects of long term surface warming due to global warming and urbanization differ from those of seasonal changes in surfaces temperature in that these effects reach deep areas temperature data from shallower than 25 m were not considered to exclude the effects of seasonal changes in surface temperature comparison of long term 2001 2018 temperature depth profiles revealed time dependent increasing temperature trends of more than 0 1 c at wells 4 5 7 and 9 whereas such changes were less obvious at wells 2 8 and 10 significant changes in the temperature depth profiles were not observed for these wells within the measurement period for post earthquake datasets c d and e similar long term increasing trends in the subsurface temperature were observed at wells 1 3 and 6 except for profiles from post earthquake dataset c which corresponds to measurement data collected nine months after the kumamoto earthquake most remarkably post earthquake dataset c at wells 1 and 3 exhibited much lower temperatures than any other pre or post earthquake datasets for instance the temperature in post earthquake dataset c decreased by 0 3 c at well 1 below a depth of 75 m and by 0 2 c at well 3 below a depth of 100 m in comparison with pre earthquake datasets on the other hand temperatures in post earthquake dataset c at well 6 were the highest among all the measurement datasets e g 0 4 c higher than the second and third highest profiles from post earthquake datasets d and e these temperature change at wells 1 3 and 6 differed from the long term increasing trends and were considered temporary anomalous post earthquake changes fig 3 a shows that the subsurface temperature at a depth of 80 m in well 1 located at the western foot of the aso caldera rim was 19 2 c in 2001 in the takuma plateau wells 3 4 6 and 7 temperatures showed a relatively small range of 18 1 18 4 c at a depth of 80 m in 2001 a comparison between pre earthquake datasets a and b did not show any obvious changes in the subsurface temperature fig 3b because the absolute values of the temperature differences were less than 0 1 c at a depth of 80 m however we did observe slight increases wells 1 4 and 6 and decreases wells 3 and 7 significant changes appeared at wells 1 and 6 nine months after the earthquake fig 3c when the temperature decreased by 0 2 c and increased by 0 5 c at wells 1 and 6 respectively these anomalies however respectively disappeared 14 or 19 months later fig 3d increasing temperature trends 0 1 0 2 c occurred at recharge and intermediate areas of the regional groundwater flow system wells 1 3 4 and 6 we did not observe any distinct changes after this period as shown by the comparison between post earthquake datasets d and e fig 3d and 3e these results suggest that long term subsurface warming generally occurred from 2001 to 2018 observed changes in the annual mean air temperature also suggest a long term warming trend about 3 5 10 2 c year from 1980 to 2018 japan meteorological agency website https www data jma go jp obd stats etrn index php recorded at the kumamoto meteorological observatory fig 1 long term changes in the surface temperature reflect changes in the air temperature smerdon et al 2006 caused by the combined effects of global warming and urbanization subsurface temperature increasing the groundwater recharge area caused by the effects on surface warming has previously been reported as a long term trend in this area taniguchi et al 2003a additionally long term trends in decreased subsurface temperature were recognized at several wells in the discharge area and the probable causes are thought to be the effects of decreased groundwater recharge rates taniguchi et al 2003a slight decreases in temperature occurred at wells 3 and 7 from 2001 to 2009 both wells however are located on the plateau in groundwater recharge or intermediate areas suggesting that this is probably not the cause long term subsurface warming was not confirmed at wells 8 and 10 both wells are located in a groundwater discharge area and subsurface warming may be concealed by other effects thus we assumed that the observed long term increasing trends in subsurface temperature could be attributed to surface warming related to air temperature especially for wells 1 7 in the plateau the anomalous temperature decreases at wells 1 and 3 as well as the temperature increase at well 6 were a post seismic effect since these changes only occurred during the earliest study period following the earthquake 3 2 post seismic changes in subsurface temperature to understand the characteristics of post seismic changes in subsurface temperature vertical distributions along cross section a a fig 1 which includes wells 1 3 and 6 are compared in fig 4 in pre earthquake datasets a and b fig 4a and b the subsurface temperature was relatively low at well 3 on the eastern takuma plateau compared with that at well 5 i e the highest temperature on the central plateau the lowest temperature at well 3 was due to surface water recharge along the middle reaches of the shirakawa river in post earthquake dataset c fig 4c temperatures of 19 c were still observed at well 5 these warm temperatures extended at well 6 at depths of greater than 40 m the 19 0 c isotherm stretched from the shallow zone first aquifer at well 5 to the western and deeper zone i e togawa lava in the second aquifer at well 6 no clear changes were observed at well 4 east of well 5 the occurrence of these high temperature zones nine months after the earthquake suggests that water was transported from shallower to deeper aquifers beneath the plateau following the kumamoto earthquake this zone of increased temperature then shrunk before the next survey 14 19 months after the earthquake fig 4d and 4e sustaining the relatively higher subsurface temperature 19 0 c only in localized areas under the deeper aquifer at well 5 this may have been partly caused by effects of long term increases in subsurface temperature due to surface warming well 6 is located in the suizenji fault zone fig 1 which appeared during the main shock of the kumamoto earthquake goto et al 2017 immediately after the earthquake the groundwater level decreased by 3 53 m due to groundwater drawdown into the deep crust through rupture systems the groundwater level typically returned to normal levels within 45 days of the earthquake hosono et al 2019 measurements for post earthquake dataset c were performed in january 2017 nearly nine months after the earthquake in april 2016 i e a significant time difference between the groundwater level drop and subsurface temperature observations effects from changes in the coseismic groundwater flow were assumed to still be present but diminished in the subsurface temperatures nine months after the earthquake due to the annual hydrological cycle subsurface temperatures at well 1 in post earthquake dataset c were approximately 0 2 c lower than those in pre earthquake dataset b and post earthquake datasets d and e figs 2a 3 and 4 an increase in the coseismic groundwater level was reported at well 1 at the western foot of the aso caldera rim this increase in the water level possibly resulted from coseismic mountain aquifer water released from higher elevations hosono et al 2019 kagabu et al 2020 therefore it can reasonably be assumed that the decrease in temporal temperature observed at well 1 was likely due to the addition of mountain aquifer water with lower temperatures similarly the addition of cooler water caused the temporary decrease in temperature observed at well 3 figs 2c and 3 the shirakawa river was considered the only possible source of this newly added water because there was no other water resource that could have been a source of low temperature upland groundwater we therefore suggest that coseismic enhancement during river water recharge occurred in the localized area near the middle reaches of the shirakawa river which was originally considered one of the major recharge areas for the regional groundwater flow system based on the subsurface temperatures post earthquake changes in groundwater flow likely occurred mainly in the first and second aquifer beneath the upland area which is the regional groundwater flow recharge and intermediate area 3 3 groundwater drawdown from type curve match analysis the temporary anomalous changes in subsurface temperature observed at wells 1 3 and 6 in post earthquake dataset c did not occur in the other datasets the increase and decrease in the coseismic well water level also occurred at wells 1 and 6 respectively suggesting that changes in groundwater flow after the earthquake may have caused the temporary changes in subsurface temperature to determine the effects of groundwater flow on subsurface temperature we further evaluated the groundwater flux using the type curve matching method described in section 2 3 most of the temperature data from wells 1 and 3 were collected at the screen or casing section between the two screens making it difficult to evaluate the vertical changes in temperature thus this evaluation was limited to the shallow zone of the second aquifer at well 6 in aso 3 32 44 m deep fig 5 the type curve match analysis results fig 6 indicate that the observed temperature depth profiles for pre earthquake datasets a and b and post earthquake datasets d and e did not correspond to any theoretical type curves fig 6a b d and e therefore vertical groundwater transportation was unlikely to have occurred during these periods on the other hand the observed temperature depth profile for post earthquake dataset c corresponded well to a type curve with positive β values ranging from 1 to 3 fig 6c which suggests that a downward groundwater flux only occurred before this measurement presumably after the earthquake an impermeable aquitard separating the first and second aquifers is not present beneath certain areas of the takuma plateau shimada and ueno 2016 including well 6 fig 5 the discontinuous nature of this impermeable layer is likely to have enhanced downward groundwater flow from the first to the second aquifers during water drawdown through ruptures in the deep crust hosono et al 2019 subsurface temperatures were originally highest in shallow areas of the central plateau fig 4 the effects of downward water flow on these warmer shallow waters caused the anomalous increase in subsurface temperature in the deep zones the results of this study differ from those of previous studies on coseismic changes in groundwater flow and subsurface temperature in that the data were obtained as temperature depth profiles the temperature depth profile data revealed temperature changes in the aquifers and applied one dimensional type curve match analyses even with limited data at the time of the earthquake the effects of post seismic changes in groundwater flow could be detected by comparing the temperature depth profiles because of the high resolution of these profiles coseismic changes in subsurface temperature with depth which are smaller than those resulting from a large earthquake could be detected this shows the usefulness of this method quantitative evaluation may be difficult with limited data at the time of the disaster but if thermal properties such as aquifer thermal conductivity are known the groundwater flow velocity could be estimated 4 conclusions repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles were conducted at 10 observation wells in january 2017 june or november 2017 and february 2018 after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake to improve understanding of the changes in subsurface temperature in kumamoto regional aquifer systems these observation data were compared with previously reported temperature depth profile datasets from 2001 to 2012 for the same wells allowing the successful identification of temporary anomalous changes in subsurface temperature due to changes in post seismic groundwater flow subsurface temperatures generally increased in both shallow and deep aquifers for nearly all observation wells from 2001 to 2018 which was likely caused by long term subsurface warming across the study area with the exception of measurements taken in january 2017 i e the earliest survey after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake temporary anomalous temperature decreases and increases were found in the vertical temperature profiles at two wells respectively located at the western foot of the aso caldera and on the western slope of the takuma plateau these temporal temperature changes were distinguishable from those explained by long term subsurface warming considering the increases and decreases in the coseismic groundwater level observed for each respective well these changes in subsurface temperature were likely associated with coseismic mountain groundwater release and shallow groundwater drawdown into the deep aquifers respectively the hypothesized shallow groundwater transport into the deep aquifers was further evaluated using a type curve match analysis that compared theoretical index curves with calculation results from the observed data these results corresponded with a downward groundwater flow scenario that occurred only after the earthquake and diminished in subsequent annual hydrological cycles thus it is reasonable to conclude that repeated measurements of temperature depth profiles can be used to evaluate changes in groundwater flow in response to large earthquakes identification of coseismic groundwater flow change is important for effective management of groundwater resources although the number of collected datasets may be constrained at the time of earthquake disasters this method is nonetheless useful because it can easily measure
