8930,the soil water content at the condition of field capacity θ fc is a key parameter in irrigation scheduling and has been suggested to be determined by running a synthetic drainage experiment until the flux rate q at the bottom of the soil profile achieves a predefined negligible value q fc we question the impact of q fc on the assessment of field capacity moreover calculating θ fc as the integral mean of the water content profile when q is equal to q fc is strictly valid only for uniform soil profiles by contrast this practice is ambiguous and biased for stratified soil profiles due to the soil water content discontinuity at the layer interfaces in this study the concept of field capacity was revisited and adapted to practical agronomic heuristics by resorting to the assessment of root zone water storage capacity w we envision field capacity as a functional hydraulic parameter derived from synthetic irrigation scheduling scenarios to minimize drought stress drainage and nitrate leachate below the root zone a functional analysis was carried out on a 135 cm thick layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska on farm irrigation scheduling applications and agricultural practices were recorded for 20 years 2001 2020 at a daily time step hydrus 1d was calibrated and validated with direct measurements of the soil water retention curve and soil water content data respectively in each soil layer a set of functional field capacity values was derived from 24 irrigation scheduling scenarios and the optimal water storage capacity at field capacity w fc was approximately 50 cm corresponding to about 80 saturation in the soil profile an average irrigation amount of 217 5 mm distributed over 21 events was obtained by using optimal irrigation scheduling which was initiated when the matric pressure head took on a value of 700 cm and the irrigation rate was set at 1 0 cm d 1 this irrigation practice ensured water storage at approximately the same level ideally at w fc by sustaining only evapotranspiration fluxes in the uppermost portion of the root zone and by limiting excessive drainage this protocol can be transferred to other agricultural fields keywords hydrus 1d on farm observations fertilizer application irrigation scheduling nitrate leachate functional analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the active rooting zone of a soil profile acts from a functional viewpoint as a reservoir that stores incoming water from precipitation or irrigation events and makes it available for crop use over longer periods of water shortage romano and santini 2002 therefore soil provides a critical interplay between crop and atmospheric demand since soil water storage supplies potential root water uptake rwu which is reduced under water stress conditions in agricultural fields drought stress is mitigated by irrigation applications to keep rwu at its potential level during the crop growing season from an operational viewpoint the main challenge is to set the irrigation schedule and the optimal water amount to improve the design of irrigation based water management strategies a widely used global indicator for governing irrigation scheduling is the root zone soil water storage capacity available for plant use or simply plant available water capacity pawc representing the maximum amount of soil water that can be stored in a soil profile to sustain optimal crop growth and yield a pragmatic but very simplistic way to determine pawc is to compute the difference between the water storage capacity at field capacity w fc and the permanent wilting point w wp commonly pawc is expressed as the difference between the soil water content values at field capacity θ fc and permanent wilting point θ wp multiplied by the thickness of the root zone z r i e pawc θ fc θ wp z r allen et al 1998 when the profile average soil water content in the rooting zone is less than the wilting point θ wp then it is commonly assumed that the plant wilts permanently although the condition of permanent wilting depends not merely on soil type but especially on plant species thomasson 1995 garg et al 2020 wiecheteck et al 2020 torres et al 2021 a common value for θ wp is the soil water content at the matric pressure of 1 5 mpa i e a matric head of 15 296 cm of water based on data from sunflowers used as a reference plant species taylor and ashcroft 1972 field capacity is defined as the volumetric water content remaining in a soil profile two or three days after having been completely wetted with water and after free drainage beyond the root zone has become negligible veihmeyer and hendrickson 1949 soil science society of america 2008 the field drainage experiment is considered a benchmark method for determining θ fc which is certainly not exempt from criticism and appears a bit vague romano and santini 2002 assouline and or 2014 de jong van lier and wendroth 2016 the tacit assumption is that the soil profile is uniform initially fully saturated and subject only to gravity driven drainage regardless of the evapotranspiration flux which is assumed as zero even though definitions exist for θ fc or w fc and θ wp or w wp the concepts underlying these variables and their physical meanings are still a matter of debate gardner 1965 ritchie 1981 minasny and mcbratney 2003 garg et al 2020 torres et al 2021 turek et al 2022 cousin et al 2022 in situ drainage experiments are notoriously cumbersome although representative of actual field conditions and the condition of field capacity is attained when the drainage flux at the lower boundary of the soil profile is virtually null romano and santini 2002 synthetic drainage experiments can be used when the soil hydraulic properties are known beforehand and the zero flux and the unit or fixed total hydraulic gradient are set as the upper and lower boundaries of the flow domain respectively the θ fc value is computed when the water flux q at the bottom of the flow domain is equal to a predefined negligible drainage flux q fc twarakavi et al 2009 assouline and or 2014 reynolds 2018 inforsato and de jong van lier 2021 when this condition is attained the simulated profile average soil water content is often referred to as the flux based field capacity meyer and gee 1999 nasta and romano 2016 inforsato and de jong van lier 2021 choosing a negligible value for q fc is obviously arbitrary but another limitation arises when the synthetic drainage process is simulated in a layered heterogeneous soil profile which exhibits contrasting vertical textural properties and hydraulic characteristics when using field capacity as a hydraulic parameter in a bucket type hydrological model the soil component of the system is often conceptualized as a uniform homogeneous flow domain and this oversimplification can be considered acceptable if one is interested in computing the lumped water budget romano et al 2011 however when the concept of pawc is used to resolve agronomic problems water dynamics in layered soil profiles should be properly characterized by using a process oriented hydrological model based on the richards equation under these circumstances the determination of θ fc as a profile average value is not trivial and is rather weak as well so it becomes convenient to resort to the assessment of w fc nasta and romano 2016 irrigated agriculture in the high plains region of the united states mostly relies on aquifer depletion especially for maize production as this crop has high irrigation requirements to achieve maximum yield the average groundwater levels have declined significantly in the southern and central high plains i e texas oklahoma and kansas and parts of nebraska scanlon et al 2012 over the last decades excessive groundwater depletion has been exacerbated by frequent droughts induced by climate change rudnick et al 2019 overapplication of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides is the primary source of groundwater contamination which further decreases the amount of water available for irrigation the challenge of irrigated agriculture is to identify a functional value for soil water storage at field capacity by preserving optimal root zone water contents so to avoid or at least minimize the onset of drought stress and excessive drainage and related contaminant transport towards the aquifer in this study hydrus 1d was used to simulate water flow and solute transport across a 135 cm thick agronomic layered soil profile beneath irrigated maize in eastern nebraska šimůnek et al 2016 in hydrus 1d irrigation timing is controlled by a depth specific user specified soil pressure head while the irrigation rate is set at prescribed values lena et al 2022 therefore the target of this synthetic approach was to perform a sensitivity analysis using different values of the user specified irrigation rate for maize and soil matric pressure head at a soil depth of 67 5 cm half of maize s maximum root depth a total of 24 values for water storage capacity at field capacity w fc were estimated and the optimal value was selected to minimize drought stress drainage flux to avoid local water waste and nitrate leachate to reduce contaminant vulnerability below the root zone the functional field capacity has been compared with the conventional synthetic drainage experiment and the challenge of estimating θ fc is discussed 2 experimental work and methods 2 1 environmental settings and data collection the study site is in eastern nebraska usa at the university of nebraska

storage is at the minimum allowable balance in the active root zone i e at the lowest tolerated water storage before the stress begins which is assumed to be 50 of field capacity and when no significant rainfall greater than about 12 7 mm is expected in the following two three days the irrigation amount is given by the difference between water storage at field capacity and the minimum

the interface of the soil layers the value of θ fc cannot be computed as the integral mean of the water content profile recorded at a certain time 2 4 2 estimation of a functional field capacity condition from irrigation scheduling scenarios the initial and boundary conditions are the same as described in section 2 3 the soil hydraulic parameters θ s α n and k s of each soil layer were assessed according to the criteria described in section 2 3 to mitigate excessive crop water stress during the growing season hydrus 1d has the option to trigger a user specified irrigation rate irr s when a prescribed pressure head ψ p is reached at a given observation node irrigation starts after a user specified lag period at a user specified irrigation rate the duration of irrigation is also

solute balance components were stored for each model simulation 3 results 3 1 model parameterization and water and nitrate balance in the irrigated plot whereas the hydrus 1d model uses the basic units of length in cm for convenience the water balance components are presented here as units of length in mm the optimized soil water retention parameters for each soil layer are reported in table 1 whereas fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated soil water content values at the four soil depths of z 10 cm z 25 cm z 50 cm and z 100 cm the shape of the water retention curve is mostly influenced by the values of n and α featured in eq 4 the soil water retention function of the deepest soil layers z 75 135 cm has the lowest values of n and α and is characterized by a smooth decay in soil water content with increasing pressure head values the optimized values of θ s and k s show a decreasing pattern towards the deeper layers and this behavior is mainly induced by soil compaction turkeltaub et al 2020 the prediction performance rmse and r2 metrics reported in table 1 are fair despite the fact that we suspect the model was ill informed by the sensors located at two soil depths the removal of observed soil water content values in the last five years n 1098 at soil depths of 10 cm and 100 cm for suspicious malfunctioning especially the deepest layer see fig 3e enhanced the rmse and r2 values table 1 and proved to be satisfactory if compared to previous studies in agricultural fields wollschläger et al 2009 wöhling and vrugt 2011 ket et al 2018 sao et al 2021 the best kge was obtained in the deepest layer where soil water content was kept constantly near fully saturated conditions fig 3e in contrast the seasonal variability of the observed soil water content was difficult to match in the first three soil layers fig 3b d and this is depicted by relatively lower kge values table 1 this was corroborated by a scrutiny of the three kge scores r β and γ not reported in table 1 the correlation coefficients passed the 0 05 significance test in all layers and ranged between 0 435 in the second layer and 0 473 in the fourth layer the β values were close to unity for all layers indicating unbiased predictions while on the one hand r and β values were similar in all layers on the other hand γ values controlled kge along soil depth with the farthest γ 1 492 and the closest γ 0 984 from optimum γ 1 for the second and fourth layer respectively the variability of simulated water content values standard deviations of 0 0609 cm3 cm 3 0 0618 cm3 cm 3 0 0415 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0097 cm3 cm 3 at soil depths of 10 cm 25 cm 50 cm and 100 cm respectively was higher than the one of corresponding observations in the first three soil depths standard deviations

are aware that it might influence the soil hydraulic properties of the uppermost soil layer schlüter et al 2018 hu et al 2018 fu et al 2021 talukder et al 2022 the mean water balance in the irrigation seasons corresponding to the 100 day long period ranging from mid june to mid september in 2001 2020 is reported in table 2 the inter annual variability of water balance components was mainly controlled by rainfall variability which ranged from 50 4 mm to 248 6 mm with a mean value of 146 7 mm the amount of water supplied by rainfall in the irrigation season was not sufficient to meet the average crop specific potential evapotranspiration demand et c 236 8 mm as the total water supplied by precipitation and irrigation exceeded the crop water requirement during the irrigation season et a represented 92 of et c when using simulations with irrigation average annual drainage represented about 20 of precipitation and irrigation by inducing on average 0 376 mg cm 2 corresponding to 37 6 kg n ha 1 or 19 2 of applied fertilizer nitrate leachate the mean annual drought stress namely the difference between potential t p and actual t a transpiration was 19 1 mm and 36 0 mm with or without irrigation scheduling respectively reductions in drainage 8 5 mm and nitrate leaching 0 075 mg cm 2 or 7 5 kg n ha 1 are reported when removing the irrigation events table 2 3 2 estimation of flux based field capacity from drainage simulation scenarios the decrease in water storage over time derived from the simulation of the draining process across the layered soil profile is presented in fig 4a theoretically water storage and the corresponding drainage flux q at the bottom of the active root zone fig 4b decrease for very long periods we report the field capacity w fc at which q is equal to a predefined negligible flux q fc table 3 we report t fc values between 4 d and 391 d and corresponding w fc values between 60 4 cm and 39 2 cm at the maximum q fc 0 49 cm d 1 and minimum q fc 0 01 cm d 1 q fc values respectively only the first prescribed negligible flux provides a drainage time that is consistent with the classical definition given by i e the amount of water held in soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has materially decreased which usually takes place within 2 3 days after a rain or irrigation in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture fig 5 shows the vertical distribution of soil matric head and soil water content values at the eight drainage times listed in table 3 note that during the evolution of the drainage process soil matric head profiles are continuous in the entire flow domain whereas soil water content profiles are discontinuous across the interface of layers characterized by contrasting soil hydraulic properties romano et al 1998 in other words at a fixed drainage time t fc one can compute the profile averaged matric head but the discontinuity of water content profiles hinders the calculation of the integral mean for function θ z t fc in the entire flow domain this drawback raises further vagueness when assessing the soil water content at the condition of field capacity in the case of stratified soil profiles nevertheless due to similar soil hydraulic functions of the first three soil layers 75 cm z 0 cm see the hydraulic parameters in table 1 fig 5b shows that the resulting soil water contents across the soil layer boundaries vary little and therefore an average θ value can be assumed to be roughly representative from the soil surface z 0 to the soil depth of 75 cm especially for the times around 59 days after the initiation of the simulation nasta and romano 2016 3 3 estimation of functional field capacity from irrigation scheduling scenarios the results of the 24

those obtained without irrigation scheduling the irrigation management based on irr s 0 5 cm d 1 and ψ p 300 cm prevented the initiation of crop stress but would require many irrigation applications

p 900 cm respectively and with increasing irrigation rates the pillar of more irrigation less drought stress more drainage and more nitrate leaching was generally valid and the choice of the best irrigation practice depended on the maximum amount of water the producers were willing to supply on the maximum crop yield which in turn depends on the relationship with actual rwu and on the maximum nitrate leachate allowed by local regulations when nitrate concentration in groundwater is above 10 mg l 1 the maximum contaminant level mcl and hazardous health effects become a concern among humans

because ψ p reached the threshold value of 700 cm at the soil depth of 67 5 cm then the irrigation application ended on day 614 6 september 2002 and both soil water content and matric pressure head

graham et al 2022 srinivasan et al 2022 kumar et al 2022 smart irrigation enables farmers to save water without subjecting crops to moisture deficiency and adverse environmental impacts bwambale et al 2022 the functional field capacity blue box in fig 2b was derived from the optimal irrigation scheduling scenario by minimizing crop water stress excessive drainage and nitrate leaching in an agronomic layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska in this study we found a mean seasonal irrigation total of 217 5 mm distributed over 21 daily events on average simulated irrigation water was supplied every five days at a rate of 1 cm d 1 in mead irrigation usually ranges between 230 mm and 350 mm and is applied with a rate of 0 65 cm d 1 per 3 day long period to ensure a full rotation of the pivot due to its speed suyker and verma 2009 gibson et al 2017 frequent irrigation applications with relatively low rates are beneficial for crop growth but in practice might be affected by evaporation loss from the sprinklers therefore future studies should consider the tradeoff between maintenance factors and optimal irrigation scheduling nitrate leaching is controlled by fertilization timing and amount nitrogen transformations root nitrate uptake dynamics and water movement which in turn are influenced by the soil hydraulic properties of each soil layer atmospheric boundary conditions and irrigation management weitzman et al 2022 in this study nitrate leachate 0 252 mg cm 2 or 25 2 kg n ha 1 derived from the best irrigation scheduling scenario represents 13 of the fertilizer amount 1 95 mg cm 2 or 195 kg n ha 1 high transpiration fluxes favored by irrigation supply during the irrigation season induce root nitrate uptake rates at their maximum level by limiting nitrate migration below the root zone samani et al 2020 found mean annual nitrate leaching of 52 kg n ha 1 and 91 kg n ha 1 for continuous corn and for corn soybean rotation at mead ne we neglected the economic criterion of efficiency because costs and prices are volatile and fluctuate rapidly from year to year whereas the relationship between drought stress and crop yield needs to be carefully assessed in a follow up study sharma and irmak 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2021b crop yield was ignored in this study because it would require specific on farm measurements and a detailed crop growth model létourneau et al 2015 vogeler et al 2019 kelly et al 2023 the other model simulation red box in fig 2a refers to a synthetic drainage experiment enabling the flux based field capacity to be assessed the determination of the flux based field capacity is a non trivial task and should follow a standard protocol by removing as much as possible all vague criteria related to the duration of the synthetic drainage process veihmeyer and hendrickson 1949 ritchie 1981 wilcox 1959 assouline and or 2014 armindo and wendroth 2016 a further difficulty arises because real world soil profiles are layered rather than uniform nasta and romano 2016 that said we pose the following questions what is the negligible flux rate at which simulated drainage is assumed null what is the corresponding drainage time a first attempt is to take advantage of the information on soil water storage depletion over time this task can be performed using quantitative or qualitative techniques based on the soil water storage decay over time simulated during the synthetic drainage process a qualitative and somewhat subjective technique has been illustrated by zotarelli et al 2019 who reported a very practical but rather subjective way of detecting the condition of field capacity in actual agronomic soils as the point of intersection of the two tangents at the curve depicting the water storage depletion one tangent drawn some hours or a few days fast drainage slope and the other tangent drawn several days or even several months slow drainage slope after the start of drainage by applying this empirical approach to the soil water storage depletion curve shown in fig 4 it was found that the root zone water storage capacity at field capacity w fc is 53 7 cm about 25 days after the beginning of the model simulation a rough quantitative estimation of the drainage time t fc at the condition of field capacity was obtained by using the analytical method developed by ogata and richards 1957 and verified by wilcox 1959 the soil water storage depletion curve of fig 4 was interpolated with a power function w t 78 7 t 0 117 for t greater than 1 day whose derivative enabled us to obtain t fc 57 2 d by fixing the negligible drainage flux dw dt q fc 0 10 cm d 1 as suggested by meyer and gee 1999 and hence to obtain w fc 49 1 cm furthermore in most cases smart irrigation systems rely on low cost capacitance sensors to monitor soil water content at different soil depths across the soil profile therefore a convenient and practical rule to ascertain the condition of field capacity in the soil profile is to refer to the resolution of a sensor that expresses the extent to which the target variable can change to be recorded by the datalogger new generation capacitance sensors have a resolution of approximately 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and accounting for the simulation results this entails that the soil water storage depletion can no longer be detected at approximately 50 days after the initiation of the synthetic drainage process as a conclusive comment on the multiple aspects covered in this discussion section we point out that the flux based water storage at field capacity obtained from the synthetic drainage process is quite similar to the functional value of water storage capacity w fc 50 cm reported in table 3 at q fc 0 10 cm d 1 and t fc 59 days yet the drainage time at field capacity obtained from the synthetic drainage process should only be considered a fictitious parameter that allows comparing the two simulation scenarios used in this study see the schematics in fig 2 but certainly cannot correspond to the maximum interval allowed between irrigations i e the so called irrigation frequency if water is supplied at the rate irr s 1 0 cm d 1 5 conclusions efficient irrigation scheduling optimizes the application of water at the right time and in the right amount field capacity represents the threshold storage needed to control the optimal irrigation amount by limiting the negative effects related to underwatering and overwatering applying more than the required irrigation water triggers excessive drainage and nitrate leaching by contrast supplying inadequate irrigation amounts may lead to crop stress and a reduction in crop yield in this study we assessed the functional water storage at field capacity by minimizing crop water stress and potential negative effects on the environment such as excessive drainage and nitrate leaching in a layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska we tested 24 irrigation scheduling scenarios by changing irrigation timing and rate the lowest drought stress drainage and nitrate leachate were obtained by triggering irrigation near optimal conditions ψ p 300 cm for irrigation rates higher than 0 50 cm d 1 by contrast increasing the irrigation rates and amounts is detrimental in terms of drainage and groundwater contamination without further benefits for root water uptake therefore an optimal compromise was found when fixing irr s 1 0 cm d 1 and ψ p 700 cm the functional water storage field capacity w fc derived from this irrigation practice was between 49 70 and 50 30 cm but this value cannot be directly converted into soil water content at field capacity θ fc for the layered soil profile the synthetic drainage experiment is used for assessing the flux based field capacity that is obtained when the drainage flux at the lower boundary of the soil profile is approximately null the functional analysis carried out in this study is useful to correct the vagueness in the synthetic drainage process when the field capacity concept was adapted to practical agronomic heuristics this protocol can be transferred to other agricultural fields under different climates soil and crop characteristics moreover the implementation of improved irrigation scheduling schemes can help minimize adverse tradeoffs between water quality and water quantity that exist

8930,the soil water content at the condition of field capacity θ fc is a key parameter in irrigation scheduling and has been suggested to be determined by running a synthetic drainage experiment until the flux rate q at the bottom of the soil profile achieves a predefined negligible value q fc we question the impact of q fc on the assessment of field capacity moreover calculating θ fc as the integral mean of the water content profile when q is equal to q fc is strictly valid only for uniform soil profiles by contrast this practice is ambiguous and biased for stratified soil profiles due to the soil water content discontinuity at the layer interfaces in this study the concept of field capacity was revisited and adapted to practical agronomic heuristics by resorting to the assessment of root zone water storage capacity w we envision field capacity as a functional hydraulic parameter derived from synthetic irrigation scheduling scenarios to minimize drought stress drainage and nitrate leachate below the root zone a functional analysis was carried out on a 135 cm thick layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska on farm irrigation scheduling applications and agricultural practices were recorded for 20 years 2001 2020 at a daily time step hydrus 1d was calibrated and validated with direct measurements of the soil water retention curve and soil water content data respectively in each soil layer a set of functional field capacity values was derived from 24 irrigation scheduling scenarios and the optimal water storage capacity at field capacity w fc was approximately 50 cm corresponding to about 80 saturation in the soil profile an average irrigation amount of 217 5 mm distributed over 21 events was obtained by using optimal irrigation scheduling which was initiated when the matric pressure head took on a value of 700 cm and the irrigation rate was set at 1 0 cm d 1 this irrigation practice ensured water storage at approximately the same level ideally at w fc by sustaining only evapotranspiration fluxes in the uppermost portion of the root zone and by limiting excessive drainage this protocol can be transferred to other agricultural fields keywords hydrus 1d on farm observations fertilizer application irrigation scheduling nitrate leachate functional analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the active rooting zone of a soil profile acts from a functional viewpoint as a reservoir that stores incoming water from precipitation or irrigation events and makes it available for crop use over longer periods of water shortage romano and santini 2002 therefore soil provides a critical interplay between crop and atmospheric demand since soil water storage supplies potential root water uptake rwu which is reduced under water stress conditions in agricultural fields drought stress is mitigated by irrigation applications to keep rwu at its potential level during the crop growing season from an operational viewpoint the main challenge is to set the irrigation schedule and the optimal water amount to improve the design of irrigation based water management strategies a widely used global indicator for governing irrigation scheduling is the root zone soil water storage capacity available for plant use or simply plant available water capacity pawc representing the maximum amount of soil water that can be stored in a soil profile to sustain optimal crop growth and yield a pragmatic but very simplistic way to determine pawc is to compute the difference between the water storage capacity at field capacity w fc and the permanent wilting point w wp commonly pawc is expressed as the difference between the soil water content values at field capacity θ fc and permanent wilting point θ wp multiplied by the thickness of the root zone z r i e pawc θ fc θ wp z r allen et al 1998 when the profile average soil water content in the rooting zone is less than the wilting point θ wp then it is commonly assumed that the plant wilts permanently although the condition of permanent wilting depends not merely on soil type but especially on plant species thomasson 1995 garg et al 2020 wiecheteck et al 2020 torres et al 2021 a common value for θ wp is the soil water content at the matric pressure of 1 5 mpa i e a matric head of 15 296 cm of water based on data from sunflowers used as a reference plant species taylor and ashcroft 1972 field capacity is defined as the volumetric water content remaining in a soil profile two or three days after having been completely wetted with water and after free drainage beyond the root zone has become negligible veihmeyer and hendrickson 1949 soil science society of america 2008 the field drainage experiment is considered a benchmark method for determining θ fc which is certainly not exempt from criticism and appears a bit vague romano and santini 2002 assouline and or 2014 de jong van lier and wendroth 2016 the tacit assumption is that the soil profile is uniform initially fully saturated and subject only to gravity driven drainage regardless of the evapotranspiration flux which is assumed as zero even though definitions exist for θ fc or w fc and θ wp or w wp the concepts underlying these variables and their physical meanings are still a matter of debate gardner 1965 ritchie 1981 minasny and mcbratney 2003 garg et al 2020 torres et al 2021 turek et al 2022 cousin et al 2022 in situ drainage experiments are notoriously cumbersome although representative of actual field conditions and the condition of field capacity is attained when the drainage flux at the lower boundary of the soil profile is virtually null romano and santini 2002 synthetic drainage experiments can be used when the soil hydraulic properties are known beforehand and the zero flux and the unit or fixed total hydraulic gradient are set as the upper and lower boundaries of the flow domain respectively the θ fc value is computed when the water flux q at the bottom of the flow domain is equal to a predefined negligible drainage flux q fc twarakavi et al 2009 assouline and or 2014 reynolds 2018 inforsato and de jong van lier 2021 when this condition is attained the simulated profile average soil water content is often referred to as the flux based field capacity meyer and gee 1999 nasta and romano 2016 inforsato and de jong van lier 2021 choosing a negligible value for q fc is obviously arbitrary but another limitation arises when the synthetic drainage process is simulated in a layered heterogeneous soil profile which exhibits contrasting vertical textural properties and hydraulic characteristics when using field capacity as a hydraulic parameter in a bucket type hydrological model the soil component of the system is often conceptualized as a uniform homogeneous flow domain and this oversimplification can be considered acceptable if one is interested in computing the lumped water budget romano et al 2011 however when the concept of pawc is used to resolve agronomic problems water dynamics in layered soil profiles should be properly characterized by using a process oriented hydrological model based on the richards equation under these circumstances the determination of θ fc as a profile average value is not trivial and is rather weak as well so it becomes convenient to resort to the assessment of w fc nasta and romano 2016 irrigated agriculture in the high plains region of the united states mostly relies on aquifer depletion especially for maize production as this crop has high irrigation requirements to achieve maximum yield the average groundwater levels have declined significantly in the southern and central high plains i e texas oklahoma and kansas and parts of nebraska scanlon et al 2012 over the last decades excessive groundwater depletion has been exacerbated by frequent droughts induced by climate change rudnick et al 2019 overapplication of nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides is the primary source of groundwater contamination which further decreases the amount of water available for irrigation the challenge of irrigated agriculture is to identify a functional value for soil water storage at field capacity by preserving optimal root zone water contents so to avoid or at least minimize the onset of drought stress and excessive drainage and related contaminant transport towards the aquifer in this study hydrus 1d was used to simulate water flow and solute transport across a 135 cm thick agronomic layered soil profile beneath irrigated maize in eastern nebraska šimůnek et al 2016 in hydrus 1d irrigation timing is controlled by a depth specific user specified soil pressure head while the irrigation rate is set at prescribed values lena et al 2022 therefore the target of this synthetic approach was to perform a sensitivity analysis using different values of the user specified irrigation rate for maize and soil matric pressure head at a soil depth of 67 5 cm half of maize s maximum root depth a total of 24 values for water storage capacity at field capacity w fc were estimated and the optimal value was selected to minimize drought stress drainage flux to avoid local water waste and nitrate leachate to reduce contaminant vulnerability below the root zone the functional field capacity has been compared with the conventional synthetic drainage experiment and the challenge of estimating θ fc is discussed 2 experimental work and methods 2 1 environmental settings and data collection the study site is in eastern nebraska usa at the university of nebraska

comparison between observations and model simulations in the dormant season n 3702 was ignored in the inverse modeling since information on snow accumulation snow melting and soil freezing defrosting

the interface of the soil layers the value of θ fc cannot be computed as the integral mean of the water content profile recorded at a certain time 2 4 2 estimation of a functional field capacity condition from irrigation scheduling scenarios the initial and boundary conditions are the same as described in section 2 3 the soil hydraulic parameters θ s α n and k s of each soil layer were assessed according to the criteria described in section 2 3 to mitigate excessive crop water stress during the growing season hydrus 1d has the option to trigger a user specified irrigation rate irr s when a prescribed pressure head ψ p is reached at a given observation node irrigation starts after a user specified lag period at a user specified irrigation rate the duration of irrigation is also

capacity as the water storage w fc in the active root zone eq 16 was determined at the end of the synthetic irrigation event after 1 day as we set both duration and lag equal to 1 day the water and solute balance components were stored for each model simulation 3 results 3 1 model parameterization and water and nitrate balance in the irrigated plot whereas the hydrus 1d model uses the basic units of length in cm for convenience the water balance components are presented here as units of length in mm the optimized soil water retention parameters for each soil layer are reported in table 1 whereas fig 3 shows the comparison between observed and simulated soil water content values at the four soil depths of z 10 cm z 25 cm z 50 cm and z 100 cm the shape of the water retention curve is mostly influenced by the values of n and α featured in eq 4 the soil water retention function of the deepest soil layers z 75 135 cm has the lowest values of n and α and is characterized by a smooth decay in soil water content with increasing pressure head values the optimized values of θ s and k s show a decreasing pattern towards the deeper layers and this behavior is mainly induced by soil compaction turkeltaub et al 2020 the prediction performance rmse and r2 metrics reported in table 1 are fair despite the fact that we suspect the model was ill informed by the sensors located at two soil depths the removal of observed soil water content values in the last five years n 1098 at soil depths of 10 cm and 100 cm for suspicious malfunctioning especially the deepest layer see fig 3e enhanced the rmse and r2 values table 1 and proved to be satisfactory if compared to previous studies in agricultural fields wollschläger et al 2009 wöhling and vrugt 2011 ket et al 2018 sao et al 2021 the best kge was obtained in the deepest layer where soil water content was kept constantly near fully saturated conditions fig 3e in contrast the seasonal variability of the observed soil water content was difficult to match in the first three soil layers fig 3b d and this is depicted by relatively lower kge values table 1 this was corroborated by a scrutiny of the three kge scores r β and γ not reported in table 1 the correlation coefficients passed the 0 05 significance test in all layers and ranged between 0 435 in the second layer and 0 473 in the fourth layer the β values were close to unity for all layers indicating unbiased predictions while on the one hand r and β values were similar in all layers on the other hand γ values controlled kge along soil depth with the farthest γ 1 492 and the closest γ 0 984 from optimum γ 1 for the second and fourth layer respectively the variability of simulated water content values standard deviations of 0 0609 cm3 cm 3 0 0618 cm3 cm 3 0 0415 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0097 cm3 cm 3 at soil depths of 10 cm 25 cm 50 cm and 100 cm respectively was higher than the one of corresponding observations in the first three soil depths standard deviations of 0 0542 cm3 cm 3 0 0489 cm3 cm 3 0 0383 cm3 cm 3 and 0 0113 cm3 cm 3 at soil depths of 10 cm 25 cm 50 cm and 100 cm respectively the impact of tillage operations on soil porosity was ignored but we are aware that it might influence the soil hydraulic properties of the uppermost soil layer schlüter et al 2018 hu et al 2018 fu et al 2021 talukder et al 2022 the mean water balance in the irrigation seasons corresponding to the 100 day long period ranging from mid june to mid september in 2001 2020 is reported in table 2 the inter annual variability of water balance components was mainly controlled by rainfall variability which ranged from 50 4 mm to 248 6 mm with a mean value of 146 7 mm the amount of water supplied by rainfall in the irrigation season was not sufficient to meet the average crop specific potential evapotranspiration demand et c 236 8 mm as the total water supplied by precipitation and irrigation exceeded the crop water requirement during the irrigation season et a represented 92 of et c when using simulations with irrigation average annual drainage represented about 20 of precipitation and irrigation by inducing on average 0 376 mg cm 2 corresponding to 37 6 kg n ha 1 or 19 2 of applied fertilizer nitrate leachate the mean annual drought stress namely the difference between potential t p and actual t a transpiration was 19 1 mm and 36 0 mm with or without irrigation scheduling respectively reductions in drainage 8 5 mm and nitrate leaching 0 075 mg cm 2 or 7 5 kg n ha 1 are reported when removing the irrigation events table 2 3 2 estimation of flux based field capacity from drainage simulation scenarios the decrease in water storage over time derived from the simulation of the draining process across the layered soil profile is presented in fig 4a theoretically water storage and the corresponding drainage flux q at the bottom of the active root zone fig 4b decrease for very long periods we report the field capacity w fc at which q is equal to a predefined negligible flux q fc table 3 we report t fc values between 4 d and 391 d and corresponding w fc values between 60 4 cm and 39 2 cm at the maximum q fc 0 49 cm d 1 and minimum q fc 0 01 cm d 1 q fc values respectively only the first prescribed negligible flux provides a drainage time that is consistent with the classical definition given by i e the amount of water held in soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has materially decreased which usually takes place within 2 3 days after a rain or irrigation in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture fig 5 shows the vertical distribution of soil matric head and soil water content values at the eight drainage times listed in table 3 note that during the evolution of the drainage process soil matric head profiles are continuous in the entire flow domain whereas soil water content profiles are discontinuous across the interface of layers characterized by contrasting soil hydraulic properties romano et al 1998 in other words at a fixed drainage time t fc one can compute the profile averaged matric head but the discontinuity of water content profiles hinders the calculation of the integral mean for function θ z t fc in the entire flow domain this drawback raises further vagueness when assessing the soil water content at the condition of field capacity in the case of stratified soil profiles nevertheless due to similar soil hydraulic functions of the first three soil layers 75 cm z 0 cm see the hydraulic parameters in table 1 fig 5b shows that the resulting soil water contents across the soil layer boundaries vary little and therefore an average θ value can be assumed to be roughly representative from the soil surface z 0 to the soil depth of 75 cm especially for the times around 59 days after the initiation of the simulation nasta and romano 2016 3 3 estimation of functional field capacity from irrigation scheduling scenarios the results of the 24 synthetic irrigation scheduling scenarios are shown in fig 6 we calculated the water and nitrate balance components in the 100 day long irrigation season total irrigation amount irr number of irrigation events n actual transpiration t a drainage q and cumulative nitrate flux no3 flux the four prescribed matric pressure heads ψ p are distinguished by different colors in fig 6 and control the number of irrigation events fig 6b triggering irrigation at a low matric head value ψ p 900 cm yellow bars induced the lowest number of irrigation events n 5 and the lowest amount of total irrigation irr ranging from 27 mm to 162 mm in contrast triggering irrigation at a pressure head ψ p 300 cm green bars close to the beginning of drought stress induced the highest number of irrigation events n ranging from 14 to 30 and the largest amount of irrigation sums irr ranging from 154 mm to 423 mm t a and q were correlated with the total amount of irrigation fig 6a c d frequent irrigation applications green bars in fig 6a induced the largest t a and q sums green bars in fig 6c d the water q and nitrate leachate fluxes obtained by fixing irr s 0 5 cm d 1 and ψ p 300 cm were similar to those obtained without irrigation scheduling the irrigation management based on irr s 0 5 cm d 1 and ψ p 300 cm prevented the initiation of crop stress but would require many irrigation applications at the cost of obtaining the largest drainage and high nitrate contamination when irrigation was initiated under sub optimal water conditions ψ p 700 cm and ψ p 900 cm simulated t a and q were lower than those obtained with ψ p 300 cm nevertheless t a was quite insensitive to irrigation rates higher than 1 0 cm d 1 fig 6c d the nitrate leachate was correlated to drainage but also depended on the reaction parameters transforming urea into ammonium and ammonium into nitrate root nitrate uptake dynamics and fertilization timing and amount generally nitrate leachate ranged between 0 121 mg cm 2 or 12 1 kg n ha 1 and 0 611 mg cm 2 or 61 1 kg n ha 1 obtained when irr s 0 5 cm d 1 and for ψ p 700 cm and irr s 2 5 cm d 1 and for ψ p 500 cm respectively fig 6e the range of nitrate leachate presented in table 2 and fig 6e compares well to a similar field measurement based study in the region where measured nitrate leaching represented up to 27 of input for continuous maize klocke et al 1999 fig 7 shows the distribution of field capacity w fc values by considering all irrigation scheduling scenarios the mean of all field capacity values was 51 2 cm whereas the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles were 48 1 cm 51 4 cm and 54 6 cm respectively the median of field capacity values tended to increase with increasing prescribed pressure heads from 55 3 cm to 47 9 cm for ψ p 300 cm and ψ p 900 cm respectively and with increasing irrigation rates the pillar of more irrigation less drought stress more drainage and more nitrate leaching was generally valid and the choice of the best irrigation practice depended on the maximum amount of water the producers were willing to supply on the maximum crop yield which in turn depends on the relationship with actual rwu and on the maximum nitrate leachate allowed by local regulations when nitrate concentration in groundwater is above 10 mg l 1 the maximum contaminant level mcl and hazardous health effects become a concern among humans and animals https extensionpublications unl edu assets pdf g1784 pdf in light of these conditions the best irrigation scheduling irr 217 5 mm distributed in 21 events per irrigation season was determined when fixing ψ p 700 cm and irr s 1 0 cm d 1 this synthetic irrigation scenario ensured a rise in t a from 174 0 mm table 2 to 200 9 mm fig 6c in q from 38 6 mm table 2 to 59 9 mm fig 6d and in nitrate flux from 0 101 mg cm 2 table 2 to 0 253 mg cm 2 fig 6e the best irrigation scheduling scenario relied on a 217 5 mm irrigation amount by saving 72 5 mm in each season when compared to the 290 mm supplied by local producers and obtained t a representing about 96 of t p the simulated drainage q 59 9 mm and nitrate leaching 0 253 mg cm 2 were lower than those q 87 0 mm and 0 376 mg cm 2 simulated by using observed agronomic practices table 2 a range of plausible values for the functional root zone water storage was calculated using the student s t distribution for a 95 confidence interval obtaining average values between 49 7 and 50 3 cm corresponding approximately to 80 of saturation condition fig 8 shows an illustrative example of the irrigation application in 2002 by fixing ψ p 700 cm and supplying water at the rate irr s 1 0 cm d 1 on day 613 5 september 2002 et a was 0 24 cm d 1 and the profile average matric head ψ 741 1 cm therefore the irrigation event started because ψ p reached the threshold value of 700 cm at the soil depth of 67 5 cm then the irrigation application ended on day 614 6 september 2002 and both soil water content and matric pressure head values increased in the upper layers of the soil profile by sustaining et a 0 297 cm d 1 on day 615 7 september 2002 the uppermost portion of the root zone i e z between 0 cm and 40 cm rapidly desaturated under dry conditions as visualized by retreating orange curves in fig 8 nevertheless the soil water storage capacity ranged between 49 6 cm and 50 2 cm approximately at the field capacity condition by limiting drought stress and downward flux 4 discussion precision agriculture relies on efficient irrigation scheduling to apply water to crops at the right time and in the right amount graham et al 2022 srinivasan et al 2022 kumar et al 2022 smart irrigation enables farmers to save water without subjecting crops to moisture deficiency and adverse environmental impacts bwambale et al 2022 the functional field capacity blue box in fig 2b was derived from the optimal irrigation scheduling scenario by minimizing crop water stress excessive drainage and nitrate leaching in an agronomic layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska in this study we found a mean seasonal irrigation total of 217 5 mm distributed over 21 daily events on average simulated irrigation water was supplied every five days at a rate of 1 cm d 1 in mead irrigation usually ranges between 230 mm and 350 mm and is applied with a rate of 0 65 cm d 1 per 3 day long period to ensure a full rotation of the pivot due to its speed suyker and verma 2009 gibson et al 2017 frequent irrigation applications with relatively low rates are beneficial for crop growth but in practice might be affected by evaporation loss from the sprinklers therefore future studies should consider the tradeoff between maintenance factors and optimal irrigation scheduling nitrate leaching is controlled by fertilization timing and amount nitrogen transformations root nitrate uptake dynamics and water movement which in turn are influenced by the soil hydraulic properties of each soil layer atmospheric boundary conditions and irrigation management weitzman et al 2022 in this study nitrate leachate 0 252 mg cm 2 or 25 2 kg n ha 1 derived from the best irrigation scheduling scenario represents 13 of the fertilizer amount 1 95 mg cm 2 or 195 kg n ha 1 high transpiration fluxes favored by irrigation supply during the irrigation season induce root nitrate uptake rates at their maximum level by limiting nitrate migration below the root zone samani et al 2020 found mean annual nitrate leaching of 52 kg n ha 1 and 91 kg n ha 1 for continuous corn and for corn soybean rotation at mead ne we neglected the economic criterion of efficiency because costs and prices are volatile and fluctuate rapidly from year to year whereas the relationship between drought stress and crop yield needs to be carefully assessed in a follow up study sharma and irmak 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2021b crop yield was ignored in this study because it would require specific on farm measurements and a detailed crop growth model létourneau et al 2015 vogeler et al 2019 kelly et al 2023 the other model simulation red box in fig 2a refers to a synthetic drainage experiment enabling the flux based field capacity to be assessed the determination of the flux based field capacity is a non trivial task and should follow a standard protocol by removing as much as possible all vague criteria related to the duration of the synthetic drainage process veihmeyer and hendrickson 1949 ritchie 1981 wilcox 1959 assouline and or 2014 armindo and wendroth 2016 a further difficulty arises because real world soil profiles are layered rather than uniform nasta and romano 2016 that said we pose the following questions what is the negligible flux rate at which simulated drainage is assumed null what is the corresponding drainage time a first attempt is to take advantage of the information on soil water storage depletion over time this task can be performed using quantitative or qualitative techniques based on the soil water storage decay over time simulated during the synthetic drainage process a qualitative and somewhat subjective technique has been illustrated by zotarelli et al 2019 who reported a very practical but rather subjective way of detecting the condition of field capacity in actual agronomic soils as the point of intersection of the two tangents at the curve depicting the water storage depletion one tangent drawn some hours or a few days fast drainage slope and the other tangent drawn several days or even several months slow drainage slope after the start of drainage by applying this empirical approach to the soil water storage depletion curve shown in fig 4 it was found that the root zone water storage capacity at field capacity w fc is 53 7 cm about 25 days after the beginning of the model simulation a rough quantitative estimation of the drainage time t fc at the condition of field capacity was obtained by using the analytical method developed by ogata and richards 1957 and verified by wilcox 1959 the soil water storage depletion curve of fig 4 was interpolated with a power function w t 78 7 t 0 117 for t greater than 1 day whose derivative enabled us to obtain t fc 57 2 d by fixing the negligible drainage flux dw dt q fc 0 10 cm d 1 as suggested by meyer and gee 1999 and hence to obtain w fc 49 1 cm furthermore in most cases smart irrigation systems rely on low cost capacitance sensors to monitor soil water content at different soil depths across the soil profile therefore a convenient and practical rule to ascertain the condition of field capacity in the soil profile is to refer to the resolution of a sensor that expresses the extent to which the target variable can change to be recorded by the datalogger new generation capacitance sensors have a resolution of approximately 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and accounting for the simulation results this entails that the soil water storage depletion can no longer be detected at approximately 50 days after the initiation of the synthetic drainage process as a conclusive comment on the multiple aspects covered in this discussion section we point out that the flux based water storage at field capacity obtained from the synthetic drainage process is quite similar to the functional value of water storage capacity w fc 50 cm reported in table 3 at q fc 0 10 cm d 1 and t fc 59 days yet the drainage time at field capacity obtained from the synthetic drainage process should only be considered a fictitious parameter that allows comparing the two simulation scenarios used in this study see the schematics in fig 2 but certainly cannot correspond to the maximum interval allowed between irrigations i e the so called irrigation frequency if water is supplied at the rate irr s 1 0 cm d 1 5 conclusions efficient irrigation scheduling optimizes the application of water at the right time and in the right amount field capacity represents the threshold storage needed to control the optimal irrigation amount by limiting the negative effects related to underwatering and overwatering applying more than the required irrigation water triggers excessive drainage and nitrate leaching by contrast supplying inadequate irrigation amounts may lead to crop stress and a reduction in crop yield in this study we assessed the functional water storage at field capacity by minimizing crop water stress and potential negative effects on the environment such as excessive drainage and nitrate leaching in a layered soil profile beneath maize in eastern nebraska we tested 24 irrigation scheduling scenarios by changing irrigation timing and rate the lowest drought stress drainage and nitrate leachate were obtained by triggering irrigation near optimal conditions ψ p 300 cm for irrigation rates higher than 0 50 cm d 1 by contrast increasing the irrigation rates and amounts is detrimental in terms of drainage and groundwater contamination without further benefits for root water uptake therefore an optimal compromise was found when fixing irr s 1 0 cm d 1 and ψ p 700 cm the functional water storage field capacity w fc derived from this irrigation practice was between 49 70 and 50 30 cm but this value cannot be directly converted into soil water content at field capacity θ fc for the layered soil profile the synthetic drainage experiment is used for assessing the flux based field capacity that is obtained when the drainage flux at the lower boundary of the soil profile is approximately null the functional analysis carried out in this study is useful to correct the vagueness in the synthetic drainage process when the field capacity concept was adapted to practical agronomic heuristics this protocol can be transferred to other agricultural fields under different climates soil and crop characteristics moreover the implementation of improved irrigation scheduling schemes can help minimize adverse tradeoffs between water quality and water quantity that exist

bjornlund and pittock 2017 pittock et al 2018 this paper investigates whether crop production can effectively be decoupled from irrigated water consumption by quantifying trends using remote sensing data we focus on six government led irrigation schemes in southern africa fig 1 which received both a technological interventions in the form of intuitive soil monitoring tools chameleon sensor and fullstop wetting front detector stirzaker et al 2017 and b social interventions in the form of agricultural innovation platforms van rooyen et al 2017 these interventions occurred from 2013 table 1 the benefits of social and technological interventions in southern african irrigation schemes have been well described for example equipping and training farmers in the use of the chameleon and fullstop soil monitoring tools has been found to generally reduce over irrigation and optimise the quantity and timing of fertiliser applications stirzaker et al 2017 2020 2010 along with the soil monitoring tools engagement between value chain actors and smallholder irrigators enabled by agricultural innovation platforms have also been identified as leverage points which shifted irrigation schemes to more commercially oriented farming systems van rooyen et al 2017 2020 several surveys and field studies have estimated changes in crop productivity and water use following interventions surveys of smallholder farmers in the six irrigation schemes fig 1 reported a 50 reduction in the frequency of irrigation and an approximate doubling of yield pittock et al 2018 furthermore surveys and field estimation of crop yield irrigation frequency and irrigation volume at plots within the silalatshani landela block and mkoba fig 1 irrigation schemes found water productivity kilograms of harvestable yield per cubic metre of applied water increased by over 100 moyo et al 2020 moyo et al 2020 attributed this to both an increase in crop yield from improved agronomic management and reduced irrigation frequency surveys and field study results demonstrate water savings at the plot scale though it is unclear how this translates to crop productivity and water use at the entire scheme scale lankford et al 2020 provide a framework for examining interactions between irrigation efficiency at sub field field plot irrigation system scheme catchment and trans boundary basin spatial scales framing analyses within the context of these spatial scales enables better recognition and quantification of the paradox of irrigation efficiency whereby gains in irrigation efficiency that result in water savings at smaller scales may result in no savings or even greater water use at larger scales grafton et al 2018 however decoupling water use from crop productivity improvement has been reported in some regions and industries marston et al 2022 roth et al 2013 in the context of southern african irrigation schemes it may be hypothesised that water saved at the plot scale is redistributed to other plots leading to minimal net change in water use and greater overall crop production furthermore the irrigation schemes can support multiple cropping seasons per year though in some cases water scarcity in dry seasons have limited irrigators ability to grow multiple crops per year pittock et al 2018 an increase in within season within field irrigation efficiency could mean more water is available in other seasons thereby increasing the overall cropping frequency and possibly water consumption at irrigation schemes limited analyses have been conducted to investigate these phenomena it is therefore important to understand how plot scale efficiency gains translate at the scheme and catchment scale in southern africa so the likely outcomes and requirements of future interventions can be adequately planned for the aim of this paper is to investigate trends in crop productivity and water use at the irrigation scheme scale using remote sensing data estimation of

crop productivity was estimated using the cropland specific machine learning model for crop light use efficiency described in wellington et al wellington et al 2022b this approach produces more accurate estimates than the traditional stress scalar estimation of gpp by allowing light use efficiency to vary with crop development wellington et al 2022b a predictive model applicable to all crop types was used given the range and uncertainty of crops grown in each irrigation scheme table 1 light use efficiency was multiplied by absorbed photsynthetically active radiation apar to produce gpp apar was calculated as the product of photosynthetically active radiation par and the fraction of it absorbed by plants fpar par was defined as 48 of incoming solar radiation as per pysebal documentation pareeth 2020a wellington et al 2022b and fpar was calculated using a linear relationship to the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi from landsat images as defined in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 based on several crop experiments sebal inputs were downloaded as per guidance from the pysebal documentation pareeth 2020a this meant that collection 1 level 1 landsat images for the area of interest with less than 20 cloud cover were downloaded from the united states geological survey website from 1st january 2013 31 st december 2021 images from both landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used to optimise the temporal resolution of data over the period analysed as per previous analyses using pysebal jaafar and ahmad 2020 pysebal outputs have been found to be more consistent when landsat 7 bands were gapfilled using the focal function from the r package raster hijmans 2021 jaafar and ahmad 2020 to correct the scan line corrector failure therefore a 3 3 moving window was applied to landsat 7 bands using the focal function to fill pixels identified as having null values in r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 pysebal also requires 24 hour and instantaneous shortwave radiation wind speed air temperature air pressure and relative humidity inputs these were derived from the national aeronautics and space administration s global land data assimilation system gldas fang et al 2009 observations closest in time to the landsat overpass time were used as the instantaneous values while means were calculated across the 3 hourly observations for each day to form 24 hour average values a digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which determined the spatial bounds of the pysebal run farr and kobrick 2000 soil physical properties were taken from the hihydrosoil dataset de boer 2016 the landsat image climatic topographical and soil data inputs were run through the pysebal script to produce maps of et t and e pareeth 2020b a pysebal uses the dual source energy balance method described in boulet et al 2018 to partition et into e and t the resulting maps were then stacked to form a raster time series and clipped to the boundaries of irrigation schemes and blocks table 1 fig 1 using the raster r package hijmans 2021 data were then extracted from raster objects and reshaped for modelling of spatiotemporal patterns using dplyr wickham 2017 rainfall data was obtained for each scheme from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station dataset via the chirps r package de sousa et al 2020 rainfall for the 120 days preceding each landsat image acquisition date was clipped to the bounds of each irrigation scheme an exponential moving average lag function was applied to 30 60 90 and 120 days preceding each landsat acquisition data using the ttr r package ulrich 2021 2 2 modelling spatiotemporal patterns generalised additive models gams used to model patterns in crop production and water use wellington et al 2022a the bam function for fitting generalised additive models to large datasets from the r package mgcv wood 2006 wood and wood 2015 li and wood 2020 wood et al 2017 2015 was used to fit models with the following structure 1 z i e f μ i ϕ g μ i β f 1 y i f 2 m i f 3 s i f 4 y i m i f 5 s i y i f 6 r i where z i is a measure of gpp et e or t at the ith pixel ef μ i ϕ represents an exponential family distribution with mean μ i and scale parameter ϕ g is the log link function β is an intercept and f j j 1 6 are smooth functions that incorporate combinations of terms m i y i and s i that represent month year and spatial terms respectively and r i is the rainfall lag wellington et al 2022a a cubic regression smooth function was used for the main effect of year and rainfall lag cyclic cubic regression was applied to the main effect of month and spatial terms were fitted with gaussian process smooths wood 2006 royston and sauerbrei 2007 simpson 2018 paciorek 2003 the basis dimension values k which act as an upper limit on smooth function degrees of freedom were set to the number of unique years and months 50 for spatial terms and 30 for the rainfall term an autoregressive ar function was fitted to each model to accommodate any temporal autocorrelation the rainfall lag was determined by fitting models with each of the 30 60 90 and 120 lags the 90 day lag gave the lowest residual deviance across several irrigation schemes and response variables and was therefore applied to all models for consistency fitting year as parametric linear term replacing f 1 y i with y i to the model for each response variable at the landela block enabled the percentage linear change to be estimated inferences were drawn from the generalised additive models by inspecting the partial and summed effects of smooth terms these were extracted using mgcviz fasiolo et al 2020 and itsadug van rij et al 2015 and passed to ggplot2 wickham 2017 the autocorrelation function of the standardised residuals was examined and did not exhibit any temporal correlation a variogram of residuals was used to check for spatial dependencies which were negligible 3 results 3 1 gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration gpp and et varied between schemes and years gpp and t showed similar patterns across years confirming they are positively associated especially at 25 de setembro khanimambo kiwere and mkoba fig 2 e appeared to be more closely associated with gpp at magozi which grew rice under flood irrigation table 1 silalatshani was the only scheme where t exceeded e though this also occurred in early and later years at 25 de setembro t appeared to behave inversely to e at some schemes leading to relatively constant et across years this was especially evident at silalatshani and khanimambo fig 2 t was close to 0 when gpp was also close to 0 at khanimambo though reductions in e offset increases in t producing relatively constant et contrasting this changes in et between years appeared to be driven by e at magozi and kiwere additionally e and t varied positively rather than inversely at kiwere and mkoba fig 2 this suggests that relationships between crop production and water use vary widely between irrigation schemes estimated et at kiwere appears very high which could be associated with error and uncertainty in the pysebal et estimation 3 2 water use efficiency wue varied between irrigation schemes and across years 25 de setembro and silalatshani both had wue around or above 2 gc mm et wue at mkoba was also close to 2 gc mm and showed an increasing trend while the tanzanian schemes kiwere and magozi which both produced rice and other vegetable crops table 1 had lower wue khanimambo had wue close to 0 gc mm in some years which may have been related to flood damaged irrigation infrastructure table 1 but wue approached 1 gc mm in other years 3 3 landela block the landela block farmers at the north west of the silalatshani scheme table 1 fig 1 were the first to receive both the soil monitoring tools and agricultural innovation platforms from 2013 so the block serves as a useful case study wue initially decreased after 2013 however t showed an increasing trend over the period which was offset by a decreasing trend in e this occurred along with an increase in gpp from 2017 onwards giving an increase in wue notably et was relatively constant especially after 2014 meaning that changes in wue were driven by gpp rather than et fitting each variable as a linear term revealed gpp to be increasing at 4 8 per year and t increasing similarly at 4 6 per year e decreased at 13 5 per year giving a decrease in et of 3 6 per year these results demonstrate that crop production can increase without necessarily increasing et and that the ratio of e to t can change over time in association with changes in crop productivity so that t exceeds e as for the entirety of silalatshani fig 2 crop production and water use variables showed similar relative variation across space as they did across time fig 5 shows positive spatial association between t and gpp and an inverse association between t and e especially in the north east top right of the irrigation block where t and gpp were very low and e very high et showed less variation in space than its components e and t 4 discussion trends in crop production and water consumption at some southern african irrigation schemes suggest that an increase in crop production without an associated increase in et is possible increases in gpp were not associated with increases in et at some schemes such as silalatshani and khanimambo and the landela sub block of silalatshani this could be attributed to inverse trends in t and e fig 3 these examples demonstrate decoupling of crop production and water use at scheme scale however we did not find that et declined to the same degree that moyo et al 2020 reported for applied irrigation water at the plot scale at mkoba and silalatshani these findings can likely be reconciled by considering effects at different scales lankford et al 2020 for example water saved at plot scale may be reallocated to other plots or other seasons and therefore lead to fewer savings at scheme or block scale lankford et al 2020 and the paradox of irrigation efficiency often report fewer savings and even greater water use with improved water use efficiency at larger spatial scales grafton et al 2018 this was the case at 25 de setembro and kiwere where et appeared to increase with gpp fig 2 the relatively constant trend in et at landela fig 4 silalatshani and khanimambo relative to gpp fig 2 suggests that improvements in wue may not always result in greater water demands at the irrigation scheme and block scale in southern africa fig 5 these findings demonstrate that improvements in crop production are possible within existing infrastructure and water allocations in southern africa it is unclear how our findings at scheme scale would translate into crop production and water use patterns at catchment regional national and trans boundary scales lankford et al 2020 expansion of irrigated area might logically lead to hypotheses that water allocations to irrigation will increase while decoupling of water application and crop production has been reported for some countries and regions roth et al 2013 marston et al 2022 analyses across these scales have not yet been undertaken in southern africa out scaling of multi stakeholder approaches such as aips may reproduce the results observed here bjornlund et al 2020 however dissociation of gpp and et was not evident in all irrigation schemes and they appeared to be positively related at kiwere magozi and mkoba fig 3 further analysis at various spatial and temporal scales will better inform policy and investment into irrigated agriculture in southern africa neither remote sensing nor the prior field based analyses can attribute observed changes in farming systems to specific interventions it is likely that the soil monitoring tools and agricultural innovation platforms played some role in contributing to the observed patterns though other factors may also be responsible van rooyen et al van rooyen et al 2020 described unique leverage points identified by the agricultural innovation platforms at each scheme which shifted the schemes towards more productive and profitable complex systems surveys have indicated that farmers at the schemes value both the agronomic decision support provided by the soil monitoring tools pittock et al 2018 stirzaker et al 2010 and the systemic issues addressed by the agricultural innovation platforms van rooyen et al 2017 pittock et al 2018 effective and efficient out scaling of these interventions may lead to similar outcomes at other southern african irrigation schemes the use of remote sensing techniques means our methodology is highly scalable across space and time though it also introduces some limitations for example we have not accounted for water loss due to deep drainage or run off by using et as a measure of applied water consumption in field plot scale analyses such as those conducted by moyo et al 2020 are able to overcome these limitations but are less scalable improvement in remote sensing techniques and higher resolution products may enable field or plot scale analyses in smallholder irrigation schemes furthermore incorporation of variables such as soil moisture may enable more complete water accounting and estimation of applied water volumes through a crop season assessing crop growth as the gpp of all vegetation in a given irrigation scheme also means that the results may be partly confounded by changes in crop type and changes in weed growth for example high rates of plot abandonment were reported at silalatshani in 2013 and 2014 pittock et al 2018 moyo et al 2020 it is reasonable to assume that an irrigated managed crop will produced greater gpp than weeds in an abandoned plot though this may mean that the changes in gpp underestimate changes in crop output further farmers at silalatshani collectively opposed mandates to grow staple grain maize in 2016 and 2017 which may have contributed to lower gpp estimates for this period despite these limitations remote sensing estimates provide a useful approximation of crop growth and water consumption 5 conclusions in summary decoupling of crop production from irrigated water consumption was observed at some irrigation blocks and schemes in southern africa suggesting that agricultural intensification may not always result in increased water demands this counters the notion of a necessary trade off between sdg 2 zero hunger and sdg 6 clean water and sustainable water management which may arise due to the paradox of irrigation efficiency the biophysical explanation of decoupling is that t accounted for a greater proportion of et when gpp increased representing an improvement in wue therefore improved crop productivity may not necessarily result in greater demand for irrigation water at irrigation scheme scale future research and development initiatives may investigate why this only occurred at some irrigation schemes and identify efficient out scaling of technological and social interventions into other southern african irrigation schemes funding the research in this

8931,improving crop productivity is crucial to food security and rural livelihoods in southern africa however agricultural intensification at irrigation schemes may place greater demands on water resources even where water use efficiency wue is improved due to the paradox of irrigation efficiency we analysed trends in water use efficiency wue gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et evaporation e and transpiration t at six irrigation schemes which received technological and social interventions gpp was decoupled from et at some schemes for example at the landela sub block of the silalatshani irrigation scheme in zimbabwe gpp and t increased at 4 8 and 4 6 per year respectively conversely e decreased at 13 5 per year giving a 3 6 decrease in et per year from 2013 to 2021 this suggests that crop production can be decoupled from water consumption at southern african irrigation schemes meaning it is possible to produce more food with less water graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation water use efficiency southern africa evapotranspiration data availability all data and analysis code is available in the following github repository https github com mickwelli tisa scheme wue 1 introduction improvement of crop productivity in southern africa has been recognised as a key pathway to development and realising sustainable development goal sdg 2 zero hunger fischer et al 2014 nhemachena et al 2018 however increased food production may place greater demands on water resources sdg 6 is related to sustainable management of water so there may be a trade off between sdg 2 and 6 specifically sdg 6 4 1 refers to change in water use efficiency over time hellegers and van halsema 2021 though even where water use efficiency wue improves increased irrigated crop production through intensification can increase water demand this phenomenon has been attributed to jevon s paradox or more specifically described as the paradox of irrigation efficiency grafton et al 2018 sears et al 2018 this especially applies to smallholder irrigation schemes in southern africa due to considerable research and development investment to improve productivity and profitability bjornlund and pittock 2017 pittock et al 2018 this paper investigates whether crop production can effectively be decoupled from irrigated water consumption by quantifying trends using remote sensing data we focus on six government led irrigation schemes in southern africa fig 1 which received both a technological interventions in the form of intuitive soil monitoring tools chameleon sensor and fullstop wetting front detector stirzaker et al 2017 and b social interventions in the form of agricultural innovation platforms van rooyen et al 2017 these interventions occurred from 2013 table 1 the benefits of social and technological interventions in southern african irrigation schemes have been well described for example equipping and training farmers in the use of the chameleon and fullstop soil monitoring tools has been found to generally reduce over irrigation and optimise the quantity and timing of fertiliser applications stirzaker et al 2017 2020 2010 along with the soil monitoring tools engagement between value chain actors and smallholder irrigators enabled by agricultural innovation platforms have also been identified as leverage points which shifted irrigation schemes to more commercially oriented farming systems van rooyen et al 2017 2020 several surveys and field studies have estimated changes in crop productivity and water use following interventions surveys of smallholder farmers in the six irrigation schemes fig 1 reported a 50 reduction in the frequency of irrigation and an approximate doubling of yield pittock et al 2018 furthermore surveys and field estimation of crop yield irrigation frequency and irrigation volume at plots within the silalatshani landela block and mkoba fig 1 irrigation schemes found water productivity kilograms of harvestable yield per cubic metre of applied water increased by over 100 moyo et al 2020 moyo et al 2020 attributed this to both an increase in crop yield from improved agronomic management and reduced irrigation frequency surveys and field study results demonstrate water savings at the plot scale though it is unclear how this translates to crop productivity and water use at the entire scheme scale lankford et al 2020 provide a framework for examining interactions between irrigation efficiency at sub field field plot irrigation system scheme catchment and trans boundary basin spatial scales framing analyses within the context of these spatial scales enables better recognition and quantification of the paradox of irrigation efficiency whereby gains in irrigation efficiency that result in water savings at smaller scales may result in no savings or even greater water use at larger scales grafton et al 2018 however decoupling water use from crop productivity improvement has been reported in some regions and industries marston et al 2022 roth et al 2013 in the context of southern african irrigation schemes it may be hypothesised that water saved at the plot scale is redistributed to other plots leading to minimal net change in water use and greater overall crop production furthermore the irrigation schemes can support multiple cropping seasons per year though in some cases water scarcity in dry seasons have limited irrigators ability to grow multiple crops per year pittock et al 2018 an increase in within season within field irrigation efficiency could mean more water is available in other seasons thereby increasing the overall cropping frequency and possibly water consumption at irrigation schemes limited analyses have been conducted to investigate these phenomena it is therefore important to understand how plot scale efficiency gains translate at the scheme and catchment scale in southern africa so the likely outcomes and requirements of future interventions can be adequately planned for the aim of this paper is to investigate trends in crop productivity and water use at the irrigation scheme scale using remote sensing data estimation of spatiotemporal trends in crop production and water use is suited to remote sensing analysis which is highly scalable across time and space we measured crop productivity as gross primary productivity gpp crop water consumption as evapotranspiration et and its components evaporation from the soil surface e and transpiration from plant leaves t using remote sensing based models mul et al 2020 pareeth 2020a wellington et al 2022b although scalable and cost effective remote sensing methods are prone to greater inaccuracy and uncertainty than ground based measures we have therefore included measures of uncertainty where possible wue was defined as the ratio of gpp to et patterns in these variables across space and time were modelled using generalised additive models gams wellington et al 2022a wood 2006 wood et al 2017 inclusion of rainfall as a nuisance effect enabled trends in response variables to be attributed to changes in applied water examination of the partial effects of time and space revealed patterns in crop production water use and wue 2 methods 2 1 estimation of crop production and water use estimation of crop production and water use followed the water accounting methodology developed for the surface energy balance algorithm sebal implemented in python pysebal mul et al 2020 pareeth 2020a b allen et al 2011 except for estimation of gpp gpp as representative of crop productivity was estimated using the cropland specific machine learning model for crop light use efficiency described in wellington et al wellington et al 2022b this approach produces more accurate estimates than the traditional stress scalar estimation of gpp by allowing light use efficiency to vary with crop development wellington et al 2022b a predictive model applicable to all crop types was used given the range and uncertainty of crops grown in each irrigation scheme table 1 light use efficiency was multiplied by absorbed photsynthetically active radiation apar to produce gpp apar was calculated as the product of photosynthetically active radiation par and the fraction of it absorbed by plants fpar par was defined as 48 of incoming solar radiation as per pysebal documentation pareeth 2020a wellington et al 2022b and fpar was calculated using a linear relationship to the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi from landsat images as defined in bastiaanssen and ali 2003 based on several crop experiments sebal inputs were downloaded as per guidance from the pysebal documentation pareeth 2020a this meant that collection 1 level 1 landsat images for the area of interest with less than 20 cloud cover were downloaded from the united states geological survey website from 1st january 2013 31 st december 2021 images from both landsat 7 and landsat 8 were used to optimise the temporal resolution of data over the period analysed as per previous analyses using pysebal jaafar and ahmad 2020 pysebal outputs have been found to be more consistent when landsat 7 bands were gapfilled using the focal function from the r package raster hijmans 2021 jaafar and ahmad 2020 to correct the scan line corrector failure therefore a 3 3 moving window was applied to landsat 7 bands using the focal function to fill pixels identified as having null values in r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 pysebal also requires 24 hour and instantaneous shortwave radiation wind speed air temperature air pressure and relative humidity inputs these were derived from the national aeronautics and space administration s global land data assimilation system gldas fang et al 2009 observations closest in time to the landsat overpass time were used as the instantaneous values while means were calculated across the 3 hourly observations for each day to form 24 hour average values a digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm which determined the spatial bounds of the pysebal run farr and kobrick 2000 soil physical properties were taken from the hihydrosoil dataset de boer 2016 the landsat image climatic topographical and soil data inputs were run through the pysebal script to produce maps of et t and e pareeth 2020b a pysebal uses the dual source energy balance method described in boulet et al 2018 to partition et into e and t the resulting maps were then stacked to form a raster time series and clipped to the boundaries of irrigation schemes and blocks table 1 fig 1 using the raster r package hijmans 2021 data were then extracted from raster objects and reshaped for modelling of spatiotemporal patterns using dplyr wickham 2017 rainfall data was obtained for each scheme from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station dataset via the chirps r package de sousa et al 2020 rainfall for the 120 days preceding each landsat image acquisition date was clipped to the bounds of each irrigation scheme an exponential moving average lag function was applied to 30 60 90 and 120 days preceding each landsat acquisition data using the ttr r package ulrich 2021 2 2 modelling spatiotemporal patterns generalised additive models gams used to model patterns in crop production and water use wellington et al 2022a the bam function for fitting generalised additive models to large datasets from the r package mgcv wood 2006 wood and wood 2015 li and wood 2020 wood et al 2017 2015 was used to fit models with the following structure 1 z i e f μ i ϕ g μ i β f 1 y i f 2 m i f 3 s i f 4 y i m i f 5 s i y i f 6 r i where z i is a measure of gpp et e or t at the ith pixel ef μ i ϕ represents an exponential family distribution with mean μ i and scale parameter ϕ g is the log link function β is an intercept and f j j 1 6 are smooth functions that incorporate combinations of terms m i y i and s i that represent month year and spatial terms respectively and r i is the rainfall lag wellington et al 2022a a cubic regression smooth function was used for the main effect of year and rainfall lag cyclic cubic regression was applied to the main effect of month and spatial terms were fitted with gaussian process smooths wood 2006 royston and sauerbrei 2007 simpson 2018 paciorek 2003 the basis dimension values k which act as an upper limit on smooth function degrees of freedom were set to the number of unique years and months 50 for spatial terms and 30 for the rainfall term an autoregressive ar function was fitted to each model to accommodate any temporal autocorrelation the rainfall lag was determined by fitting models with each of the 30 60 90 and 120 lags the 90 day lag gave the lowest residual deviance across several irrigation schemes and response variables and was therefore applied to all models for consistency fitting year as parametric linear term replacing f 1 y i with y i to the model for each response variable at the landela block enabled the percentage linear change to be estimated inferences were drawn from the generalised additive models by inspecting the partial and summed effects of smooth terms these were extracted using mgcviz fasiolo et al 2020 and itsadug van rij et al 2015 and passed to ggplot2 wickham 2017 the autocorrelation function of the standardised residuals was examined and did not exhibit any temporal correlation a variogram of residuals was used to check for spatial dependencies which were negligible 3 results 3 1 gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration gpp and et varied between schemes and years gpp and t showed similar patterns across years confirming they are positively associated especially at 25 de setembro khanimambo kiwere and mkoba fig 2 e appeared to be more closely associated with gpp at magozi which grew rice under flood irrigation table 1 silalatshani was the only scheme where t exceeded e though this also occurred in early and later years at 25 de setembro t appeared to behave inversely to e at some schemes leading to relatively constant et across years this was especially evident at silalatshani and khanimambo fig 2 t was close to 0 when gpp was also close to 0 at khanimambo though reductions in e offset increases in t producing relatively constant et contrasting this changes in et between years appeared to be driven by e at magozi and kiwere additionally e and t varied positively rather than inversely at kiwere and mkoba fig 2 this suggests that relationships between crop production and water use vary widely between irrigation schemes estimated et at kiwere appears very high which could be associated with error and uncertainty in the pysebal et estimation 3 2 water use efficiency wue varied between irrigation schemes and across years 25 de setembro and silalatshani both had wue around or above 2 gc mm et wue at mkoba was also close to 2 gc mm and showed an increasing trend while the tanzanian schemes kiwere and magozi which both produced rice and other vegetable crops table 1 had lower wue khanimambo had wue close to 0 gc mm in some years which may have been related to flood damaged irrigation infrastructure table 1 but wue approached 1 gc mm in other years 3 3 landela block the landela block farmers at the north west of the silalatshani scheme table 1 fig 1 were the first to receive both the soil monitoring tools and agricultural innovation platforms from 2013 so the block serves as a useful case study wue initially decreased after 2013 however t showed an increasing trend over the period which was offset by a decreasing trend in e this occurred along with an increase in gpp from 2017 onwards giving an increase in wue notably et was relatively constant especially after 2014 meaning that changes in wue were driven by gpp rather than et fitting each variable as a linear term revealed gpp to be increasing at 4 8 per year and t increasing similarly at 4 6 per year e decreased at 13 5 per year giving a decrease in et of 3 6 per year these results demonstrate that crop production can increase without necessarily increasing et and that the ratio of e to t can change over time in association with changes in crop productivity so that t exceeds e as for the entirety of silalatshani fig 2 crop production and water use variables showed similar relative variation across space as they did across time fig 5 shows positive spatial association between t and gpp and an inverse association between t and e especially in the north east top right of the irrigation block where t and gpp were very low and e very high et showed less variation in space than its components e and t 4 discussion trends in crop production and water consumption at some southern african irrigation schemes suggest that an increase in crop production without an associated increase in et is possible increases in gpp were not associated with increases in et at some schemes such as silalatshani and khanimambo and the landela sub block of silalatshani this could be attributed to inverse trends in t and e fig 3 these examples demonstrate decoupling of crop production and water use at scheme scale however we did not find that et declined to the same degree that moyo et al 2020 reported for applied irrigation water at the plot scale at mkoba and silalatshani these findings can likely be reconciled by considering effects at different scales lankford et al 2020 for example water saved at plot scale may be reallocated to other plots or other seasons and therefore lead to fewer savings at scheme or block scale lankford et al 2020 and the paradox of irrigation efficiency often report fewer savings and even greater water use with improved water use efficiency at larger spatial scales grafton et al 2018 this was the case at 25 de setembro and kiwere where et appeared to increase with gpp fig 2 the relatively constant trend in et at landela fig 4 silalatshani and khanimambo relative to gpp fig 2 suggests that improvements in wue may not always result in greater water demands at the irrigation scheme and block scale in southern africa fig 5 these findings demonstrate that improvements in crop production are possible within existing infrastructure and water allocations in southern africa it is unclear how our findings at scheme scale would translate into crop production and water use patterns at catchment regional national and trans boundary scales lankford et al 2020 expansion of irrigated area might logically lead to hypotheses that water allocations to irrigation will increase while decoupling of water application and crop production has been reported for some countries and regions roth et al 2013 marston et al 2022 analyses across these scales have not yet been undertaken in southern africa out scaling of multi stakeholder approaches such as aips may reproduce the results observed here bjornlund et al 2020 however dissociation of gpp and et was not evident in all irrigation schemes and they appeared to be positively related at kiwere magozi and mkoba fig 3 further analysis at various spatial and temporal scales will better inform policy and investment into irrigated agriculture in southern africa neither remote sensing nor the prior field based analyses can attribute observed changes in farming systems to specific interventions it is likely that the soil monitoring tools and agricultural innovation platforms played some role in contributing to the observed patterns though other factors may also be responsible van rooyen et al van rooyen et al 2020 described unique leverage points identified by the agricultural innovation platforms at each scheme which shifted the schemes towards more productive and profitable complex systems surveys have indicated that farmers at the schemes value both the agronomic decision support provided by the soil monitoring tools pittock et al 2018 stirzaker et al 2010 and the systemic issues addressed by the agricultural innovation platforms van rooyen et al 2017 pittock et al 2018 effective and efficient out scaling of these interventions may lead to similar outcomes at other southern african irrigation schemes the use of remote sensing techniques means our methodology is highly scalable across space and time though it also introduces some limitations for example we have not accounted for water loss due to deep drainage or run off by using et as a measure of applied water consumption in field plot scale analyses such as those conducted by moyo et al 2020 are able to overcome these limitations but are less scalable improvement in remote sensing techniques and higher resolution products may enable field or plot scale analyses in smallholder irrigation schemes furthermore incorporation of variables such as soil moisture may enable more complete water accounting and estimation of applied water volumes through a crop season assessing crop growth as the gpp of all vegetation in a given irrigation scheme also means that the results may be partly confounded by changes in crop type and changes in weed growth for example high rates of plot abandonment were reported at silalatshani in 2013 and 2014 pittock et al 2018 moyo et al 2020 it is reasonable to assume that an irrigated managed crop will produced greater gpp than weeds in an abandoned plot though this may mean that the changes in gpp underestimate changes in crop output further farmers at silalatshani collectively opposed mandates to grow staple grain maize in 2016 and 2017 which may have contributed to lower gpp estimates for this period despite these limitations remote sensing estimates provide a useful approximation of crop growth and water consumption 5 conclusions in summary decoupling of crop production from irrigated water consumption was observed at some irrigation blocks and schemes in southern africa suggesting that agricultural intensification may not always result in increased water demands this counters the notion of a necessary trade off between sdg 2 zero hunger and sdg 6 clean water and sustainable water management which may arise due to the paradox of irrigation efficiency the biophysical explanation of decoupling is that t accounted for a greater proportion of et when gpp increased representing an improvement in wue therefore improved crop productivity may not necessarily result in greater demand for irrigation water at irrigation scheme scale future research and development initiatives may investigate why this only occurred at some irrigation schemes and identify efficient out scaling of technological and social interventions into other southern african irrigation schemes funding the research in this

8932,as an effect of climate change a considerable increase in irrigation demand is expected in subhumid regions this poses a future challenge for agriculture which often does not meet the requirements for highly efficient irrigation management field experiments in combination with modelling approaches can help in the development and evaluation of alternative irrigation strategies the aim of this study was to parameterize the fao aquacrop model for soybeans in order to evaluate irrigation systems and strategies used by farmers in austria moreover this study aims at proposing a deficit irrigation strategy to increase irrigation water productivity wpirrig three irrigation methods were investigated sprinkler drip and hose reel boom rainfed conditions were also assessed data sets from 2018 and 2019 were used for the parameterization of aquacrop based on threshold values for the percentage of readily available water raw full and deficit irrigation strategies were defined and tested for the years 1990 2019 the parameterization results showed good agreement between the simulated and observed canopy cover and yields from the four water management practices with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients between 0 76 and 0 96 large errors resulted from the soil water content simulations mainly due to poor sensor performance it was concluded that a moderate deficit with raw thresholds of 150 and 140 for the vegetative and reproductive stages respectively was an adequate strategy to improve yields and wpirrig conversely a severe deficit with an irrigation threshold of 180 raw throughout the season considerably reduced yields especially in years with high irrigation demand moreover a significant improvement in wpirrig was observed when drip systems were used compared to sprinklers due to the higher efficiency of the former these results can help scheduling irrigation for soybeans and increasing wpirrig thereby reducing pressure on limited water resources keywords aquacrop deficit irrigation readily available water irrigation scheduling drip sprinkler data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is responsible for a large percentage of freshwater consumption it is well known that irrigation is essential for crop production in dry regions however irrigation requirements have also increased rapidly in humid areas mainly due to a severe precipitation deficit and increment of air temperature produced by climate change in humid areas of central europe for example irrigation requirements are expected to continue increasing as climate change progresses busschaert et al 2022 similarly an increment of extreme weather events such as droughts floods storms and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change which can affect agricultural production for example the global drought observatory gdo reported that the summer droughts of 2022 caused water and heat stress that substantially reduced crops yields across europe the most affected crops were grain maize soybean and sunflower toreti et al 2022 according to the ipcc ar6 report ipcc 2022 agricultural production losses will progress for most european areas over the 21st century as a consequence of heat waves drought and high risk of water scarcity consequently adaptation measures in agriculture are needed to deal with the increasing stress in water resources this includes advances in irrigation strategies besides the negative impacts of climate change on water resources availability inefficient irrigation water application constitutes a major problem in agricultural regions since it contributes to water losses according to an eu report eprs 2019 savings of over 40 of the volume of water abstracted can be achieved by improving the delivery and application efficiency of irrigation systems changing practices planting drought resistant crops and reusing treated water therefore significant water savings could be achieved with improvements in irrigation management in austria for example an average of 69 million m³ of water is currently used for irrigation from which about 64 million m³ are taken from groundwater the irrigation demand is expected to almost double by 2050 about 90 of the areas equipped with irrigation and actually irrigated approximately 116 050 ha as of 2013 are concentrated in eastern austria lindinger et al 2021 irrigation volumes vary greatly due to annual weather conditions and can be up to eight times higher in dry years than in years when annual precipitation reaches averages of 500 mm lindinger et al 2021 farmers irrigation strategies in this region rely mostly on experience and rainfall patterns from previous years this approach primarily based on the empirical or heuristic knowledge of the farmer represents a risk especially under current climate change conditions of dry summers with uncertain precipitation distribution in the event of an oversupply of irrigation water there is a risk of soil water loss due to deep drainage and even a washout of nutrients and nitrate leakage the latter could lead to contamination of aquifers thompson et al 2020 on the other hand a reduced water supply increases the risk of drought stress resulting in loss of amount and quality of yield soybean yield reduction in austria is an example of the consequences of crop water related stress produced by unsuitable irrigation management under a changing environment soybean cultivation in austria started to intensify in 2011 with an increase in cultivation area throughout the years fogelberg and recknagel 2017 however considerable soybean yield reductions have been reported in the last decade statistik austria 2018 for example the soybean fields had a significantly larger crop water demand in 2018 than other crops in austria which was not satisfied by precipitation migdall et al 2022 an irrigation schedule can be evaluated by quantifying the output at the end of the season including crops yield and total water use for example water productivity wp is the ratio between the yield obtained versus the water used to produce that yield pereira et al 2012 wp can be obtained in terms of irrigation in which case it is it is denoted as wpirrig and it is calculated as the ratio between the yield produced by a crop along the growing season and the irrigation water used iwu in the same period wpirrig depends among other factors on irrigation management consequently wpirrig can be improved by optimizing the irrigation scheduling in such way that the crops take maximum advantage of the irrigation water applied deficit irrigation is an example of a well studied technique for making better use of irrigation water especially in areas with highly limited water resources it consists in the application of water below the crop evapotranspiration requirements fereres and soriano 2007 for the proper application of deficit irrigation it is important to be aware of the crop stages when water stress has less negative impact on the final yield so that irrigation events can be planned accordingly payero et al 2005 for soybeans the crop stages when the water stress is most critical correspond to the period from flowering to grain filling karam et al 2005 in a subhumid environment demirtaş et al 2010 observed the largest wpirrig on soybeans under water stress during the vegetative stage of development v5 5th node on the main stem beginning with the unifoliate note on the other hand single or multiple water stress treatments applied during reproductive development stages flowering r2 pod elongation r4 or seed enlargement r6 resulted in significant reductions of seed yield demirtaş et al 2010 under dry conditions in nebraska seasonal rainfall between of 149 and 317 mm during the studied years payero et al 2005 concluded that delaying irrigation until the beginning of flowering or later growth stages resulted in early stress which decreased seasonal evapotranspiration that lead to yield reduction there are few studies dealing with deficit irrigation strategies for soybeans in subhumid areas in general mainly because water scarcity is a recent issue in these regions sincik et al 2008 marković et al 2016 for example marković et al 2016 observed higher wpirrig for soybeans under deficit irrigation compared to full supplemental irrigation in a subhumid area of croatia in austria there are no studies to our knowledge that investigate the feasibility of applying deficit irrigation for any crop therefore more scientific efforts are necessary to investigate the benefits that advanced and sustainable irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation can bring in terms of water productivity in subhumid regions the development and adoption of irrigation strategies with the purpose of improving water productivity need experimentation however these type of experiments require a lot of time effort and resources therefore for practical reasons the development of irrigation strategies can be achieved through modelling modelling studies carried out in agricultural areas of austria are mainly focused on water productivity predictions based on future climate scenarios eitzinger et al 2001 alexandrov et al 2002 these studies provide an interesting and certainly useful overview of the possible outcomes from future water scarcity conditions in general these studies recommend improvements in irrigation management however they do not develop or provide information about irrigation strategies based on water content thresholds and consequent water productivity therefore it is necessary to explore more in detail the use of models to simulate irrigation schedules that improve water productivity models that combine crop physiological and soil hydrological processes can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling thereby improving water productivity for example the aquacrop is a crop growth model developed by the food and agriculture organization fao that simulates yield response to water for a variety of crops by using an empirical and mechanistic approach steduto et al 2012 aquacrop combines robustness accuracy and simplicity since it requires few explicit parameters and largely intuitive variables steduto et al 2009 the model has been used for simulating crop development biomass and yield of many crops including soybeans showing satisfactory results paredes et al 2015 adeboye et al 2017 adeboye et al 2019 studies indicate that the model performance decreases as water deficit increases khoshravesh et al 2013 adeboye et al 2017 giménez et al 2017 silva et al 2017 nevertheless there is agreement that the model is a useful tool for irrigation management when properly calibrated and validated the model facilitates the assessment of deficit irrigation strategies that otherwise would require great effort and expenses to perform for example it is possible to indicate in the model the irrigation timing based on readily available water raw and total available water taw thresholds below which a crop begins to experience water stress deficit irrigation strategies established using raw thresholds can provide a remarkable improvement in wpirrig for water saving strategies ket et al 2018 additionally aquacrop can be used to simulate the net irrigation requirements nir of a crop and these results can be used to make decisions about irrigation management for example nunes et al 2021 used the model to investigate optimal planting dates for cowpea based on simulations of nir similarly paredes and torres 2017 obtained the seasonal nir for a long term data series in aquacrop and classified the demand of crop water based on an empirical frequency distribution in general the aquacrop model has been used mainly to assess yield response to water in dry environments therefore the use of the model in subhumid areas in central europe will provide alternatives to improve water management in the region for example an important application of aquacrop to improve irrigation management decisions is the dynamic use of the model to adapt threshold values depending on changes in the climatic conditions additionally the model is relatively easy to handle compared to sophisticated numerical models which require extensive theoretical background and complex calibration therefore from the practitioner s point of view it represents a practical alternative similarly coupling sensors that are easy to manage and maintain into the decision support system can result economically and environmentally advantageous over more traditional irrigation management practices in this regard numerous studies suggested that the decision making process in irrigation can be improved by using real time measurements from sensors strategically distributed in the field in austria the use of sensors for irrigation management started to get relevance in the past two decades e g cepuder 2004 cepuder and nolz 2007 nolz et al 2016 nolz and kammerer 2017 morales santos and nolz 2023 however studies about the use of sensors to monitor soil water content in the root zone and the use of this feedback to trigger irrigation are lacking it is therefore necessary to investigate this alternative to provide further guidance to practitioners about the detection of irrigation timing in the field according to pre defined thresholds investigation and evaluation of common site based irrigation management and possible adaptation strategies such as deficit irrigation are necessary to improve water productivity in the future in this context models can help to incorporate specific irrigation thresholds and assess long term effects therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to parameterize the aquacrop model for soybeans under different water management practices in a subhumid climate 2 to simulate the net irrigation requirements of soybean under subhumid conditions 3 to assess the impact of deficit irrigation with different irrigation systems on soybean yield and water productivity from this recommendations are derived for implementing deficit irrigation strategies that can help farmers make irrigation management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study site the study site was located at the landwirtschaftliche fachschule obersiebenbrunn agricultural school obersiebenbrunn lfs in lower austria 48 15 49 8 n 16 42 01 7 e elevation 151 m a s l the data used for the aquacrop parametrization were obtained from an experiment conducted during 2018 and 2019 in that location the climate of the region is characterized as subhumid between 1991 and 2020 the average annual precipitation p and mean air temperature t in the area were 560 mm and 11 8 c respectively according to data from a weather station in groß enzersdorf 48 11 58 9 n 16 33 33 1 e elevation 154 m a s l circa 16 km south west from the study site and in the same country region the weather station at groß enzersdorf belongs to geosphere austria the official meteorological network of the country and the climate as well as the land use in this town has the same characteristics as in obsersiebenbrunn precipitation air temperature and relative humidity rh were measured at a weather station close to the field approximately 1 km solar radiation rs and wind speed u2 were obtained from the weather station at groß enzersdorf the meteorological data were converted from hourly to daily intervals and used to compute the reference evapotranspiration eto mm using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the daily maximum and minimum temperatures tmax and tmin p and eto from 1 april to 15 october are shown in fig 1 for the studied years of 2018 and 2019 the study site is located in the agricultural area of the marchfeld where the soils predominately belong to the chernozem type based on the fao world soil classification iuss working group wrb 2015 the texture class and other physical properties of the soil at different depths were determined in the laboratory to determine the particle size distribution disturbed soil samples were collected with an auger from five depths i e 0 15 15 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm the samples were analyzed in the laboratory by combining sieving and sedimentation methods the particles with diameter 2000 µm were wet sieved through stainless steel sieves into grain size fractions 63 125 125 200 200 630 630 1000 and 1000 2000 µm önorm l1061 1 2002 the finer particles with diameter 63 µm were fractionated into four fractions 2 2 6 3 6 3 20 and 20 63 µm by sedimentation using the pipette method after kubiena önorm l1061 2 2002 the texture was classified according to önorm l1050 in order to compare the soil texture results with international literature and to use them as input data in the aquacrop model the percentages of soil though the limits for every sample were converted to the classification system developed by the united states department of agriculture usda the conversion was made in excel using a log linear interpolation nemes et al 1999 the main difference between the austrian and usda classification is the silt sand limit which is 2 50 µm for the latter soil science division staff 2018 undisturbed samples were taken down to 60 cm in four depths 0 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 70 cm using metallic cylinders with a volume of 200 cm3 to determine the soil water retention characteristics and bulk density ρb the undisturbed samples were placed in rectangular containers and saturated gradually by adding water until the water level was constant which occurred in a time lapse between 48 and 72 h once saturated the samples were put into a pressure plate apparatus ppa to obtain the water retention properties of the soil in doing so the volumetric water content of a sample was related to the respective equilibrium pressure the mass after the saturation procedure was used to calculate the volumetric water content at saturation θsat to calculate volumetric water content at field capacity θfc and permanent wilting point θpwp the mass values at 10 and 1500 kpa pressure were used respectively the available water capacity θawc was then calculated by subtracting the θpwp from θfc the undisturbed samples were then dried in the oven for 24 48 h to calculate the bulk density ρb by dividing the dry soil mass by the volume of the soil i e volume of the metallic cylinder the ρb corresponding to the soil depth of 90 120 cm was assumed to be the same as in the 60 90 cm soil depth the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was estimated from pedotransfer functions by using rosetta program schaap et al 2001 the input parameters used for prediction of ksat were sand silt clay and ρb details of the soil physical properties are listed in table 1 2 2 description of the experiments soybean varieties antonia mg 000 and lenka mg 00 were planted on 26 april 2018 and on 8 may 2019 respectively the maturity levels of varieties in mg 000 range from 2 to 4 whereas those of mg 00 from 5 to 7 varieties antonia and lenka belong to levels 4 and 6 respectively which indicates that the former will ripen a few days earlier than the latter additionally soybeans in mg 000 and mg 00 differ on seeding rates as the former yields 4 5 and the latter 4 packages of 150 000 grains respectively in both years a precision seeder was used 80 grains m 2 with a row spacing of 50 cm and seeding depth of 5 cm the final plant density was approximately 40 plants per m2 the study site had a total area of 120 120 m2 and was divided into four rectangular plots three of which were irrigated and one was rainfed water was applied to the crops differently in each of the irrigated plots the irrigation systems used were a boom in the bi plot sprinklers in the si plot and drip lines in the di plot the rainfed plot is referred to as ni i e non irrigated plot in this paper the length of each plot was 120 m and the respective widths for each plot were 17 m for the di 25 m for the ni 18 m for the si and 60 m for the bi plot a scheme of the experimental site can be found in morales santos and nolz 2023 the details about the irrigation systems in each plot are shown in table 2 the irrigation events were scheduled by the farmers that work at the agricultural school based on their experience for more details about the irrigation management and the experimental site see morales santos and nolz 2023 the farmers measured the gross irrigation volumes of the individual systems and events with flowmeters however net amounts were required for the analysis therefore to account for irrigation losses related to e g management of the systems leakage evaporation or seepage irrigation efficiency coefficients were applied to the gross irrigation amounts the efficiency values were taken from literature and approximate the real efficiency of the systems for the sprinkler and drip systems 60 and 90 efficiencies were considered respectively based on the study by howell 2005 the efficiency of the hose reel boom was assumed to be similar to that of a lateral move irrigation spray heads with hose feed being 90 howell 2005 table 3 shows the irrigation dates and irrigation amounts for the two seasons throughout the 2019 growing season canopy cover cc and leaf area index lai were measured cc was monitored using canopeo application for mobile phones patrignani and ochsner 2015 until the crops reached full cc i e approximately 95 cc in the irrigated plots lai data were collected until senescence stage with an accupar par lai ceptometer model lp 80 meter group inc usa before the first irrigation event four cc and four lai measurements were collected in different parts of the field on dap 42 and 57 after the first irrigation was applied in all plots five to eight measurements per plot were collected this procedure was followed on dap 69 and 76 for both cc and lai whereas on dap 84 91 104 and 125 only lai was measured since cc was monitored until dap 76 and no measurements were taken during most of the crop maturity and senescence cc was calculated for those stages using lai data this was achieved by relating all lai and cc data pairs empirically using the program curveexpert basic hyams 2017 and following the procedure used by farahaniandet al 2009 and adeboye et al 2017 1 cc 1 exp α l ai where α non dimensional is a fitting parameter of the exponential function after the fitting α resulted in 0 53 which is close to the α value of 0 46 that adeboye et al 2017 used for soybeans therefore eq 1 was used to estimate cc for eight days dap 42 57 69 76 84 91 104 and 125 before harvesting in 2019 the plants in 1 m2 for each plot were taken as above ground biomass samples the plant samples were weighed and dried in an aerated oven for 72 h and weighed again to determine the dry above ground biomass b a plot harvester was used to obtain the yield on 27 september 2018 and 3 october 2019 the grain yields were harvested in dry conditions approximately 12 of water content the harvest index for variety lenka 2019 was calculated from the biomass and yield data a monitoring station was installed at each plot in the study site during both crop seasons the monitoring stations consisted of a wireless sensor network that collected processed and stored data every 15 min the data was visualized and retrieved from the online platform of adcon addvantage 6 6 adcon telemetry 2015 each station included one sm1 probe adcon telemetry by ott hydromet gmbh austria which is a multi sensor capacitance probe encapsulated in a pvc tube ott hydromet gmbh 2015 that measures soil water content swc the sm1 probe comprises cylindrical sensor electrodes on a circuit board with a 10 cm spacing between sensors in this study four sm1 of 90 cm length were used which contained nine sensors each the sensor readings of the sm1 were given in so called scaled frequency units sfu intended to represent soil moisture from zero to 100 ott hydromet gmbh 2015 to be able to relate the sensor readings to water content and increase accuracy a soil specific calibration procedure for the four sm1 probes was performed in the laboratory see appendix soil water content swc for every 10 cm depth was calculated from the calibrated sm1 measurements and added to obtain the swc within the root zone as follows 2 swc i 1 n θ i z i in eq 2 swc is total soil water content in the root zone mm θi the water content for soil layer i cm3 cm 3 z the soil depth or layer i mm and n the number of soil layers within the root zone 2 3 aquacrop model parameterization the aquacrop model is a crop growth water driven model developed by the fao division for land and water that uses an empirical and mechanistic approach to simulate yield response to water steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2018 aquacrop uses daily steps to compute crop evapotranspiration etc by treating crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es separately to calculate tc mm the model uses a cc development function which changes depending on three growth phases of the crop using the following equation 3 t c cc k ctr x et o where cc is the canopy cover adjusted by the microadvective effects kctr x the maximum transpiration coefficient non dimensional and the eto the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration mm estimated from the specific climatic data of the study site as of es aquacrop considers it proportional to the area of soil not covered by the canopy but also adjusted empirically for effects of microadvection as detailed in raes et al 2009 the response of crop to water deficits is simulated by the model through a stress coefficient ks 0 1 non dimensional that is function of fractional available soil water regulated by evaporative demand of the atmosphere the level of crop to water stress is reflected in for four key plant processes canopy expansion stomata control of transpiration canopy senescence and harvest index with specific stress coefficients for the former three processes in aquacrop the water productivity is normalized for climate based on the atmospheric evaporative demand as defined by eto and the co2 concentration of the atmosphere using the normalized water productivity wp the model calculates the biomass b for daily transpiration finally the crop yield y is then calculated as a harvestable fraction of the final above ground biomass for a detailed explanation of the calculation scheme of aquacrop see steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 in this study aquacrop was used to simulate growth and water uptake of soybeans under different irrigation strategies and rainfed conditions represented in four plots bi di si and ni the soybean file included in aquacrop contains parameters that have been calibrated and validated for several locations during the development of the model as well as in previous studies e g paredes et al 2015 adeboye et al 2017 adeboye et al 2019 therefore to adapt the crop characteristics to the specific conditions of this study a parameterization process was performed following the guidelines presented in steduto et al 2012 this process consists in adjusting the nonconservative crop parameters according to field observations and literature in this regard the input data for the parameterization included for example the planting date number of plants per hectare and the starting and duration of the phenological stages such as crop emergence flowering and yield formation which were obtained from field observations and supplementary soybean specific information described in the reference manual of aquacrop raes et al 2018 table 4 shows crop development details during broth growing seasons similarly the parameters related to cc development including maximum canopy cover canopy growth and canopy decline coefficients were adjusted from the default values according to the cc data collected in 2019 over the irrigated plots i e bi di and si described in section 2 2 the harvest index was modified after calculating the ratio between yield and biomass data observed in 2019 the maximum rooting depth was defined from soil water content evolution data throughout the growing season down to 1 m depth a calibration of three crop stress related parameters was performed in order to adapt the stress response of soybeans under subhumid conditions these stress parameters were adjusted to values within a reasonable range until the model simulations matched the field observations from the rainfed plot ni a similar approach to estimate stress thresholds was used by silva et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 an adjustment of the parameters related to water stress conditions for soybean is also suggested in the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2018 as the default values of these parameters have a minimum degree of calibration the refinement of the crop stages durations cc development and stress parameters was conducted through a trial and error procedure to guarantee the best performance between simulated and observed cc in addition to the crop data the model input included combined climate files from the weather stations at groß enzersdorf and obersiebenbrunn see section 2 1 containing meteorological variables to calculate eto the default co2 concentration of the model database was used the irrigation schedules described in table 3 were specified for each plot regarding the soil the hydraulic parameters listed in table 1 were used to characterize the soil down to 120 m groundwater levels were obtained from database measured by the national hydrological monitoring network of austria ehyd according to these data the average groundwater table in 2018 and 2019 was 3 6 m and 3 7 m respectively the 2018 climate and irrigation data were used for the model validation the only modifications made to the parameterized crop file from 2019 in order to model the crop in 2018 were the planting date and the reference harvest index the reference harvest index in 2019 corresponds to the ratio between observed yield and biomass data while for 2018 it was adjusted according to literature raes et al 2018 krisnawati and adie 2015 to define the initial conditions of the soil in both years a date prior to planting was identified in which the soil was considered to be at field capacity due to the rainfall regime i e april 1 2018 and april 30 2019 2 4 performance assessment of the aquacrop model the assessment of the model performance for the 2019 dataset was done by comparing observed and simulated values of cc swc y and b for the 2018 dataset only swc and y simulations were assessed due to lack of cc and b observed data from that year the following statistical indicators were used to assess the goodness of fit of the model the normalized root mean square error nrmse which reflects the difference between field observations and results of simulations relative to the mean of the observed data 4 nrmse 1 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n where oi is the measured data ō the mean of measured data pi the simulated data and n is the number of measurements taken from the same plot over the seasons nrmse 10 is considered excellent 10 20 is

those parameters results 2 5 assessment of net irrigation requirements the net irrigation requirements nir of the crop were run in aquacrop for a 30 years data series 1990 2019 to have an overview of the seasonal irrigation amounts that covered the crops needs over the years for two planting dates chosen by the farmers i e 26 april and 8 may climatic data from the station at groß enzersdorf were used to calculate eto for a time series from 1990 to 2017 the nir is the seasonal amount of irrigation water needed to keep the water content in the soil profile above the specified threshold of depletion to avoid yield loss raes et al 2018 therefore when the root zone depletion reaches the specified threshold irrigation water is added and stored in the soil profile the default depletion threshold value in aquacrop is 50 of the readily available water raw the thresholds in terms of depletion i e of raw can be modified according to soil characteristics and observations of soil water content the nir can be also calculated by the model for a certain crop period by indicating the dap at which raw threshold should trigger irrigation in this study raw thresholds depending on specific growth stages were stablished to obtain more plausible nir from planting to maximum canopy cover i e vegetative stage a raw of 75 was indicated which corresponded to the upper threshold for leaf expansion whereas from maximum cc to the start of crop senescence a raw threshold of 100 was used which corresponded to the threshold for stomatal closure the threshold defined as percentage of the raw can also be indicated in terms of the total available water taw for example depletions of 75 and 100 of the raw represented in this case 0 3taw and 0 4taw respectively no irrigation was applied from dap 125 corresponding to 2 3 weeks before the end of the crop cycle relative to the average crop cycle of 142 days obtained from the time series crop simulations nir for the two soybean varieties during the 30 years time series were simulated by indicating in the model the planting dates selected by the farmers 26 april for variety antonia and 8 may for variety lenka to investigate the irrigation demand according to possible climatic conditions empirical probability curves relating nir with the probability p of their occurrence were elaborated following the procedure presented in the studies by popova and pereira 2005 and paredes and torres 2017 using the following equation 9 p nir m n 1 100 where pnir represents the percent probability that a given nir will be equalled or exceeded m the rank of the nir value with 1 being the largest possible value and n the total number of events or data points on record 2 6 assessment of farmers irrigation schedules and alternative irrigation strategies deficit irrigation schedules were generated and simulated in aquacrop for the 2018 and 2019 seasons the purpose was to investigate the impact of irrigation scheduling on yield and water balance components and to propose alternative irrigation strategies that save water and improve productivity this assessment was carried out by comparing the model outputs from those strategies with the outputs from the irrigation applied by the farmers in 2018 and 2019 in addition to this analysis the yield and water balance model results of a full irrigation fi strategy which referred to the nir multiplied by the irrigation system efficiency coefficients from table 3 were assessed and compared to the deficit strategies and the farmers strategies the farmers and deficit strategies were also simulated for the long term time series using the parameterized crop file corresponding to variety lenka planted on 8 may two deficit strategies were generated in this study also using of raw thresholds the aim was to identify an appropriate criterion for irrigation timing that optimizes water use and results in similar or higher yields even if the plant has suffered from stress to achieve plausible outputs the deficit irrigation strategies were generated to obtain similar seasonal irrigation amounts as the ones the farmers used in 2018 and 2019 a severe deficit irrigation strategy sd was defined by setting an irrigation threshold of 180 raw i e 0 67taw thus it was purposely allowed that the crop was exposed to the three types of stress throughout the growing season the processes of canopy expansion stomata closure and early canopy senescence no irrigation was applied during the four weeks before the end of the crop cycle a moderate deficit irrigation strategy md was defined by indicating depletion thresholds of 150 of raw 0 56taw and 140 of raw 0 45taw for the vegetative and reproductive stages respectively a 10 reduction of deficit during the reproductive stage was done due to the higher sensitivity of soybeans to stress during this growth stages giménez et al 2017 for sd and md strategies no irrigation was applied during the four weeks before the end of the crop cycle the irrigation amounts given by the model for sd and md strategies were then multiplied by the irrigation efficiency coefficients in table 3 to obtain gross amounts a diagram showing the different irrigation strategies compared in this study and the simulated irrigation systems is depicted in fig 2 to define the initial conditions of the soil for the long term consecutive simulations a date prior to planting was identified at which the soil was considered to be at field capacity due to the rainfall regime i e 7 april 1990 the conditions at the end of each simulation period were considered as initial conditions for the following one the adjustment for partial wetting the only parameter that differentiates irrigation systems in the model was considered the same for the boom and sprinkler systems for this reason the fi sd and md strategies were simulated only for the di and si plots net irrigation depths of 15 mm and 40 mm were specified for the drip and sprinkler systems respectively as suggested in aquacrop s reference manual raes et al 2018 these irrigation depths are compatible with the irrigation systems designs in the area the assessment of the farmers irrigation strategies in relation to the full and deficit strategies was performed following a similar procedure as the one presented by paredes and torres 2017 the procedure consisted of comparing different water productivity wp indicators calculated for each of the irrigation strategies the wp indicators represent the ratio between the yield produced with a certain amount of water which can be the total water use twu irrigation water use iwu or crop evapotranspiration etc depending on different crop water use perspectives the wp indicators were calculated using observed data in combination with aquacrop output information since the model can be used to simulate the impact of irrigation scheduling on yield and the different water balance components for example crop evapotranspiration soil water content change and capillary rise the wp indicators assessed in this study were a irrigation water productivity wpirrig kg m 3 10 wp irrig y a iwu where ya is the actual yield kg ha 1 observed or estimated iwu mm is the seasonal irrigation water used as gross amount observed or estimated b crop water productivity wp et kg m 3 11 wp et y a et c act where etc act mm is

the effective precipitation pe mm capillary rise cr mm and iwu pe was calculated by subtracting ro estimated by aquacrop from the total precipitation the farmers and alternative irrigation strategies were also assessed in terms of relative yield decrease ryd using 13 ryd y m y a y a 100 where ym is the attainable yield i e the yield obtained from the nir simulations 3 results 3 1 aquacrop model parameterization and performance assessment data collected during 2019 growing season was used to parameterize the model and adapt the crop file to the study conditions by calibrating the stress related parameters while data from 2018 was used for validation the resulting crop parameters after model parameterization and their method of determination are listed in table 5 the default values of aquacrop for basal crop transpiration coefficient kctr x and water productivity wp for soybeans were used in the present study a hio of 30 was considered for the soybean variety lenka planted in 2019 approximated from the ratio between biomass and yield observed in the irrigated plots hio for variety antonia planted in 2018 was increased to 39 to simulate larger yields obtained from variety antonia mg 000 compared to variety lenka mg 00 discussed later the initial canopy cover cco at 90 of emergence and maximum canopy cover ccx were 2 04 and 99 respectively table 5 the canopy growth coefficient cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc were 9 8 day 1 and 0 454 gdd 1 respectively the duration of the growing cycle from day 1 after planting until maturity was 2090 gdd i e 144 days the graphical illustrations of the observed and simulated canopy cover are shown in fig 3 and the statistical indicators for the simulations are listed in table 6 a good agreement between the simulated and observed cc was achieved with nrmse between 6 21 and 14 8 the ef between 0 77 and 0 96 indicated that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the variance of the observed data small pbias values between 1 06 and 0 20 indicated that the model was excellent at simulating the cc although with a slight underestimation in the ni plot during the senescence phase fig 3 therefore results in table 6 show that a good calibration of the cc development parameters was achieved especially under irrigated conditions total soil water content swc simulations in aquacrop compared to the sm1 measured values are shown in fig 4 for 2019 and 2018 the results in fig 4 correspond to the total swc in the effective root zone i e 90 cm depth a clear difference can be observed between the sensor measurements and aquacrop in the four plots in both years in general the model showed smaller swc compared to the sensors being those differences more evident in the di and ni plots in 2018 fig 4 the statistical indicators of the model simulations compared to the observed values are listed in table 7 the lowest nrmse was obtained in the si plot in 2019 nrmse 6 12 whereas the largest nrmse was obtained in the ni plot in 2018 nrmes 27 6 ef values were lower than 0 5 and negative in most cases suggesting that the mean of measured swc data sets are better predictors than the simulated data sets the pbias results in table 7 indicate that overall the model underestimated the swc the deviations of simulated swc from observed values were mainly attributed to the performance of the soil water content sensors it can be noted in fig 4 that before any irrigation event the sm1 probe showed larger swc in di and ni plots compared to si and bi in both years with differences as large as 122 mm between ni and bi in 2018 moreover according to the sm1 measurements before irrigation swc in the bi plot in 2018 was even smaller than wilting point wp 121 mm different swc values from the sm1 under the same conditions indicate that the sensor measurements were not plausible additionally sm1 values increased drastically after the first irrigation in 2018 from 111 to 224 mm 173 260 mm and 207 306 mm in bi si and di respectively such large increments of swc were not possible since gross irrigation amounts were 60 49 and 27 mm in the bi si and di plots respectively swc values in the ni plot during the first half of the monitoring period in 2019 and during the entire monitoring period in 2018 were close to those in the irrigated plots even though only p contributed to wet the soil besides the inaccurate swc sensor measurements another source of uncertainties in the water balance simulations was the lack of accurate information about water lost during each specific irrigation event for example in 2019 the sm1 did not show a pronounced peak after the second irrigation event in the bi plot as well as after the first irrigation event in the si plot similar behaviour was observed in 2018 after the second and third irrigation events in the si and di plots in the case of the di plot the discrepancies between observed and simulated values can be also attributed to heterogeneities of the water distribution by drippers this means that the sensors might have been in contact with more wet soil due to the closeness to the drippers than the rest of the field which is what the model reflected in general the swc results from aquacrop can be considered satisfactory due to the above mentioned reasons furthermore the calculation scheme of aquacrop consists in simulating the canopy cover according to the soil water content the excellent simulation results of canopy cover can be attributed to a reasonable soil water balance calculation therefore the simulated water balance was considered accurate and appropriate to further use the model for irrigation management the thresholds at which the different types of stress started depicted in the in fig 4 in colored straight lines showed that the irrigation scheduling that the farmers implemented produced stress in the crops and yield reductions it can be observed in fig 4 that the simulated swc was most of the time below the threshold of canopy expansion p exp upper green line therefore the crops in all the irrigated plots experienced at least some level of canopy expansion related stress this probably affected the harvest index since somewhat large yield reductions relative to the potential yield were observed even in the irrigated plots discussed later additionally the simulated swc was the lowest in the ni plot in both years and was under the early senescence threshold yellow line in fig 4 even before the start of senescence dap 107 this suggested that the water stress induced early senescence in ni plot which is in accordance with field observations these results indicate that reasonable simulations in aquacrop can be obtained from stressed soybeans the observed and simulated yields from both seasons are shown in table 8 the observed grain yield ranged from 1899 to 3094 kg ha 1 in 2019 and from 2336 to 3649 kg ha 1 in 2018 table 8 the differences in the grain yield from both seasons were attributed to the differences in soybean varieties and environmental conditions in 2019 the simulated yields variated slightly from the measured ones according to the observed means the yields in the bi and si plots were underestimated whereas in the di and ni plots they were overestimated in 2018 the simulated yields in bi and di plots were smaller than the observed means while the yields in si and ni plots were overestimated overall the largest difference between observed and simulated yield corresponded to the rainfed ni plot in both years the results from the ni plot influenced the ef values greatly nevertheless the standard deviation indicates that the model results are within the measured range therefore the results of grain yield are considered good the deviations between observed and simulated biomass in 2019 are shown in table 9 the performance of the model in predicting biomass in the bi and ni plots could be rated as poor this is because only 1 m2 of biomass was sampled in each plot which might not be enough to represent the conditions of the entire plot this can be already noted in the observed yield biomass ratio which are not congruent for instance similar yields were observed in si and bi plots whereas the observed biomass from bi was over 2000 kg ha 1 larger than that from the si plot the results of the performance assessment of the model showed that aquacrop was well parameterized for soybean under the local conditions consequently an appropriate simulation of the crop yield response to water was achieved especially regarding canopy cover development and yield 3 2 assessment of net irrigation requirements the nir simulated for 30 years for the varieties antonia and lenka planted on 26 april and 8 may respectively are shown in fig 5 there is only a slight difference between both nir curves this is because the only difference between both simulations is the planting date since the two varieties did not differ in the parameters related to the water relations of the plant for planting date 26 april fig 5a nir ranged from 119 to 183 mm for low demand years i e when the probability of exceedance was pnir 90 240 324 mm for average demand years 40 pnir 75 and 369 401 mm for high demand years pnir 20 for planting date 8 may fig 5b nir ranged from 110 to 163 mm for low demand years pnir 90 241 308 mm for average demand years 40 pnir 75 and 344 385 mm for high demand years pnir 20 nir simulations showed that year 2018 had a very high irrigation demand while 2019 was a moderately wet year both regardless of variety and planting date when planting on 26 april fig 5a pnir 16 for year 2018 and pnir 68 for year 2019 when planting on 8 may pnir 19 for year 2018 and pnir 65 for year 2019 therefore 2018 was overall one of the driest years amongst the period between 1990 and 2019 the yields when irrigating according to the nir ranged between 3084 and 4041 kg ha 1 for variety antonia planting by 26 april and 4033 5133 kg ha 1 for variety lenka planting by 8 may not shown the duration of the soybean cycle when planting by 26 april ranged from 117 to 166 days however when planting by 8 may the crop cycles in 1990 and 1991 were prolonged to 258 and 300 days this is because the model does not include proper functions to simulate crop death under low temperature conditions which represents a limitation when simulating crops in the northern hemisphere average nir simulated for the time series as well as nir for the years 2018 and 2019 were considerably larger than the irrigation amounts used by the farmers the average nir for the 30 years time series were 278 mm for planting on 26 april and 287 mm for planting on 8 may for the years 2018 and 2019 nir resulted in 372 mm for planting on 26 april and 258 mm for planting on 8 may however the net irrigation amounts used by the farmers were between 90 and 137 mm in 2018 and 54 and 76 mm in 2019 rainfall during the vegetation period varied highly between 274 and 774 mm among all the investigated years and both plating dates therefore simulated crop water use calculated as the sum of effective rainfall capillary rise and nir was in the range of 638 and 919 mm 3 3 assessment of farmers irrigation schedules and alternative irrigation strategies water productivity indicators were used to assess farmers irrigation schedules used in 2018 and 2019 the results from the observed irrigation schedules in table 10 showed that although yields were larger in 2018 wpirrig was larger in the bi and si plots in 2019 since applied water was less than in 2018 in 2018 larger values of wpet were obtained because actual yield was larger in 2018 compared to 2019 and etc was generally smaller in 2018 than in 2019 wpfarm was larger in 2018 also because yield was larger on that year and further because twu was less due to lower soil water content levels in 2019 the largest wpirrig was obtained in the bi plot whereas in 2018 it was obtained in the di plot in both years the smallest wpirrig was found in the si plot wpet was the largest in the bi plot both years while the smallest wpet was found in the ni in 2019 the largest wpfarm was also found in the bi plot whilst the smallest in the ni plot the results of ryd in 2019 ranged from 13 in bi plot to 47 in the ni plot table 10 similarly the lowest ryd in 2018 was found in the bi plot and the largest in the ni plot corresponding to 27 and 64 respectively hence the differences between observed and potential yields were larger in 2018 compared to 2019 due to the climatic conditions and irrigation decisions made in 2018 rainfall was almost two times larger during the emergence and vegetative stages in 2019 140 mm than in 2018 96 mm despite the dry conditions during vegetative stages irrigation in 2018 was scheduled when flowering had already started and rainfall amounts were larger 159 mm between flowering and maturity moreover larger amounts of irrigation water were used in 2018 compared to 2019 however in 2018 the crops experienced the type of stress that affects canopy development early in the growing season consequently affecting the hio and producing yield reductions severe deficit sd and moderate deficit md strategies were simulated for varieties antonia 2018 and lenka 2019 for sprinkler si and drip di plots the wp indicators from those strategies as well as the results from the full irrigation fi strategy are shown in table 11 the strategies were compared to the farmers irrigation schedules used in 2018 and 2019 table 10 in general more water was used by the sprinklers due to the lower efficiency of the system compared to the drip system see table 3 the results from 2019 showed that sd strategy in the di plot had the highest irrigation water productivity wpirrig 7 57 kg m 3 since iwu was reduced considerably from 86 mm famer s in 2019 to 33 mm sd in di in 2019 however a quite low yield was obtained from that strategy ya 2524 kg ha 1 iwu yields and wpirrig resulting from md strategies in the si and di plots in 2019 table 11 were comparable to the ones obtained by the farmers in that year table 10 it can be concluded that although the irrigation in si and di plots in 2019 caused moderate stress to the crops the yields were not severely affected wpet and wpfarm differences among irrigation strategies were quite small in both years in 2018 wpirrig was also the largest under sd strategy in the di plot however the sd strategy produced a considerably large yield reduction of 39 in the di plot therefore severe deficit greatly penalizes yields during years of high irrigation demand a larger yield was obtained from md strategy than the observed in the di plot while using the same amount of irrigation water in the case of the si plot 13 mm of more water under the md strategy increased the yield by 445 kg ha 1 compared to the observed one consequently a ryd of 21 was achieved under md strategy in the si plot whereas a ryd of 34 resulted from the farmers irrigation scheduling in that plot the irrigation strategies were assessed over a period of 30 years 1990 2019 box plots showing the distributions of iwu wpirrig and ryd for the 30 years time series are presented in fig 6 the number of observations considered for the box plot calculations are shown at the top of the plots in blue color mean values of the indicators are shown in red in fig 6 mean values followed by different letters differ significantly at p 0 05 according to a wilcoxon pairwised test as expected iwu values from full irrigation strategies si fi and di fi were significantly larger than the iwu from the farmers and deficit strategies fig 5a thus significantly low wpirrig fig 6b were obtained from the fi strategies conversely the strategies with the smallest iwu were both deficit strategies using drip lines di sd and di md therefore those strategies had the largest wpirrig fig 6b a significant reduction of iwu was observed under di md strategy compared to di 2018 whereas di md and di 2019 were not significantly different iwu from di sd was significantly lower than di 2018 and di 2019 both deficit strategies increased wpirrig considerably in the di plot although not significantly compared to the farmers strategies regarding the si plot the results indicated that a significant amount of water can be saved under si sd compared to si 2018 wpirrig from si 2018 was significantly lower than si 2019 si sd and si md strategies the widest inter annual variability of iwu was found under the si fi strategy with one exceptionally wet year corresponding to 2010 and depicted as an outlier also observed in the di fi strategy fig 6 the deficit strategies in the si plot showed larger inter annual variability than in the di plot because the gross amounts of sprinkler irrigation were larger than those of drip due to the lower efficiency coefficient applied conversely the deficit strategies in the di plot showed the widest range of wpirrig values among the studied years exceptional wpirrig values as large as 20 kg m 3 were observed in wet years this is because the wpirrig does not account for the precipitation that contributed to obtain large yields overall mean ryd for the 30 years time series were between 19 and 11 mean ryd of 16 and 11 were obtained from si sd and si md strategies respectively similarly the mean ryd in di sd was 19 and in di md was 15 fig 6c therefore approximately a further ryd of 4 5 could result from a sd irrigation scheduling compared to a md moreover the narrowest range of ryd was observed under the md strategies 0 25 for si md and 0 30 for di md which can be interpreted as less risk of yield losses compared to the farmers 0 39 for si plot and 0 38 for di plot and sd strategies 3 40 for both si and di plots 4 discussion 4 1 parameterization and performance of the aquacrop model the model aquacrop was used to simulate soybean yield response to water in a subhumid environment four plots under different irrigation systems and rainfed conditions were assessed the simulations were compared to measured canopy cover cc data collected during the 2019 crop season the nrmse from cc simulation ranged from 5 21 to 12 5 which were within the range of the results from the study by adeboye et al 2019 and sandhu and irmak 2019 the largest error was observed in the rainfed ni plot suggesting that the model performance decreased under water limiting conditions as observed by sandhu and irmak 2019 in general an accurate simulation of soybeans cc was obtained in this study the calibration was achieved after the adjustment of crop development parameters mostly based on experimental data and the stress thresholds such as p exp upper based on the studies by silva et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 the differences between the starting dates of maturity between the two variants were represented in the model as duration of the crop cycle the end of the crop cycle for variety antonia was 20 days before variety lenka according to field observations and confirmed by the model considering that variety antonia was planted 13 days before variety lenka this means that variety antonia reached maturity 7 days before variety lenka as it is supposed for soybeans in maturity levels 4 antonia and 6 lenka moreover the yields of variety antonia were larger than those of variety lenka which was also indicated in the model by increasing the reference harvest index of the former therefore it is concluded that the differences between the two varieties were well accounted in the simulations the changes in the harvest index were made considering that highly variable harvest index values have been reported for soybeans depending to a large extent on their genotype for example krisnawati and adie 2015 found an average harvest index value of 38 from 29 soybean genotypes in the case of hio values ranging from 30 marković et al 2020 to 62 adeboye et al 2017 have been used for simulating soybeans in aquacrop therefore as stated by steduto et al 2012 hio is closely linked to the characteristics of the crop cultivars and conditions of the region where they are grown in this study a value of 39 was used as hio for variety antonia 2018 which was similar to the model default value of 40 and to 38 used by paredes et al 2015 in the case of variety lenka 2019 a hio of 30 was used obtained from observed data regarding the soil water content swc simulations the values from aquacrop were compared to measurements from 2019 and 2018 during both seasons the model was able to reproduce the dynamics of wetting and drying periods however a tendency of underestimation was observed especially in the ni plot this behaviour persisted even though the parameters that control the swc in the model were modified to achieve agreement with measurements for example kctr x thresholds of onset of soil water stress rew and cn were adjusted without success nrmse was between 6 and 16 for the 2019 dataset and 11 and 27 for the 2018 dataset such large swc errors as the ones observed in 2018 were also obtained after the calibration of the model for maize performed in the study by sandhu and irmak 2019 other authors have reported poor swc simulations by aquacrop and attributed it to inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation e g paredes et al 2014 sandhu and irmak 2019 also mentioned that under stress conditions roots might extract water from deeper layers which is not considered in aquacrop although limitations of the model when simulating swc have been reported in literature in this study the discrepancies were mainly attributed to inaccurate swc measured with sm1 capacitance probes sources of inaccuracies from capacitance probes include low operational frequency that allows salinity kelleners et al 2004 baumhardt et al 2000 and relaxation effects due to bad contact between soil and probes fares and polyakov 2006 dominate the output of the probes evett et al 2012 demonstrated that the capacitance probes were very sensitive to bulk electrical conductivity and soil structure which are highly linked to the resulting value of permittivity therefore biased values of water content can be expected from such sensors when soils are well structured and with relatively large bulk electrical conductivity with some layers wetter than others evett et al 2012 in this context plenty of repetitions in the field are required to account for the soil and water status heterogeneities which is highly impractical in this study the analysis of the swc dynamics and water stress thresholds evidenced that the water balance was well simulated and the sensors overestimated the swc in most cases despite uncertainties in swc results the accurate cc simulations allowed an adequate determination of grain yield the results showed that there was no trend of under or over estimation in the yield predictions from the irrigated plots which relative differences rd were satisfactory and in the range of those reported by da silva et al 2020 the largest rd between simulated and observed yield was found in the ni plot this could be partially attributed to inaccurate estimation of actual transpiration in the model when water stress occurs giménez et al 2017 paredes et al 2015 also reflected in the errors from cc and swc simulations in the ni plot in this study the deviations around the observed means from all the plots were rather large therefore the simulated yields were within the ranges of the measured ones 4 2 recommendations for irrigation management based on simulations of nir yield and water productivity the model was also applied for a range of climatic conditions represented by the 30 years weather data series between 1990 and 2019 the simulations provided an overview of the net irrigation requirements nir for planting dates 26 april and 8 may for high demand years nir was between 344 and 401 mm being smaller when planting by 8 may these results were similar to the ones obtained for soybeans under full irrigation treatments by giménez et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 the latter in a humid temperate climate and during dry years the nir results showed that delaying planting increases the risk of underdevelopment of crops due to low temperatures these results are in contrast to the findings in warmer climates where delayed planting date for soybean should be most effective alternative to mitigate the thermal effects of climate change ramteke et al 2015 therefore even though water might be saved when planting on 8 may or later the consequences that come with late planting such as low winter temperatures should be evaluated when scheduling planting dates the comparison of yield and irrigation amounts between the farmers strategies and deficit irrigation schedules based on readily available water raw thresholds were in line with previous research about stress on soybeans studies have demonstrated that water deficiency especially when it occurs during the flowering and pods filling stages is one of the main factors affecting soybean development demirtaş et al 2010 giménez et al 2017 marcelo et al 2018 the assessment of the farmers irrigation scheduling in 2018 and 2019 agrees with these results from literature since the stress during development vegetative in 2019 produced less relative yield decrease ryd than the stress during flowering reproductive in 2018 table 10 additionally in the study by giménez et al 2017 the highest impacts of water stress were observed when deficits were imposed for the period from the vegetative to the grain filling stages the results from the present study supported these findings since the sd strategy i e severe deficit throughout the entire season produced considerably large ryd especially in 2018 table 11 conversely when less stress was imposed during the reproductive stages i e md strategy iwu values were comparable to those that the farmers used in 2018 and 2019 while yield was maintained and even increased in some cases table 10 and table 11 these results suggested that a moderate deficit is an appropriate strategy to be adopted by the farmers under the climatic conditions of this study this is especially applicable for drip irrigation since almost half or the irrigation amount was necessary to achieve similar yields than with sprinkler irrigation concerning the water productivity results wpet values from the farmers and deficit strategies for the years 2018 and 2019 table 10 and table 11 were mostly within the ranges presented by mekonnen et al 2020 on the other hand wpet values in this study were larger than those obtained by sincik et al 2008 demirtaş et al 2010 and adeboye et al 2020 wpet values usually vary among locations because etc act is not normalized by the evaporative demand using for example eto wpfarm values obtained in this study were larger than the results found by evett and howell 2000 this can be attributed to the fact that evett and howell 2000 estimated twu as the sum of irrigation rainfall and decrease in stored soil moisture this approach assumes larger amounts of twu than the approach used in study therefore lower wpfarm can be expected from other studies larger wpirrig values were obtained from all the strategies analysed in this study than the ones from other studies gajić et al 2018 evett and howell 2000 garcia y garcia et al 2010 demirtaş et al 2010 marković et al 2016 this is because wpirrig depends highly on precipitation regime especially in humid areas yu et al 2020 which makes it difficult to directly compare the results from this study with literature moreover the wpirrig results were greatly influenced by the irrigation efficiency factor applied a higher efficiency was assumed for drip irrigation system thus wpirrig was usually larger in the di plot than in the si the substantial improvement of water productivity under drip system due to little water loss through surface runoff or deep percolation was also observed by zhang et al 2021 the statistical analysis of iwu wpirrig and ryd for a time series of 30 years indicated that similar yield reductions can result by applying significantly different amounts of irrigation for example significantly different iwu amounts were estimated from md and sd strategies under the same irrigation system which resulted in non significantly different wpirrig and ryd fig 6 therefore reducing etc act under deficit irrigation may not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in yield kang et al 2000 du et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 these results suggested that inducing severe deficit on soybeans represents an alternative to avoid significant yield losses when water is seriously limited the results of iwu and ryd from di md versus si md were not significantly different the same applied after comparing di sd against si sd however wpirrig was significantly larger under deficit strategies for the di plot in relation to the si plot the main difference between the farmers strategies and di md is the irrigation amounts which varied for the former and were fixed to 15 mm per event for the latter consequently the irrigation events of di md were more frequent than those of the farmers strategies moreover di md responded to raw thresholds and farmers strategies to empirical knowledge after running di md strategy for the time series it was found that in 43 of the investigated years at least one irrigation event was required in the first 15 days of the month of july dap 54 68 furthermore most irrigation was needed during the dry period between the second half of july and the beginning of august on the other hand the start of irrigation according to the farmers in 2018 was delayed until the second half of july and in 2019 no irrigation was applied in august therefore the deficit irrigation strategies based on raw thresholds indicated that irrigation should be applied during the most sensitive crop growth stages reproductive and driest summer months these results showed that in contrast to the farmers strategies the deficit irrigation strategies suggested in this study responded to the crop water requirements similar to the iwu of 70 mm for di md from this study marković et al 2016 found that 80 mm was enough to compensate the lack of rainfall during average climatic years for soybeans under subhumid conditions given these results a moderate deficit using drip irrigation is a good alternative when aiming at improving wpirrig while maintaining yields and promoting a sustainable water management 5 conclusions aquacrop was parameterized to simulate canopy cover yields above ground biomass soil water content and water productivity of soybeans under rainfed and irrigated conditions for two consecutive seasons the model parameterization was tested successfully resulting in low estimation errors in simulating canopy cover therefore the agreement between the measured and simulated canopy cover was excellent which is very important for predicting soil water biomass and grain yield in the model the water content sensors provided inaccurate readings thus the estimation errors for this variable were large soil water content measurements in the rainfed plot may also have been underestimated by the model as its performance decreased under dry conditions however soil water storage variability was well captured by aquacrop during the growing seasons a good agreement was found between observed and simulated yields it was therefore concluded that the model parameterization was suitable for irrigation scheduling the model was used to simulate a variety of climatic conditions from 1990 to 2019 this showed a wide range of net irrigation requirements which were almost four times larger in years with very high demand than in wet years to overcome the challenge of maintaining yields under insufficient and poorly distributed rainfall deficit irrigation strategies were evaluated the assessment of irrigation strategies based on raw thresholds i e depletion indicated that a moderate deficit irrigation with reduced stress during reproductive stages was found to be suitable for soybeans in subhumid areas especially when drip irrigation systems are used in case drip systems are not available or not accepted a moderate deficit with sprinklers is also an alternative considering that there would be a trade off between larger gross irrigation amounts and lower relative yield decrease it should be noted that proper application of deficit irrigation requires technical support to farmers such as high quality soil water content sensors to facilitate monitoring of soil water in the root zone the results of this study provide a technical reference for evaluating the irrigation efficiency of different technologies and a theoretical basis for irrigation decision making in subhumid areas moreover a new perspective of water productivity under different irrigation methods and levels was revealed which could serve as

hackl and dasten atasoy from adcon telemetry for technical support appendix four sm1 probes with 90 cm length were calibrated the probes delivered water content in scaled frequency units sfu at nine depths as well as soil temperature in c at 15 cm 45 cm and 75 cm depths the nine water content sensors within the probes are referred to here as s1 to s9 the sm1 calibration was carried out using a stable cylindrical pvc tube dn 300 which had a height of 79 cm and inner diameter of 29 5 cm a coated wooden plate was mounted 22 cm from the top of the tube as a leakage free base with a hole in the middle to place one sm1 access tube the access tube was fixed to a block of wood to keep it stable the soil used for the calibration was collected from the topsoil 0 15 cm depth of the obersiebenbrunn field the soil material was sieved with a 2 mm sieve to facilitate filling into the pvc tube and avoid gaps near the access tube first measurements were taken in water the space in the pvc tube above the coated wooden base was filled up to 15 cm height with tap water to ensure the scaled frequency readings of the medium from a single sensor at a time due to the fixation of the access tube and the space needed to fill in the water or later the soil and to extract undisturbed soil samples it was not possible to do the readings at the uppermost position in 10 cm therefore when the sensor board to be tested was introduced completely in the access tube the first sensor reading was in 20 cm s2 after collecting five readings of each sensor the board was lifted to continue with the following sensor until the one in 90 cm s9 wooden rulers were used to fix the sensor board in a straight vertical position and avoid damage once the water readings from all probes were collected the measurements in soil started the space in the pvc tube above the coated wooden base was filled up to 15 cm height with air dried soil the measurement procedure at different depths was the same as for the test in water the measurements were repeated at increasing soil water contents to achieve the next volumetric water content to measure a volume of water was added to the soil in the pvc tube set up estimated

status four undisturbed soil samples were taken around the access tube using metallic cylinders of known mass and volume to obtain the gravimetric water content the samples were weighed and dried in the oven at 105 c until their mass remained constant and then were weighed again the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density ρb calculated from the wet and dry mass as well to determine the volumetric water content θ the measurements in soil ended up in different volumetric water content θ values and the respective sensor readings rs the latter ones were normalized by using the sensor readings in air ra and in water rw the normalized values n were calculated by using the formula a 2 n r a r s r a r w the normalized sensor reading n is a dimensionless number having the values n 0 for an air reading and n 1 for a measurement in tap water at 28 c to obtain fitted curves and develop a calibration function the data pairs i e θ vs n were related to each other by

8932,as an effect of climate change a considerable increase in irrigation demand is expected in subhumid regions this poses a future challenge for agriculture which often does not meet the requirements for highly efficient irrigation management field experiments in combination with modelling approaches can help in the development and evaluation of alternative irrigation strategies the aim of this study was to parameterize the fao aquacrop model for soybeans in order to evaluate irrigation systems and strategies used by farmers in austria moreover this study aims at proposing a deficit irrigation strategy to increase irrigation water productivity wpirrig three irrigation methods were investigated sprinkler drip and hose reel boom rainfed conditions were also assessed data sets from 2018 and 2019 were used for the parameterization of aquacrop based on threshold values for the percentage of readily available water raw full and deficit irrigation strategies were defined and tested for the years 1990 2019 the parameterization results showed good agreement between the simulated and observed canopy cover and yields from the four water management practices with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients between 0 76 and 0 96 large errors resulted from the soil water content simulations mainly due to poor sensor performance it was concluded that a moderate deficit with raw thresholds of 150 and 140 for the vegetative and reproductive stages respectively was an adequate strategy to improve yields and wpirrig conversely a severe deficit with an irrigation threshold of 180 raw throughout the season considerably reduced yields especially in years with high irrigation demand moreover a significant improvement in wpirrig was observed when drip systems were used compared to sprinklers due to the higher efficiency of the former these results can help scheduling irrigation for soybeans and increasing wpirrig thereby reducing pressure on limited water resources keywords aquacrop deficit irrigation readily available water irrigation scheduling drip sprinkler data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is responsible for a large percentage of freshwater consumption it is well known that irrigation is essential for crop production in dry regions however irrigation requirements have also increased rapidly in humid areas mainly due to a severe precipitation deficit and increment of air temperature produced by climate change in humid areas of central europe for example irrigation requirements are expected to continue increasing as climate change progresses busschaert et al 2022 similarly an increment of extreme weather events such as droughts floods storms and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change which can affect agricultural production for example the global drought observatory gdo reported that the summer droughts of 2022 caused water and heat stress that substantially reduced crops yields across europe the most affected crops were grain maize soybean and sunflower toreti et al 2022 according to the ipcc ar6 report ipcc 2022 agricultural production losses will progress for most european areas over the 21st century as a consequence of heat waves drought and high risk of water scarcity consequently adaptation measures in agriculture are needed to deal with the increasing stress in water resources this includes advances in irrigation strategies besides the negative impacts of climate change on water resources availability inefficient irrigation water application constitutes a major problem in agricultural regions since it contributes to water losses according to an eu report eprs 2019 savings of over 40 of the volume of water abstracted can be achieved by improving the delivery and application efficiency of irrigation systems changing practices planting drought resistant crops and reusing treated water therefore significant water savings could be achieved with improvements in irrigation management in austria for example an average of 69 million m³ of water is currently used for irrigation from which about 64 million m³ are taken from groundwater the irrigation demand is expected to almost double by 2050 about 90 of the areas equipped with irrigation and actually irrigated approximately 116 050 ha as of 2013 are concentrated in eastern austria lindinger et al 2021 irrigation volumes vary greatly due to annual weather conditions and can be up to eight times higher in dry years than in years when annual precipitation reaches averages of 500 mm lindinger et al 2021 farmers irrigation strategies in this region rely mostly on experience and rainfall patterns from previous years this approach primarily based on the empirical or heuristic knowledge of the farmer represents a risk especially under current climate change conditions of dry summers with uncertain precipitation distribution in the event of an oversupply of irrigation water there is a risk of soil water loss due to deep drainage and even a washout of nutrients and nitrate leakage the latter could lead to contamination of aquifers thompson et al 2020 on the other hand a reduced water supply increases the risk of drought stress resulting in loss of amount and quality of yield soybean yield reduction in austria is an example of the consequences of crop water related stress produced by unsuitable irrigation management under a changing environment soybean cultivation in austria started to intensify in 2011 with an increase in cultivation area throughout the years fogelberg and recknagel 2017 however considerable soybean yield reductions have been reported in the last decade statistik austria 2018 for example the soybean fields had a significantly larger crop water demand in 2018 than other crops in austria which was not satisfied by precipitation migdall et al 2022 an irrigation schedule can be evaluated by quantifying the output at the end of the season including crops yield and total water use for example water productivity wp is the ratio between the yield obtained versus the water used to produce that yield pereira et al 2012 wp can be obtained in terms of irrigation in which case it is it is denoted as wpirrig and it is calculated as the ratio between the yield produced by a crop along the growing season and the irrigation water used iwu in the same period wpirrig depends among other factors on irrigation management consequently wpirrig can be improved by optimizing the irrigation scheduling in such way that the crops take maximum advantage of the irrigation water applied deficit irrigation is an example of a well studied technique for making better use of irrigation water especially in areas with highly limited water resources it consists in the application of water below the crop evapotranspiration requirements fereres and soriano 2007 for the proper application of deficit irrigation it is important to be aware of the crop stages when water stress has less negative impact on the final yield so that irrigation events can be planned accordingly payero et al 2005 for soybeans the crop stages when the water stress is most critical correspond to the period from flowering to grain filling karam et al 2005 in a subhumid environment demirtaş et al 2010 observed the largest wpirrig on soybeans under water stress during the vegetative stage of development v5 5th node on the main stem beginning with the unifoliate note on the other hand single or multiple water stress treatments applied during reproductive development stages flowering r2 pod elongation r4 or seed enlargement r6 resulted in significant reductions of seed yield demirtaş et al 2010 under dry conditions in nebraska seasonal rainfall between of 149 and 317 mm during the studied years payero et al 2005 concluded that delaying irrigation until the beginning of flowering or later growth stages resulted in early stress which decreased seasonal evapotranspiration that lead to yield reduction there are few studies dealing with deficit irrigation strategies for soybeans in subhumid areas in general mainly because water scarcity is a recent issue in these regions sincik et al 2008 marković et al 2016 for example marković et al 2016 observed higher wpirrig for soybeans under deficit irrigation compared to full supplemental irrigation in a subhumid area of croatia in austria there are no studies to our knowledge that investigate the feasibility of applying deficit irrigation for any crop therefore more scientific efforts are necessary to investigate the benefits that advanced and sustainable irrigation strategies such as deficit irrigation can bring in terms of water productivity in subhumid regions the development and adoption of irrigation strategies with the purpose of improving water productivity need experimentation however these type of experiments require a lot of time effort and resources therefore for practical reasons the development of irrigation strategies can be achieved through modelling modelling studies carried out in agricultural areas of austria are mainly focused on water productivity predictions based on future climate scenarios eitzinger et al 2001 alexandrov et al 2002 these studies provide an interesting and certainly useful overview of the possible outcomes from future water scarcity conditions in general these studies recommend improvements in irrigation management however they do not develop or provide information about irrigation strategies based on water content thresholds and consequent water productivity therefore it is necessary to explore more in detail the use of models to simulate irrigation schedules that improve water productivity models that combine crop physiological and soil hydrological processes can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling thereby improving water productivity for example the aquacrop is a crop growth model developed by the food and agriculture organization fao that simulates yield response to water for a variety of crops by using an empirical and mechanistic approach steduto et al 2012 aquacrop combines robustness accuracy and simplicity since it requires few explicit parameters and largely intuitive variables steduto et al 2009 the model has been used for simulating crop development biomass and yield of many crops including soybeans showing satisfactory results paredes et al 2015 adeboye et al 2017 adeboye et al 2019 studies indicate that the model performance decreases as water deficit increases khoshravesh et al 2013 adeboye et al 2017 giménez et al 2017 silva et al 2017 nevertheless there is agreement that the model is a useful tool for irrigation management when properly calibrated and validated the model facilitates the assessment of deficit irrigation strategies that otherwise would require great effort and expenses to perform for example it is possible to indicate in the model the irrigation timing based on readily available water raw and total available water taw thresholds below which a crop begins to experience water stress deficit irrigation strategies established using raw thresholds can provide a remarkable improvement in wpirrig for water saving strategies ket et al 2018 additionally aquacrop can be used to simulate the net irrigation requirements nir of a crop and these results can be used to make decisions about irrigation management for example nunes et al 2021 used the model to investigate optimal planting dates for cowpea based on simulations of nir similarly paredes and torres 2017 obtained the seasonal nir for a long term data series in aquacrop and classified the demand of crop water based on an empirical frequency distribution in general the aquacrop model has been used mainly to assess yield response to water in dry environments therefore the use of the model in subhumid areas in central europe will provide alternatives to improve water management in the region for example an important application of aquacrop to improve irrigation management decisions is the dynamic use of the model to adapt threshold values depending on changes in the climatic conditions additionally the model is relatively easy to handle compared to sophisticated numerical models which require extensive theoretical background and complex calibration therefore from the practitioner s point of view it represents a practical alternative similarly coupling sensors that are easy to manage and maintain into the decision support system can result economically and environmentally advantageous over more traditional irrigation management practices in this regard numerous studies suggested that the decision making process in irrigation can be improved by using real time measurements from sensors strategically distributed in the field in austria the use of sensors for irrigation management started to get relevance in the past two decades e g cepuder 2004 cepuder and nolz 2007 nolz et al 2016 nolz and kammerer 2017 morales santos and nolz 2023 however studies about the use of sensors to monitor soil water content in the root zone and the use of this feedback to trigger irrigation are lacking it is therefore necessary to investigate this alternative to provide further guidance to practitioners about the detection of irrigation timing in the field according to pre defined thresholds investigation and evaluation of common site based irrigation management and possible adaptation strategies such as deficit irrigation are necessary to improve water productivity in the future in this context models can help to incorporate specific irrigation thresholds and assess long term effects therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to parameterize the aquacrop model for soybeans under different water management practices in a subhumid climate 2 to simulate the net irrigation requirements of soybean under subhumid conditions 3 to assess the impact of deficit irrigation with different irrigation systems on soybean yield and water productivity from this recommendations are derived for implementing deficit irrigation strategies that can help farmers make irrigation management decisions 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the study site the study site was

classified according to önorm l1050 in order to compare the soil texture results with international literature and to use them as input data in the aquacrop model the percentages of soil though the limits for every sample were converted to the classification system developed by the united states department of agriculture usda the conversion was made in excel using a log linear interpolation nemes et al 1999 the main difference between the austrian and usda classification is the silt sand limit which is 2 50 µm for the latter soil science division staff 2018 undisturbed samples were taken down to 60 cm in four depths 0 15 15 30 30 60 and 60 70 cm using metallic cylinders with a volume of 200 cm3 to determine the soil water retention characteristics and bulk density ρb the undisturbed samples were placed in rectangular containers and saturated gradually by adding water until the water level was constant which occurred in a time lapse between 48 and 72 h once saturated the samples were put into a pressure plate apparatus ppa to obtain the water retention properties of the soil in doing so the volumetric water content of a sample was related to the respective equilibrium pressure the mass after the saturation procedure was used to calculate the volumetric water content at saturation θsat to calculate volumetric water content at field capacity θfc and permanent wilting point θpwp the mass values at 10 and 1500 kpa pressure were used respectively the available water capacity θawc was then calculated by subtracting the θpwp from θfc the undisturbed samples were then dried in the oven for 24 48 h to calculate the bulk density ρb by dividing the dry soil mass by the volume of the soil i e volume of the metallic cylinder the ρb corresponding to the soil depth of 90 120 cm was assumed to be the same as in the 60 90 cm soil depth the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was estimated from pedotransfer functions by using rosetta program schaap et al 2001 the input parameters used for prediction of ksat were sand silt clay and ρb details of the soil physical properties are listed in table 1 2 2 description of the experiments soybean varieties antonia mg 000 and lenka mg 00 were planted on 26 april 2018 and on 8 may 2019 respectively the maturity levels of varieties in mg 000 range from 2 to 4 whereas those of mg 00 from 5 to 7 varieties antonia and lenka belong to levels 4 and 6 respectively which indicates that the former will ripen a few days earlier than the latter additionally soybeans in mg 000 and mg 00 differ on seeding rates as the former yields 4 5 and the latter 4 packages of 150 000 grains respectively in both years a precision seeder was used 80 grains m 2 with a row spacing of 50 cm and seeding depth of 5 cm the final plant density was approximately 40 plants per m2 the study site had a total area of 120 120 m2 and was divided into four rectangular plots three of which were irrigated and one was rainfed water was applied to the crops differently in each of the irrigated plots the irrigation systems used were a boom in the bi plot sprinklers in the si plot and drip lines in the di plot the rainfed plot is referred to as ni i e non irrigated plot in this paper the length of each plot was 120 m and the respective widths for each plot were 17 m for the di 25 m for the ni 18 m for the si and 60 m for the bi plot a scheme of the experimental site can be found in morales santos and nolz 2023 the details about the irrigation systems in each plot are shown in table 2 the irrigation events were scheduled by the farmers that work at the agricultural school based on their experience for more details about the irrigation management and the experimental site see morales santos and nolz 2023 the farmers measured the gross irrigation volumes of the individual systems and events with flowmeters however net amounts were required for the analysis therefore to account for irrigation losses related to e g management of the systems leakage evaporation or seepage irrigation efficiency coefficients were applied to the gross irrigation amounts the efficiency values were taken from literature and approximate the real efficiency of the systems for the sprinkler and drip systems 60 and 90 efficiencies were considered respectively based on the study by howell 2005 the efficiency of the hose reel boom was assumed to be similar to that of a lateral move irrigation spray heads with hose feed being 90 howell 2005 table 3 shows the irrigation dates and irrigation amounts for the two seasons throughout the 2019 growing season canopy cover cc and leaf area index lai were measured cc was monitored using canopeo application for mobile phones patrignani and ochsner 2015 until the crops reached full cc i e approximately 95 cc in the irrigated plots lai data were collected until senescence stage with an accupar par lai ceptometer model lp 80 meter group inc usa before the first irrigation event four cc and four lai measurements were collected in different parts of the field on dap 42 and 57 after the first irrigation was applied in all plots five to eight measurements per plot were collected this procedure was followed on dap 69 and 76 for both cc and lai whereas on dap 84 91 104 and 125 only lai was measured since cc was monitored until dap 76 and no measurements were taken during most of the crop maturity and senescence cc was calculated for those stages using lai data this was achieved by relating all lai and cc data pairs empirically using the program curveexpert basic hyams 2017 and following the procedure used by farahaniandet al 2009 and adeboye et al 2017 1 cc 1 exp α l ai where α non dimensional is a fitting parameter of the exponential function after the fitting α resulted in 0 53 which is close to the α value of 0 46 that adeboye et al 2017 used for soybeans therefore eq 1 was used to estimate cc for eight days dap 42 57 69 76 84 91 104 and 125 before harvesting in 2019 the plants in 1 m2 for each plot were taken as above ground biomass samples the plant samples were weighed and dried in an aerated oven for 72 h and weighed again to determine the dry above ground biomass b a plot harvester was used to obtain the yield on 27 september 2018 and 3 october 2019 the grain yields were harvested in dry conditions approximately 12 of water content the harvest index for variety lenka 2019 was calculated from the biomass and yield data a monitoring station was installed at each plot in the study site during both crop seasons the monitoring stations consisted of a wireless sensor network that collected processed and stored data every 15 min the data was visualized and retrieved from the online platform of adcon addvantage 6 6 adcon telemetry 2015 each station included one sm1 probe adcon telemetry by ott hydromet gmbh austria which is a multi sensor capacitance probe encapsulated in a pvc tube ott hydromet gmbh 2015 that measures soil water content swc the sm1 probe comprises cylindrical sensor electrodes on a circuit board with a 10 cm spacing between sensors in this study four sm1 of 90 cm length were used which contained nine sensors each the sensor readings of the sm1 were given in so called scaled frequency units sfu intended to represent soil moisture from zero to 100 ott hydromet gmbh 2015 to be able to relate the sensor readings to water content and increase accuracy a soil specific calibration procedure for the four sm1 probes was performed in the laboratory see appendix soil water content swc for every 10 cm depth was calculated from the calibrated sm1 measurements and added to obtain the swc within the root zone as follows 2 swc i 1 n θ i z i in eq 2 swc is total soil water content in the root zone mm θi the water content for soil layer i cm3 cm 3 z the soil depth or layer i mm and n the number of soil layers within the root zone 2 3 aquacrop model parameterization the aquacrop model is a crop growth water driven model developed by the fao division for land and water that uses an empirical and mechanistic approach to simulate yield response to water steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2018 aquacrop uses daily steps to compute crop evapotranspiration etc by treating crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es separately to calculate tc mm the model uses a cc development function which changes depending on three growth phases of the crop using the following equation 3 t c cc k ctr x et o where cc is the canopy cover adjusted by the microadvective effects kctr x the maximum transpiration coefficient non dimensional and the eto the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration mm estimated from the specific climatic data of the study site as of es aquacrop considers it proportional to the area of soil not covered by the canopy but also adjusted empirically for effects of microadvection as detailed in raes et al 2009 the response of crop to water deficits is simulated by the model through a stress coefficient ks 0 1 non dimensional that is function of fractional available soil water regulated by evaporative demand of the atmosphere the level of crop to water stress is reflected in for four key plant processes canopy expansion stomata control of transpiration canopy senescence and harvest index with specific stress coefficients for the former three processes in aquacrop the water productivity is normalized for climate based on the atmospheric evaporative demand as defined by eto and the co2 concentration of the atmosphere using the normalized water productivity wp the model calculates the biomass b for daily transpiration finally the crop yield y is then calculated as a harvestable fraction of the final above ground biomass for a detailed explanation of the calculation scheme of aquacrop see steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 in this study aquacrop was used to simulate growth and water uptake of soybeans under different irrigation strategies and rainfed conditions represented in four plots bi di si and ni the soybean file included in aquacrop contains parameters that have been calibrated and validated for several locations during the development of the model as well as in previous studies e g paredes et al 2015 adeboye et al 2017 adeboye et al 2019 therefore to adapt the crop characteristics to the specific conditions of this study a parameterization process was performed following the guidelines presented in steduto et al 2012 this process consists in adjusting the nonconservative crop parameters according to field observations and literature in this regard the input data for the parameterization included for example the planting date number of plants per hectare and the starting and duration of the phenological stages such as crop emergence flowering and yield formation which were obtained from field observations and supplementary soybean specific information described in the reference manual of aquacrop raes et al 2018 table 4 shows crop development details during broth growing seasons similarly the parameters related to cc development including maximum canopy cover canopy growth and canopy decline coefficients were adjusted from the default values according to the cc data collected in 2019 over the irrigated plots i e bi di and si described in section 2 2 the harvest index was modified after calculating the ratio between yield and biomass data observed in 2019 the maximum rooting depth was defined from soil water content evolution data throughout the growing season down to 1 m depth a calibration of three crop stress related parameters was performed in order to adapt the stress response of soybeans under subhumid conditions these stress parameters were adjusted to values within a reasonable range until the model simulations matched the field observations from the rainfed plot ni a similar approach to estimate stress thresholds was used by silva et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 an adjustment of the parameters related to water stress conditions for soybean is also suggested in the aquacrop reference manual raes et al 2018 as the default values of these parameters have a minimum degree of calibration the refinement of the crop stages durations cc development and stress parameters was conducted through a trial and error procedure to guarantee the best performance between simulated and observed cc in addition to the crop data the model input included combined climate files from the weather stations at groß enzersdorf and obersiebenbrunn see section 2 1 containing meteorological variables to calculate eto the default co2 concentration of the model database was used the irrigation schedules described in table 3 were specified for each plot regarding the soil the hydraulic parameters listed in table 1 were used to characterize the soil down to 120 m groundwater levels were obtained from database measured by the national hydrological monitoring network of austria ehyd according to these data the average groundwater table in 2018 and 2019 was 3 6 m and 3 7 m respectively the 2018 climate and irrigation data were used for the model validation the only modifications made to the parameterized crop file from 2019 in order to model the crop in 2018 were the planting date and the reference harvest index the reference harvest index in 2019 corresponds to the ratio between observed yield and biomass data while for 2018 it was adjusted according to literature raes et al 2018 krisnawati and adie 2015 to define the initial conditions of the soil in both years a date prior to planting was identified in which the soil was considered to be at field capacity due to the rainfall regime i e april 1 2018 and april 30 2019 2 4 performance assessment of the aquacrop model the assessment of the model performance for the 2019 dataset was done by comparing observed and simulated values of cc swc y and b for the 2018 dataset only swc and y simulations were assessed due to lack of cc and b observed data from that year the following statistical indicators were used to assess the goodness of fit of the model the normalized root mean square error nrmse which reflects the difference between field observations and results of simulations relative to the mean of the observed data 4 nrmse 1 o i 1 n p i o i 2 n where oi is the measured data ō the mean of measured data pi the simulated data and n is the number of measurements taken from the same plot over the seasons nrmse 10 is considered excellent 10 20 is

those parameters results 2 5 assessment of net irrigation requirements the net irrigation requirements nir of the crop were run in aquacrop for a 30 years data series 1990 2019 to have an overview of the seasonal irrigation amounts that covered the crops needs over the years for two planting dates chosen by the farmers i e 26 april and 8 may climatic data from the station at groß enzersdorf were used to calculate eto for a time series from 1990 to 2017 the nir is the seasonal amount of irrigation water needed to keep the water content in the soil profile above the specified threshold of depletion to avoid yield loss raes et al 2018 therefore when the root zone depletion reaches the specified threshold irrigation water is added and stored in the soil profile the default depletion threshold value in aquacrop is 50 of the readily available water raw the thresholds in terms of depletion i e of raw can be modified according to soil characteristics and observations of soil water content the nir can be also calculated by the model for a certain crop period by indicating the dap at which raw threshold should trigger irrigation in this study raw thresholds depending on specific growth stages were stablished to obtain more plausible nir from planting to maximum canopy cover i e vegetative stage a raw of 75 was indicated which corresponded to the upper threshold for leaf expansion whereas from maximum cc to the start of crop senescence a raw threshold of 100 was used which corresponded to the threshold for stomatal closure the threshold defined as percentage of the raw can also be indicated in terms of the total available water taw for example depletions of 75 and 100 of the raw represented in this case 0 3taw and 0 4taw respectively no irrigation was applied from dap 125 corresponding to 2 3 weeks before the end of the crop cycle relative to the average crop cycle of 142 days obtained from the time series crop simulations nir for the two soybean varieties during the 30 years time series were simulated by indicating in the model the planting dates selected by the farmers 26 april for variety antonia and 8 may for variety lenka to investigate the irrigation demand according to possible climatic conditions empirical probability curves relating nir with the probability p of their occurrence were elaborated following the procedure presented in the studies by popova and pereira 2005 and paredes and torres 2017 using the following equation 9 p nir m n 1 100 where pnir represents the percent probability that a given nir will be equalled or exceeded m the rank of the nir value with 1 being the largest possible value and n the total number of events or data points on record 2 6 assessment of farmers irrigation schedules and alternative irrigation strategies deficit irrigation schedules were generated and simulated in aquacrop for the 2018 and 2019 seasons the purpose was to investigate the impact of irrigation scheduling on yield and water balance components and to propose alternative irrigation strategies that save water and improve productivity this assessment was carried out by comparing the model outputs from those strategies with the outputs from the irrigation applied by the farmers in 2018 and 2019 in addition to this analysis the yield and water balance model results of a full irrigation fi strategy which referred to the nir multiplied by the irrigation system efficiency coefficients from table 3 were assessed and compared to the deficit strategies and the farmers strategies the farmers and deficit strategies were also simulated for the long term time series using the parameterized crop file corresponding to variety lenka planted on 8 may two deficit strategies were generated in this study also using of raw thresholds the aim was to identify an appropriate criterion for irrigation timing that optimizes water use and results in similar or higher yields even if the plant has suffered from stress to achieve plausible outputs the deficit irrigation strategies were generated to obtain similar seasonal irrigation amounts as the ones the farmers used in 2018 and 2019 a severe deficit irrigation strategy sd was defined by setting an irrigation threshold of 180 raw i e 0 67taw thus it was purposely allowed that the crop was exposed to the three types of stress throughout the growing season the processes of canopy expansion stomata closure and early canopy senescence no irrigation was applied during the four weeks before the end of the crop cycle a moderate deficit irrigation strategy md was defined by indicating depletion thresholds of 150 of raw 0 56taw and 140 of raw 0 45taw for the vegetative and reproductive stages respectively a 10 reduction of deficit during the reproductive stage was done due to the higher sensitivity of soybeans to stress during this growth stages giménez et al 2017 for sd and md strategies no irrigation was applied during the four weeks before the end of the crop cycle the irrigation amounts given by the model for sd and md strategies were then multiplied by the irrigation efficiency coefficients in table 3 to obtain gross amounts a diagram showing the different irrigation strategies compared in this study and the simulated irrigation systems is depicted in fig 2 to define the initial conditions of the soil for the long term consecutive simulations a date prior to planting was identified at which the soil was considered to be at field capacity due to the rainfall regime i e 7 april 1990 the conditions at the end of each simulation period were considered as initial conditions for the following one the adjustment for partial wetting the only parameter that differentiates irrigation systems in the model was considered the same for the boom and sprinkler systems for this reason the fi sd and md strategies were simulated only for the di and si plots net irrigation depths of 15 mm and 40 mm were specified for the drip and sprinkler systems respectively as suggested in aquacrop s reference manual raes et al 2018 these irrigation depths are compatible with the irrigation systems designs in the area the assessment of the farmers irrigation strategies in relation to the full and deficit strategies was performed following a similar procedure as the one presented by paredes and torres 2017 the procedure consisted of comparing different water productivity wp indicators calculated for each of the irrigation strategies the wp indicators represent the ratio between the yield produced with a certain amount of water which can be the total water use twu irrigation water use iwu or crop evapotranspiration etc depending on different crop water use perspectives the wp indicators were calculated using observed data in combination with aquacrop output information since the model can be used to simulate the impact of irrigation scheduling on yield and the different water balance components for example crop evapotranspiration soil water content change and capillary rise the wp indicators assessed in this study were a irrigation water productivity wpirrig kg m 3 10 wp irrig y a iwu where ya is the actual yield kg ha 1 observed or estimated iwu mm is the seasonal irrigation water used as gross amount observed or estimated b crop water productivity wp et kg m 3 11 wp et y a et c act where etc act mm is the actual crop evapotranspiration as estimated by the aquacrop model c farm water productivity wpfarm kg m 3 12 wp farm y a twu y a p e cr iwu where twu is the total water use mm obtained by adding the effective precipitation pe mm capillary rise cr mm and iwu pe was calculated by subtracting ro estimated by aquacrop from the total precipitation the farmers and alternative irrigation strategies were also assessed in terms of relative yield decrease ryd using 13 ryd y m y a y a 100 where ym is the attainable yield i e the yield obtained from the nir simulations 3 results 3 1 aquacrop model parameterization and performance assessment data collected during 2019 growing season was used to parameterize the model and adapt the crop file to the study conditions by calibrating the stress related parameters while data from 2018 was used for validation the resulting crop parameters after model parameterization and their method of determination are listed in table 5 the default values of aquacrop for basal crop transpiration coefficient kctr x and water productivity wp for soybeans were used in the present study a hio of 30 was considered for the soybean variety lenka planted in 2019 approximated from the ratio between biomass and yield observed in the irrigated plots hio for variety antonia planted in 2018 was increased to 39 to simulate larger yields obtained from variety antonia mg 000 compared to variety lenka mg 00 discussed later the initial canopy cover cco at 90 of emergence and maximum canopy cover ccx were 2 04 and 99 respectively table 5 the canopy growth coefficient cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc were 9 8 day 1 and 0 454 gdd 1 respectively the duration of the growing cycle from day 1 after planting until maturity was 2090 gdd i e 144 days the graphical illustrations of the observed and simulated canopy cover are shown in fig 3 and the statistical indicators for the simulations are listed in table 6 a good agreement between the simulated and observed cc was achieved with nrmse between 6 21 and 14 8 the ef between 0 77 and 0 96 indicated that the variance of the residuals was smaller than the variance of the observed data small pbias values between 1 06 and 0 20 indicated that the model was excellent at simulating the cc although with a slight underestimation in the ni plot during the senescence phase fig 3 therefore results in table 6 show that a good calibration of the cc development parameters was achieved especially under irrigated conditions total soil water content swc simulations in aquacrop compared to the sm1 measured values are shown in fig 4 for 2019 and 2018 the results in fig 4 correspond to the total swc in the effective root zone i e 90 cm depth a clear difference can be observed between the sensor measurements and aquacrop in the four plots in both years in general the model showed smaller swc compared to the sensors being those differences more evident in the di and ni plots in 2018 fig 4 the statistical indicators of the model simulations compared to the observed values are listed in table 7 the lowest nrmse was obtained in the si plot in 2019 nrmse 6 12 whereas the largest nrmse was obtained in the ni plot in 2018 nrmes 27 6 ef values were lower than 0 5 and negative in most cases suggesting that the mean of measured swc data sets are better predictors than the simulated data sets the pbias results in table 7 indicate that overall the model underestimated the swc the deviations of simulated swc from observed values were mainly attributed to the performance of the soil water content sensors it can be noted in fig 4 that before any irrigation event the sm1 probe showed larger swc in di and ni plots compared to si and bi in both years with differences as large as 122 mm between ni and bi in 2018 moreover according to the sm1 measurements before irrigation swc in the bi plot in 2018 was even smaller than wilting point wp 121 mm different swc values from the sm1 under the same conditions indicate that the sensor measurements were not plausible additionally sm1 values increased drastically after the first irrigation in 2018 from 111 to 224 mm 173 260 mm and 207 306 mm in bi si and di respectively such large increments of swc were not possible since gross irrigation amounts were 60 49 and 27 mm in the bi si and di plots respectively swc values in the ni plot during the first half of the monitoring period in 2019 and during the entire monitoring period in 2018 were close to those in the irrigated plots even though only p contributed to wet the soil besides the inaccurate swc sensor measurements another source of uncertainties in the water balance simulations was the lack of accurate information about water lost during each specific irrigation event for example in 2019 the sm1 did not show a pronounced peak after the second irrigation event in the bi plot as well as after the first irrigation event in the si plot similar behaviour was observed in 2018 after the second and third irrigation events in the si and di plots in the case of the di plot the discrepancies between observed and simulated values can be also attributed to heterogeneities of the water distribution by drippers this means that the sensors might have been in contact with more wet soil due to the closeness to the drippers than the rest of the field which is what the model reflected in general the swc results from aquacrop can be considered satisfactory due to the above mentioned reasons furthermore the calculation scheme of aquacrop consists in simulating the canopy cover according to the soil water content the excellent simulation results of canopy cover can be attributed to a reasonable soil water balance calculation therefore the simulated water balance was considered accurate and appropriate to further use the model for irrigation management the thresholds at which the different types of stress started depicted in the in fig 4 in colored straight lines showed that the irrigation scheduling that the farmers implemented produced stress in the crops and yield reductions it can be observed in fig 4 that the simulated swc was most of the time below the threshold of canopy expansion p exp upper green line therefore the crops in all the irrigated plots experienced at least some level of canopy expansion related stress this probably affected the harvest index since somewhat large yield reductions relative to the potential yield were observed even in the irrigated plots discussed later additionally the simulated swc was the lowest in the ni plot in both years and was under the early senescence threshold yellow line in fig 4 even before the start of senescence dap 107 this suggested that the water stress induced early senescence in ni plot which is in accordance with field observations these results indicate that reasonable simulations in aquacrop can be obtained from stressed soybeans the observed and simulated yields from both seasons are shown in table 8 the observed grain yield ranged from 1899 to 3094 kg ha 1 in 2019 and from 2336 to 3649 kg ha 1 in 2018 table 8 the differences in the grain yield from both seasons were attributed to the differences in soybean varieties and environmental conditions in 2019 the simulated yields variated slightly from the measured ones according to the observed means the yields in the bi and si plots were underestimated whereas in the di and ni plots they were overestimated in 2018 the simulated yields in bi and di plots were smaller than the observed means while the yields in si and ni plots were overestimated overall the largest difference between observed and simulated yield corresponded to the rainfed ni plot in both years the results from the ni plot influenced the ef values greatly nevertheless the standard deviation indicates that the model results are within the measured range therefore the results of grain yield are considered good the deviations between observed and simulated biomass in 2019 are shown in table 9 the performance of the model in predicting biomass in the bi and ni plots could be rated as poor this is because only 1 m2 of biomass was sampled in each plot which might not be enough to represent the conditions of the entire plot this can be already noted in the observed yield biomass ratio which are not congruent for instance similar yields were observed in si and bi plots whereas the observed biomass from bi was over 2000 kg ha 1 larger than that from the si plot the results of the performance assessment of the model showed that aquacrop was well parameterized for soybean under the local conditions consequently an appropriate simulation of the crop yield response to water was achieved especially regarding canopy cover development and yield 3 2 assessment of net irrigation requirements the nir simulated for 30 years for the varieties antonia and lenka planted on 26 april and 8 may respectively are shown in fig 5 there is only a slight difference between both nir curves this is because the only difference between both simulations is the planting date since the two varieties did not differ in the parameters related to the water relations of the plant for planting date 26 april fig 5a nir ranged from 119 to 183 mm for low demand years i e when the probability of exceedance was pnir 90 240 324 mm for average demand years 40 pnir 75 and 369 401 mm for high demand years pnir 20 for planting date 8 may fig 5b nir ranged from 110 to 163 mm for low demand years pnir 90 241 308 mm for average demand years 40 pnir 75 and 344 385 mm for high demand years pnir 20 nir simulations showed that year 2018 had a very high irrigation demand while 2019 was a moderately wet year both regardless of variety and planting date when planting on 26 april fig 5a pnir 16 for year 2018 and pnir 68 for year 2019 when planting on 8 may pnir 19 for year 2018 and pnir 65 for year 2019 therefore 2018 was overall one of the driest years amongst the period between 1990 and 2019 the yields when irrigating according to the nir ranged between 3084 and 4041 kg ha 1 for variety antonia planting by 26 april and 4033 5133 kg ha 1 for variety lenka planting by 8 may not shown the duration of the soybean cycle when planting by 26 april ranged from 117 to 166 days however when planting by 8 may the crop cycles in 1990 and 1991 were prolonged to 258 and 300 days this is because the model does not include proper functions to simulate crop death under low temperature conditions which represents a limitation when simulating crops in the northern hemisphere average nir simulated for the time series as well as nir for the years 2018 and 2019 were considerably larger than the irrigation amounts used by the farmers the average nir for the 30 years time series were 278 mm for planting on 26 april and 287 mm for planting on 8 may for the years 2018 and 2019 nir resulted in 372 mm for planting on 26 april and 258 mm for planting on 8 may however the net irrigation amounts used by the farmers were between 90 and 137 mm in 2018 and 54 and 76 mm in 2019 rainfall during the vegetation period varied highly between 274 and 774 mm among all the investigated years and both plating dates therefore simulated crop water use calculated as the sum of effective rainfall capillary rise and nir was in the range of 638 and 919 mm 3 3 assessment of farmers irrigation schedules and alternative irrigation strategies water productivity indicators were used to assess farmers irrigation schedules used in 2018 and 2019 the results from the observed irrigation schedules in table 10 showed that although yields were larger in 2018 wpirrig was larger in the bi and si plots in 2019 since applied water was less than in 2018 in 2018 larger values of wpet were obtained because actual yield was larger in 2018 compared to 2019 and etc was generally smaller in 2018 than in 2019 wpfarm was larger in 2018 also because yield was larger on that year and further because twu was less due to lower soil water content levels in 2019 the largest wpirrig was obtained in the bi plot whereas in 2018 it was obtained in the di plot in both years the smallest wpirrig was found in the si plot wpet was the largest in the bi plot both years while the smallest wpet was found in the ni in 2019 the largest wpfarm was also found in the bi plot whilst the smallest in the ni plot the results of ryd in 2019 ranged from 13 in bi plot to 47 in the ni plot table 10 similarly the lowest ryd in 2018 was found in the bi plot and the largest in the ni plot corresponding to 27 and 64 respectively hence the differences between observed and potential yields were larger in 2018 compared to 2019 due to the climatic conditions and irrigation decisions made in 2018 rainfall was almost two times larger during the emergence and vegetative stages in 2019 140 mm than in 2018 96 mm despite the dry conditions during vegetative stages irrigation in 2018 was scheduled when flowering had already started and rainfall amounts were larger 159 mm between flowering and maturity moreover larger amounts of irrigation water were used in 2018 compared to 2019 however in 2018 the crops experienced the type of stress that affects canopy development early in the growing season consequently affecting the hio and producing yield reductions severe deficit sd and moderate deficit md strategies were simulated for varieties antonia 2018 and lenka 2019 for sprinkler si and drip di plots the wp indicators from those strategies as well as the results from the full irrigation fi strategy are shown in table 11 the strategies were compared to the farmers irrigation schedules used in 2018 and 2019 table 10 in general more water was used by the sprinklers due to the lower efficiency of the system compared to the drip system see table 3 the results from 2019 showed that sd strategy in the di plot had the highest irrigation water productivity wpirrig 7 57 kg m 3 since iwu was reduced considerably from 86 mm famer s in 2019 to 33 mm sd in di in 2019 however a quite low yield was obtained from that strategy ya 2524 kg ha 1 iwu yields and wpirrig resulting from md strategies in the si and di plots in 2019 table 11 were comparable to the ones obtained by the farmers in that year table 10 it can be concluded that although the irrigation in si and di plots in 2019 caused moderate stress to the crops the yields were not severely affected wpet and wpfarm differences among irrigation strategies were quite small in both years in 2018 wpirrig was also the largest under sd strategy in the di plot however the sd strategy produced a considerably large yield reduction of 39 in the di plot therefore severe deficit greatly penalizes yields during years of high irrigation demand a larger yield was obtained from md strategy than the observed in the di plot while using the same amount of irrigation water in the case of the si plot 13 mm of more water under the md strategy increased the yield by 445 kg ha 1 compared to the observed one consequently a ryd of 21 was achieved under md strategy in the si plot whereas a ryd of 34 resulted from the farmers irrigation scheduling in that plot the irrigation strategies were assessed over a period of 30 years 1990 2019 box plots showing the distributions of iwu wpirrig and ryd for the 30 years time series are presented in fig 6 the number of observations considered for the box plot calculations are shown at the top of the plots in blue color mean values of the indicators are shown in red in fig 6 mean values followed by different letters differ significantly at p 0 05 according to a wilcoxon pairwised test as expected iwu values from full irrigation strategies si fi and di fi were significantly larger than the iwu from the farmers and deficit strategies fig 5a thus significantly low wpirrig fig 6b were obtained from the fi strategies conversely the strategies with the smallest iwu were both deficit strategies using drip lines di sd and di md therefore those strategies had the largest wpirrig fig 6b a significant reduction of iwu was observed under di md strategy compared to di 2018 whereas di md and di 2019 were not significantly different iwu from di sd was significantly lower than di 2018 and di 2019 both deficit strategies increased wpirrig considerably in the di plot although not significantly compared to the farmers strategies regarding the si plot the results indicated that a significant amount of water can be saved under si sd compared to si 2018 wpirrig from si 2018 was significantly lower than si 2019 si sd and si md strategies the widest inter annual variability of iwu was found under the si fi strategy with one exceptionally wet year corresponding to 2010 and depicted as an outlier also observed in the di fi strategy fig 6 the deficit strategies in the si plot showed larger inter annual variability than in the di plot because the gross amounts of sprinkler irrigation were larger than those of drip due to the lower efficiency coefficient applied conversely the deficit strategies in the di plot showed the widest range of wpirrig values among the studied years exceptional wpirrig values as large as 20 kg m 3 were observed in wet years this is because the wpirrig does not account for the precipitation that contributed to obtain large yields overall mean ryd for the 30 years time series were between 19 and 11 mean ryd of 16 and 11 were obtained from si sd and si md strategies respectively similarly the mean ryd in di sd was 19 and in di md was 15 fig 6c therefore approximately a further ryd of 4 5 could result from a sd irrigation scheduling compared to a md moreover the narrowest range of ryd was observed under the md strategies 0 25 for si md and 0 30 for di md which can be interpreted as less risk of yield losses compared to the farmers 0 39 for si plot and 0 38 for di plot and sd strategies 3 40 for both si and di plots 4 discussion 4 1 parameterization and performance of the aquacrop model the model aquacrop was used to simulate soybean yield response to water in a subhumid environment four plots under different irrigation systems and rainfed conditions were assessed the simulations were compared to measured canopy cover cc data collected during the 2019 crop season the nrmse from cc simulation ranged from 5 21 to 12 5 which were within the range of the results from the study by adeboye et al 2019 and sandhu and irmak 2019 the largest error was observed in the rainfed ni plot suggesting that the model performance decreased under water limiting conditions as observed by sandhu and irmak 2019 in general an accurate simulation of soybeans cc was obtained in this study the calibration was achieved after the adjustment of crop development parameters mostly based on experimental data and the stress thresholds such as p exp upper based on the studies by silva et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 the differences between the starting dates of maturity between the two variants were represented in the model as duration of the crop cycle the end of the crop cycle for variety antonia was 20 days before variety lenka according to field observations and confirmed by the model considering that variety antonia was planted 13 days before variety lenka this means that variety antonia reached maturity 7 days before variety lenka as it is supposed for soybeans in maturity levels 4 antonia and 6 lenka moreover the yields of variety antonia were larger than those of variety lenka which was also indicated in the model by increasing the reference harvest index of the former therefore it is concluded that the differences between the two varieties were well accounted in the simulations the changes in the harvest index were made considering that highly variable harvest index values have been reported for soybeans depending to a large extent on their genotype for example krisnawati and adie 2015 found an average harvest index value of 38 from 29 soybean genotypes in the case of hio values ranging from 30 marković et al 2020 to 62 adeboye et al 2017 have been used for simulating soybeans in aquacrop therefore as stated by steduto et al 2012 hio is closely linked to the characteristics of the crop cultivars and conditions of the region where they are grown in this study a value of 39 was used as hio for variety antonia 2018 which was similar to the model default value of 40 and to 38 used by paredes et al 2015 in the case of variety lenka 2019 a hio of 30 was used obtained from observed data regarding the soil water content swc simulations the values from aquacrop were compared to measurements from 2019 and 2018 during both seasons the model was able to reproduce the dynamics of wetting and drying periods however a tendency of underestimation was observed especially in the ni plot this behaviour persisted even though the parameters that control the swc in the model were modified to achieve agreement with measurements for example kctr x thresholds of onset of soil water stress rew and cn were adjusted without success nrmse was between 6 and 16 for the 2019 dataset and 11 and 27 for the 2018 dataset such large swc errors as the ones observed in 2018 were also obtained after the calibration of the model for maize performed in the study by sandhu and irmak 2019 other authors have reported poor swc simulations by aquacrop and attributed it to inaccurate partitioning of transpiration and evaporation e g paredes et al 2014 sandhu and irmak 2019 also mentioned that under stress conditions roots might extract water from deeper layers which is not considered in aquacrop although limitations of the model when simulating swc have been reported in literature in this study the discrepancies were mainly attributed to inaccurate swc measured with sm1 capacitance probes sources of inaccuracies from capacitance probes include low operational frequency that allows salinity kelleners et al 2004 baumhardt et al 2000 and relaxation effects due to bad contact between soil and probes fares and polyakov 2006 dominate the output of the probes evett et al 2012 demonstrated that the capacitance probes were very sensitive to bulk electrical conductivity and soil structure which are highly linked to the resulting value of permittivity therefore biased values of water content can be expected from such sensors when soils are well structured and with relatively large bulk electrical conductivity with some layers wetter than others evett et al 2012 in this context plenty of repetitions in the field are required to account for the soil and water status heterogeneities which is highly impractical in this study the analysis of the swc dynamics and water stress thresholds evidenced that the water balance was well simulated and the sensors overestimated the swc in most cases despite uncertainties in swc results the accurate cc simulations allowed an adequate determination of grain yield the results showed that there was no trend of under or over estimation in the yield predictions from the irrigated plots which relative differences rd were satisfactory and in the range of those reported by da silva et al 2020 the largest rd between simulated and observed yield was found in the ni plot this could be partially attributed to inaccurate estimation of actual transpiration in the model when water stress occurs giménez et al 2017 paredes et al 2015 also reflected in the errors from cc and swc simulations in the ni plot in this study the deviations around the observed means from all the plots were rather large therefore the simulated yields were within the ranges of the measured ones 4 2 recommendations for irrigation management based on simulations of nir yield and water productivity the model was also applied for a range of climatic conditions represented by the 30 years weather data series between 1990 and 2019 the simulations provided an overview of the net irrigation requirements nir for planting dates 26 april and 8 may for high demand years nir was between 344 and 401 mm being smaller when planting by 8 may these results were similar to the ones obtained for soybeans under full irrigation treatments by giménez et al 2017 and montoya and otero 2019 the latter in a humid temperate climate and during dry years the nir results showed that delaying planting increases the risk of underdevelopment of crops due to low temperatures these results are in contrast to the findings in warmer climates where delayed planting date for soybean should be most effective alternative to mitigate the thermal effects of climate change ramteke et al 2015 therefore even though water might be saved when planting on 8 may or later the consequences that come with late planting such as low winter temperatures should be evaluated when scheduling planting dates the comparison of yield and irrigation amounts between the farmers strategies and deficit irrigation schedules based on readily available water raw thresholds were in line with previous research about stress on soybeans studies have demonstrated that water deficiency especially when it occurs during the flowering and pods filling stages is one of the main factors affecting soybean development demirtaş et al 2010 giménez et al 2017 marcelo et al 2018 the assessment of the farmers irrigation scheduling in 2018 and 2019 agrees with these results from literature since the stress during development vegetative in 2019 produced less relative yield decrease ryd than the stress during flowering reproductive in 2018 table 10 additionally in the study by giménez et al 2017 the highest impacts of water stress were observed when deficits were imposed for the period from the vegetative to the grain filling stages the results from the present study supported these findings since the sd strategy i e severe deficit throughout the entire season produced considerably large ryd especially in 2018 table 11 conversely when less stress was imposed during the reproductive stages i e md strategy iwu values were comparable to those that the farmers used in 2018 and 2019 while yield was maintained and even increased in some cases table 10 and table 11 these results suggested that a moderate deficit is an appropriate strategy to be adopted by the farmers under the climatic conditions of this study this is especially applicable for drip irrigation since almost half or the irrigation amount was necessary to achieve similar yields than with sprinkler irrigation concerning the water productivity results wpet values from the farmers and deficit strategies for the years 2018 and 2019 table 10 and table 11 were mostly within the ranges presented by mekonnen et al 2020 on the other hand wpet values in this study were larger than those obtained by sincik et al 2008 demirtaş et al 2010 and adeboye et al 2020 wpet values usually vary among locations because etc act is not normalized by the evaporative demand using for example eto wpfarm values obtained in this study were larger than the results found by evett and howell 2000 this can be attributed to the fact that evett and howell 2000 estimated twu as the sum of irrigation rainfall and decrease in stored soil moisture this approach assumes larger amounts of twu than the approach used in study therefore lower wpfarm can be expected from other studies larger wpirrig values were obtained from all the strategies analysed in this study than the ones from other studies gajić et al 2018 evett and howell 2000 garcia y garcia et al 2010 demirtaş et al 2010 marković et al 2016 this is because wpirrig depends highly on precipitation regime especially in humid areas yu et al 2020 which makes it difficult to directly compare the results from this study with literature moreover the wpirrig results were greatly influenced by the irrigation efficiency factor applied a higher efficiency was assumed for drip irrigation system thus wpirrig was usually larger in the di plot than in the si the substantial improvement of water productivity under drip system due to little water loss through surface runoff or deep percolation was also observed by zhang et al 2021 the statistical analysis of iwu wpirrig and ryd for a time series of 30 years indicated that similar yield reductions can result by applying significantly different amounts of irrigation for example significantly different iwu amounts were estimated from md and sd strategies under the same irrigation system which resulted in non significantly different wpirrig and ryd fig 6 therefore reducing etc act under deficit irrigation may not necessarily lead to a significant decrease in yield kang et al 2000 du et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 these results suggested that inducing severe deficit on soybeans represents an alternative to avoid significant yield losses when water is seriously limited the results of iwu and ryd from di md versus si md were not significantly different the same applied after comparing di sd against si sd however wpirrig was significantly larger under deficit strategies for the di plot in relation to the si plot the main difference between the farmers strategies and di md is the irrigation amounts which varied for the former and were fixed to 15 mm per event for the latter consequently the irrigation events of di md were more frequent than those of the farmers strategies moreover di md responded to raw thresholds and farmers strategies to empirical knowledge after running di md strategy for the time series it was found that in 43 of the investigated years at least one irrigation event was required in the first 15 days of the month of july dap 54 68 furthermore most irrigation was needed during the dry period between the second half of july and the beginning of august on the other hand the start of irrigation according to the farmers in 2018 was delayed until the second half of july and in 2019 no irrigation was applied in august therefore the deficit irrigation strategies based on raw thresholds indicated that irrigation should be applied during the most sensitive crop growth stages reproductive and driest summer months these results showed that in contrast to the farmers strategies the deficit irrigation strategies suggested in this study responded to the crop water requirements similar to the iwu of 70 mm for di md from this study marković et al 2016 found that 80 mm was enough to compensate the lack of rainfall during average climatic years for soybeans under subhumid conditions given these results a moderate deficit using drip irrigation is a good alternative when aiming at improving wpirrig while maintaining yields and promoting a sustainable water management 5 conclusions aquacrop was parameterized to simulate canopy cover yields above ground biomass soil water content and water productivity of soybeans under rainfed and irrigated conditions for two consecutive seasons the model parameterization was tested successfully resulting in low estimation errors in simulating canopy cover therefore the agreement between the measured and simulated canopy cover was excellent which is very important for predicting soil water biomass and grain yield in the model the water content sensors provided inaccurate readings thus the estimation errors for this variable were large soil water content measurements in the rainfed plot may also have been underestimated by the model as its performance decreased under dry conditions however soil water storage variability was well captured by aquacrop during the growing seasons a good agreement was found between observed and simulated yields it was therefore concluded that the model parameterization was suitable for irrigation scheduling the model was used to simulate a variety of climatic conditions from 1990 to 2019 this showed a wide range of net irrigation requirements which were almost four times larger in years with very high demand than in wet years to overcome the challenge of maintaining yields under insufficient and poorly distributed rainfall deficit irrigation strategies were evaluated the assessment of irrigation strategies based on raw thresholds i e depletion indicated that a moderate deficit irrigation with reduced stress during reproductive stages was found to be suitable for soybeans in subhumid areas especially when drip irrigation systems are used in case drip systems are not available or not accepted a moderate deficit with sprinklers is also an alternative considering that there would be a trade off between larger gross irrigation amounts and lower relative yield decrease it should be noted that proper application of deficit irrigation requires technical support to farmers such as high quality soil water content sensors to facilitate monitoring of soil water in the root zone the results of this study provide a technical reference for evaluating the irrigation efficiency of different technologies and a theoretical basis for irrigation decision making in subhumid areas moreover a new perspective of water productivity under different irrigation methods and levels was revealed which could serve as

hackl and dasten atasoy from adcon telemetry for technical support appendix four sm1 probes with 90 cm length were calibrated the probes delivered water content in scaled frequency units sfu at nine depths as well as soil temperature in c at 15 cm 45 cm and 75 cm depths the nine water content sensors within the probes are referred to here as s1 to s9 the sm1 calibration was carried out using a stable cylindrical pvc tube dn 300 which had a height of 79 cm and inner diameter of 29 5 cm a coated wooden plate was mounted 22 cm from the top of the tube as a leakage free base with a hole in the middle to place one sm1 access tube the access tube was fixed to a block of wood to keep it stable the soil used for the calibration was collected from the topsoil 0 15 cm depth of the obersiebenbrunn field the soil material was sieved with a 2 mm sieve to facilitate filling into the pvc tube and avoid gaps near the access tube first measurements were taken in water the space in the pvc tube above the coated wooden base was filled up to 15 cm height with tap water to ensure the scaled frequency readings of the medium from a single sensor at a time due to the fixation of the access tube and the space needed to fill in the water or later the soil and to extract undisturbed soil samples it was not possible to do the readings at the uppermost position in 10 cm therefore when the sensor board to be tested was introduced completely in the access tube the first sensor reading was in 20 cm s2 after collecting five readings of each sensor the board was lifted to continue with the following sensor until the one in 90 cm s9 wooden rulers were used to fix the sensor board in a straight vertical position and avoid damage once the water readings from all probes were collected the measurements in soil started the space in the pvc tube above the coated wooden base was filled up to 15 cm height with air dried soil the measurement procedure at different depths was the same as for the test in water the measurements were repeated at increasing soil water contents to achieve the next volumetric water content to measure a volume of water was added to the soil in the pvc tube set up estimated as follows a 1 v w v pore θ add in equation a 1 vw is the volume of water in cm3 required to reach a desired volumetric water content vpore in cm3 is the volume of pores in the soil calculated from

obtained 0 041 0 061 0 136 0 230 0 362 cm3 cm 3 in addition measured values were recorded in air at 28 c ambient temperature after recording data from the four sensor boards at a specific soil water status four undisturbed soil samples were taken around the access tube using metallic cylinders of known mass and volume to obtain the gravimetric water content the samples were weighed and dried in the oven at 105 c until their mass remained constant and then were weighed again the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density ρb calculated from the wet and dry mass as well to determine the volumetric water content θ the measurements in soil ended up in different volumetric water content θ values and the respective sensor readings rs the latter ones were normalized by using the sensor readings in air ra and in water rw the normalized values n were calculated by using the formula a 2 n r a r s r a r w the normalized sensor reading n is a dimensionless number having the values n 0 for an air reading and n 1 for a measurement in tap water at 28 c to obtain fitted curves and develop a calibration function the data pairs i e θ vs n were related to each other by

commission 2012 the use of conservation practices cps such as cover crops conservation tillage or 4rs nutrient management on fields has been widely prioritized over treatment systems which can be overwhelmed tomer et al 2013 and are particularly effective when such cps are used together i e stacked recent work has shown that edge of field p losses from fields that employ multiple on field cps are small 0 5 kg ha 1 in comparison to estimated losses from fields that do not employ multiple cps 1 1 5 kg ha 1 tan and zhang 2011 williams et al 2017 plach et al 2019 however even multiple on field cps may not be enough to meet the ambitious targets that have been set smith et al 2015 scavia et al 2019 thus the application of treatment cps such as filters at the edge of field on farms that are already using in field cps may offer opportunities to further reduce p losses in runoff in the great lakes region a significant proportion of annual nutrient losses occur under peak flow conditions that typically occur during the non growing season macrae et al 2007 king et al 2015 lam et al 2016 pease et al 2018 plach et al 2019 in the undulating loam soils surface runoff represents the dominant p pathway at the edge of field mittelstet et al 2011 van esbroeck et al 2016 plach et al 2019 the majority of which is associated with snowmelt macrae et al 2010 van esbroeck et al 2017 unfortunately some of the cps commonly used to reduce p losses in surface runoff such as cover crops and riparian zones can be less effective during the non growing season hoffmann et al 2009 darch et al 2015 kieta et al 2018 and are typically more effective at reducing sediment erosion and particulate p pp than dissolved p species although total phosphorus tp losses in surface runoff are dominated by pp in the great lakes region macrae et al 2021 they also include soluble reactive p srp which is highly bioavailable thus there is a need for cps that are effective under cold conditions i e the non growing season and are effective at reducing both dissolved and particulate p fractions phosphorus removal structures are being explored as a strategy to reduce p losses from agricultural lands these structures are designed to capture and remove p leaving fields in runoff and work best in conjunction with other on land cps penn et al 2017 some p removal structures use large amounts biproduct or rocks rich in ca fe and al bryant et al 2012 penn et al 2020 which can be placed in large ditches bryant et al 2012 as edge of field filters penn et al 2017 or long flow through beds penn et al 2020 however not all farms have layouts conducive to the installation of large p removal structures and some materials may be difficult to obtain e g biproduct commercially available filters fig s1 installed at field edges may offer a low cost easy to use alternative to reduce p concentrations in surface runoff such filters typically consist of a woven fabric exterior sock filled with porous media that can facilitate p removal examples of materials can be sand woodchips or rock with additional sources of metal ions suitable for removing phosphate including ca fe and al rollin lombard 1988 devlin et al 2017 the larger materials trap particulates but the inclusion of metal ions facilitates sorption of dissolved p zhang et al 2016 these filters offer an opportunity to further reduce p losses from fields that already employ multiple cps because they are less likely to become saturated with p or clogged quickly by sediment and they are expected to function all year round including during the non growing season which is a time of high p loss risk macrae et al 2010 although many p sorbing materials psms have shown success in controlled laboratory or wastewater treatment environments søvik kløve 2005 renman and renman 2010 herrmann et al 2014 they often do not perform as well in a field setting klimeski et al 2012 penn et al 2017 differences observed between lab and field results can likely be explained by a number of factors including ph water residence time flow rate clogging and p concentrations szabó et al 2008 klimeski et al 2012 winston et al 2017 few filter based p removal studies have been conducted in field settings under variable climatic and flow conditions and little is known about their efficacy during the non growing season despite the fact that p loss is dominant during this period in cold temperate regions thus the goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a simple commercially available filter sock to mitigate agricultural p and sediment losses in edge of field runoff from two fields already using stacked in field cps in ontario canada over a 2 year period the study addresses the following specific objectives 1 quantify the reduction in edge of field losses of total p tp soluble reactive p srp and total suspended sediments tss from surface runoff by the filter 2 characterize differences in the form of p removed i e dissolved versus particulate and estimate the relative solubility of p retained by the filter i e loosely versus tightly bound and 3 identify potential factors filter age flow volume flow rate p concentrations driving temporal variability in p and tss retention efficacy of the filter 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this research was conducted on two working farms in midwestern ontario that have been monitored since 2011 fig s1 these sites have been previously reported on by van esbroeck et al 2016 2017 lozier et al 2017 and plach et al 2018 2019 the study took place over two water years oct 1 sept 30 from 2016 to 2018 both sites have humid continental climates the ild site receives 1247 mm precipitation per year 17 as snow and has a mean annual temperature of 8 2 whereas the lon site receives 1024 mm of precipitation 30 as snow and has a mean temperature of 7 2 eccc 2019 mean air temperatures are below freezing between december and march eccc 2019 the 7 8 ha ild site has hummocky topography with imperfectly drained soils of the thorndale silt loam and embro silt loam varieties hagerty and kingston 1992 the 8 1 ha lon site has a gently undulating topography that is also imperfectly drained with perth clay loam as its dominant soil type hoffman et al 1952 both fields are systematically tile drained the fields have both followed a corn soy winter wheat rotation and have both been at the same stage of this rotation since 2011 table s1 other cps used by the farmers include conservation tillage strip till at ild and shallow 5 cm vertical till at lon following wheat harvest with no till during corn and soy rotations the use of cover crops after winter wheat oat at ild red clover or oat at lon and 4 r nutrient management strategies for fertilizer applications table s1 fertilizer was applied at both sites in august of 2017 after the wheat was harvested and was the only amendment to the soils throughout the study period table s1 the sites are comparable in their soil organic matter content ph calcium content and soil fertility table s2 soil olsen p was 18 mg kg at ild and 21 mg kg lon depth weighted average top 15 cm table s3 filters were installed at both sites along field edges where surface runoff exits the field and is monitored the filters contained a combination of wood chips clay and gypsum pellets encased in a mesh woven fabric sock approximately 40 cm in diameter at the lon site the filter material was wrapped in a semi circle around a surface runoff outlet culvert in 3 different layers fig s1 whereas at ild the material was placed in concentric circles stacked two layers high around a surface inlet that drained surface runoff from the field fig s1 filter materials were installed in concentric circles to provide multiple opportunities for the filters to retain p in surface runoff approximately 7 6 m of the geotextile material was used with a total estimated weight of 100 kg of material at each of the research sites approximate cost of 400 site each site was equipped for monitoring flow and for water quality sampling of the tile drain effluent as described previously in van esbroeck et al 2016 tile flow and water quality were measured to calculate total edge of field runoff and p losses for each site as such no tile drainage water was treated by filters during this study only surface runoff 3 field and laboratory methods for surface runoff and tile drainage each site was equipped with a meteorological station to record rainfall s rgb m002 onset ltd and air temperature s thb m002 onset ltd 1 m above the soil surface at the edge of the field at 15 minute intervals snowfall data cm of snow that fell and snow depth on ground was recorded hourly at nearby weather stations located closest to the sites 30 km from lon site 20 km from the ild site eccc 2018 snow accumulation estimates from the weather stations were validated with on site snow surveys before large runoff events using standard techniques and values were found to be comparable the outlets for surface runoff and tile drainage at each field were equipped with flow sensors flo tote 3 avensys canada as well as water level loggers u20 onset ltd for periods in which flow sensors did not function or were being serviced all measurements were taken at 15 minute intervals automated water samplers teledyne isco 6700 avensys canada were placed before and after the filter material to collect high frequency samples throughout the duration of surface runoff events for the study period oct 1 2016 sept 30 2018 autosamplers were triggered when flow commenced and collected water samples at intervals between 30 min and 3 hrs for surface runoff events and at 2 8 hrs intervals in tile drainage adjusted seasonally to span the entire event hydrograph described in van esbroeck et al 2016 sampling bottles were acid washed 10 h2so4 and triple rinsed with milli q prior to water collection water samples collected from the sites were retrieved from the field within 24 h warm conditions and 72 hrs cool cold conditions of collection and the samples were either frozen and stored for later analyses during busy seasons or promptly processed in the laboratory a lab comparison of samples that were frozen prior to filtration against samples that were filtered prior to freezing did not reveal significant changes to srp concentrations from these sites macrae and plach unpublished data phosphorus species were analyzed using colorimetric analysis at the university of waterloo in the biogeochemistry lab bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical seattle for each sample a 50 ml aliquot was passed through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter and analyzed for srp ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method no g 175 96 rev 13 seal

then method no g 188 097 aaiii bran luebbe seal analytical detection limits were 0 001 mg l 1 for srp and 0 01 mg l 1 for tp analytical precision was determined on 10 duplicates and found to be 6 of reported values a subset of unfiltered samples was analyzed for tss where 100 ml of sample was passed through a 0 7 µm filter whatman 42 dried at 105 c for 1 hr and the dry mass of material on the filter was obtained gravimetrically the difference between tp and srp is the sum of both particulate p pp and soluble unreactive p sup however the analysis of a subset of samples n 200 for total dissolved p srp sup found sup to be very small and that the sup pp fraction was dominated by pp 90 thus is described as pp in this paper at both study sites water samples were collected for a majority of surface runoff events before and after the filter as well as tile drainage i e 88 of surface events 95 of total surface flow 86 of tile events 95 of tile flow however a few events were missed due to equipment failure for sampled events flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc were calculated from discrete water samples and continuous flow data using the methods of williams et al 2016 and p losses were estimated by multiplying fwmc by the total flow for a given event for small events missed by autosamplers fwmc were applied from a similar size event in the same season and multiplied by the flow to estimate the p losses surface runoff only occurred during peak flow conditions and was thus considered event flow however for tile drainage there were low flow periods 2 5 l s 1 between event peaks with no rain i e baseflow conditions phosphorus concentrations during baseflow conditions were assigned the detection limit 0 001 mg l 1 for srp and 0 01 mg l 1 for tp as has been observed consistently at these sites over an 8 year period and verified by periodic grab samples collected throughout the current study period total p losses for each season and water year include both event and baseflow conditions the mass of p retained by the filter was determined by subtracting the p load below the filter from the p load above the filter kg ha 1 a positive value denotes net retention by the filter while a negative value represents a net release the differences in fwmc of srp tp and tss concentrations before and after the filter for all events were compared using a series of paired t tests a value of p 0 05 was considered significant 4 laboratory analysis of filter material the commercially available filter material used in this study was composed of large woodchips 2 45 mm small gypsum pellets 1 2 mm and even smaller clay particles 1 mm mixed together this material was all contained within a mesh fabric sock 30 cm in diameter wide in the fall of 2016 material from the filters at ild and lon was taken from the filter sock and stored before it experienced any runoff events and labelled as unused filters were placed in semi circles around surface runoff exit points from the fields fig s1 filters were not used for the tile drainage exit points in february 2018 after a year and a half of use 500 g of material from the filters at both sites were retrieved and transported to the laboratory this material was taken from the center of the innermost layer of the filter at each site to ensure it had interacted with all runoff and is referred to here as used all material was dried at 30 for 24 h ground in batches subsequently sieved to 2 mm and homogenized prior to analysis the grinding process broke up the large woodchip pieces which ranged in width from 2 5 cm while the particles of gypsum and clay were already small and became blended into the mixture 5 solid phase p fractionation and p saturation index solid phase p partitioning of used and unused filter material from lon and ild was determined following zhang and kovar 2009 this method was previously used to analyze solid phase p partitioning of the surface and subsurface soils at the lon and ild sites plach et al 2018 briefly a subsample of 1 g of sieved 2 mm material was subjected to a four step sequential extraction table 2 the four operationally defined p pools were 1 loosely bound p e g adsorbed p onto oxide surfaces al and fe and or p compounds soluble in bases and bound to clay 2 moderately bound p i e redox sensitive pool 3 tightly bound p i e acid soluble phases which may include ca bound p and 4 residual p e g the refractory organic p pool the sum of the four pools is reported as total extractable srp after each extraction step the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min 11 180 xg and the remaining material was washed with saturated nacl the extract and wash from each extraction step were combined into polypropylene tubes and stored at 4 oc until analysis all samples from each step were analyzed for srp within 24 h of extraction in the biogeochemistry lab at the university of waterloo using the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method on a bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical seattle usa samples from step 2 were corrected for interferences between the extract and molybdate by oxidizing excess dithionite that result from allowing the samples to be exposed to air and the addition of ammonium molybdate to each sample to improve colour development weaver 1974 extracts from steps 1 and 3 were neutralized with hcl and naoh respectively before analysis for the entire procedure 10 duplicates were conducted and the relative percent difference between the duplicates were 6 the total extractable srp retained by the filter was determined by multiplying the sum of all four fractions mg kg by an estimated mass of 100 kg of filter material at each site a phosphorus sorption index psi was determined on used and unused filter material from both sites following the methods of bache and williams 1971 briefly 1 g of the dried ground 2 mm filter material was combined with 25 ml of a 75 mg p l 1 solution kh2po4 in 0 01 m kcl to 50 ml conical polypropylene tubes and agitated for 18 h on a mechanical shaker in triplicate samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 mins 2 795 xg filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter delta scientific and stored at 4 the srp concentrations of the filtrate from each sample were determined colorimetrically 6 results 6 1 edge of field hydrological losses and phosphorus concentrations tile flow and surface runoff were observed over the study period at both sites although tile drains represented the dominant hydrological pathway at both sites 90 at ild 60 75 at lon fig 1 table 1 total hydrological losses in tile drainage over the study period were comparable between the sites whereas surface runoff was considerably greater at the lon site than at the ild site table 1 total runoff volumes at the lon site were similar for the two study years whereas more runoff occurred from the ild site in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 1 both sites experienced seasonal conditions typical for the region although there were some departures from long term average climatic conditions fig s1 both study years were drier than normal ild was 21 drier in 2016 2017 and 44 drier in 2017 2018 than the 1217 mm long term normal precipitation lon was 25 drier in 2016 2017 and 29 drier in 2017 2018 than the 1372 mm long term normal phosphorus concentrations were greater in surface runoff than tile drainage particularly at the lon site fig 1 surface runoff represented the dominant p pathway at the lon site 57 of tp loss 25 discharge in 2016 2017 82 of tp loss 40 discharge in 2017 2018 table 1 in contrast tile drains represented the dominant p pathway at the ild site table 1 the greater proportion of water moving over the surface at lon in 2017 2018 relative to the previous year coincided with a tile blockage occurring in autumn 2017 that was removed in november 2017 across both sites and years srp accounted for 50 60 of the tp in surface runoff in contrast srp only represented 20 30 of tp in tile drainage at ild and 20 of tp in tile drainage at lon table 1 most hydrological p and tss losses occurred during the non growing season ngs fig 1 and were associated with storm or thaw events fig 1 table s3 phosphorus losses from the sites were greater in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 1 the greater p losses in 2017 2018 coincide with a larger number of surface runoff events and more runoff in general fig 1 but also with a p application at the beginning of the 2017 2018 water year tables s2 s3 these data represent p losses exiting the field prior to treatment by the filter 7 removal of phosphorus species and sediments from surface runoff by filter in each of the study years approximately half of tss lost in surface runoff at the edge of field was removed by the filter 56 at ild 39 43 at lon unfortunately tss was not measured in tile drainage so the total reduction in edge of field tss losses by the filter cannot be quantified in contrast the removal efficacy of the filter for p differed with p species time and between the two sites at the ild site 55 of tp 89 of srp and 38 of pp in surface runoff were removed by the filter in the first year but only 12 of tp 8 of srp and 16 of pp in the second year 18 of tp 16 of srp 21 of pp losses in surface runoff over the entire study period however given that tile drainage was the largest p pathway at this site and the tile drain was not equipped with a filter when the contribution of tile drainage to edge of field p losses at the ild site is included the surface filter only removed 2 of edge of field tp losses over the study period the removal efficacy of the filter at the lon site was considerably lower as the filter led to a net increase in tp losses at the edge of field 6 in surface runoff over study period table 1 although the filter removed 6 2016 2017 and 21 2017 2018 of pp 17 for the entire study period from surface runoff it increased srp losses by 47 2016 2017 and 16 2017 2018 in surface runoff 21 for the entire study period which led to a net increase in tp in surface runoff and ultimately edge of field losses in both years table 1 8 p fractions retained by the filter at the start of the study the unused filter material contained approximately 66 69 mg kg of total extractable p primarily retained as loosely bound p table 2 following 1 5 years of deployment in the field the used filter material retained contained higher total extractable p i e 239 290 mg kg both sites of which the majority 90 at ild 71 at lon was stored in the loosely bound p pool table 2 the other three p pools also increased by the end of the study period suggesting that a smaller portion of p removed from the runoff was retained as more tightly bound p e g potentially occluded within metal oxides such as iron and or bound tightly with calcium the distribution of retained p across the different fractions differed slightly between the two sites at the lon site a greater proportion of the retained p was in the more tightly held fractions i e moderately soluble p tightly bound p and residual p with an average of 8x more p held in these pools in the used material relative to the unused filter material in contrast the quantity of p held in the more tightly bound fractions only doubled at the ild site although it was exposed to less runoff over the study period 43 mm at ild 366 mm at lon the material at ild retained 50 mg kg more total extractable p overall than the lon material psi tests indicate that the unused material from ild and lon and the used material from ild were able to sorb similar amounts of p at all concentration levels in contrast the used material from lon had a reduced capacity to remove additional p from solution table 2 for example the used material at lon adsorbed less than half the srp of the other materials 9 potential drivers of temporal variation in p removal efficacy of the filter to infer potential mechanisms driving retention efficacy of filters reductions in p species and sediments were examined as a function of time flow volume per event and cumulatively the flow rate of runoff and initial p concentrations in runoff during surface runoff events that occurred early in the study period following installation of the filters jan may 2017 n 5 at ild n 4 at lon proportions of srp and tp were retained by the filter 80 100 of srp was retained at ild whereas only 8 30 of srp was retained at lon fig 2 table s1 at both sites the efficacy of removal as a of losses was larger for srp than for tp during these initial events although greater absolute quantities of tp were retained than srp it is important to note that the losses during these events were small in comparison with other events over the study period fig 3 table s3 representing only 15 of srp and 11 of tp losses in surface runoff at ild and 27 of srp and 9 of tp losses in surface runoff at lon over the study period there was a notable change in filter performance at both sites after the filters had been in the field for one year once surface runoff resumed in the second water year fig 2 table s3 a significant multi day rain event at the lon site 65 mm coupled with a blocked tile drain led to prolonged multi day standing water in the topographic depression in the field where the filter was installed and several surface runoff responses between september and november 2017 this was not observed at the ild site table s3 fig 1 during this event and for all subsequent events at the lon site both srp and tp concentrations were greater below the filter than above the filter the increases in tp below the filter were largely attributed to srp as particulate p and dissolved unreactive p i e tp srp continued to decrease below the filter table s3 in contrast srp pp and tp continued to decrease below the filter at the ild site although at a smaller rate than during the first year over the study period the filter at the lon site was in contact with runoff water for almost twice as long as the ild filter was and experienced more surface runoff overall as a result of a larger number of events and longer duration event responses at the ild site surface runoff during most events lasted less than a single day with the longest event occurring over 3 days however at lon after initially experiencing small events the remaining events were very large and all ranged from one to five days in length indeed the decrease in filter performance at the lon site occurred following an event during which the filter material was submerged for approximately five days cumulative flow through the filter fig 2 may have had an effect as the lon filter began to release srp and tp after approximately 100 mm of cumulative surface runoff had occurred in contrast the ild filter only experienced 40 mm of surface runoff over the entire study period it is unclear if the filter efficacy would diminish after 100 mm of cumulative runoff at the ild site the filter performance may have also been impacted by the total volume of runoff passing through the filter during a given runoff event fig 3 most of the events at ild experienced 20 mm of surface runoff and showed net srp retention in contrast the majority of events at lon experienced 20 mm of surface runoff at both sites those events that were small in size 10 mm surface runoff experienced net retention of srp by the filter but clear patterns were not apparent for tp or tss events exceeding 10 mm of runoff in magnitude experienced little retention at either site the velocity of surface runoff may also have played a role in p retention by affecting residence time in the filter an examination of peak flow rates for each event as a surrogate for velocity fig 3 suggests that p retention occurred during events with low peak flow conditions although clear relationships are not apparent with peak flow rates another possible driver of filter performance may be the initial concentrations of p in the water entering the filter fig 3 no clear relationships were found between p or tss concentrations in runoff and filter retention efficacy 10 discussion the data presented in this paper have shown that filters at the edge of field were able to remove srp and tp from surface runoff during the lower intensity runoff events that occurred early in the study period at both sites these events when srp and tp were more effectively retained by the filters occurred during the most hydrologically active ngs when other p reducing cps are typically less effective however the overall removal of p from surface runoff was small over the study period ranging from a 18 reduction of tp at ild to an increase of tp by 6 at lon and the removal of tss from surface runoff was more substantial e g 42 of tss removed at lon over the study period phosphorus removal efficacy was greater at the ild site than at the lon site this suggests that while there is potential for the use of filters at the edge of field their efficacy may vary across landscape types and flow regimes and for different p species and they should therefore be used with caution 10 1 efficacy of filters for sediment trapping and p retention the removal efficacies of the filters used in this study were very low at the lon site with a small net release of srp and tp observed 6 of tp in surface runoff however at the ild site 18 of tp in surface runoff they were comparable to other field investigations of psm albeit at the low end for example an in ditch gypsum filter removed 22 of total dissolved p bryant et al 2012 and riparian buffers removed 32 of tp in 2 m wide buffers and 54 in 5 m wide buffers abu zreig et al 2003 such removal efficacies are low relative to more sophisticated systems e g 40 50 of tp and 30 80 of drp removed by an integrated filter bed and riparian buffer system zak et al 2018 21 59 of tp removed by constructed wetlands braskerud 2002 lu et al 2009 20 50 for srp removed by slag and alum sludge boyer et al 2011 and up to 99 of p removed in ca rich slag filtration systems barca et al 2012 however in systems where more sophisticated removal structures are not feasible due to lack of resources or land the filters used in the current study may offer a low cost and low disturbance short duration opportunity to reduce p losses at the edge of field filters were only used for surface runoff in the current study the fact that most p is lost in tile drainage at the ild site due to very small surface runoff volumes van esbroeck et al 2016 plach et al 2019 lessened the overall impact of the use of filters in surface runoff at this site indeed opportunities exist to explore the use of filters or psm in both surface and subsurface runoff to increase p retention at the edge of field the removal of particulate material tss pp was greater than the removal of srp and srp was even released at the lon site offsetting the overall tp removal efficacy the greater potential for the removal of pp and tss observed in this study has also been shown in other p retention systems such as riparian buffers abu zreig et al 2003 dabney et al 2006 hoffmann et al 2009 or alternative types of filters choudhury et al 2016 large particles in tss are more effectively removed whereas lower pp removal reflects greater p sorption to finer particulates with larger specific surface area which do not settle as readily parfitt 1979 sharpley 1980 the filters used in the current study are a mixture of wood chips gypsum pellets and clay held together by a woven sock thus potential retention mechanisms for srp by the filters are chemical interactions with ca penn mcgrath 2011 barca et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 adsorption onto metal oxides on the clays penn and warren 2009 or even retained particulate material from fields the repeated submergence of the filter in standing water on fields at the lon site may have reduced p retention as a result of dissolution of the gypsum pellets p saturation of available free binding sites on the clay particles and or potential release of srp by reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide coatings on clay minerals during protracted periods of water saturation of the filter materials the results of the filter p solid phase analysis demonstrated that although some srp was retained in more tightly held forms a majority was loosely held sol p and thus had significant opportunity for remobilization through desorption or dissolution reactions e g chorus and mur 1999 antelo et al 2005 liu et al 2012 penn and warren 2009 one large difference between the sites was that the used ild material contained more total srp than the lon material despite having much less runoff pass through and lower concentrations of srp over all events this may be explained by the multiple large runoff events at lon in the fall of 2017 which led to a large release of srp from the lon filter likely reflecting a combination of dissolution desorption and high rates of water flow through the filter 10 2 effects of phosphorus and sediment concentration and flow rate on filter performance initial p concentration in runoff is often a contributing factor to filter performance previous laboratory research on p retention by filters in agricultural drainage water used p concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mg l 1 and reported high retention rates johansson westholm 2006 barca et al 2012 however field based studies with similar p and tss concentrations to those in the current study report similar reductions in p and tss to this study abu zreig et al 2003 boyer at al 2011 bryant et al 2012 zak et al 2018 concentrations of p in field runoff samples in the current study were most often below 1 mg l 1 tp and thus may have been too low for the filter to retain appreciable quantities of p given that the efficacy of filters is reduced when p concentration in input water is small penn et al 2017 although it is recommended that psm should be combined with other cps to reduce p losses at the edge of field penn et al 2017 there may be a threshold below which psms at the edge of field do not offer additional benefits when stacked on top of on field cps indeed field studies in which psm have shown greater removal efficacies have typically been associated with sites with legacy p build up e g bryant et al 2012 penn et al 2017 penn et al 2020 or large initial p concentrations in runoff ádám et al 2005 herrmann et al 2014 these findings suggest that the potential efficacy of filters at the edge of field may vary both with hydroclimatological and landscape i e runoff volume and velocity conditions but also p supply flow rate likely played a role in the filter performance for individual events due to the reduced residence time which would reduce the potential for the trapping of particulate materials within the filter as well as the time for srp sorption to occur szabó et al 2008 other studies have shown p removal efficiency tends to be greater 60 at lower flow rates mcdowell et al 2007 penn et al 2012 the configuration of fields and surface runoff pathways may also be relevant as surface runoff exits both fields at a single location more so at lon dabney et al 2006 showed an increase in p reduction within and edge of field filter that experienced slow and diffuse flow thus there may be greater opportunity for p removal in fields where surface runoff exits fields in a more diffuse manner the data in this study indicate a progressive exhaustion of p retention by the filters over the two years of study decreased filter performance was more evident at the lon site than at the ild site and appeared to be related to a combination of cumulative runoff and event magnitude the exhaustion of psm and the associated reduction in p removal efficacy has been observed in other applications szabó et al 2008 postila et al 2017 mendes 2020 demonstrating a need to refresh or replace psm at regular intervals for example penn et al 2020 recommend replacing or rejuvenating steel slag filters every 4 6 months to ensure adequate p removal although the filters were not replaced at any point during this two year study their portable nature and low cost would easily permit such routine maintenance although frequent replacement may make the practice more cost prohibitive and may ultimately lessen farmer uptake 11 conclusions and management implications this study evaluated the efficacy of a commercially available low cost low disturbance water filtration product for removing p and tss in surface runoff from agricultural fields that already employed multiple conservation practices i e the filter was intended to be an additional conservation practice stacked onto other conservation practices the filters were selected because they were simple low cost and portable and could be easily placed at the edge of field to filter surface runoff that might encourage farmer adoption the filters were tested at sites where existing multiple stacked conservation practices including such as rotational conservation till nutrient management cover crops had been implemented to examine whether p losses at the edge of field could be further reduced although these filters had some ability to remove tss from surface runoff up to 42 removal of tss at the lon site their impacts on p removal from surface runoff were found to be minimal ranging from a 18 removal of tp at ild to a 6 release at lon and a progressive exhaustion of p retention by the filters was observed over the two years of the study however the edge of field p and sediment losses were small to begin with owing to effective conservation management further work is now needed to establish whether these portable low cost edge of field filters

8933,nutrient losses from agricultural fields are the largest sources of phosphorus p entering the great lakes in north america stacked conservation practices cps may reduce p losses from individual fields simple low cost low disturbance commercially available filters containing wood chips and phosphorus sorbing materials psm were installed on two fields already using conservation practices in midwestern ontario ild and lon to quantify their ability to remove soluble reactive p srp particulate p pp total p tp and total suspended sediments tss from surface runoff laboratory tests on unused new and used field filter materials were also conducted to estimate p sorption and remobilization potentials during the two year study period the filter retained 0 018 kg ha 1 of srp 0 38 kg ha 1 of pp 0 4 kg ha 1 of tp and 8 75 kg ha 1 of tss from surface runoff at the ild site in contrast although the filter at lon removed 37 kg ha 1 of tss and 0 07 kg ha 1 of pp it released 0 22 kg ha 1 of srp and 0 15 kg ha 1 tp a reduction in filter efficacy was observed over time particularly at the site with greater cumulative surface runoff and larger runoff events lon the majority of the srp retained by the filter was held in a loosely bound form thus susceptible to p remobilization the results of this study demonstrate that low cost simple psms have some potential to retain p from surface runoff but their efficacy may decline over time and their p retention capability may differ with site hydrology e g runoff volumes and velocity and p supply keywords tile drainage seasonality water quality phosphorus sorbing materials agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the great lakes region of north america is experiencing recurring harmful and nuisance algal blooms due in part to non point source phosphorus p originating from agricultural lands carpenter et al 1998 lake erie lamp 2011 mckindles et al 2020 lake erie is particularly vulnerable to algal growth maccoux et al 2016 and consequently the international joint commission created target goals for the reduction of p entering lake erie by 40 from 2008 levels by 2025 ijc 2014 great lakes commission 2012 the use of conservation practices cps such as cover crops conservation tillage or 4rs nutrient management on fields has been widely prioritized over treatment systems which can be overwhelmed tomer et al 2013 and are particularly effective when such cps are used together i e stacked recent work has shown that edge of field p losses from fields that employ multiple on field cps are small 0 5 kg ha 1 in comparison to estimated losses from fields that do not employ multiple cps 1 1 5 kg ha 1 tan and zhang 2011 williams et al 2017 plach et al 2019 however even multiple on field cps may not be enough to meet the ambitious targets that have been set smith et al 2015 scavia et al 2019 thus the application of treatment cps such as filters at the edge of field on farms that are already using in field cps may offer opportunities to further reduce p losses in runoff in the great lakes region a significant proportion of annual nutrient losses occur under peak flow conditions that typically occur during the non growing season macrae et al 2007 king et al 2015 lam et al 2016 pease et al 2018 plach et al 2019 in the undulating loam soils surface runoff represents the dominant p pathway at the edge of field mittelstet et al 2011 van esbroeck et al 2016 plach et al 2019 the majority of which is associated with snowmelt macrae et al 2010 van esbroeck et al 2017 unfortunately some of the cps commonly used to reduce p losses in surface runoff such as cover crops and riparian zones can be less effective during the non growing season hoffmann et al 2009 darch et al 2015 kieta et al 2018 and are typically more effective at reducing sediment erosion and particulate p pp than dissolved p species although total phosphorus tp losses in surface runoff are dominated by pp in the great lakes region macrae et al 2021 they also include soluble reactive p srp which is highly bioavailable thus there is a need for cps that are effective under cold conditions i e the non growing season and are effective at reducing both dissolved and particulate p fractions phosphorus removal structures are being explored as a strategy to reduce p losses from agricultural lands these structures are designed to capture and remove p leaving fields in runoff and work best in conjunction with other on land cps penn et al 2017 some p removal structures use large amounts biproduct or rocks rich in ca fe and al bryant et al 2012 penn et al 2020 which can be placed in large ditches bryant et al 2012 as edge of field filters penn et al 2017 or long flow through beds penn et al 2020 however not all farms have layouts conducive to the installation of large p removal structures and some materials may be difficult to obtain e g biproduct commercially available filters fig s1 installed at field edges may offer a low cost easy to use alternative to reduce p concentrations in surface runoff such filters typically consist of a woven fabric exterior sock filled with porous media that can facilitate p removal examples of materials can be sand woodchips or rock with additional sources of metal ions suitable for removing phosphate including ca fe and al rollin lombard 1988 devlin et al 2017 the larger materials trap particulates but the inclusion of metal ions facilitates sorption of dissolved p zhang et al 2016 these filters offer an opportunity to further reduce p losses from fields that already employ multiple cps because they are less likely to become saturated with p or clogged quickly by sediment and they are expected to function all year round including during the non growing season which is a time of high p loss risk macrae et al 2010 although many p sorbing materials psms have shown success in controlled laboratory or wastewater treatment environments søvik kløve 2005 renman and renman 2010 herrmann et al 2014 they often do not perform as well in a field setting klimeski et al 2012 penn et al 2017 differences observed between lab and field results can likely be explained by a number of factors including ph water residence time flow rate clogging and p concentrations szabó et al 2008 klimeski et al 2012 winston et al 2017 few filter based p removal studies have been conducted in field settings under variable climatic and flow conditions and little is known about their efficacy during the non growing season despite the fact that p loss is dominant during this period in cold temperate regions thus the goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a simple commercially available filter sock to mitigate agricultural p and sediment losses in edge of field runoff from two fields already using stacked in field cps in ontario canada over a 2 year period the study addresses the following specific objectives 1 quantify the reduction in edge of field losses of total p tp soluble reactive p srp and total suspended sediments tss from surface runoff by the filter 2 characterize differences in the form of p removed i e dissolved versus particulate and estimate the relative solubility of p retained by the filter i e loosely versus tightly bound and 3 identify potential factors filter age flow volume flow rate p concentrations driving temporal variability in p and tss retention efficacy of the filter 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this research was conducted on two working farms in midwestern ontario that have been monitored since 2011 fig s1 these sites have been previously reported on by van esbroeck et al 2016 2017 lozier et al 2017 and plach et al 2018 2019 the study took place over two water years oct 1 sept 30 from 2016 to 2018 both sites have humid continental climates the ild site receives 1247 mm precipitation per year 17 as snow and has a mean annual temperature of 8 2 whereas the lon site receives 1024 mm of precipitation 30 as snow and has a mean temperature of 7 2 eccc 2019 mean air temperatures are below freezing between december and march eccc 2019 the 7 8 ha ild site has hummocky topography with imperfectly drained soils of the thorndale silt loam and embro silt loam varieties hagerty and kingston 1992 the 8 1 ha lon site has a gently undulating topography that is also imperfectly drained with perth clay loam as its dominant soil type hoffman et al 1952 both fields are systematically tile drained the fields have both followed a corn soy winter wheat rotation and have both been at the same stage of this rotation since 2011 table s1 other cps used by the farmers include conservation tillage strip till at ild and shallow 5 cm vertical till at lon following wheat harvest with no till during corn and soy rotations the use of cover crops after winter wheat oat at ild red clover or oat at lon and 4 r nutrient management strategies for fertilizer applications table s1 fertilizer was applied at both sites in august of 2017 after the wheat was harvested and was the only amendment to the soils throughout the study period table s1 the sites are comparable in their soil organic matter content ph calcium content and soil fertility table s2 soil olsen p was 18 mg kg at ild and 21 mg kg lon depth weighted average top 15 cm table s3 filters were installed at both sites along field edges where surface runoff exits the field and is monitored the filters contained a combination of wood chips clay and gypsum pellets encased in a mesh woven fabric sock approximately 40 cm in diameter at the lon site the filter material was wrapped in a semi circle around a surface runoff outlet culvert in 3 different layers fig s1 whereas at ild the material was placed in concentric circles stacked two layers high around a surface inlet that drained surface runoff from the field fig s1 filter materials were installed in concentric circles to provide multiple opportunities for the filters to retain p in surface runoff approximately 7 6 m of the geotextile material was used with a total estimated weight of 100 kg of material at each of the research sites approximate cost of 400 site each site was equipped for monitoring flow and for water quality sampling of the tile drain effluent as described previously in van esbroeck et al 2016 tile flow and water quality were measured to calculate total edge of field runoff and p losses for each site as such no tile drainage water was treated by filters during this study only surface runoff 3 field and laboratory methods for surface runoff and tile drainage each site was equipped with a meteorological station to record rainfall s rgb m002 onset ltd and air temperature s thb m002 onset ltd 1 m above the soil surface at the edge of the field at 15 minute intervals snowfall data cm of snow that fell and snow depth on ground was recorded hourly at nearby weather stations located closest to the sites 30 km from lon site 20 km from the ild site eccc 2018 snow accumulation estimates from the weather stations were validated with on site snow surveys before large runoff events using standard techniques and values were found to be comparable the outlets for surface runoff and tile drainage at each field were equipped with flow sensors flo tote 3 avensys canada as well as water level loggers u20 onset ltd for periods in which flow sensors did not function or were being serviced all measurements were taken at 15 minute intervals automated water samplers teledyne isco 6700 avensys canada were placed before and after the filter material to collect high frequency samples throughout the duration of surface runoff events for the study period oct 1 2016 sept 30 2018 autosamplers were triggered when flow commenced and collected water samples at intervals between 30 min and 3 hrs for surface runoff events and at 2 8 hrs intervals in tile drainage adjusted seasonally to span the entire event hydrograph described in van esbroeck et al 2016 sampling bottles were acid washed 10 h2so4 and triple rinsed with milli q prior to water collection water samples collected from the sites were retrieved from the field within 24 h warm conditions and 72 hrs cool cold conditions of collection and the samples were either frozen and stored for later analyses during busy seasons or promptly processed in the laboratory a lab comparison of samples that were frozen prior to filtration against samples that were filtered prior to freezing did not reveal significant changes to srp concentrations from these sites macrae and plach unpublished data phosphorus species were analyzed using colorimetric analysis at the university of waterloo in the biogeochemistry lab bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical seattle for each sample a 50 ml aliquot was passed through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter and analyzed for srp ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method no g 175 96 rev 13 seal

then method no g 188 097 aaiii bran luebbe seal analytical detection limits were 0 001 mg l 1 for srp and 0 01 mg l 1 for tp analytical precision was determined on 10 duplicates and found to be 6 of

filter was obtained gravimetrically the difference between tp and srp is the sum of both particulate p pp and soluble unreactive p sup however the analysis of a subset of samples n 200 for total dissolved p srp sup found sup to be very small and that the sup pp fraction was dominated by pp 90 thus is described as pp in this paper at both study sites water samples were collected for a majority of surface runoff events before and after the filter as well as tile drainage i e 88 of surface events 95 of total surface flow 86 of tile events 95 of tile flow however a few events were missed due to equipment failure for sampled events flow weighted mean concentrations fwmc were calculated from discrete water samples and continuous flow data using the methods of williams et al 2016 and p losses were estimated by multiplying fwmc by the total flow for a given event for small events missed by autosamplers fwmc were applied from a similar size event in the same season and multiplied by the flow to estimate the p losses surface runoff only occurred during peak flow conditions and was thus considered event flow however for tile drainage there were low flow periods 2 5 l s 1 between event peaks with no rain i e baseflow conditions phosphorus concentrations during baseflow conditions were assigned the detection limit 0 001 mg l 1 for srp and 0 01 mg l 1 for tp as has been observed consistently at these sites over an 8 year period and verified by periodic grab samples collected throughout the current study period total p losses for each season and water year include both event and baseflow conditions the mass of p retained by the filter was determined by subtracting the p load below the filter from the p load above the filter kg ha 1 a positive value denotes net retention by the filter while a negative value represents a net release the differences in fwmc of srp tp and tss concentrations before and after the filter for all events were compared using a series of paired t tests a value of p 0 05 was considered significant 4 laboratory analysis of filter material the commercially available filter material used in this study was composed of large woodchips 2 45 mm small gypsum pellets 1 2 mm and even smaller clay particles 1 mm mixed together this material was all contained within a mesh fabric sock 30 cm in diameter wide in the fall of 2016 material from the filters at ild and lon was taken from the filter sock and stored before it experienced any runoff events and labelled as unused filters were placed in semi circles around surface runoff exit points from the fields fig s1 filters were not used for the tile drainage exit points in february 2018 after a year and a half of use 500 g of material from the filters at both sites were retrieved and transported to the laboratory this material was taken from the center of the innermost layer of the filter at each site to ensure it had interacted with all runoff and is referred to here as used all material was dried at 30 for 24 h ground in batches subsequently sieved to 2 mm and homogenized prior to analysis the grinding process broke up the large woodchip pieces which ranged in width from 2 5 cm while the particles of gypsum and clay were already small and became blended into the mixture 5 solid phase p fractionation and p saturation index solid phase p partitioning of used and unused filter material from lon and ild was determined following zhang and kovar 2009 this method was previously used to analyze solid phase p partitioning of the surface and subsurface soils at the lon and ild sites plach et al 2018 briefly a subsample of 1 g of sieved 2 mm material was subjected to a four step sequential extraction table 2 the four operationally defined p pools were 1 loosely bound p e g adsorbed p onto oxide surfaces al and fe and or p compounds soluble in bases and bound to clay 2 moderately bound p i e redox sensitive pool 3 tightly bound p i e acid soluble phases which may include ca bound p and 4 residual p e g the refractory organic p pool the sum of the four pools is reported as total extractable srp after each extraction step the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min 11 180 xg and the remaining material was washed with saturated nacl the extract and wash from each extraction step were combined into polypropylene tubes and stored at 4 oc until analysis all samples from each step were analyzed for srp within 24 h of extraction in the biogeochemistry lab at the university of waterloo using the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method on a bran luebbe aa3 seal analytical seattle usa samples from step 2 were corrected for interferences between the extract and molybdate by oxidizing excess dithionite that result from allowing the samples to be exposed to air and the addition of ammonium molybdate to each sample to improve colour development weaver 1974 extracts from steps 1 and 3 were neutralized with hcl and naoh respectively before analysis for the entire procedure 10 duplicates were conducted and the relative percent difference between the duplicates were 6 the total extractable srp retained by the filter was determined by multiplying the sum of all four fractions mg kg by an estimated mass of 100 kg of filter material at each site a phosphorus sorption index psi was determined on used and unused filter material from both sites following the methods of bache and williams 1971 briefly 1 g of the dried ground 2 mm filter material was combined with 25 ml of a 75 mg p l 1 solution kh2po4 in 0 01 m kcl to 50 ml conical polypropylene tubes and agitated for 18 h on a mechanical shaker in triplicate samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 mins 2 795 xg filtered through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter delta scientific and stored at 4 the srp concentrations of the filtrate from each sample were determined colorimetrically 6 results 6 1 edge of field hydrological losses and phosphorus concentrations tile flow and surface runoff were observed over the study period at both sites although tile drains represented the dominant hydrological pathway at both sites 90 at ild 60 75 at lon fig 1 table 1 total hydrological losses in tile drainage over the study period were comparable between the sites whereas surface runoff was considerably greater at the lon site than at the ild site table 1 total runoff volumes at the lon site were similar for the two study years whereas more runoff occurred from the ild site in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 1 both sites experienced seasonal conditions typical for the region although there were some departures from long term average climatic conditions fig s1 both study years were drier than normal ild was 21 drier in 2016 2017 and 44 drier in 2017 2018 than the 1217 mm long term normal precipitation lon was 25 drier in 2016 2017 and 29 drier in 2017 2018 than the 1372 mm long term normal phosphorus concentrations were greater in surface runoff than tile drainage particularly at the lon site fig 1 surface runoff represented the dominant p pathway at the lon site 57 of tp loss 25 discharge in 2016 2017 82 of tp loss 40 discharge in 2017 2018 table 1 in contrast tile drains represented the dominant p pathway at the ild site table 1 the greater proportion of water moving over the surface at lon in 2017 2018 relative to the previous year coincided with a tile blockage occurring in autumn 2017 that was removed in november 2017 across both sites and years srp accounted for 50 60 of the tp in surface runoff in contrast srp only represented 20 30 of tp in tile drainage at ild and 20 of tp in tile drainage at lon table 1 most hydrological p and tss losses occurred during the non growing season ngs fig 1 and were associated with storm or thaw events fig 1 table s3 phosphorus losses from the sites were greater in 2017 2018 than in 2016 2017 table 1 the greater p losses in 2017 2018 coincide with a larger number of surface runoff events and more runoff in general fig 1 but also with a p application at the beginning of the 2017 2018 water year tables s2 s3 these data represent p losses exiting the field prior to treatment by the filter 7 removal of phosphorus species and sediments from surface runoff by filter in each of the study years approximately half of tss lost in surface runoff at the edge of field was removed by the filter 56 at ild 39 43 at lon unfortunately tss was not measured in tile drainage so the total reduction in edge of field tss losses by the filter cannot be quantified in contrast the removal efficacy of the filter for p differed with p species time and between the two sites at the ild site 55 of tp 89 of srp and 38 of pp in surface runoff were removed by the filter in the first year but only 12 of tp 8 of srp and 16 of pp in the second year 18 of tp 16 of srp 21 of pp losses in surface runoff over the entire study period however given that tile drainage was the largest p pathway at this site and the tile drain was not equipped with a filter when the contribution of tile drainage to edge of field p losses at the ild site is included the surface filter only removed 2 of edge of field tp losses over the study period the removal efficacy of the filter at the lon site was considerably lower as the filter led to a net increase in tp losses at the edge of field 6 in surface runoff over study period table 1 although the filter removed 6 2016 2017 and 21 2017 2018 of pp 17 for the entire study period from surface runoff it increased srp losses by 47 2016 2017 and 16 2017 2018 in surface runoff 21 for the entire study period which led to a net increase in tp in surface runoff and ultimately edge of field losses in both years table 1 8 p fractions retained by the filter at the start of the study the unused filter material contained approximately 66 69 mg kg of total extractable p primarily retained as loosely bound p table 2 following 1 5 years of deployment in the field the used filter material retained contained higher total extractable p i e 239 290 mg kg both sites of which the majority 90 at ild 71 at lon was stored in the loosely bound p pool table 2 the other three p pools also increased by the end of the study period suggesting that a smaller portion of p removed from the runoff was retained as more tightly bound p e g potentially occluded within metal oxides such as iron and or bound tightly with calcium the distribution of retained p across the different fractions differed slightly between the two sites at the lon site a greater proportion of the retained p was in the more tightly held fractions i e moderately soluble p tightly bound p and residual p with an average of 8x more p held in these pools in the used material relative to the unused filter material in contrast the quantity of p held in the more tightly bound fractions only doubled at the ild site although it was exposed to less runoff over the study period 43 mm at ild 366 mm at lon the material at ild retained 50 mg kg more total extractable p overall than the lon material psi tests indicate that the unused material from ild and lon and the used material from ild were able to sorb similar amounts of p at all concentration levels in contrast the used material from lon had a reduced capacity to remove additional p from solution table 2 for example the used material at lon adsorbed less than half the srp of the other materials 9 potential drivers of temporal variation in p removal efficacy of the filter to infer potential mechanisms driving retention efficacy of filters reductions in p species and sediments were examined as a function of time flow volume per event and cumulatively the flow rate of runoff and initial p concentrations in runoff during surface runoff events that occurred early in the study period following installation of the filters jan may 2017 n 5 at ild n 4 at lon proportions of srp and tp were retained by the filter 80 100 of srp was retained at ild whereas only 8 30 of srp was retained at lon fig 2 table s1 at both sites the efficacy of removal as a of losses was larger for srp than for tp during these initial events although greater absolute quantities of tp were retained than srp it is important to note that the losses during these events were small in comparison with other events over the study period fig 3 table s3 representing only 15 of srp and 11 of tp losses in surface runoff at ild and 27 of srp and 9 of tp losses in surface runoff at lon over the study period there was a notable change in filter performance at both sites after the filters had been in the field for one year once surface runoff resumed in the second water year fig 2 table s3 a significant multi day rain event at the lon site 65 mm coupled with a blocked tile drain led to prolonged multi day standing water in the topographic depression in the field where the filter was installed and several surface runoff responses between september and november 2017 this was not observed at the ild site table s3 fig 1 during this event and for all subsequent events at the lon site both srp and tp concentrations were greater below the filter than above the filter the increases in tp below the filter were largely attributed to srp as particulate p and dissolved unreactive p i e tp srp continued to decrease below the filter table s3 in contrast srp pp and tp continued to decrease below the filter at the ild site although at a smaller rate than during the first year over the study period the filter at the lon site was in contact with runoff water for almost twice as long as the ild filter was and experienced more surface runoff overall as a result of a larger number of events and longer duration event responses at the ild site surface runoff during most events lasted less than a single day with the longest event occurring over 3 days however at lon after initially experiencing small events the remaining events were very large and all ranged from one to five days in length indeed the decrease in filter performance at the lon site occurred following an event during which the filter material was submerged for approximately five days cumulative flow through the filter fig 2 may have had an effect as the lon filter began to release srp and tp after approximately 100 mm of cumulative surface runoff had occurred in contrast the ild filter only experienced 40 mm of surface runoff over the entire study period it is unclear if the filter efficacy would diminish after 100 mm of cumulative runoff at the ild site the filter performance may have also been impacted by the total volume of runoff passing through the filter during a given runoff event fig 3 most of the events at ild experienced 20 mm of surface runoff and showed net srp retention in contrast the majority of events at lon experienced 20 mm of surface runoff at both sites those events that were small in size 10 mm surface runoff experienced net retention of srp by the filter but clear patterns were not apparent for tp or tss events exceeding 10 mm of runoff in magnitude experienced little retention at either site the velocity of surface runoff may also have played a role in p retention by affecting residence time in the filter an examination of peak flow rates for each event as a surrogate for velocity fig 3 suggests that p retention occurred during events with low peak flow conditions although clear relationships are not apparent with peak flow rates another possible driver of filter performance may be the initial concentrations of p in the water entering the filter fig 3 no clear relationships were found between p or tss concentrations in runoff and filter retention efficacy 10 discussion the data presented in this paper have shown that filters at the edge of field were able to remove srp and tp from surface runoff during the lower intensity runoff events that occurred early in the study period at both sites these events when srp and tp were more effectively retained by the filters occurred during the most hydrologically active ngs when other p reducing cps are typically less effective however the overall removal of p from surface runoff was small over the study period ranging from a 18 reduction of tp at ild to an increase of tp by 6 at lon and the removal of tss from surface runoff was more substantial e g 42 of tss removed at lon over the study period phosphorus removal efficacy was greater at the ild site than at the lon site this suggests that while there is potential for the use of filters at the edge of field their efficacy may vary across landscape types and flow regimes and for different p species and they should therefore be used with caution 10 1 efficacy of filters for sediment trapping and p retention the removal efficacies of the filters used in this study were very low at the lon site with a small net release of srp and tp observed 6 of tp in surface runoff however at the ild site 18 of tp in surface runoff they were comparable to other field investigations of psm albeit at the low end for example an in ditch gypsum filter removed 22 of total dissolved p bryant et al 2012 and riparian buffers removed 32 of tp in 2 m wide buffers and 54 in 5 m wide buffers abu zreig et al 2003 such removal efficacies are low relative to more sophisticated systems e g 40 50 of tp and 30 80 of drp removed by an integrated filter bed and riparian buffer system zak et al 2018 21 59 of tp removed by constructed wetlands braskerud 2002 lu et al 2009 20 50 for srp removed by slag and alum sludge boyer et al 2011 and up to 99 of p removed in ca rich slag filtration systems barca et al 2012 however in systems where more sophisticated removal structures are not feasible due to lack of resources or land the filters used in the current study may offer a low cost and low disturbance short duration opportunity to reduce p losses at the edge of field filters were only used for surface runoff in the current study the fact that most p is lost in tile drainage at the ild site due to very small surface runoff volumes van esbroeck et al 2016 plach et al 2019 lessened the overall impact of the use of filters in surface runoff at this site indeed opportunities exist to explore the use of filters or psm in both surface and subsurface runoff to increase p retention at the edge of field the removal of particulate material tss pp was greater than the removal of srp and srp was even released at the lon site offsetting the overall tp removal efficacy the greater potential for the removal of pp and tss observed in this study has also been shown in other p retention systems such as riparian buffers abu zreig et al 2003 dabney et al 2006 hoffmann et al 2009 or alternative types of filters choudhury et al 2016 large particles in tss are more effectively removed whereas lower pp removal reflects greater p sorption to finer particulates with larger specific surface area which do not settle as readily parfitt 1979 sharpley 1980 the filters used in the current study are a mixture of wood chips gypsum pellets and clay held together by a woven sock thus potential retention mechanisms for srp by the filters are chemical interactions with ca penn mcgrath 2011 barca et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 adsorption onto metal oxides on the clays penn and warren 2009 or even retained particulate material from fields the repeated submergence of the filter in standing water on fields at the lon site may have reduced p retention as a result of dissolution of the gypsum pellets p saturation of available free binding sites on the clay particles and or potential release of srp by reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide coatings on clay minerals during protracted periods of water saturation of the filter materials the results of the filter p solid phase analysis demonstrated that although some srp was retained in more tightly held forms a majority was loosely held sol p and thus had significant opportunity for remobilization through desorption or dissolution reactions e g chorus and mur 1999 antelo et al 2005 liu et al 2012 penn and warren 2009 one large difference between the sites was that the used ild material contained more total srp than the lon material despite having much less runoff pass through and lower concentrations of srp over all events this may be explained by the multiple large runoff events at lon in the fall of 2017 which led to a large release of srp from the lon filter likely reflecting a combination of dissolution desorption and high rates of water flow through the filter 10 2 effects of phosphorus and sediment concentration and flow rate on filter performance initial p concentration in runoff is often a contributing factor to filter performance previous laboratory research on p retention by filters in agricultural drainage water used p concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 mg l 1 and reported high retention rates johansson westholm 2006 barca et al 2012 however field based studies with similar p and tss concentrations to those in the current study report similar reductions in p and tss to this study abu zreig et al 2003 boyer at al 2011 bryant et al 2012 zak et al 2018 concentrations of p in field runoff samples in the current study were most often below 1 mg l 1 tp and thus may have been too low for the filter to retain appreciable quantities of p given that the efficacy of filters is reduced when p concentration in input water is small penn et al 2017 although it is recommended that psm should be combined with other cps to reduce p losses at the edge of field penn et al 2017 there may be a threshold below which psms at the edge of field do not offer additional benefits when stacked on top of on field cps indeed field studies in which psm have shown greater removal efficacies have typically been associated with sites with legacy p build up e g bryant et al 2012 penn et al 2017 penn et al 2020 or large initial p concentrations in runoff ádám et al 2005 herrmann et al 2014 these findings suggest that the potential efficacy of filters at the edge of field may vary both with hydroclimatological and landscape i e runoff volume and velocity conditions but also p supply flow rate likely played a role in the filter performance for individual events due to the reduced residence time which would reduce the potential for the trapping of particulate materials within the filter as well as the time for srp sorption to occur szabó et al 2008 other studies have shown p removal efficiency tends to be greater 60 at lower flow rates mcdowell et al 2007 penn et al 2012 the configuration of fields and surface runoff pathways may also be relevant as surface runoff exits both fields at a single location more so at lon dabney et al 2006 showed an increase in p reduction within and edge of field filter that experienced slow and diffuse flow thus there may be greater opportunity for p removal in fields where surface runoff exits fields in a more diffuse manner the data in this study indicate a progressive exhaustion of p retention by the filters over the two years of study decreased filter performance was more evident at the lon site than at the ild site and appeared to be related to a combination of cumulative runoff and event magnitude the exhaustion of psm and the associated reduction in p removal efficacy has been observed in other applications szabó et al 2008 postila et al 2017 mendes 2020 demonstrating a need to refresh or replace psm at regular intervals for example penn et al 2020 recommend replacing or rejuvenating steel slag filters every 4 6 months to ensure adequate p removal although the filters were not replaced at any point during this two year study their portable nature and low cost would easily permit such routine maintenance although frequent replacement may make the practice more cost prohibitive and may ultimately lessen farmer uptake 11 conclusions and management implications this study evaluated the efficacy of a commercially available low cost low disturbance water filtration product for removing p and tss in surface runoff from agricultural fields that already employed multiple conservation practices i e the filter was intended to be an additional conservation practice stacked onto other conservation practices the filters were selected because they were simple low cost and portable and could be easily placed at the edge of field to filter surface runoff that might encourage farmer adoption the filters were tested at sites where existing multiple stacked conservation practices including such as rotational conservation till nutrient management cover crops had been implemented to examine whether p losses at the edge of field could be further reduced although these filters had some ability to remove tss from surface runoff up to 42 removal of tss at the lon site their impacts on p removal from surface runoff were found to be minimal ranging from a 18 removal of tp at ild to a 6 release at lon and a progressive exhaustion of p retention by the filters was observed over the two years of the study however the edge of field p and sediment losses were small to begin with owing to effective conservation management further work is now needed to establish whether these portable low cost edge of field filters may be more effective at retaining p and sediments at higher runoff loadings from fields with higher soil test p levels and greater disturbance from tillage declaration of competing interest the

8934,the water use rights trading system fully embodies a new concept of water resources management of the water saving priority and market oriented governance the price mechanism is a core component of this system and the benchmark price is its cornerstone accordingly this paper analyzes the connotation and characteristics of the water use rights benchmark price wurbp based on the marxist labor theory of value and land rent theory it is proposed that the wurbp should be the economic embodiment of the water use rights value considering the case of the ningxia yellow river irrigated area a wurbp calculation model was established using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to calculate the agricultural wurbp the obstacle degree model was introduced to analyze the main factors affecting the wurbp results show that the wurbp for food crops in the ningxia yellow river irrigation area is 0 252 yuan m3 and 0 652 yuan m3 for cash crops water yield coefficient runoff coefficient per capita gdp farmland irrigation utilization coefficient and ecological water consumption have gradually become the primary obstacles affecting agricultural wurbp water administrative departments should adjust the wurbp according to the actual situation this paper innovatively puts forward the concept of wurbp these results have important practical significance for improving china s agricultural water use rights trading price system keywords water use rights benchmark price the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model influencing factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a key element in resource utilization and ecological protection with the social economy s rapid growth and urbanization acceleration imbalances in regional water resources occur frequently water resources have gradually become an important factor that hampers china s sustainable green development zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore effective conservation and efficient utilization of water resources have important strategic significance in economic development and ecological civilization construction kong et al 2021 the water use rights trading system can play a decisive role in water resources allocation and the core mechanism of this market operation is the pricing howe and christopher 2003 yoo et al 2013 a scientific price mechanism can effectively regulate the supply and demand of water resources thereby promoting the flow of water resources to a higher yield and efficient use tian 2022 therefore water use rights reform and its price mechanism are important policy tools in china s water resources management which can enhance the governance capacity of water resources and improve the modern governance system of water resources in china ownership of water resources belongs to the state therefore previously studied water rights have typically referred to water intake and use rights both water intake and use rights belong to the rights of use but there are significant differences between the two water intake rights refer to the amount of water that can be exploited to develop and utilize regional water resources water use rights refer to water consumption entering a user terminal in transforming water rights from water intake rights to water use rights the distribution and regulation of water rights are typically completed by government departments water use rights are then purchased according to their own needs therefore water trading refers explicitly to trading water use rights dou et al 2014 however owing to the particularity of the trading object the water use rights trading market can only be a quasi market bradley and taylor 2010 that is the market cannot entirely determine the price of water use rights wang 2012 bekchanov et al 2015 to ensure social fairness and reflect the value of public resources the government should play a backstop role in establishing water use rights trading prices therefore it should set the water use rights benchmark price wurbp while considering the water resources value and social development to ensure the healthy operation of the water rights trading market the benchmark price is the industry product s essential and standard price zhao et al 2019 which can guide the formation of the trading price the price formation of water use rights must be based on the wurbp created through market competition therefore establishing a wurbp becomes a more complicated technical difficulty before constructing the benchmark price measurement model we must first clarify the pricing object of the wurbp there are two types of water use rights first the surplus water use rights are formed by the difference between the confirmed and planned amounts and are the water use rights obtained without any element input second the savings of water use rights are caused by water saving transformation or long term adjustment of the planting structure although there is no difference between the two types of water use rights involved in the transaction their formation processes and inputs differ shen et al 2020b based on china s current laws and regulations water use rights saved through water saving projects and technologies are profitable and widely accepted by the academic community shao 2022 however the debate on the universal value of water use rights is still ongoing in the first case of water use rights one needs to ask if the water use rights value be included in the benchmark price and allow the transferor to receive benefits the academic community has been arguing about this which is also one of the key obstacles to reforming water use rights trading it is worth an in depth theoretical analysis considering these two views finding a scientific theoretical basis for the value of water use rights is necessary the value assessment of water use rights should be based on the marxist labor theory of value and land rent theory fang et al 2000 moreover reasonable factors of wealth theory and efficacy theory of western economics are used as the theoretical basis that is the user determines the value which depends on scarcity external development and utilization conditions thus the wurbp is an economic embodiment of the use of water resources as a capitalization of rent it is not limited by the condensation of ordinary undifferentiated human labor therefore the water use rights involved in the transaction can demand the wurbp when trading regardless of whether surplus water is obtained through water conservation the above content indicates that the water use rights value the wurbp and the trading price are both different and related the value of water use rights reflects the resource and economic value of water resources use the wurbp is a policy price formulated by the government based on the water use rights value which has a guiding role in adjusting the water use structures and behaviors the benchmark price can navigate control and adjust trading prices in contrast the trading price is the final price formed by competition and negotiation between buyers and sellers of water use rights based on the wurbp therefore the water use rights value is an integral part of the wurbp which in turn plays a cornerstone role in the trading price that is trading prices result from more market competition whereas the wurbp is the intrinsic price of water use rights the inherent relationship between the water use rights value the wurbp and the trading price is shown in fig 1 previous studies have tended to focus on the final water use rights trading price with few studies involving a benchmark price a study by ning 2008 is the only literature the authors know that strictly uses a benchmark price he studied the benchmark price of water rights transfer under the dual role of the government and the market and proposed that the government should regulate the trading price wu and li 2019 studied the base price of water rights trading they calculated the water rights price of buyers and sellers then carried out bilateral coupling to get the game equilibrium price some studies examine government regulated or reference prices similar to the wurbp they believe that the lower price limit of water trading is the value of water resources ni et al 2019 in addition more literature research objects are the water rights price water rights trading price water rights conversion price and water rights transfer price although the above prices are slightly different they all refer to the final trading price of the water rights market water use rights trading can be divided into three types irrigation water user trading agricultural transfer to industry and regional water use rights trading trading price performance differs for different types of water use rights trading regarding the water use rights price of irrigation water users wang et al 2019 obtained a result similar to the wurbp based on considering the three dimensions of society economy and environment they then formed the final water use rights trading price by market supply and demand yan et al 2020 established an agricultural two stage fuzzy differential water price model its dwpm to calculate the trading price of water use rights under various water shortage conditions regarding the price of water use rights transferred from agriculture to industry zhang et al 2018 measured the trading price of water use rights transferred from agriculture to industry by taking ordos water use rights trading as an example guan et al 2019 used the fuzzy mathematics method and a production function to calculate the trading price of water use rights regarding regional water use rights trading prices chen et al 2021b believed that buyers and sellers should fully consider water resources protection and opportunity costs when setting water use rights trading prices tian et al 2018 proposed a one to one negotiated pricing for regional water use rights and a many to many bidding mechanism for water access rights in addition there are studies on the trading or transfer price of water use rights using the value stream theory shen et al 2020a meta synthesis workshops ren and chen 2012 bargaining models guan et al 2021 and actual option models chen et al 2021a the following characteristics can be observed in existing water use rights price research 1 research on the water use rights market s trading price final price forms the majority of current research whereas research on benchmark price is scarce this also shows that the current academic research and industry management have yet to fully realize the vital position and role of the wurbp in the price formation mechanism 2 the factors that must be considered in forming water use rights trading prices are numerous and complex whereas the factors considered in the relevant literature are quite different however the summary literature shows that the water resources value appears in the category of price considerations therefore the value of water resources is an essential aspect of the price of water use rights and the value of water resources is essential to the price thus a unique study of the wurbp is necessary agricultural irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 65 of total water consumption making it china s most significant water user geng 2020 however the water use efficiency of agricultural irrigation is less than 60 and there is a sizeable spatial difference cui and liu 2021 the agrarian sector shows excellent potential for water conservation maksud et al 2015 and agricultural water conservation is imminent dalin et al 2012 related studies have also confirmed that water use rights trading has improved water saving irrigation technologies and agricultural water use efficiency fei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the trading price still lacks scientific rules therefore taking the ningxia yellow river irrigation area nxyria as an example this study focuses on formulating an agricultural wurbp and introduces an obstacle degree model to analyze the main factors affecting the wurbp the primary contribution of this study is to propose a concept of the wurbp and apply the idea of opportunity cost to the calculation of the benchmark price crops were divided into food and cash crops and their wurbp was calculated the research results have important practical significance for improving the trading and management of water resources and the price system of agricultural water use rights trading in china 2 material and methods water use rights refer to property rights related to water resources the wurbp should be based on the water resources value however the water resources system is complex and influenced by natural economic and social factors hung and chie 2013 therefore the wurbp is not only affected by the number of water resources but also by the scarcity of local water resources the degree of demand and the economic environment han et al 2015 due to an incompatible principle in the complex system the water resources system is fuzzy and cannot simply be judged as either valuable or worthless given that there may be a high medium or low value the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can solve this problem jia et al 2018 the model used in this study to quantitatively evaluate the wurbp in nxyria can be divided into a fuzzy evaluation model and a price calculation model first the value of water use rights is assessed and then the price is calculated by combining the price ceiling and the vector on this basis an obstacle degree model was built to analyze the main factors affecting the value of water use rights to understand the factors affecting the wurbp 2 1 determination of the index weight in the process of multi attribute evaluation the weight has an important influence on the evaluation results scientifically determining the weight of each index factor is of great significance when accurately evaluating water resources value owing to the complexity of modern evaluation and decision making problems using a single method to determine the weight is unreasonable therefore multiple methods should be used to examine the relationship between various indexes comprehensively and to determine the weights of attributes this study used order relation analysis and entropy value methods to measure subjective and objective weights subsequently the game theory combination weighting method determines the final weight xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2 1 1 subjective weights order relation analysis also known as the g1 method is a new subjective weighting method improved based on the analytic hierarchy process this method first ranks the evaluation indexes qualitatively and then makes a rational judgment on the important comparison of adjacent indexes finally this study makes a quantitative calculation the proposed method does not need to construct an importance judgment matrix therefore it can determine the independent weight of the index simply and efficiently 2 1 1 1 determine the order relation experienced experts rank resilience indices based on their importance if the index x i has greater importance than x j it is denoted x i x j an order relation can be established for the k toughness indices of a certain layer x 1 x 2 x k x i is the toughness index after i sorting 2 1 1 2 determine the importance of adjacent indexes after determining the order relationship the experts assigned the importance r k of the adjacent toughness indexes according to table 1 1 r k w k 1 w k k n n 1 n 2 3 2 where r k is the ratio of importance of x k 1 and x k the order relation index r k needs to satisfy r k 1 1 r k n is the number of evaluation indexes and w k represents the weight of the index k 2 1 1 3 calculating the weight of indexes the weight of the kth index was calculated based on the empowerment of experts 2 w k 1 k 2 n i k n r i 1 w k 1 r k w k k n n 1 3 2 where i takes k n 2 1 2 objective weights entropy is an objective weighting method according to the degree of variation of each index the weight of each index was calculated using information entropy for the target above x consists of n samples and m evaluation indices first the positive and negative indices are standardized by eq 3 then x i j is used to calculate the specific gravity p i j of the j item evaluation index of the i sample information entropy e j and entropy weight ω j of the i item index the calculation formula is expressed as follows 3 x i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j thepositiveindicators max x i j x i j max x i j min x i j thenegativeindicators 4 p i j x i j i 1 n x i j i 1 n j 1 m 5 e j k i 1 n p i j ln p i j j 1 m where k 1 ln n 0 and e j 0 6 w j 1 e j j 1 m 1 e j j 1 m 2 1 3 game theory combinatorial empowerment given that the evaluation results of each evaluation method are independent of each other the corresponding evaluation conclusions of different evaluation methods may conflict the game theory combination weighting method can be used to obtain the equilibrium results in the evaluation conclusions of the above conflicts this method considers that each method is competitive and consistent it can find consistency or compromise between different evaluation index weights the combinatorial weighting method used in game theory is convenient scientific comprehensive and objective therefore this method was selected to comprehensively assign the subjective and objective weights obtained above the procedure is as follows 2 1 3 1 construct the base weight vector set using l different weighting methods to calculate the weight of each toughness evaluation index the primary weight vector set w k w k 1 w k 2 w k n k 1 2 l of the evaluation index was constructed here n is the number of toughness indices and any linear combination of these l vectors is as follows 7 w k 1 l λ k w k t λ k 0 where w is a possible combination weight vector in the weight set and λ k is the linear combination coefficient 2 1 3 2 optimize the linear combination coefficient the optimal weight combination coefficient was first solved and game theory was used to balance different weights the nash equilibrium point was then calculated and the deviation between the combined weight and the weight of each method was minimized 8 min k 1 l λ k w k t w k k 1 2 l according to the differential properties of the matrix the first derivative of eq 8 is obtained and transformed into the following linear equation 9 w 1 w 1 t w 1 w 2 t w 1 w n t w 2 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w 2 w n t w n w 1 t w n w 2 t w n w n t λ 1 λ 2 λ n w 1 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w n w n t the optimal combination coefficient λ λ 1 λ 2 λ l can be obtained after solving 2 1 3 3 calculate comprehensive weight 10 λ k λ k k 1 l λ k finally get the comprehensive weight 11 w k 1 l λ k w k t k 1 2 l 2 2 calculation model of the wurbp 2 2 1 fuzzy evaluation model of water use rights it is assumed that the domain n is the value factor of water use rights and the expression is n x 1 x 2 x n where x 1 x 2 x n is a variable influencing factor the evaluation vector of water use rights is divided into five levels namely the evaluation vector m high relatively high common relatively low low the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of water use rights is shown as follows 12 v a u where v is the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix of water use rights a is the set of weights of each index and u is the evaluation membership matrix the specific form of the evaluating membership matrix u is expressed in eq 13 13 u μ 1 1 μ 1 2 μ 1 3 μ 1 4 μ 1 5 μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 2 3 μ 2 4 μ 2 5 μ n 1 μ n 2 μ n 3 μ n 4 μ n 5 where μ n j is the membership value of evaluation index i to each grade in this study a semi trapezoid distribution was selected to establish a linear membership function to calculate the membership degree of each index for different evaluation grades the functional form is expressed as follows 14 μ i 1 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i x i 2 x i 1 x i 1 x i x i 2 0 x i x i 2 j 1 15 μ i 1 x i x i j 1 x i j x i j 1 x i j 1 x i x i j x i j 1 x i x i j 1 x i j x i j x i x i j 1 0 x i x i j 1 x i x i j 1 j 2 3 4 16 μ i 1 0 x i x i 4 x i x i 4 x i 5 x i 4 x i 4 x i x i 5 1 x i x i 5 j 5 where x i is the actual value of the evaluation index i and x i j 1 x i j x i j 1 are the standard value of two adjacent levels of the evaluation index then the evaluation result v is normalized 17 v v i v here v is a dimensionless vector since the result of a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is a sequence without continuity a comprehensive fuzzy index of water use rights is introduced the value of water use rights is divided into five levels representing different value levels and then constructing vector 18 t 5 4 3 2 1 t then the fuzzy comprehensive index w of water use rights can be calculated as follows 19 w v t the comprehensive evaluation index w is between 0 and 5 the greater the index the higher the value of water use rights conversely the lower the value of the water use rights a multi level evaluation of water use rights can be performed based on the above evaluation method for each criterion layer the weight of each index is used to synthesize the evaluation index of the criterion layer then the weight of each criterion layer and the evaluation index of the criterion layer were used to synthesize the comprehensive evaluation index of water use rights 2 2 2 calculation model of the benchmark price a price vector is introduced to present the valuation of water use rights in an economic form the dimensionless vector result of the fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation of water use rights was transformed into the corresponding scalar value of price through the price vector this study uses the conversion formula proposed by jiang 1998 to calculate the wurbp the specific formula is expressed as follows 20 p v s 21 s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 where p is the benchmark price of water use rights v is the comprehensive evaluation vector s is the price vector and p is the upper limit of the water use rights price which is determined according to the method of agricultural affordability referring to the agricultural water price comprehensive reform pilot training materials 1 1 this monograph expounds on the content and requirements of agricultural terminal water price reform taking it as the research basis conforms to the basic needs of china s current comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices this study provides two bases for calculating the affordability of agricultural water charges first agricultural water expenditure accounts for 5 10 of the output value per mu the second is the proportion of agricultural water expenditure in the net agrarian income per mu which is 10 13 determining the bearing capacity of the above two cases and then taking the maximum value as the affordability of the water price the calculation formula is expressed as follows 22 c max a r b r where c represents the maximum affordability of agricultural water price yuan a represents the unit output value of local farmers yuan r represents the maximum proportion of water charges in the output value of local farmers production b represents the net income per unit of farmers yuan r represents the maximum proportion of water fee in local agricultural production and r and r are constants without units the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp is further calculated as follows 23 p c e where e is the current average quota of irrigation water m3 according to field research the per mu input and income of food and cash crops in ningxia differ therefore based on the nature of crops the main crops are wheat rice grain corn potato small grains and silage corn as food crops cold vegetables facility vegetables vegetables for hong kong selenium melon wolfberry and wine grapes planted were used as cash crops the benchmark price limits for water use rights for food and cash crops were calculated fig 2 2 3 obstacle degree model according to existing research this study argues that the intrinsic factor affecting wurbp is the value of water use rights the value of water use rights is affected by various indices therefore water use rights value factors directly affect the benchmark price this paper introduces the obstacle degree model for analysis to explore further the factors affecting the wurbp zhao et al 2021 24 l i j 1 x i j w i j 1 x i j w i j 100 where l i j is the obstacle degree of a single index to the value of water use rights x i j is the standardized value of a single index and w i j is the weight 3 results 3 1 study area and data sources 3 1 1 study area ningxia located in northwest china belongs to the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river the terrain is characterized by a long north south the east west shorter territory of 66 400 km2 and is the smallest province in china various landscapes such as plateaus and mountains are interwoven in the region with complex geological structures and diverse climate types in general ningxia has an arid and semi arid climate with a significant temperature difference between day and night and long sunshine characteristics the overall distribution of precipitation is higher in the south and less in the north and the primary wet months falling over the summer and autumn months statistically the average annual rainfall in ningxia is equivalent to a runoff depth of 289 mm the precipitation is far lower than the average precipitation in the yellow river basin and the national average ningxia is an area experiencing a severe water shortage which has hindered its economic development wang et al 2019 its agricultural production is heavily dependent on yellow river water resources the yellow river irrigation area includes 11 cities and counties in the northern part of the ningxia autonomous region and several state owned agricultural and forestry pastures currently the region has 17 large and medium sized water diversion channels it relies on the yellow river water resources for agricultural irrigation area of up to 5513 33 km2 accounting for 75 of the total irrigation area in ningxia since 2016 the irrigation area has conducted a pilot study of water use rights trading through efficient water saving irrigation at the city and county levels from 2017 2020 there were 27 agricultural water use rights transactions in the irrigation area with a total transaction volume of 9 83 million m3 however owing to the imperfect trading price mechanism the problems such as an inactive trading market unreasonable water use structures and inefficient water use efficiency in irrigated areas have arisen the reform effect is insignificant in tackling these problems therefore research on the benchmark price of agricultural water use rights in the yellow river irrigation area helps improve the price mechanism and cultivate the market to promote market trading of water use rights the location map of the study area is shown in fig 3 the reform effect needs to be more significant in tackling these problems 3 1 2 data sources the data of economic social and water resources indexes used in the calculation of water use rights value in this study are derived from the 2011 2020 ningxia statistical yearbook 2011 2020 ningxia water resources bulletin ningxia water long term supply and demand planning report ningxia water resources allocation plan and other government departments have published documents the data on water use rights trading come from the official website of ningxia hui autonomous region water resources department slt nx gov cn the data on the production efficiency of agricultural products involved are the first hand data obtained by the author through visiting the agriculture and rural affairs department the food and strategic reserves bureau and the water resources department of ningxia hui autonomous region the average data of the last five years is used to make the data more scientific 3 2 indexes selection water use rights value evaluation research has yet to form a unified classification standard and evaluation system this study draws on the ecosystem and human well being evaluation framework proposed by the united nations millennium ecosystem assessment report 2004 based on the concept of sustainable development the factors affecting the evaluation of water use rights are divided into natural social economic and ecological factors simultaneously referring to the green accounting idea of natural assets proposed by the united nations statistics division the value evaluation index of water resources and its directionality were selected and determined the indices and their grades are listed in table 2 the indices were graded according to the annual average data of the chinese provinces li et al 2016 specifically the upper and lower limits of the index classification were determined based on the local average yearly data after setting the highest and lowest criteria the interval arithmetic method was used to calculate the values in each classification interval 3 3 benchmark price calculation of water use rights in nxuria 3 3 1 water use rights value assessment first the water use rights evaluation vector is divided into five levels m high relatively high common relatively low low then the evaluation indices were evaluated according to the scoring criteria table 2 according to eqs 13 16 the membership degree u of the water use rights evaluation value in the nxyria is calculated according to the following matrix u 0 8252 0 1248 0 0 0 0 0 872 0 128 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6444 0 3556 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6396 0 3604 0 0 0 0 0 579 0 421 0 0 0 67 0 33 0 0 0 0 286 0 714 0 0 0 482 0 518 0 0 0 576 0 424 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 0 0 0 58 0 42 0 0 then the weight of each index was calculated according to eqs 1 11 and the results are shown in table 3 finally the comprehensive evaluation result v of water use rights in nxria is calculated according to eq 12 the normalized v of the fuzzy total evaluation result was calculated according to eq 17 v 0 323 0 2464 0 2383 0 112 0 0187 v 0 3442 0 2626 0 2539 0 1194 0 199 according to the evaluation grade of water use rights value vector t 5 4 3 2 1 t is constructed and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of water use rights is as follows w v t 3 791 from the above calculation results the value of water use rights in nxyria was 3 791 zhu and shi 2018 estimated that the average water resources value of the major cities in china was 3 214 in contrast the value of water use rights in nxyria is higher than the national average which belongs to the region with a higher value of water use rights this is because ningxia is an area of severe water shortage and it can use the yellow river water every year is fixed however with the development of society the contradiction between fixed water intake and increasing water demand is increasing daily which leads to a high value of water use rights 3 3 2 calculation of benchmark price upper limit of agricultural water use rights in the nxyria this study calculates the benchmark price of their water use rights due to the significant difference between food and cash crops in input and income the production benefits of main food crops are shown in table 4 based on the above information the maximum bearing capacity of the water price for agriculture was calculated by taking the water cost for food planting in 10 of the per mu output value or the proportion of agricultural water cost for net agrarian income of 13 as the calculation basis according to eq 23 the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for food crops is 0 3585 yuan m3 the production efficiency of the main cash crops in the yellow river irrigation area is shown in table 5 combined with the income and expenditure of cash crop planting the maximum bearing capacity of the agricultural water price is calculated by taking 5 of the average output value of cash crop planting or 10 of the average net income of rural income per mu as the calculation basis according to eq 23 the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for cash crops is 0 9348 yuan m3 note that although the water used for planting cash and food crops is agricultural water it need not be consistent in selecting the calculation ratio the calculation proportion should be chosen according to actual income and expenditure for the cultivation of food crops owing to the low water use efficiency of food crops in ningxia two upper limits were selected as the basis for calculating water affordability this can achieve the effects of water constraints and incentives although the water affordability of cash crops is relatively high the price gap between cash and food crops should be manageable due to the water efficiency of cash crops being relatively high therefore two lower limits were selected to calculate the water price affordability of cash crops to maintain an appropriate gap between cash and food crops 3 3 3 agricultural wurbp calculation 3 3 3 1 benchmark price calculation of agricultural water use rights for food crops according to the above calculation results the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for food crops in the yellow river irrigation area is 0 3585 yuan m3 the water resources price vector s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 of ningxia was constructed and agricultural wurbp p f was obtained p f v s 0 252 y u a n m 3 3 3 3 2 benchmark price calculation of agricultural water use rights for cash crops according to the above calculation results the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for cash crops in the yellow river irrigation area is 0 9348 yuan m3 the water resources price vector s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 of ningxia was constructed and agricultural wurbp p c was obtained p c v s 0 652 y u a n m 3 based on the above calculation the wurbp for food crops in the nxyria is 0 252 yuan m3 and that for cash crops is 0 652 yuan m3 the gap between the two is significant because of the huge difference in returns per unit of water used to grow cash and food crops compared with the previous trading price 0 18 0 21 yuan m3 of water use rights transfer from food crops to industry the calculation results of this study are only slightly higher than the actual trading prices therefore it can be verified that the wurbp calculated in this study was scientific and the results can be applied to agricultural water use rights trading in nxyria 3 4 analysis of the influencing factors 3 4 1 analysis of the influencing factors of the criteria layer from the annual average the obstacle degree of the water use rights value criterion layer in nxyria is natural factors economic factors ecological factors social factors among them the obstacle degree of natural factors was more than 30 the obstacle degree of economic and ecological factors was more than 20 and the obstacle degree of social factors was less than 20 by year see fig 4 the obstacle degree of natural factors was the highest from 2011 to 2020 indicating that natural factors have significantly restricted the water use rights value however it also shows a trend of fluctuation and decline due to water resource scarcity affecting the value of water use rights with the continuous improvement of the water resources management system the allocation of regional water resources is becoming more reasonable and the obstacle degree of natural factors to the water use rights value is gradually being reduced however this is always in the most critical position the obstacle degree of the ecological factors increased from 1 78 in 2011 to 34 27 in 2020 closer to the obstacle degree of natural factors after 2017 the obstacle degree of ecological factors has been steadily increasing and the ranking of obstacle degree has also expanded to second place the impact of ecological factors on the value of water use rights is also increasing this was because the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in 2017 further strengthened the construction of an ecological civilization which puts forward the harmonious coexistence between man and nature this made ecological factors increasingly critical in evaluating water use rights value conversely owing to the continuous development of the social economy it constantly adapts to the characteristics of regional water resources according to the theory of comparative advantage regional industrial and water use structures are continuously optimized the obstacle degree of economic and social factors to the value of water use rights was reduced 3 4 2 analysis of the influencing factors of the index layer since water resources are complex systems there are significant uncertainties in the size of each index therefore the main factors affecting the value of water use rights are not fixed however the three indices exhibited relatively stable patterns the water yield coefficient has always been the most important obstacle factor and its obstacle degree has been the largest since 2014 ecological water consumption has been the main obstacle affecting water use rights since 2013 the farmland irrigation utilization coefficient has gradually become the main influencing factor since 2015 the inter annual variation of the obstacle degree of each index is shown in fig 5 this study considered the top six indices of obstacle factors as the main obstacle factors as shown in table 6 the main obstacle factors affecting the water use rights value in the 10 years from 2011 to 2020 were the index layer of natural factors the water yield coefficient always being the primary obstacle affecting the water use rights value the smaller the water yield coefficient the greater the water use rights value among the natural factors the number of times each index appeared as the main obstacle affecting the water use rights value was the water production coefficient ten times runoff coefficient six times water production modulus five times and water resources per capita four times among the social factors the proportion of urban water demand six times daily water consumption of urban residents two times and per capita water consumption one time appeared as the main obstacle factors affecting the water use rights value the proportion of urban water demand was the main obstacle from 2011 to 2016 because the water rights value is more sensitive to urban residents water demand changes after 2017 the proportion of urban water demand fell to a relatively stable state and its impact on the water rights value gradually decreased water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp five times and per capita gdp four times was the main obstacle among the economic factors the obstacle degree of water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp ranked first in 2011 2013 and second in 2014 2015 this is because the water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp in ningxia was much higher than the national average in 2011 2015 and its size had a noticeable impact on the value of water use rights with scientific and technological innovation development the water consumption of 10 000 yuan gdp continuously reduces and tends to stabilize this gradually decreases its impact on the value of water use rights rapid per capita gdp growth has steadily become the main obstacle affecting water use rights as the state society and individuals pay more attention to protecting the ecological environment water resources play an increasingly important role in the ecological factors therefore environmental water consumption and farmland irrigation utilization coefficient have gradually become the main obstacles affecting water use rights 4 discussion the shift from government led to market led approaches to water resources management has gradually become an effective policy tool ouyang et al 2022 as an effective water governance model water trading significantly optimizes water resources allocation and promotes water conservation wang et al 2017 in reforming water use rights a scientific price mechanism can more effectively incentivize water conservation facilitating water resource flow to higher yields and more efficient uses tian and hu 2019 therefore research on the wurbp is the basis for formulating the water use rights trading price mechanism the wurbp is also an effective method for the government to participate in and supervise the water use rights trading market based on this this study uses the nxyria as an example to study the method of setting the agricultural wurbp and its influencing factors the fundamental purpose of the water use rights reform is to save water and increase efficiency its form is market trading and the gripper is a price mechanism water use rights reform has made water resources a valuable and scarce production factor it can realize the economical and efficient use of water resources through market allocation on the one hand the water use rights trading market is a quasi market if resources are allocated solely by the market there is a lack of competitive or insufficient information in the water trading market resulting in a low trading price it not only harms the interests of water use rights transferors but also seriously dampens their enthusiasm to participate in the water use rights market reform zhang and liu 2010 the wurbp has certain constraints which can prevent the distortion phenomenon of the water use rights trading price from being too low and enhance the endogenous power of water conservation in all sectors of society however water resources are more complex than other natural resources to establish the property rights system of natural resource assets the water resources value measurement criteria must be clarified further chen and zhu 2021 the wurbp is a valuable measure for water resources capitalization management the asset based management of water resources involved in water use rights such as the paid acquisition of water use rights or asset pledges yi et al 2020 must be measured by the benchmark price this also prevents the fire sale of water use rights as an asset resulting in the loss of national or local government assets to a certain extent it also avoids market failure due to the distortion of trading prices this study used a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to formulate the wurbp for two main reasons first according to the political economy principle price is a monetary expression of value madhoo 2004 the government should fully reflect on the value of water resources when setting the benchmark price a water resources system is a complex system involving natural social economic and ecological factors therefore it is difficult to use the traditional shadow price method molinos senante et al 2016 marginal opportunity cost model sun et al 2013 or the supply demand price model qian et al 2014 to measure wurbp a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can solve this problem zhang et al 2019 second the wurbp is a price standard confirmed and promulgated by the government and is subject to joint public supervision this requires that the calculation process not only be rigorous but also simple the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is relatively simple and the necessary data are all public statistical data that satisfy this requirement through the analysis of the influencing factors the supply and demand of water resources technological progress and social and economic development level are the main factors affecting the wurbp the wurbp calculated in this study emphasizes the average regional water use rights price on a specific valuation date under certain conditions thus the wurbp is dynamic but relatively stable for a certain period wu et al 2021 therefore the local water resources situation social demand for water resources industrial economic development policies and other factors should be considered to scientifically evaluate the current wurbp water administrative departments should regularly research local water use rights trading prices and strengthen the monitoring and analysis of water use rights trading prices according to the local resource endowment economic development level water use rights trading market changes and other comprehensive factors reasonable wurbp adjustments can be made the government also needs to establish and improve the online information publishing platform for the fundamental water use rights value to enhance the real time reference value of the wurbp 5 conclusions this study examined the connotation calculation method and influencing factors of the wurbp first the definition and characteristics of the benchmark price of water use rights were analyzed using wealth land rent and labor value theories then the subjective and objective combination weighting method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model were used to construct the wurbp finally the obstacle degree model was introduced to analyze the main obstacle factors affecting the wurbp taking nxyria as an example the agricultural wurbp was calculated and the main factors affecting the benchmark price were analyzed the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the government formulated the wurbp with the regional water resources endowment water use structure and water use characteristics the benchmark price can guide control and adjust the trading prices based on the benchmark price the water use rights trading price can be determined through competition and negotiation between buyers and sellers 2 the wurbp for food crops in nxyria is 0 252 yuan m3 and that for cash crops is 0 652 yuan m3 the large difference between the two is that farmers have different maximum bearing capacities for water prices when planting crops with additional attributes 3 in the criterion layer natural factors have always been the main cause of agricultural wurbp in nxyria in the index layer the water yield coefficient runoff coefficient per capita gdp farmland irrigation utilization coefficient and ecological water consumption have gradually become the main obstacles affecting the agricultural wurbp therefore water administrative departments should strengthen the monitoring and analysis of the supply and demand of local water resources and the trading price of water use rights and dynamically adjust the wurbp this paper innovatively proposed the wurbp concept so the government can play a backstop role in the water use rights trading market the benchmark price mechanism of water use rights can prevent the price from being too low to avoid market failure in the water use rights trading market however the wurbp reflects the scarcity of water resources and the cost of water saving which can enhance the awareness of water saving in various sectors of society to a certain extent however water resources have exhibited dynamic changes in the past therefore the wurbp should constantly change according to the reality this study was limited to analyzing the main factors affecting the wurbp and did not construct a dynamic measurement model of the benchmark price this is a limitation of this study and is one of the directions that the authors will continue to study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

8934,the water use rights trading system fully embodies a new concept of water resources management of the water saving priority and market oriented governance the price mechanism is a core component of this system and the benchmark price is its cornerstone accordingly this paper analyzes the connotation and characteristics of the water use rights benchmark price wurbp based on the marxist labor theory of value and land rent theory it is proposed that the wurbp should be the economic embodiment of the water use rights value considering the case of the ningxia yellow river irrigated area a wurbp calculation model was established using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to calculate the agricultural wurbp the obstacle degree model was introduced to analyze the main factors affecting the wurbp results show that the wurbp for food crops in the ningxia yellow river irrigation area is 0 252 yuan m3 and 0 652 yuan m3 for cash crops water yield coefficient runoff coefficient per capita gdp farmland irrigation utilization coefficient and ecological water consumption have gradually become the primary obstacles affecting agricultural wurbp water administrative departments should adjust the wurbp according to the actual situation this paper innovatively puts forward the concept of wurbp these results have important practical significance for improving china s agricultural water use rights trading price system keywords water use rights benchmark price the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model influencing factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is a key element in resource utilization and ecological protection with the social economy s rapid growth and urbanization acceleration imbalances in regional water resources occur frequently water resources have gradually become an important factor that hampers china s sustainable green development zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore effective conservation and efficient utilization of water resources have important strategic significance in economic development and ecological civilization construction kong et al 2021 the water use rights trading system can play a decisive role in water resources allocation and the core mechanism of this market operation is the pricing howe and christopher 2003 yoo et al 2013 a scientific price mechanism can effectively regulate the supply and demand of water resources thereby promoting the flow of water resources to a higher yield and efficient use tian 2022 therefore water use rights reform and its price mechanism are important policy tools in china s water resources management which can enhance the governance capacity of water resources and improve the modern governance system of water resources in china ownership of water resources belongs to the state therefore previously studied water rights have typically referred to water intake and use rights both water intake and use rights belong to the rights of use but there are significant differences between the two water intake rights refer to the amount of water that can be exploited to develop and utilize regional water resources water use rights refer to water consumption entering a user terminal in transforming water rights from water intake rights to water use rights the distribution and regulation of water rights are typically completed by government departments water use rights are then purchased according to their own needs therefore water trading refers explicitly to trading water use rights dou et al 2014 however owing to the particularity of the trading object the water use rights trading market can only be a quasi market bradley and taylor 2010 that is the market cannot entirely determine the price of water use rights wang 2012 bekchanov et al 2015 to ensure social fairness and reflect the value of public resources the government should play a backstop role in establishing water use rights trading prices therefore it should set the water use rights benchmark price wurbp while considering the water resources value and social development to ensure the healthy operation of the water rights trading market the benchmark price is the industry product s essential and standard price zhao et al 2019 which can guide the formation of the trading price the price formation of water use rights must be based on the wurbp created through market competition therefore establishing a wurbp becomes a more complicated technical difficulty before constructing the benchmark price measurement model we must first clarify the pricing object of the wurbp there are two types of water use rights first the surplus water use rights are formed by the difference between the confirmed and planned amounts and are the water use rights obtained without any element input second the savings of water use rights are caused by water saving transformation or long term adjustment of the planting structure although there is no difference between the two types of water use rights involved in the transaction their formation processes and inputs differ shen et al 2020b based on china s current laws and regulations water use rights saved through water saving projects and technologies are profitable and widely accepted by the academic community shao 2022 however the debate on the universal value of water use rights is still ongoing in the first case of water use rights one needs to ask if the water use rights value be included in the benchmark price and allow the transferor to receive benefits the academic community has been arguing about this which is also one of the key obstacles to reforming water use rights trading it is worth an in depth theoretical analysis considering these two views finding a scientific theoretical basis for the value of water use rights is necessary the value assessment of water use rights should be based on the marxist labor theory of value and land rent theory fang et al 2000 moreover reasonable factors of wealth theory and efficacy theory of western economics are used as the theoretical basis that is the user determines the value which depends on scarcity external development and utilization conditions thus the wurbp is an economic embodiment of the use of water resources as a capitalization of rent it is not limited by the condensation of ordinary undifferentiated human labor therefore the water use rights involved in the transaction can demand the wurbp when trading regardless of whether surplus water is obtained through water conservation the above content indicates that the water use rights value the wurbp and the trading price are both different and related the value of water use rights reflects the resource and economic value of water resources use the wurbp is a policy price formulated by the government based on the water use rights value which has a guiding role in adjusting the water use structures and behaviors the benchmark price can navigate control and adjust trading prices in contrast the trading price is the final price formed by competition and negotiation between buyers and sellers of water use rights based on the wurbp therefore the water use rights value is an integral part of the wurbp which in turn plays a cornerstone role in the trading price that is trading prices result from more market competition whereas the wurbp is the intrinsic price of water use rights the inherent relationship between the water use rights value the wurbp and the trading price is shown in fig 1 previous studies have tended to focus on the final water use rights trading price with few studies involving a benchmark price a study by ning 2008 is the only literature the authors know that strictly uses a benchmark price he studied the benchmark price of water rights transfer under the dual role of the government and the market and proposed that the government should regulate the trading price wu and li 2019 studied the base price of water rights trading they calculated the water rights price of buyers and sellers then carried out bilateral coupling to get the game equilibrium price some studies examine government regulated or reference prices similar to the wurbp they believe that the lower price limit of water trading is the value of water resources ni et al 2019 in addition more literature research objects are the water rights price water rights trading price water rights conversion price and water rights transfer price although the above prices are slightly different they all refer to the final trading price of the water rights market water use rights trading can be divided into three types irrigation water user trading agricultural transfer to industry and regional water use rights trading trading price performance differs for different types of water use rights trading regarding the water use rights price of irrigation water users wang et al 2019 obtained a result similar to the wurbp based on considering the three dimensions of society economy and environment they then formed the final water use rights trading price by market supply and demand yan et al 2020 established an agricultural two stage fuzzy differential water price model its dwpm to calculate the trading price of water use rights under various water shortage conditions regarding the price of water use rights transferred from agriculture to industry zhang et al 2018 measured the trading price of water use rights transferred from agriculture to industry by taking ordos water use rights trading as an example guan et al 2019 used the fuzzy mathematics method and a production function to calculate the trading price of water use rights regarding regional water use rights trading prices chen et al 2021b believed that buyers and sellers should fully consider water resources protection and opportunity costs when setting water use rights trading prices tian et al 2018 proposed a one to one negotiated pricing for regional water use rights and a many to many bidding mechanism for water access rights in addition there are studies on the trading or transfer price of water use rights using the value stream theory shen et al 2020a meta synthesis workshops ren and chen 2012 bargaining models guan et al 2021 and actual option models chen et al 2021a the following characteristics can be observed in existing water use rights price research 1 research on the water use rights market s trading price final price forms the majority of current research whereas research on benchmark price is scarce this also shows that the current academic research and industry management have yet to fully realize the vital position and role of the wurbp in the price formation mechanism 2 the factors that must be considered in forming water use rights trading prices are numerous and complex whereas the factors considered in the relevant literature are quite different however the summary literature shows that the water resources value appears in the category of price considerations therefore the value of water resources is an essential aspect of the price of water use rights and the value of water resources is essential to the price thus a unique study of the wurbp is necessary agricultural irrigation water consumption accounts for more than 65 of total water consumption making it china s most significant water user geng 2020 however the water use efficiency of agricultural irrigation is less than 60 and there is a sizeable spatial difference cui and liu 2021 the agrarian sector shows excellent potential for water conservation maksud et al 2015 and agricultural water conservation is imminent dalin et al 2012 related studies have also confirmed that water use rights trading has improved water saving irrigation technologies and agricultural water use efficiency fei et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 however the trading price still lacks scientific rules therefore taking the ningxia yellow river irrigation area nxyria as an example this study focuses on formulating an agricultural wurbp and introduces an obstacle degree model to analyze the main factors affecting the wurbp the primary contribution of this study is to propose a concept of the wurbp and apply the idea of opportunity cost to the calculation of the benchmark price crops were divided into food and cash crops and their wurbp was calculated the research results have important practical significance for improving the trading and management of water resources and the price system of agricultural water use rights trading in china 2 material and methods water use rights refer to property rights related to water resources the wurbp should be based on the water resources value however the water resources system is complex and influenced by natural economic and social factors hung and chie 2013 therefore the wurbp is not only affected by the number of water resources but also by the scarcity of local water resources the degree of demand and the economic environment han et al 2015 due to an incompatible principle in the complex system the water resources system is fuzzy and cannot simply be judged as either valuable or worthless given that there may be a high medium or low value the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can solve this problem jia et al 2018 the model used in this study to quantitatively evaluate the wurbp in nxyria can be divided into a fuzzy evaluation model and a price calculation model first the value of water use rights is assessed and then the price is calculated by combining the price ceiling and the vector on this basis an obstacle degree model was built to analyze the main factors affecting the value of water use rights to understand the factors affecting the wurbp 2 1 determination of the index weight in the process of multi attribute evaluation the weight has an important influence on the evaluation results scientifically determining the weight of each index factor is of great significance when accurately evaluating water resources value owing to the complexity of modern evaluation and decision making problems using a single method to determine the weight is unreasonable therefore multiple methods should be used to examine the relationship between various indexes comprehensively and to determine the weights of attributes this study used order relation analysis and entropy value methods to measure subjective and objective weights subsequently the game theory combination weighting method determines the final weight xu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 2 1 1 subjective weights order relation analysis also known as the g1 method is a new subjective weighting method improved based on the analytic hierarchy process this method first ranks the evaluation indexes qualitatively and then makes a rational judgment on the important comparison of adjacent indexes finally this study makes a quantitative calculation the proposed method does not need to construct an importance judgment matrix therefore it can determine the independent weight of the index simply and efficiently 2 1 1 1 determine the order relation experienced experts rank resilience indices based on their importance if the index x i has greater importance than x j it is denoted x i x j an order relation can be established for the k toughness indices of a certain layer x 1 x 2 x k x i is the toughness index after i sorting 2 1 1 2 determine the importance of adjacent indexes after determining the order relationship the experts assigned the importance r k of the adjacent toughness indexes according to table 1 1 r k w k 1 w k k n n 1 n 2 3 2 where r k is the ratio of importance of x k 1 and x k the order relation index r k needs to satisfy r k 1 1 r k n is the number of evaluation indexes and w k represents the weight of the index k 2 1 1 3 calculating the weight of indexes the weight of the kth index was calculated based on the empowerment of experts 2 w k 1 k 2 n i k n r i 1 w k 1 r k w k k n n 1 3 2 where i takes k n 2 1 2 objective weights entropy is an objective weighting method according to the degree of variation of each index the weight of each index was calculated using information entropy for the target above x consists of n samples and m evaluation indices first the positive and negative indices are standardized by eq 3 then x i j is used to calculate the specific gravity p i j of the j item evaluation index of the i sample information entropy e j and entropy weight ω j of the i item index the calculation formula is expressed as follows 3 x i j x i j min x i j max x i j min x i j thepositiveindicators max x i j x i j max x i j min x i j thenegativeindicators 4 p i j x i j i 1 n x i j i 1 n j 1 m 5 e j k i 1 n p i j ln p i j j 1 m where k 1 ln n 0 and e j 0 6 w j 1 e j j 1 m 1 e j j 1 m 2 1 3 game theory combinatorial empowerment given that the evaluation results of each evaluation method are independent of each other the corresponding evaluation conclusions of different evaluation methods may conflict the game theory combination weighting method can be used to obtain the equilibrium results in the evaluation conclusions of the above conflicts this method considers that each method is competitive and consistent it can find consistency or compromise between different evaluation index weights the combinatorial weighting method used in game theory is convenient scientific comprehensive and objective therefore this method was selected to comprehensively assign the subjective and objective weights obtained above the procedure is as follows 2 1 3 1 construct the base weight vector set using l different weighting methods to calculate the weight of each toughness evaluation index the primary weight vector set w k w k 1 w k 2 w k n k 1 2 l of the evaluation index was constructed here n is the number of toughness indices and any linear combination of these l vectors is as follows 7 w k 1 l λ k w k t λ k 0 where w is a possible combination weight vector in the weight set and λ k is the linear combination coefficient 2 1 3 2 optimize the linear combination coefficient the optimal weight combination coefficient was first solved and game theory was used to balance different weights the nash equilibrium point was then calculated and the deviation between the combined weight and the weight of each method was minimized 8 min k 1 l λ k w k t w k k 1 2 l according to the differential properties of the matrix the first derivative of eq 8 is obtained and transformed into the following linear equation 9 w 1 w 1 t w 1 w 2 t w 1 w n t w 2 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w 2 w n t w n w 1 t w n w 2 t w n w n t λ 1 λ 2 λ n w 1 w 1 t w 2 w 2 t w n w n t the optimal combination coefficient λ λ 1 λ 2 λ l can be obtained after solving 2 1 3 3 calculate comprehensive weight 10 λ k λ k k 1 l λ k finally get the comprehensive weight 11 w k 1 l λ k w k t k 1 2 l 2 2 calculation model of the wurbp 2 2 1 fuzzy evaluation model of water use rights it is assumed that the domain n is the value factor of water use rights and the expression is n x 1 x 2 x n where x 1 x 2 x n is a variable influencing factor the evaluation vector of water use rights is divided into five levels namely the evaluation vector m high relatively high common relatively low low the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of water use rights is shown as follows 12 v a u where v is the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation matrix of water use rights a is the set of weights of each index and u is the evaluation membership matrix the specific form of the evaluating membership matrix u is expressed in eq 13 13 u μ 1 1 μ 1 2 μ 1 3 μ 1 4 μ 1 5 μ 2 1 μ 2 2 μ 2 3 μ 2 4 μ 2 5 μ n 1 μ n 2 μ n 3 μ n 4 μ n 5 where μ n j is the membership value of evaluation index i to each grade in this study a semi trapezoid distribution was selected to establish a linear membership function to calculate the membership degree of each index for different evaluation grades the functional form is expressed as follows 14 μ i 1 1 x i x i 1 x i 2 x i x i 2 x i 1 x i 1 x i x i 2 0 x i x i 2 j 1 15 μ i 1 x i x i j 1 x i j x i j 1 x i j 1 x i x i j x i j 1 x i x i j 1 x i j x i j x i x i j 1 0 x i x i j 1 x i x i j 1 j 2 3 4 16 μ i 1 0 x i x i 4 x i x i 4 x i 5 x i 4 x i 4 x i x i 5 1 x i x i 5 j 5 where x i is the actual value of the evaluation index i and x i j 1 x i j x i j 1 are the standard value of two adjacent levels of the evaluation index then the evaluation result v is normalized 17 v v i v here v is a dimensionless vector since the result of a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is a sequence without continuity a comprehensive fuzzy index of water use rights is introduced the value of water use rights is divided into five levels representing different value levels and then constructing vector 18 t 5 4 3 2 1 t then the fuzzy comprehensive index w of water use rights can be calculated as follows 19 w v t the comprehensive evaluation index w is between 0 and 5 the greater the index the higher the value of water use rights conversely the lower the value of the water use rights a multi level evaluation of water use rights can be performed based on the above evaluation method for each criterion layer the weight of each index is used to synthesize the evaluation index of the criterion layer then the weight of each criterion layer and the evaluation index of the criterion layer were used to synthesize the comprehensive evaluation index of water use rights 2 2 2 calculation model of the benchmark price a price vector is introduced to present the valuation of water use rights in an economic form the dimensionless vector result of the fuzzy mathematics comprehensive evaluation of water use rights was transformed into the corresponding scalar value of price through the price vector this study uses the conversion formula proposed by jiang 1998 to calculate the wurbp the specific formula is expressed as follows 20 p v s 21 s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 where p is the benchmark price of water use rights v is the comprehensive evaluation vector s is the price vector and p is the upper limit of the water use rights price which is determined according to the method of agricultural affordability referring to the agricultural water price comprehensive reform pilot training materials 1 1 this monograph expounds on the content and requirements of agricultural terminal water price reform taking it as the research basis conforms to the basic needs of china s current comprehensive reform of agricultural water prices this study provides two bases for calculating the affordability of agricultural water charges first agricultural water expenditure accounts for 5 10 of the output value per mu the second is the proportion of agricultural water expenditure in the net agrarian income per mu which is 10 13 determining the bearing capacity of the above two cases and then taking the maximum value as the affordability of the water price the calculation formula is expressed as follows 22 c max a r b r where c represents the maximum affordability of agricultural water price yuan a represents the unit output value of local farmers yuan r represents the maximum proportion of water charges in the output value of local farmers production b represents the net income per unit of farmers yuan r represents the maximum proportion of water fee in local agricultural production and r and r are constants without units the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp is further calculated as follows 23 p c e where e is the current average quota of irrigation water m3 according to field research the per mu input and income of food and cash crops in ningxia differ therefore based on the nature of crops the main crops are wheat rice grain corn potato small grains and silage corn as food crops cold vegetables facility vegetables vegetables for hong kong selenium melon wolfberry and wine grapes planted were used as cash crops the benchmark price limits for water use rights for food and cash crops were calculated fig 2 2 3 obstacle degree model according to existing research this study argues that the intrinsic factor affecting wurbp is the value of water use rights the value of water use rights is affected by various indices therefore water use rights value factors directly affect the benchmark price this paper introduces the obstacle degree model for analysis to explore further the factors affecting the wurbp zhao et al 2021 24 l i j 1 x i j w i j 1 x i j w i j 100 where l i j is the obstacle degree of a single index to the value of water use rights x i j is the standardized value of a single index and w i j is the weight 3 results 3 1 study area and data sources 3 1 1 study area ningxia located in northwest china belongs to the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river the terrain is characterized by a long north south the east west shorter territory of 66 400 km2 and is the smallest province in china various landscapes such as plateaus and mountains are interwoven in the region with complex geological structures and diverse climate types in general ningxia has an arid and semi arid climate with a significant temperature difference between day and night and long sunshine characteristics the overall distribution of precipitation is higher in the south and less in the north and the primary wet months falling over the summer and autumn months statistically the average annual rainfall in ningxia is equivalent to a runoff depth of 289 mm the precipitation is far lower than the average precipitation in the yellow river basin and the national average ningxia is an area experiencing a severe water shortage which has hindered its economic development wang et al 2019 its agricultural production is heavily dependent on yellow river water resources the yellow river irrigation area includes 11 cities and counties in the northern part of the ningxia autonomous region and several state owned agricultural and forestry pastures currently the region has 17 large and medium sized water diversion channels it relies on the yellow river water resources for agricultural irrigation area of up to 5513 33 km2 accounting for 75 of the total irrigation area in ningxia since 2016 the irrigation area has conducted a pilot study of water use rights trading through efficient water saving irrigation at the city and county levels from 2017 2020 there were 27 agricultural water use rights transactions in the irrigation area with a total transaction volume of 9 83 million m3 however owing to the imperfect trading price mechanism the problems such as an inactive trading market unreasonable water use structures and inefficient water use efficiency in irrigated areas have arisen the reform effect is insignificant in tackling these problems therefore research on the benchmark price of agricultural water use rights in the yellow river irrigation area helps improve the price mechanism and cultivate the market to promote market trading of water use rights the location map of the study area is shown in fig 3 the reform effect needs to be more significant in tackling these problems 3 1 2 data sources the data of economic social and water resources indexes used in the calculation of water use rights value in this study are derived from the 2011 2020 ningxia statistical yearbook 2011 2020 ningxia water resources bulletin ningxia water long term supply and demand planning report ningxia water resources allocation plan and other government departments have published documents the data on water use rights trading come from the official website of ningxia hui autonomous region water resources department slt nx gov cn the data on the production efficiency of agricultural products involved are the first hand data obtained by the author through visiting the agriculture and rural affairs department the food and strategic reserves bureau and the water resources department of ningxia hui autonomous region the average data of the last five years is used to make the data more scientific 3 2 indexes selection water use rights value evaluation research has yet to form a unified classification standard and evaluation system this study draws on the ecosystem and human well being evaluation framework proposed by the united nations millennium ecosystem assessment report 2004 based on the concept of sustainable development the factors affecting the evaluation of water use rights are divided into natural social economic and ecological factors simultaneously referring to the green accounting idea of natural assets proposed by the united nations statistics division the value evaluation index of water resources and its directionality were selected and determined the indices and their grades are listed in table 2 the indices were graded according to the annual average data of the chinese provinces li et al 2016 specifically the upper and lower limits of the index classification were determined based on the local average yearly data after setting the highest and lowest criteria the interval arithmetic method was used to calculate the values in each classification interval 3 3 benchmark price calculation of water use rights in nxuria 3 3 1 water use rights value assessment first the water use rights evaluation vector is divided into five levels m high relatively high common relatively low low then the evaluation indices were evaluated according to the scoring criteria table 2 according to eqs 13 16 the membership degree u of the water use rights evaluation value in the nxyria is calculated according to the following matrix u 0 8252 0 1248 0 0 0 0 0 872 0 128 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6444 0 3556 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6396 0 3604 0 0 0 0 0 579 0 421 0 0 0 67 0 33 0 0 0 0 286 0 714 0 0 0 482 0 518 0 0 0 576 0 424 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 0 0 0 58 0 42 0 0 then the weight of each index was calculated according to eqs 1 11 and the results are shown in table 3 finally the comprehensive evaluation result v of water use rights in nxria is calculated according to eq 12 the normalized v of the fuzzy total evaluation result was calculated according to eq 17 v 0 323 0 2464 0 2383 0 112 0 0187 v 0 3442 0 2626 0 2539 0 1194 0 199 according to the evaluation grade of water use rights value vector t 5 4 3 2 1 t is constructed and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation value of water use rights is as follows w v t 3 791 from the above calculation results the value of water use rights in nxyria was 3 791 zhu and shi 2018 estimated that the average water resources value of the major cities in china was 3 214 in contrast the value of water use rights in nxyria is higher than the national average which belongs to the region with a higher value of water use rights this is because ningxia is an area of severe water shortage and it can use the yellow river water every year is fixed however with the development of society the contradiction between fixed water intake and increasing water demand is increasing daily which leads to a high value of water use rights 3 3 2 calculation of benchmark price upper limit of agricultural water use rights in the nxyria this study calculates the benchmark price of their water use rights due to the significant difference between food and cash crops in input and income the production benefits of main food crops are shown in table 4 based on the above information the maximum bearing capacity of the water price for agriculture was calculated by taking the water cost for food planting in 10 of the per mu output value or the proportion of agricultural water cost for net agrarian income of 13 as the calculation basis according to eq 23 the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for food crops is 0 3585 yuan m3 the production efficiency of the main cash crops in the yellow river irrigation area is shown in table 5 combined with the income and expenditure of cash crop planting the maximum bearing capacity of the agricultural water price is calculated by taking 5 of the average output value of cash crop planting or 10 of the average net income of rural income per mu as the calculation basis according to eq 23 the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for cash crops is 0 9348 yuan m3 note that although the water used for planting cash and food crops is agricultural water it need not be consistent in selecting the calculation ratio the calculation proportion should be chosen according to actual income and expenditure for the cultivation of food crops owing to the low water use efficiency of food crops in ningxia two upper limits were selected as the basis for calculating water affordability this can achieve the effects of water constraints and incentives although the water affordability of cash crops is relatively high the price gap between cash and food crops should be manageable due to the water efficiency of cash crops being relatively high therefore two lower limits were selected to calculate the water price affordability of cash crops to maintain an appropriate gap between cash and food crops 3 3 3 agricultural wurbp calculation 3 3 3 1 benchmark price calculation of agricultural water use rights for food crops according to the above calculation results the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for food crops in the yellow river irrigation area is 0 3585 yuan m3 the water resources price vector s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 of ningxia was constructed and agricultural wurbp p f was obtained p f v s 0 252 y u a n m 3 3 3 3 2 benchmark price calculation of agricultural water use rights for cash crops according to the above calculation results the upper limit p of the agricultural wurbp for cash crops in the yellow river irrigation area is 0 9348 yuan m3 the water resources price vector s p 0 75 p 0 5 p 0 25 p 0 of ningxia was constructed and agricultural wurbp p c was obtained p c v s 0 652 y u a n m 3 based on the above calculation the wurbp for food crops in the nxyria is 0 252 yuan m3 and that for cash crops is 0 652 yuan m3 the gap between the two is significant because of the huge difference in returns per unit of water used to grow cash and food crops compared with the previous trading price 0 18 0 21 yuan m3 of water use rights transfer from food crops to industry the calculation results of this study are only slightly higher than the actual trading prices therefore it can be verified that the wurbp calculated in this study was scientific and the results can be applied to agricultural water use rights trading in nxyria 3 4 analysis of the influencing factors 3 4 1 analysis of the influencing factors of the criteria layer from the annual average the obstacle degree of the water use rights value criterion layer in nxyria is natural factors economic factors ecological factors social factors among them the obstacle degree of natural factors was more than 30 the obstacle degree of economic and ecological factors was more than 20 and the obstacle degree of social factors was less than 20 by year see fig 4 the obstacle degree of natural factors was the highest from 2011 to 2020 indicating that natural factors have significantly restricted the water use rights value however it also shows a trend of fluctuation and decline due to water resource scarcity affecting the value of water use rights with the continuous improvement of the water resources management system the allocation of regional water resources is becoming more reasonable and the obstacle degree of natural factors to the water use rights value is gradually being reduced however this is always in the most critical position the obstacle degree of the ecological factors increased from 1 78 in 2011 to 34 27 in 2020 closer to the obstacle degree of natural factors after 2017 the obstacle degree of ecological factors has been steadily increasing and the ranking of obstacle degree has also expanded to second place the impact of ecological factors on the value of water use rights is also increasing this was because the 19th national congress of the communist party of china in 2017 further strengthened the construction of an ecological civilization which puts forward the harmonious coexistence between man and nature this made ecological factors increasingly critical in evaluating water use rights value conversely owing to the continuous development of the social economy it constantly adapts to the characteristics of regional water resources according to the theory of comparative advantage regional industrial and water use structures are continuously optimized the obstacle degree of economic and social factors to the value of water use rights was reduced 3 4 2 analysis of the influencing factors of the index layer since water resources are complex systems there are significant uncertainties in the size of each index therefore the main factors affecting the value of water use rights are not fixed however the three indices exhibited relatively stable patterns the water yield coefficient has always been the most important obstacle factor and its obstacle degree has been the largest since 2014 ecological water consumption has been the main obstacle affecting water use rights since 2013 the farmland irrigation utilization coefficient has gradually become the main influencing factor since 2015 the inter annual variation of the obstacle degree of each index is shown in fig 5 this study considered the top six indices of obstacle factors as the main obstacle factors as shown in table 6 the main obstacle factors affecting the water use rights value in the 10 years from 2011 to 2020 were the index layer of natural factors the water yield coefficient always being the primary obstacle affecting the water use rights value the smaller the water yield coefficient the greater the water use rights value among the natural factors the number of times each index appeared as the main obstacle affecting the water use rights value was the water production coefficient ten times runoff coefficient six times water production modulus five times and water resources per capita four times among the social factors the proportion of urban water demand six times daily water consumption of urban residents two times and per capita water consumption one time appeared as the main obstacle factors affecting the water use rights value the proportion of urban water demand was the main obstacle from 2011 to 2016 because the water rights value is more sensitive to urban residents water demand changes after 2017 the proportion of urban water demand fell to a relatively stable state and its impact on the water rights value gradually decreased water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp five times and per capita gdp four times was the main obstacle among the economic factors the obstacle degree of water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp ranked first in 2011 2013 and second in 2014 2015 this is because the water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp in ningxia was much higher than the national average in 2011 2015 and its size had a noticeable impact on the value of water use rights with scientific and technological innovation development the water consumption of 10 000 yuan gdp continuously reduces and tends to stabilize this gradually decreases its impact on the value of water use rights rapid per capita gdp growth has steadily become the main obstacle affecting water use rights as the state society and individuals pay more attention to protecting the ecological environment water resources play an increasingly important role in the ecological factors therefore environmental water consumption and farmland irrigation utilization coefficient have gradually become the main obstacles affecting water use rights 4 discussion the shift from government led to market led approaches to water resources management has gradually become an effective policy tool ouyang et al 2022 as an effective water governance model water trading significantly optimizes water resources allocation and promotes water conservation wang et al 2017 in reforming water use rights a scientific price mechanism can more effectively incentivize water conservation facilitating water resource flow to higher yields and more efficient uses tian and hu 2019 therefore research on the wurbp is the basis for formulating the water use rights trading price mechanism the wurbp is also an effective method for the government to participate in and supervise the water use rights trading market based on this this study uses the nxyria as an example to study the method of setting the agricultural wurbp and its influencing factors the fundamental purpose of the water use rights reform is to save water and increase efficiency its form is market trading and the gripper is a price mechanism water use rights reform has made water resources a valuable and scarce production factor it can realize the economical and efficient use of water resources through market allocation on the one hand the water use rights trading market is a quasi market if resources are allocated solely by the market there is a lack of competitive or insufficient information in the water trading market resulting in a low trading price it not only harms the interests of water use rights transferors but also seriously dampens their enthusiasm to participate in the water use rights market reform zhang and liu 2010 the wurbp has certain constraints which can prevent the distortion phenomenon of the water use rights trading price from being too low and enhance the endogenous power of water conservation in all sectors of society however water resources are more complex than other natural resources to establish the property rights system of natural resource assets the water resources value measurement criteria must be clarified further chen and zhu 2021 the wurbp is a valuable measure for water resources capitalization management the asset based management of water resources involved in water use rights such as the paid acquisition of water use rights or asset pledges yi et al 2020 must be measured by the benchmark price this also prevents the fire sale of water use rights as an asset resulting in the loss of national or local government assets to a certain extent it also avoids market failure due to the distortion of trading prices this study used a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to formulate the wurbp for two main reasons first according to the political economy principle price is a monetary expression of value madhoo 2004 the government should fully reflect on the value of water resources when setting the benchmark price a water resources system is a complex system involving natural social economic and ecological factors therefore it is difficult to use the traditional shadow price method molinos senante et al 2016 marginal opportunity cost model sun et al 2013 or the supply demand price model qian et al 2014 to measure wurbp a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model can solve this problem zhang et al 2019 second the wurbp is a price standard confirmed and promulgated by the government and is subject to joint public supervision this requires that the calculation process not only be rigorous but also simple the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model is relatively simple and the necessary data are all public statistical data that satisfy this requirement through the analysis of the influencing factors the supply and demand of water resources technological progress and social and economic development level are the main factors affecting the wurbp the wurbp calculated in this study emphasizes the average regional water use rights price on a specific valuation date under certain conditions thus the wurbp is dynamic but relatively stable for a certain period wu et al 2021 therefore the local water resources situation social demand for water resources industrial economic development policies and other factors should be considered to scientifically evaluate the current wurbp water administrative departments should regularly research local water use rights trading prices and strengthen the monitoring and analysis of water use rights trading prices according to the local resource endowment economic development level water use rights trading market changes and other comprehensive factors reasonable wurbp adjustments can be made the government also needs to establish and improve the online information publishing platform for the fundamental water use rights value to enhance the real time reference value of the wurbp 5 conclusions this study examined the connotation calculation method and influencing factors of the wurbp first the definition and characteristics of the benchmark price of water use rights were analyzed using wealth land rent and labor value theories then the subjective and objective combination weighting method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model were used to construct the wurbp finally the obstacle degree model was introduced to analyze the main obstacle factors affecting the wurbp taking nxyria as an example the agricultural wurbp was calculated and the main factors affecting the benchmark price were analyzed the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the government formulated the wurbp with the regional water resources endowment water use structure and water use characteristics the benchmark price can guide control and adjust the trading prices based on the benchmark price the water use rights trading price can be determined through competition and negotiation between buyers and sellers 2 the wurbp for food crops in nxyria is 0 252 yuan m3 and that for cash crops is 0 652 yuan m3 the large difference between the two is that farmers have different maximum bearing capacities for water prices when planting crops with additional attributes 3 in the criterion layer natural factors have always been the main cause of agricultural wurbp in nxyria in the index layer the water yield coefficient runoff coefficient per capita gdp farmland irrigation utilization coefficient and ecological water consumption have gradually become the main obstacles affecting the agricultural wurbp therefore water administrative departments should strengthen the monitoring and analysis of the supply and demand of local water resources and the trading price of water use rights and dynamically adjust the wurbp this paper innovatively proposed the wurbp concept so the government can play a backstop role in the water use rights trading market the benchmark price mechanism of water use rights can prevent the price from being too low to avoid market failure in the water use rights trading market however the wurbp reflects the scarcity of water resources and the cost of water saving which can enhance the awareness of water saving in various sectors of society to a certain extent however water resources have exhibited dynamic changes in the past therefore the wurbp should constantly change according to the reality this study was limited to analyzing the main factors affecting the wurbp and did not construct a dynamic measurement model of the benchmark price this is a limitation of this study and is one of the directions that the authors will continue to study in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
