pluvial flood are identified by a spatial multi criteria analysis that combines five criteria imperviousness slope hydrologic soil groups density of sewer system and social vulnerability to build a pluvial flood index pfi the pfi is validated by the comparison with historical pluvial flood events in the city and it is used for the identification of high priority areas for intervention then this information is merged with the analysis of urban planning and nbs design constraints to identify the suitable areas for nbs installation new hydrological insights for the region results allow the definition of a nbs implementation strategy against pluvial flooding in the city of florence identifying for each pluvial flood hotspot the set of measures that can be implemented to solve the problem

floods occur when rainfall intensity locally exceeds infiltration and the conveyance capacity of the sewer system rosenzweig et al 2018 tanaka et al 2020 bulti and abebe 2020 they represent a major challenge worldwide villordon and gourbesville 2014 schmitt ans scheid 2020 both because of their small temporal scale making their prediction complex li and willems 2020 and due to the extensive damage to property and people they can cause yin et al 2016 moreover climate change ongoing urbanization reductions in urban green spaces and deteriorating urban water management infrastructures are further increasing pluvial flood risk kaykhosravi et al 2019 o donnell and thorne 2020 zölch et al 2017 pachauri et al 2014 and questioning the effectiveness of traditional management approaches westra et al 2014 indeed grey infrastructures or hard engineering solutions designed only to collect rainwater and convey it away from the city context through sewer systems li et al 2020 often show their inadequacy to deal with very intense and locally concentrated rainfall events moreover such solutions will not provide an adequate response to today and future environmental economic and social challenges including climate change eea 2012 zhou 2014 to address these challenges adaptable and multifunctional solutions are required ashley et al 2007 woodward et al 2011 emami 2020 in this context nature based solutions nbs represent an interesting approach that involves the use of integrated solutions to manage urban runoff obtaining simultaneously other benefits nbs are defined as solutions that are inspired and supported by nature which are cost effective simultaneously provide environmental social and economic benefits and help build resilience eea 2015 most frequently nbs are realized to regulate stormwater in urban areas creating so called sustainable urban drainage systems suds depending on the context alternative terminologies can be used to indicate nbs in urban areas such as green infrastructure gi ecosystem based adaptation eba low impact development lid water sensitive urban design wsud and best management practices bmps fletcher et al 2015 in this article the term nbs will be used as it represents the wider set of solutions that encompass all the specific sub definitions pauleit et al 2017 the great potential of these solutions in urban areas is that they can provide a multitude of ecosystem services coutts and hahn 2015 pacetti et al 2020 in addition to the main benefits for which they are built for example nbs can be useful in the management of flooding in terms of retention managing infiltration and runoff thus allowing a reduction in the amount of water conveyed into the drainage system at the same time thanks to the presence of grass bushes and trees nbs contribute to increase water and air quality biodiversity amenity of the area dagenais et al 2017 coutts and hahn 2015 ashley et al 2013 and to reduce noise level urban heat island and respiratory diseases epa 2017 nbs can be used alone or in combination with grey infrastructures favoring cities adaptation to climate change and strengthening the management and utilization of rainwater runoff sun et al 2020 even though an increasing number of cities have adopted urban planning approaches where nature is seen as an opportunity for adaptation kabisch et al 2017 urban water management is still heavily dominated by gray infrastructures with nbs accounting for less than 5 of the global expenditure in water resources management wwap 2018 the main barriers hindering the investments in nbs are represented by the inadequate financial resources and the lack of incentives the institutional fragmentation the lack of political commitment and institutional and technical capabilities the increasing gentrification and the limited availability of land due to ownership issues and to urban planning limitations ershad sarabi et al 2019 in this context the importance of developing appropriate planning and design tools for the successful nbs uptake is paramount ershad sarabi et al 2019 as shown by recent literature one of the most important aspects is to define the adequate locations for nbs installation depending on the purpose meerow and newell 2017 developed a geographical information system gis based approach to support the spatial planning of multifunctional gi li et al 2020 proposed a multi criteria evaluation method to identify areas where to realize gi to mitigate urban flood risk kaykhosravi et al 2019 proposed a geospatial framework based on hydrological hydraulic economics social and environmental benefits of lid to identify priority sites martin mikle et al 2015 defined a spatial approach to identify priority areas for lid based on a topographic index calculated by combining various environmental indicators and technical suitability aiming at supporting the introduction of nbs to manage stormwater in heritage cities contexts this study integrates gis based and multi criteria analysis to identify the most suitable areas where implementing nbs against urban pluvial flooding in the city of florence italy the proposed methodology is divided into two phases in the first one the pluvial flood index pfi of the entire municipality is elaborated to identify the most critical areas during pluvial flood from a combined socio hydrological perspective in the second phase the suitability of nbs implementation against pluvial flood is analyzed focusing on a pilot area the city of florence has special features because it is a historic and art city with an important architectural artistic landscape scientific and natural heritage that can limit the introduction of nbs e g presence of archeological evidence therefore the urban constraints and technical feasibility constraints of different nbs typologies i e infiltration trenches filter strips filter drains vegetative swales bioretention areas tree boxes permeable pavement detention basins ponds have been analyzed to identify the most suitable areas that allow nbs installation while preserving the city heritage the methodology allows the identification of the critical areas that would benefit from nbs implementation and the preliminary assessment of nbs feasibility the results can support the decision making process for implementation of nbs for urban flooding mitigation 2 study area florence fig 1 is the capital city of tuscany region italy covering an area of about 102 km2 with 366 927 inhabitants according to the 2019 census of the italian national statistical institute istat it has a humid temperate climate with an elevation ranging between 83 m and 338 m above sea level the municipality is crossed by the arno river that flows in the east west direction and it is connected to multiple tributaries as well as to some buried rivers channels and culverts the land use in the area is various on the plain areas along the arno river there are residential commercial industrial and green urban areas on hills agricultural areas including vineyards orchards and olive groves and forests are predominant the sewer system of the city is combined i e no separation between stormwater runoff and wastewater collection and is mainly based on the infrastructures built in the 19th century resulting in a complex sewer network with a total length of around 800 km the sewage is almost completely connected to wastewater treatment plants however there are some collectors that discharge the excess water in the arno river and its tributaries in addition to the flood risk associated to the presence of the arno river caporali 2016 the whole city area is exposed to flash and pluvial flood events that involve the minor hydrographic network and the sewer system in the last decades due to the high level of urbanization the inadequacy of the sewer network to population growth and the increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall events numerous pluvial floods in various parts of the city have been observed 3 materials and methods the proposed methodology is based on two phases starting with the definition and mapping of the pluvial flood index pfi to identify the areas most affected by pluvial flood risk in the entire municipality in the second phase the areas suitable for the installation of nbs are located according to planning and technical constraints with reference to a single district among those having on average the higher pfi values finally priority areas for nbs installation to mitigate the pluvial flood problems are identified fig 2 3 1 pluvial flood index pfi the construction of pfi is based on the use of five criteria table 1 i imperviousness imp ii slope s iii hydrologic soil group hsg iv density of sewer system dss v social vulnerability index svi the combination of environmental and socio economic criteria is crucial to determine the risk and to identify the most critical areas crichton 1999 as shown by various recent studies li et al 2020 kaykhosravi et al 2019 meerow and newell 2017 all data used in the analysis are summarized in table 1 3 1 1 description of criteria for the construction of pfi 3 1 1 1 imperviousness imp the impervious areas inhibit the infiltration of rainwater in the soil thus determining a greater volume of runoff therefore the evaluation of imperviousness allows to identify the areas prone to flood due to their inability to effectively drain the rainwater the imperviousness density dataset of 2015 provided by copernicus land monitoring service table 1 is used to map the percentage of imp with 20 m spatial resolution 3 1 1 2 slope s slope is a measure of the inclination of a surface relative to the horizontal plane and it has an important role in the rainfall runoff transformation steeper slopes contribute to generating major floods while areas with a lower slope have higher probability to be inundated kandilioti et al 2012 the slope s is obtained by the digital terrain model dtm of tuscany region with 10 m spatial resolution integrated and corrected if necessary with reference to the dtm lidar table 1 and it is expressed as a percentage 3 1 1 3 hydrologic soil group hsg soil characteristics have an important role in the runoff formation based on the percentage of sand gravel silt and clay a soil can have a high or low infiltration capacity indeed all the rainfall not infiltrating in the soil contributes to generate runoff hsg information has been derived by the pedology dataset of tuscany region table 1 where soils are classified in four hydrological groups gardin 2015 based on their runoff potential according to the classification introduced by the u s department of agriculture usda 2009 the first group a includes soils with low runoff potential with typically less than 10 of clay and more than 90 of sand and gravel the second group b includes soils with medium low runoff potential characterized by an amount of clay between 10 and 20 and sand between 50 and 90 the third group c includes soils with medium high runoff potential characterized by an amount of clay between 20 and less than 50 of sand the fourth group d includes soils with high runoff potential with typically greater than 40 of clay and less than 50 of sand only the a b and d classes are present in the municipality of florence 3 1 1 4 density of sewer system dss a widespread distribution of the sewer system is fundamental to reduce the impact of stormwater in this study the dss m m2 is evaluated as the total length of the pipes provided by the local water management company per unit drainage basin area corresponding to the census area defined by istat table 1 despite the complex dynamics that water can have in areas with high dss kandilioti et al 2012 it is assumed that high density values correspond to high levels of the sewer system functionality palla et al 2018 3 1 1 5 social vulnerability index svi the effects of a flood event depend also on the vulnerability of the affected socio economic and ecological systems messner and meyer 2006 in general the term social vulnerability refers to the combinations of social cultural economic political and institutional processes that influence population sensitivity to hazard events and its ability to prepare respond cope and recover from it zhou et al 2014 spielman et al 2020 in this case the main interest is on the analysis of the social vulnerability related to flood hazard i e how the population may react in different ways to it depending on its economic social and physical status oulahen et al 2015 therefore we adopted the svi map obtained by pileggi et al 2018 analyzing the social vulnerability to flood hazard in the municipality of florence in particular the index is composed by a set of sixteen variables grouped into six clusters according to literature morrow 1999 and cutter et al 2003 ability to react presence of foreigners access to resources family composition population and housing and education the selected variables are then combined with a spatial multi criteria evaluation smce after their standardization the weight assigned to each variable is determined by expert judgment table 2 3 1 2 spatial multi criteria evaluation smce smce was implemented to map pfi using the integrated land and water information system ilwis itc 2001 within a smce approach the following steps must be followed to transform a set of criteria into a decision define a structure of the decision problem standardize the criteria so that they can be compared determine the importance of one criterion over another and combine the information the structuring of the decision making process involves the construction of a criteria tree to break up the problem into simpler and more easily manageable parts in ilwis criteria can be divided into factors and constraints factors can have a positive or a negative correlation to the analysis output itc 2001 in accordance with the problem definition and the analysis goals i e evaluate the areas most affected by pluvial flood risk in this study the criteria imp hsg and svi identifying respectively areas with high percentage of impervious areas soils with high runoff potential and areas with high social vulnerability index have a positive correlation with pfi the criteria s and dss describing respectively areas with low slope more prone to be inundated and areas with low density drainage of the sewer system less able to drain rainwater have a negative correlation with pfi constraints instead are criteria that identify areas that must be considered as not suitable for nbs installation in this case areas with slope major of 10 and the riparian areas of arno rivers and its tributaries are defined as constraints since it is assumed that the implementation of nbs in such areas could be difficult or even impossible each criterion is then standardized transforming the original scale of measurement into a dimensionless scale between 0 and 1 the standardization of factors is carried out using maximum and interval standardization functions described in itc 2001 table 3 with maximum function the input values are linearly standardized dividing them by the maximum value of the selected map maintaining their relative differences the interval function standardizes the input with a linear function that uses the minimum value and the maximum value of the input map emphasizing the differences among alternatives bagli et al 2011 unlike factors standardization standardized constraints will either obtain value 0 areas excluded from the analysis or value 1 area included in the analysis after standardization the next step is determining the weight of each factor criterion a pairwise comparison method is used to calculate factor criteria weights allowing the comparison of their relative importance pairwise comparison is the basic step of analytic hierarchy process ahp a technique for relating different criteria characterized by qualitative and quantitative evaluations and therefore not directly comparable the criteria are ranked according to their importance and a weight is assigned to each of them saaty 1987 to compute the weights a comparison matrix a is created it is a n x n real matrix where n is the number of used criteria each matrix component a ij represents the importance of the i th criterion relative to the j th criterion to compare the criteria a scale of evaluation ranging from 1 to 9 is considered according to the saaty s scale score 1 indicates that i and j are equally important 3 that i is slightly important than j 5 that i is more important than j 7 is strongly more important than j and 9 is absolutely more important than j on the other hand their reciprocal ones indicate the minor importance of criterion i compared to j in this work the relative importance of each criterion is assigned based on literature review kandilioti et al 2012 lawal et al 2012 gigović et al 2017 kazakis et al 2015 caprario et al 2019 rimba et al 2017 as shown in table 4 after obtaining the matrix a to calculate the vector of percentage weights to be assigned to each criterion it is necessary to calculate the normalized principal eigenvector of the matrix to do this the eigenvectors of the matrix a and their respective eigenvalues are calculated the largest eigenvalue is called the principal eigenvalue and the principal eigenvector corresponds to it normalizing the principal eigenvector we obtain the vector of weights corresponding to each criterion after that it is necessary to check the consistency of the matrix a through the following index 2 cr ci ri where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index and ri is the random index ri value is dependent on the number n of criteria while ci value is calculated by eq 3 3 ci λmax n n 1 where λmax is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix and n the number of criteria in this case n 5 so ri 1 12 and cr 0 069 a matrix is consistent if cr 0 1 so the condition is respected and the matrix is well constructed the final pfi map is constructed according to eq 4 4 pfi 0 267 imp 0 460 s 0 112 hsg 0 090 dss 0 071 svi the pfi mapping results are then analyzed to validate the map i e verify correct identification of areas previously affected by pluvial flooding and to set up a pfi threshold value useful to identify potential hotspots i e identification of the areas where pluvial flood can represent a high risk due to the unavailability of a pluvial flood event database for the city of florence an investigation on media libraries tuscany region 2020c has been carried out to gather information on the areas most frequently hit by pluvial flooding in the 2012 2019 period flooded areas are identified based on the pluvial flood events description and photographic information available and mapped using the streets map provided by the municipality of florence florence municipality 2020 this allows defining multiple control points to validate the pfi results checking the correspondence between the location of floods occurring in the reference period and the areas associated with higher pfi values in particular the mean value μ and the standard deviation σ of pfi are calculated for the identified flooded areas checking the index consistency then the minimum value of pfi in the flooded areas is selected as a threshold to identify the main hotspots in the entire city territory 3 2 spatial planning of nbs for flood mitigation after the identification of the most critical areas during pluvial flood events the most suitable locations for nbs are investigated taking into account two categories of constraints those related to urban planning and determined by the city characteristics e g presence of heritage sites to be protected and those related to technical feasibility thus connected to the nbs design limitations e g spatial requirements for their installation since the extent of the areas with high criticality is wide the analysis focused on one district among those having the higher pfi the selected district is the district d5 rifredi novoli fig 4 which has many pluvial flood hotspots 32 5 of total area of district is considered as critical area according to fpi and represents the district with the highest share of impermeable surfaces i e roofs roads parking lots and other areas with different destinations in the entire city territory the evaluation of urban planning constraints is fundamental in any territorial planning but it is even more important in areas of considerable historical and cultural interest such as the city of florence characterized by numerous areas that are restricted or protected both for cultural landscape and security reasons the two main urban planning normative tools on the municipal scale are analyzed i e structural plan 2014 florence municipality 2014 and the urban regulations 2015 florence municipality 2015 the first is the general planning tool of the territory and is consistent with the overarching provincial and regional planning while the second one downscales the structural plan guidelines into localized interventions as far as urban planning constraints are concerned out of the eighteen rules defined by the city normative tools five constraints are applicable in the area of study these five constraints can be divided into two subgroups total exclusion constraints i e areas where nbs cannot be implemented and conditional exclusion constraints i e in which a specific authorization is needed the total exclusion constraints include the archeological constraint and the presence of wells or springs the archeological constraint does not allow territorial transformation interventions including urban planning within the subjected areas springs and wells are characterized by an absolute protection zone with a radius of 10 m within which only the works for water catchment can be located and a buffer zone with a radius of 200 m for the qualitative and quantitative protection of the withdrawn water resource areas within these two zones can therefore be directly excluded from those where nbs can be installed the group of conditional exclusion constraints includes landscape and hydrogeological constraints and archeological evidence these are constraints whose main purpose is respectively to protect the areas and buildings with the greatest landscape value to preserve the physical environment and regulate interventions related to the territory and to protect the present archeological evidence the areas subjected to conditional exclusion can be dedicated to nbs implementation only after a specific authorization process by a sectorial institution the analysis focuses on public spaces only therefore areas where neither total nor conditional constraints apply have been considered always suitable for nbs installation i e no presence of urban planning constraints with regard to the technical feasibility of nbs the most suitable locations and installation limits of each individual solution were analyzed on the basis of literature information jiménez ariza et al 2019 jato espino et al 2016 ávila et al 2016 christman et al 2018 according to the specific characteristics of the area of study which would not allow large scale nbs implementation the types of nbs considered for pluvial flood risk mitigation were infiltration trenches filter strips filter drains vegetative swales bioretention systems rain gardens tree box filters permeable pavements detention basins and ponds wwap 2018 european commission et al 2015 european commission et al 2020 the following parameters are considered focusing only on public spaces intervention maximum slope of the terrain areal extension of the structure typology of public space e g parks squares traffic islands pavements cycle paths parking areas minimum distance from building foundations table 5 all the urban planning and the technical feasibility constraints described have been mapped using a gis the overlapping of all the constraint maps allowed the definition of a suitability map for each type of nbs considered showing their potential application in the selected district merging the nbs potential implementation map with the pfi map the areas suitable for nbs implementation against urban pluvial flooding are identified this allows us to have a useful overview of the priority for a nbs intervention strategy implementation 4 results 4 1 pluvial flood index pfi the pfi map realized according to the methodology presented in section 3 1 allows the identification of the pluvial flood critical areas in the entire florence territory fig 4 the areas with higher values of pfi are mainly found in the historic city center district d1 centro storico in industrial areas and in expansion areas located in the south eastern and north eastern districts of the municipality i e districts d3 gavinana galluzzo and d2 campo di marte when analysing the physical urban setting our results mainly reflect the slope and the level of imperviousness that strongly influence the capacity of the city to cope with pluvial flood events indeed pfi hotspots are located in flat areas and mainly characterized by relevant share of impermeable surface indeed the historical center of florence characterized by high values of pfi is mostly paved with stone blocks that do not allow the infiltration of water into the soil and the green areas are limited to few gardens belonging to historical villas and religious buildings similar observations can also be made for the north east area of the old town on the right bank of arno river i e district d5 rifredi novoli these areas were built starting from the second half of the 19th century and today are dense with streets residential and commercial blocks the situation is different in the south western part of the city i e district d4 isolotto legnaia mainly characterized by residential areas with larger green spaces in these areas the map shows lower pfi values than in other urbanized areas however in expansion areas there are some sites that despite the low value of imperviousness have a medium pfi final value this is caused by the hydrologic class characterized by high runoff potential and low slope values in the historical center there is also a high level of social vulnerability mainly due to the high number of elderly people living alone but also to a high population density average percentage of immigrant population and the scattered presence of houses in a poor state of preservation most of the analyzed areas have low slope values that have a great influence on the result also according to the weights in the multicriteria analysis resulting in a small portion of the territory with pfi values below 50 the media library investigation has identified 17 points where floods frequently occurred in the period 2012 2019 these events involved limited portion of the city often being circumscribed at the level of single streets or underpasses that have been mapped fig 4 analyzing the pfi distribution in the 17 identified flooded areas pfi values in the interval 80 91 are found with low standard deviation in each area ranging between 0 6 and 3 8 of the mean pfi values table 6 this allows the definition of a threshold value for pfi that is equal to the minimum value of the index in the flooded areas pfi 80 and that can be used to map the area with higher intervention priority areas with pfi 80 applying the threshold to the selected pilot district i e district 5 it is possible to obtain a map with the main pfi hotspots fig 5 where the realization of nbs against pluvial flood would be highly beneficial 4 2 spatial planning of nbs for flood mitigation the pfi hotspot map for the district fig 5 is then combined with the analysis of nbs associated constraints for the selected area of analysis the results show that the areas where nbs are totally excluded are rare and mainly concentrated around the two main water abstraction points of the district on the other hand conditional constraints are widespread restricting the suitable areas on the north eastern border of the district where an overlapping of landscape hydrogeological and archeological constraints is found and on other scattered areas mainly characterized by potential archeological evidence fig 6 with regard to the technical feasibility constraints of the nbs the most suitable areas to host each of the analyzed nbs are identified based on the compatibility with their requirements table 4 analyzing the results it can be observed that bioretention systems rain gardens and vegetated channels are among the most applicable solutions as they can be installed even in areas with small extension filtering drains infiltrating strips and infiltrating trenches also have a good distribution in the neighborhood for the same reason similarly permeable pavements can be widely used to convert existing parking lots footpaths and cycle paths that are widespread throughout the district on the other hand detention basins and ponds requiring larger surface areas can be installed only in more peripheral areas with less of a built environment intersecting technical feasibility constraints map with urban planning constraints the final feasibility maps are obtained fig 7 as expected the maps show a reduction in terms of areas where nbs can actually be implemented in particular conditional constraints exclude from nbs implementation the entire northern part of the district while the total exclusion constraints affect only a small portion of the area along the western borders of the district comparing suitability areas with those hotspots associated with a pfi higher than 80 it is possible to determine a nbs implementation strategy against pluvial flooding identifying for each pluvial flood hotspot the set of measures that can be implemented to solve the problem fig 8 results show that the possibility of implementing ponds and detention basins is limited by the availability of space while other nbs such as permeable pavement or vegetated swale can be spread around the main pfi hotspots highlighting the multiple possibility of supporting existing drainage network with nbs interventions to reduce runoff volumes this preliminary positioning of nbs in the district 5 allows the evaluation of alternative intervention scenarios where nbs are implemented in synergy with existing gray infrastructures the intervention maps obtained can provide a useful support to the design phase where starting from the preliminary location of nbs the efficiency in solving pluvial flood issues is analyzed through dedicated modeling huang et al 2020 pappalardo et al 2017 5 discussion the proposed analysis is oriented to the identification of nbs implementation areas to mitigate the risks associated with pluvial flood events the wider perspective adopted including socio economic factors in the definition of the pfi is linked to the idea that management solutions should move beyond the single sector perspective favoring the multifunctionality the results reflect this approach with the pfi being able to properly identify the areas where pluvial flood events occurred but also including a larger part of the territory that should be considered as hotspots due to their negative combination of the other aspects included in the smce e g svi in this sense solving a pluvial flood issue cannot be only limited to the correct management of water volumes but should also consider the socio economic context to define intervention priorities favoring most vulnerable areas our results are coherent with several studies highlighting the higher risk of pluvial floods in industrial and expansion areas szewrański et al 2018 sperotto et al 2016 less evidence was found on higher pluvial floods risk in historical city centers especially in italy but this could be linked to the limited availability of similar studies most of which are limited to city center di salvo et al 2018 or are excluding them sperotto et al 2016 however like in other non historical case studies quan 2021 the higher risk of pluvial floods in florence historical center is mainly linked to the high imperviousness of the paved surfaces of the area similarly the adoption of nbs should follow a similar approach including the evaluation of the whole set of benefits they can provide such as improving water quality increasing the amenity of neighborhoods reducing urban heat island and noise level the obtained results represent a qualitative analysis able to support the uptake of nbs for flood management through a preliminary selection of the potential solutions as shown in table 7 results show that the areas suitable for the realization of the different nbs types analyzed ranges between 0 1 and 7 1 of the districts analyzed this suggests that in cities similar to florence where the urbanization is dense and there are many historical parts embedded the nbs potential can be limited therefore it is strategic to develop detailed mapping of nbs feasibility in order to quickly compare multiple intervention scenarios the final map obtained fig 8 allows the identification of nbs potentially implementable to deal with pfi hotspots after such a gis mapping approach aiming at identifying all the areas where nbs can be implemented at the city scale an additional in depth analysis can be needed to quantify the capacity of the selected nbs to solve the pluvial flood issue in this framework hydrological and hydraulic modeling of nbs can help to identify their effects in terms of drainage network inflow reduction kumar et al 2021 quagliolo et al 2021 such modeling approaches could also allow the identification of the benefit provided by different levels of nbs implementation epelde et al 2022 castelli et al 2017 in addition to this integrated modeling approaches can allow the evaluation of other potential co benefits such as enhanced biodiversity increased carbon storage reduction of extreme temperatures epelde et al 2022 6 conclusions rainwater management is one of the main challenges that characterizes urban areas in a global context of growing urbanization and climate change impacts flooding caused by heavy rainfall is increasingly frequent and new integrated solutions such as nbs are needed to improve existing grey infrastructures the proposed methodology identifies the pluvial flooding hotspots in which the installation of nbs is recommended and can bring considerable benefits the city of florence is selected as an exemplar case study due to its complex historical structure and the ageing water infrastructures pfi is defined to evaluate the areas most prone to flooding using hydrological environmental technical and social criteria that were combined through a smce the pfi map obtained allows to analyze the distribution of the areas with high and low priority of intervention on the municipality territory to mitigate the flooding impacts during pluvial flood events the results obtained are validated by the comparison with the historically flooded areas during heavy rainy events the comparison shows the results consistency with high pfi map correctly identifying the main critical districts of the city in particular pfi hotspots are located in flat areas and mainly characterized by relevant share of impermeable surface as those located the historical center of florence mostly paved with stone blocks high runoff potential and low slope values characterized also the other city districts resulting in a small portion of the territory with pfi values below 50 the svi factor plays a relevant role in the area with high number of elderly people living alone high population density high presence of immigrant population and presence of houses in a poor state of preservation among the critical districts one was selected to explore a nbs implementation strategy for pluvial flood mitigation considering urban planning constraints and technical feasibility parameters a final map was then realized to determine which nbs types could fit in the areas with over threshold pfi values the space available for the realization of the different nbs types analyzed ranges between 0 1 and 7 1 of the selected district area this suggests that in cities similar to florence the nbs potential can be limited due to dense urbanization and historical parts embedded however the introduction of nbs remains an option to be explored not only in terms of runoff flow management and reduction of impermeable areas but also evaluating the multiple ecosystem services associated the results obtained can be a useful support for urban planning providing a holistic approach to explore the potential of adopting nbs for urban pluvial flood management in heritage cities credit authorship contribution statement tommaso pacetti

further increasing pluvial flood risk kaykhosravi et al 2019 o donnell and thorne 2020 zölch et al 2017 pachauri et al 2014 and questioning the effectiveness of traditional management approaches westra et al 2014 indeed grey infrastructures or hard engineering solutions designed only to collect rainwater and convey it away from the city context through sewer systems li et al 2020 often show their inadequacy to deal with very intense and locally concentrated rainfall events moreover such solutions will not provide an adequate response to today and future environmental economic and social challenges including climate change eea 2012 zhou 2014 to address these challenges adaptable and multifunctional solutions are required ashley et al 2007 woodward et al 2011 emami 2020 in this context nature based solutions nbs represent an interesting approach that involves the use of integrated solutions to manage urban runoff obtaining simultaneously other benefits nbs are defined as solutions that are inspired and supported by nature which are cost effective simultaneously provide environmental social and economic benefits and help build resilience eea 2015 most frequently nbs are realized to regulate stormwater in urban areas creating so called sustainable urban drainage systems suds depending on the context alternative terminologies can be used to indicate nbs in urban areas such as green infrastructure gi ecosystem based adaptation eba low impact development lid water sensitive urban design wsud and best management practices bmps fletcher et al 2015 in this article the term nbs will be used as it represents the wider set of solutions that encompass all the specific sub definitions pauleit et al 2017 the great potential of these solutions in urban areas is that they can provide a multitude of ecosystem services coutts and hahn 2015 pacetti et al 2020 in addition to the main benefits for which they are built for example nbs can be useful in the management of flooding in terms of retention managing infiltration and runoff thus allowing a reduction in the amount of water conveyed into the drainage system at the same time thanks to the presence of grass bushes and trees nbs contribute to increase water and air quality biodiversity amenity of the area dagenais et al 2017 coutts and hahn 2015 ashley et al 2013 and to reduce noise level urban heat island and respiratory diseases epa 2017 nbs can be used alone or in combination with grey infrastructures favoring cities adaptation to climate change and strengthening the management and utilization of rainwater runoff sun et al 2020 even though an increasing number of cities have adopted urban planning approaches where nature is seen as an opportunity for adaptation kabisch et al 2017 urban water management is still heavily dominated by gray infrastructures with nbs accounting for less than 5 of the global expenditure in water resources management wwap 2018 the main barriers hindering the investments in nbs are represented by the inadequate financial resources and the lack of incentives the institutional fragmentation the lack of political commitment and institutional and technical capabilities the increasing gentrification and the limited availability of land due to ownership issues and to urban planning limitations ershad sarabi et al 2019 in this context the importance of developing appropriate planning and design tools for the successful nbs uptake is paramount ershad sarabi et al 2019 as shown by recent literature one of the most important aspects is to define the adequate locations for nbs installation depending on the purpose meerow and newell 2017 developed a geographical information system gis based approach to support the spatial planning of multifunctional gi li et al 2020 proposed a multi criteria evaluation method to identify areas where to realize gi to mitigate urban flood risk kaykhosravi et al 2019 proposed a geospatial framework based on hydrological hydraulic economics social and environmental benefits of lid to identify priority sites martin mikle et al 2015 defined a spatial approach to identify priority areas for lid based on a topographic index calculated by combining various environmental indicators and technical suitability aiming at supporting the introduction of nbs to manage stormwater in heritage cities contexts this study integrates gis based and multi criteria analysis to identify the most suitable areas where implementing nbs against urban pluvial flooding in the city of florence italy the proposed methodology is divided into two phases in the first one the pluvial flood index pfi of the entire municipality is elaborated to identify the most critical areas during pluvial flood from a combined socio hydrological perspective in the second phase the suitability of nbs implementation against pluvial flood is analyzed focusing on a pilot area the city of florence has special features because it is a historic and art city with an important architectural artistic landscape scientific and natural heritage that can limit the introduction of nbs e g presence of archeological evidence therefore the urban constraints and technical feasibility constraints of different nbs typologies i e infiltration trenches filter strips filter drains vegetative swales bioretention areas tree boxes permeable pavement detention basins ponds have been analyzed to identify the most suitable areas that allow nbs installation while preserving the city heritage the methodology allows the identification of the critical areas that would benefit from nbs implementation and the preliminary assessment of nbs feasibility the results can support the decision making process for implementation of nbs for urban flooding mitigation 2 study area florence fig 1 is the capital city of tuscany region italy covering an area of about 102 km2 with 366 927 inhabitants according to the 2019 census of the italian national statistical institute istat it has a humid temperate climate with an elevation ranging between 83 m and 338 m above sea level the municipality is crossed by the arno river that flows in the east west direction and it is connected to multiple tributaries as well as to some buried rivers channels and culverts the land use in the area is various on the plain areas along the arno river there are residential commercial industrial and green urban areas on hills agricultural areas including vineyards orchards and olive groves and forests are predominant the sewer system of the city is combined i e no separation between stormwater runoff and wastewater collection and is mainly based on the infrastructures built in the 19th century resulting in a complex sewer network with a total length of around 800 km the sewage is almost completely connected to wastewater treatment plants however there are some collectors that discharge the excess water in the arno river and its tributaries in addition to the flood risk associated to the presence of the arno river caporali 2016 the whole city area is exposed to flash and pluvial flood events that involve the minor hydrographic network and the sewer system in the last decades due to the high level of urbanization the inadequacy of the sewer network to population growth and the increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall events numerous pluvial floods in various parts of the city have been observed 3 materials and methods the proposed methodology is based on two phases starting with the definition and mapping of the pluvial flood index pfi to identify the areas most affected by pluvial flood risk in the entire municipality in the second phase the areas suitable for the installation of nbs are located according to planning and technical constraints with reference to a single district among those having on average the higher pfi values finally priority areas for nbs installation to mitigate the pluvial flood problems are identified fig 2 3 1 pluvial flood index pfi the construction of pfi is based on the use of five criteria table 1 i imperviousness imp ii slope s iii hydrologic soil group hsg iv density of sewer system dss v social vulnerability index svi the combination of environmental and socio economic criteria is crucial to determine the risk and to identify the most critical areas crichton 1999 as shown by various recent studies li et al 2020 kaykhosravi et al 2019 meerow and newell 2017 all data used in the analysis are summarized in table 1 3 1 1 description of criteria for the construction of pfi 3 1 1 1 imperviousness imp the impervious areas inhibit the infiltration of rainwater in the soil thus determining a greater volume of runoff therefore the evaluation of imperviousness allows to identify the areas prone to flood due to their inability to effectively drain the rainwater the imperviousness density dataset of 2015 provided by copernicus land monitoring service table 1 is used to map the percentage of imp with 20 m spatial resolution 3 1 1 2 slope s slope is a measure of the inclination of a surface relative to the horizontal plane and it has an important role in the rainfall runoff transformation steeper slopes contribute to generating major floods while areas with a lower slope have higher probability to be inundated kandilioti et al 2012 the slope s is obtained by the digital terrain model dtm of tuscany region with 10 m spatial resolution integrated and corrected if necessary with reference to the dtm lidar table 1 and it is expressed as a percentage 3 1 1 3 hydrologic soil group hsg soil characteristics have an important role in the runoff formation based on the percentage of sand gravel silt and clay a soil can have a high or low infiltration capacity indeed all the rainfall not infiltrating in the soil contributes to generate runoff hsg information has been derived by the pedology dataset of tuscany region table 1 where soils are classified in four hydrological groups gardin 2015 based on their runoff potential according to the classification introduced by the u s department of agriculture usda 2009 the first group a includes soils with low runoff potential with typically less than 10 of clay and more than 90 of sand and gravel the second group b includes soils with medium low runoff potential characterized by an amount of clay between 10 and 20 and sand between 50 and 90 the third group c includes soils with medium high runoff potential characterized by an amount of clay between 20 and less than 50 of sand the fourth group d includes soils with high runoff potential with typically greater than 40 of clay and less than 50 of sand only the a b and d classes are present in the municipality of florence 3 1 1 4 density of sewer system dss a widespread distribution of the sewer system is fundamental to reduce the impact of stormwater in this study the dss m m2 is evaluated as the total length of the pipes provided by the local water management company per unit drainage basin area corresponding to the census area defined by istat table 1 despite the complex dynamics that water can have in areas with high dss kandilioti et al 2012 it is assumed that high density values correspond to high levels of the sewer system functionality palla et al 2018 3 1 1 5 social vulnerability index svi the effects of a flood event depend also on the vulnerability of the affected socio economic and ecological systems messner and meyer 2006 in general the term social vulnerability refers to the combinations of social cultural economic political and institutional processes that influence population sensitivity to hazard events and its ability to prepare respond cope and recover from it zhou et al 2014 spielman et al 2020 in this case the main interest is on the analysis of the social vulnerability related to flood hazard i e how the population may react in different ways to it depending on its economic social and physical status oulahen et al 2015 therefore we adopted the svi map obtained by pileggi et al 2018 analyzing the social vulnerability to flood hazard in the municipality of florence in particular the index is composed by a set of sixteen variables grouped into six clusters according to literature morrow 1999 and cutter et al 2003 ability to react presence of foreigners access to resources family composition population and housing and education the selected variables are then combined with a spatial multi criteria evaluation smce after their standardization the weight assigned to each variable is determined by expert judgment table 2 3 1 2 spatial multi criteria evaluation smce smce was implemented to map pfi using the integrated land and water information system ilwis itc 2001 within a smce approach the following steps must be followed to transform a set of criteria into a decision define a structure of the decision problem standardize the criteria so that they can be compared determine the importance of one criterion over another and combine the information the structuring of the decision making process involves the construction of a criteria tree to break up the problem into simpler and more easily manageable parts in ilwis criteria can be divided into factors and constraints factors can have a positive or a negative correlation to the analysis output itc 2001 in accordance with the problem definition and the analysis goals i e evaluate the areas most affected by pluvial flood risk in this study the criteria imp hsg and svi identifying respectively areas with high percentage of impervious areas soils with high runoff potential and areas with high social vulnerability index have a positive correlation with pfi the criteria s and dss describing respectively areas with low slope more prone to be inundated and areas with low density drainage of the sewer system less able to drain rainwater have a negative correlation with pfi constraints instead are criteria that identify areas that must be considered as not suitable for nbs installation in this case areas with slope major of 10 and the riparian areas of arno rivers and its tributaries are defined as constraints since it is assumed that the implementation of nbs in such areas could be difficult or even impossible each criterion is then standardized transforming the original scale of measurement into a dimensionless scale between 0 and 1 the standardization of factors is carried out using maximum and interval standardization functions described in itc 2001 table 3 with maximum function the input values are linearly standardized dividing them by the maximum value of the selected map maintaining their relative differences the interval function standardizes the input with a linear function that uses the minimum value and the maximum value of the input map emphasizing the differences among alternatives bagli et al 2011 unlike factors standardization standardized constraints will either obtain value 0 areas excluded from the analysis or value 1 area included in the analysis after standardization the next step is determining the weight of each factor criterion a pairwise comparison method is used to calculate factor criteria weights allowing the comparison of their relative importance pairwise comparison is the basic step of analytic hierarchy process ahp a technique for relating different criteria characterized by qualitative and quantitative evaluations and therefore not directly comparable the criteria are ranked according to their importance and a weight is assigned to each of them saaty 1987 to compute the weights a comparison matrix a is created it is a n x n real matrix where n is the number of used criteria each matrix component a ij represents the importance of the i th criterion relative to the j th criterion to compare the criteria a scale of evaluation ranging from 1 to 9 is considered according to the saaty s scale score 1 indicates that i and j are equally important 3 that i is slightly important than j 5 that i is more important than j 7 is strongly more important than j and 9 is absolutely more important than j on the other hand their reciprocal ones indicate the minor importance of criterion i compared to j in this work the relative importance of each criterion is assigned based on literature review kandilioti et al 2012 lawal et al 2012 gigović et al 2017 kazakis et al 2015 caprario et al 2019 rimba et al 2017 as shown in table 4 after obtaining the matrix a to calculate the vector of percentage weights to be assigned to each criterion it is necessary to calculate the normalized principal eigenvector of the matrix to do this the eigenvectors of the matrix a and their respective eigenvalues are calculated the largest eigenvalue is called the principal eigenvalue and the principal eigenvector corresponds to it normalizing the principal eigenvector we obtain the vector of weights corresponding to each criterion after that it is necessary to check the consistency of the matrix a through the following index 2 cr ci ri where cr is the consistency ratio ci is the consistency index and ri is the random index ri value is dependent on the number n of criteria while ci value is calculated by eq 3 3 ci λmax n n 1 where λmax is the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix and n the number of criteria in this case n 5 so ri 1 12 and cr 0 069 a matrix is consistent if cr 0 1 so the condition is respected and the matrix is well constructed the final pfi map is constructed according to eq 4 4 pfi 0 267 imp 0 460 s 0 112 hsg 0 090 dss 0 071 svi the pfi mapping results are then analyzed to validate the map i e verify correct identification of areas previously affected by pluvial flooding and to set up a pfi threshold value useful to identify potential hotspots i e identification of the areas where pluvial flood can represent a high risk due to the unavailability of a pluvial flood event database for the city of florence an investigation on media libraries tuscany region 2020c has been carried out to gather information on the areas most frequently hit by pluvial flooding in the 2012 2019 period flooded areas are identified based on the pluvial flood events description and photographic information available and mapped using the streets map provided by the municipality of florence florence municipality 2020 this allows defining multiple control points to validate the pfi results checking the correspondence between the location of floods occurring in the reference period and the areas associated with higher pfi values in particular the mean value μ and the standard deviation σ of pfi are calculated for the identified flooded areas checking the index consistency then the minimum value of pfi in the flooded areas is selected as a threshold to identify the main hotspots in the entire city territory 3 2 spatial planning of nbs for flood mitigation after the identification of the most critical areas during pluvial flood events the most suitable locations for nbs are investigated taking into account two categories of constraints those related to urban planning and determined by the city characteristics e g presence of heritage sites to be protected and those related to technical feasibility thus connected to the nbs design limitations e g spatial requirements for their installation since the extent of the areas with high criticality is wide the analysis focused on one district among those having the higher pfi the selected district is the district d5 rifredi novoli fig 4 which has many pluvial flood hotspots 32 5 of total area of district is considered as critical area according to fpi and represents the district with the highest share of impermeable surfaces i e roofs roads parking lots and other areas with different destinations in the entire city territory the evaluation of urban planning constraints is fundamental in any territorial planning but it is even more important in areas of considerable historical and cultural interest such as the city of florence characterized by numerous areas that are restricted or protected both for cultural landscape and security reasons the two main urban planning normative tools on the municipal scale are analyzed i e structural plan 2014 florence municipality 2014 and the urban regulations 2015 florence municipality 2015 the first is the general planning tool of the territory and is consistent with the overarching provincial and regional planning while the second one downscales the structural plan guidelines into localized interventions as far as urban planning constraints are concerned out of the eighteen rules defined by the city normative tools five constraints are applicable in the area of study these five constraints can be divided into two subgroups total exclusion constraints i e areas where nbs cannot be implemented and conditional exclusion constraints i e in which a specific authorization is needed the total exclusion constraints include the archeological constraint and the presence of wells or springs the archeological constraint does not allow territorial transformation interventions including urban planning within the subjected areas springs and wells are characterized by an absolute protection zone with a radius of 10 m within which only the works for water catchment can be located and a buffer zone with a radius of 200 m for the qualitative and quantitative protection of the withdrawn water resource areas within these two zones can therefore be directly excluded from those where nbs can be installed the group of conditional exclusion constraints includes landscape and hydrogeological constraints and archeological evidence these are constraints whose main purpose is respectively to protect the areas and buildings with the greatest landscape value to preserve the physical environment and regulate interventions related to the territory and to protect the present archeological evidence the areas subjected to conditional exclusion can be dedicated to nbs implementation only after a specific authorization process by a sectorial institution the analysis focuses on public spaces only therefore areas where neither total nor conditional constraints apply have been considered always suitable for nbs installation i e no presence of urban planning constraints with regard to the technical feasibility of nbs the most suitable locations and installation limits of each individual solution were analyzed on the basis of literature information jiménez ariza et al 2019 jato espino et al 2016 ávila et al 2016 christman et al 2018 according to the specific characteristics of the area of study which would not allow large scale nbs implementation the types of nbs considered for pluvial flood risk mitigation were infiltration trenches filter strips filter drains vegetative swales bioretention systems rain gardens tree box filters permeable pavements detention basins and ponds wwap 2018 european commission et al 2015 european commission et al 2020 the following parameters are considered focusing only on public spaces intervention maximum slope of the terrain areal extension of the structure typology of public space e g parks squares traffic islands pavements cycle paths parking areas minimum distance from building foundations table 5 all the urban planning and the technical feasibility constraints described have been mapped using a gis the overlapping of all the constraint maps allowed the definition of a suitability map for each type of nbs considered showing their potential application in the selected district merging the nbs potential implementation map with the pfi map the areas suitable for nbs implementation against urban pluvial flooding are identified this allows us to have a useful overview of the priority for a nbs intervention strategy implementation 4 results 4 1 pluvial flood index pfi the pfi map realized according to the methodology presented in section 3 1 allows the identification of the pluvial flood critical areas in the entire florence territory fig 4 the areas with higher values of pfi are mainly found in the historic city center district d1 centro storico in industrial areas and in expansion areas located in the south eastern and north eastern districts of the municipality i e districts d3 gavinana galluzzo and d2 campo di marte when analysing the physical urban setting our results mainly reflect the slope and the level of imperviousness that strongly influence the capacity of the city to cope with pluvial flood events indeed pfi hotspots are located in flat areas and mainly characterized by relevant share of impermeable surface indeed the historical center of florence characterized by high values of pfi is mostly paved with stone blocks that do not allow the infiltration of water into the soil and the green areas are limited to few gardens belonging to historical villas and religious buildings similar observations can also be made for the north east area of the old town on the right bank of arno river i e district d5 rifredi novoli these areas were built starting from the second half of the 19th century and today are dense with streets residential and commercial blocks the situation is different in the south western part of the city i e district d4 isolotto legnaia mainly characterized by residential areas with larger green spaces in these areas the map shows lower pfi values than in other urbanized areas however in expansion areas there are some sites that despite the low value of imperviousness have a medium pfi final value this is caused by the hydrologic class characterized by high runoff potential and low slope values in the historical center there is also a high level of social vulnerability mainly due to the high number of elderly people living alone but also to a high population density average percentage of immigrant population and the scattered presence of houses in a poor state of preservation most of the analyzed areas have low slope values that have a great influence on the result also according to the weights in the multicriteria analysis resulting in a small portion of the territory with pfi values below 50 the media library investigation has identified 17 points where floods frequently occurred in the period 2012 2019 these events involved limited portion of the city often being circumscribed at the level of single streets or underpasses that have been mapped fig 4 analyzing the pfi distribution in the 17 identified flooded areas pfi values in the interval 80 91 are found with low standard deviation in each area ranging between 0 6 and 3 8 of the mean pfi values table 6 this allows the definition of a threshold value for pfi that is equal to the minimum value of the index in the flooded areas pfi 80 and that can be used to map the area with higher intervention priority areas with pfi 80 applying the threshold to the selected pilot district i e district 5 it is possible to obtain a map with the main pfi hotspots fig 5 where the realization of nbs against pluvial flood would be highly beneficial 4 2 spatial planning of nbs for flood mitigation the pfi hotspot map for the district fig 5 is then combined with the analysis of nbs associated constraints for the selected area of analysis the results show that the areas where nbs are totally excluded are rare and mainly concentrated around the two main water abstraction points of the district on the other hand conditional constraints are widespread restricting the suitable areas on the north eastern border of the district where an overlapping of landscape hydrogeological and archeological constraints is found and on other scattered areas mainly characterized by potential archeological evidence fig 6 with regard to the technical feasibility constraints of the nbs the most suitable areas to host each of the analyzed nbs are identified based on the compatibility with their requirements table 4 analyzing the results it can be observed that bioretention systems rain gardens and vegetated channels are among the most applicable solutions as they can be installed even in areas with small extension filtering drains infiltrating strips and infiltrating trenches also have a good distribution in the neighborhood for the same reason similarly permeable pavements can be widely used to convert existing parking lots footpaths and cycle paths that are widespread throughout the district on the other hand detention basins and ponds requiring larger surface areas can be installed only in more peripheral areas with less of a built environment intersecting technical feasibility constraints map with urban planning constraints the final feasibility maps are obtained fig 7 as expected the maps show a reduction in terms of areas where nbs can actually be implemented in particular conditional constraints exclude from nbs implementation the entire northern part of the district while the total exclusion constraints affect only a small portion of the area along the western borders of the district comparing suitability areas with those hotspots associated with a pfi higher than 80 it is possible to determine a nbs implementation strategy against pluvial flooding identifying for each pluvial flood hotspot the set of measures that can be implemented to solve the problem fig 8 results show that the possibility of implementing ponds and detention basins is limited by the availability of space while other nbs such as permeable pavement or vegetated swale can be spread around the main pfi hotspots highlighting the multiple possibility of supporting existing drainage network with nbs interventions to reduce runoff volumes this preliminary positioning of nbs in the district 5 allows the evaluation of alternative intervention scenarios where nbs are implemented in synergy with existing gray infrastructures the intervention maps obtained can provide a useful support to the design phase where starting from the preliminary location of nbs the efficiency in solving pluvial flood issues is analyzed through dedicated modeling huang et al 2020 pappalardo et al 2017 5 discussion the proposed analysis is oriented to the identification of nbs implementation areas to mitigate the risks associated with pluvial flood events the wider perspective adopted including socio economic factors in the definition of the pfi is linked to the idea that management solutions should move beyond the single sector perspective favoring the multifunctionality the results reflect this approach with the pfi being able to properly identify the areas where pluvial flood events occurred but also including a larger part of the territory that should be considered as hotspots due to their negative combination of the other aspects included in the smce e g svi in this sense solving a pluvial flood issue cannot be only limited to the correct management of water volumes but should also consider the socio economic context to define intervention priorities favoring most vulnerable areas our results are coherent with several studies highlighting the higher risk of pluvial floods in industrial and expansion areas szewrański et al 2018 sperotto et al 2016 less evidence was found on higher pluvial floods risk in historical city centers especially in italy but this could be linked to the limited availability of similar studies most of which are limited to city center di salvo et al 2018 or are excluding them sperotto et al 2016 however like in other non historical case studies quan 2021 the higher risk of pluvial floods in florence historical center is mainly linked to the high imperviousness of the paved surfaces of the area similarly the adoption of nbs should follow a similar approach including the evaluation of the whole set of benefits they can provide such as improving water quality increasing the amenity of neighborhoods reducing urban heat island and noise level the obtained results represent a qualitative analysis able to support the uptake of nbs for flood management through a preliminary selection of the potential solutions as shown in table 7 results show that the areas suitable for the realization of the different nbs types analyzed ranges between 0 1 and 7 1 of the districts analyzed this suggests that in cities similar to florence where the urbanization is dense and there are many historical parts embedded the nbs potential can be limited therefore it is strategic to develop detailed mapping of nbs feasibility in order to quickly compare multiple intervention scenarios the final map obtained fig 8 allows the identification of nbs potentially implementable to deal with pfi hotspots after such a gis mapping approach aiming at identifying all the areas where nbs can be implemented at the city scale an additional in depth analysis can be needed to quantify the capacity of the selected nbs to solve the pluvial flood issue in this framework hydrological and hydraulic modeling of nbs can help to identify their effects in terms of drainage network inflow reduction kumar et al 2021 quagliolo et al 2021 such modeling approaches could also allow the identification of the benefit provided by different levels of nbs implementation epelde et al 2022 castelli et al 2017 in addition to this integrated modeling approaches can allow the evaluation of other potential co benefits such as enhanced biodiversity increased carbon storage reduction of extreme temperatures epelde et al 2022 6 conclusions rainwater management is one of the main challenges that characterizes urban areas in a global context of growing urbanization and climate change impacts flooding caused by heavy rainfall is increasingly frequent and new integrated solutions such as nbs are needed to improve existing grey infrastructures the proposed methodology identifies the pluvial flooding hotspots in which the installation of nbs is recommended and can bring considerable benefits the city of florence is selected as an exemplar case study due to its complex historical structure and the ageing water infrastructures pfi is defined to evaluate the areas most prone to flooding using hydrological environmental technical and social criteria that were combined through a smce the pfi map obtained allows to analyze the distribution of the areas with high and low priority of intervention on the municipality territory to mitigate the flooding impacts during pluvial flood events the results obtained are validated by the comparison with the historically flooded areas during heavy rainy events the comparison shows the results consistency with high pfi map correctly identifying the main critical districts of the city in particular pfi hotspots are located in flat areas and mainly characterized by relevant share of impermeable surface as those located the historical center of florence mostly paved with stone blocks high runoff potential and low slope values characterized also the other city districts resulting in a small portion of the territory with pfi values below 50 the svi factor plays a relevant role in the area with high number of elderly people living alone high population density high presence of immigrant population and presence of houses in a poor state of preservation among the critical districts one was selected to explore a nbs implementation strategy for pluvial flood mitigation considering urban planning constraints and technical feasibility parameters a final map was then realized to determine which nbs types could fit in the areas with over threshold pfi values the space available for the realization of the different nbs types analyzed ranges between 0 1 and 7 1 of the selected district area this suggests that in cities similar to florence the nbs potential can be limited due to dense urbanization and historical parts embedded however the introduction of nbs remains an option to be explored not only in terms of runoff flow management and reduction of impermeable areas but also evaluating the multiple ecosystem services associated the results obtained can be a useful support for urban planning providing a holistic approach to explore the potential of adopting nbs for urban pluvial flood management in heritage cities credit authorship contribution statement tommaso pacetti

7966,study region ganh hao river ca mau peninsular vietnamese mekong delta study focus the study was conducted to determine the extent of pollution by physicochemical parameters and heavy metals through seasonally sampling of the river the water quality was compared with international and vietnamese standards while sediment quality was compared with the vietnamese standard and pollution indices geo accumulation index contamination factor and pollution load index the principal component analysis pca was employed for explaining the main factors responsible for observed levels of water pollution the oscillations due to tidal cycles and seasonality were also evaluated by statistical comparison based on the logistic regression models the temporal variability of selected water quality parameters was visualized using qgis new hydrological insights the results showed that the concentrations of nutrients and organic compounds exceeded the allowable standards for surface water quality the concentrations of heavy metals were below the allowable standard for sediment quality and consistent with the background levels the influences of the tidal regime and seasonality caused significant changes in water quality aquaculture practices and tidal regimes accounted for 79 84 of the total variance in water quality characteristics the extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture activities were identified in relation to the variation in water quality and water quality maps highlighted pollution hotspots the research results could be useful not only to policymakers in developing water resources management strategies but also likely widespread implications for other rivers beyond the geographical regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords pollution indices principal component analysis surface water quality complex tidal regime ganh hao river 1 introduction river and sediment contamination has been one of the most concerning environmental issues in recent decades and it continues to pose a global threat to humans biodiversity and aquatic organisms bashir et al 2020 high pollutant concentrations in surface water and sediments pose serious environmental and health risks liang et al 2017 natural and anthropogenic activities are important factors in the accumulation of polluted sediments in streams leading to increased pollutant concentrations in the environment pollutants exist in a variety of forms in surface water bodies and their availability and mobility in surface water and sediment systems are influenced by a variety of physical and chemical processes prokop et al 2003 over the last few decades useful tools for supporting water quality management have steadily increased such as water quality models kenov et al 2014 however a considerable amount of input data are required to run the models otherwise assumptions due to insufficient data would lead to the deviation between the facts and the simulation gao and li 2014 multivariate analysis was chosen as an effective tool to discover the complex factors in the environmental system therefore complicated phenomena could be simplified to extract vital information wu

chotpantarat et al 2020 wisitthammasri et al 2020 boonkaewwan et al 2021 chotpantarat and thamrongsrisakul 2021 due to the advantage of the pca method complicated databases would be simplified to provide a better understanding of water quality singh et al 2005 charuseiam et al 2022 the ca mau peninsula located in the southernmost section of the vietnamese mekong delta vmd fig 1a is within the seawater intrusion zone which is influenced by both east and west sea tidal regimes resulting in unsuitable water quality for irrigation during the dry season hoanh et al 2009 as a consequence of seawater intrusion traditional rice production was limited to only one wet season crop this resulted in a constraint of priority policy for agriculture led growth since the 1990 s as a result up until the year 2000 a series of coastal embankments and tidal sluices had been completed to prevent seawater intrusion for rice farming when freshwater within protected zones was supplied adequately for rice production increasing in double or triple rice crops conflicts occurred among stakeholders who used brackish and saline water for aquaculture practices as a result a new strategy for the balanced development of aquaculture and agriculture practices adopted in 2000 considerably promoted the region s economic growth brennan et al 2000 hoanh et al 2003 nevertheless negative environmental impacts on surface water quality caused by aquaculture and agricultural activities were not considered sufficiently hori 2000 over the last few decades there has been a prompt increase in the modified landscape due to land use and seawater intrusion management which have resulted in remarkable effects on surface water quality in the ca mau peninsula the surface water quality at main rivers has been polluted due to urbanization and aquaculture and agriculture practices fanslow et al 2005 chea et al 2016 the discharge of domestic agriculture and aquaculture wastewater entering the receiving waters which found the most apparent consequences of water pollution in the ganh hao river caused the negative effects making changes in physicochemical characteristics of surface water dinh 2019 tri et al 2019 for instance the surface water quality at ganh hao river and tributaries were deteriorated due to high concentrations of nutrients and organic substances the dissolved oxygen do ammonium n nh4 and phosphorous p po4 3 varied respectively from 3 32 to 7 12 mg l 1 0 195 1 577 mg l 1 and 0 019 0 185 mg l 1 in the dry season toan et al 2007 high contents of arsenic as were found in the surface water and sediment at main rivers and ganh hao river in ca mau province particularly as contents varied from 2 13 to 2 27 µg l 1 and 0 4 23 33 µg l 1 in the surface water in the dry and wet seasons respectively while the contents of the as in sediment presented respectively in a range of 4 9 6 7 mg kg 1 and 10 77 14 97 mg kg 1 in the dry and wet seasons tho 2007 elevated as contents tended to increase from the inland to the estuaries in the surface water and sediment which ranged respectively from 15 43 to 78 41 µg l 1 and 7 10 12 4 mg kg 1 at main rivers in ca mau province nga 2010 long 2015 indicated that the water quality of canals and rivers belonging to ca mau province has been polluted due to agricultural and aquaculture practices the concentrations e g do n nh4 p po4 3 were detected in a range of 1 37 7 95 mg l 1 0 3 111 mg l 1 and 0 008 0 963 mg l 1 surface water pollution has not only remarkably influenced aquatic life but also inhabitants who have relied mainly on the surface water resources for daily activities chi et al 2018 however few studies assessed entirely the variation of the surface water and sediment quality under the various drivers of influence the previous studies just investigated either the content of pollutants in the surface water or sediment at a large scale it is difficult to assume that the water and sediment quality of tributary systems are similar to that of the key waterway therefore to fill the gap in the literature our research focused on the spatial and temporal variations in surface water and sediment quality in the ganh hao river one of the main rivers in the ca mau peninsula to determine the corresponding quality status and identify the main sources of pollution the river under investigation is important for water supplies from the seas and receives wastewater from anthropogenic activities in the area the research is based on the following hypotheses i pollution levels in the river are expected to be higher than international and national standards ii aquaculture practices cause pollution of surface water and sediment iii changes in contaminant concentrations are greatly influenced by tidal and seasonal factors to accomplish the given hypotheses the following objectives were addressed i to analyze the water and sediment quality at representative sites along the river and compare the surface water quality results with the standards of vietnam and the united states environmental protection agency and the sediment quality results with the vietnamese standards and pollution indices ii to specify factors for interpreting the temporal variability in surface water quality iii to evaluate the effects of the tidal regime and seasonality on water quality and iv to visualize spatially the water quality variation along the river to identify pollution hotspots 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area a common border between the bac lieu and ca mau provinces in the ca mau peninsula vmd is located at a lower part of the ganh hao river fig 1a the river is influenced significantly by the tidal regimes of the east and west seas inundated twice daily at various tidal amplitudes the east sea is characterized by a mixed semi diurnal tidal cycle with a tidal range of up to 3 m and has two ebb and flood tides daily while the west sea has a diurnal tide with a smaller tidal range of 0 8 m albers and stolzenwald 2015 the weather is characterized by the east asian summer monsoon leading to a dry season from december to late april and a wet season from may to november the average annual rainfall is nearly 2000 mm with warm temperatures all year 20 c 35 c kontgis et al 2019 saline water is dominated in the study area due to the direct impact of the vietnamese west and east seas inundated twice daily at various tidal amplitudes it is one of four main rivers bringing seawater from the seas and receiving wastewater from anthropogenic activities in this region since economic growth in bac lieu and ca mau provinces has focused mainly on aquaculture practices therefore the discharge of untreated wastewater into the surface water has caused significant degradation of water quality over the last decades freshwater for agricultural practices in the eastern part of bac lieu province is mainly provided through the quan lo phung hiep canal that connects to the bassac river the main branch of the mekong river in vmd ngo dang et al 2016 however the seasonal dams and sluices that prevent seawater intrusion have prevented fresh water from reaching the study area during the rainy season rainfall runoff is the major source of freshwater for the river the predominant land use in the study area is mostly characterized by intensive advanced intensive extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture activities particularly the dong hai district of the bac lieu province has a natural area of 57 008 74 ha of which shrimp culture obtained for 39 387 5 ha the district consists of 11 communes of which three communes e g dinh thanh an trach and an phuc commune accounted for 11 095 12 ha used for shrimp farms dhpc 2019 2020 while the dam doi district of the ca mau province includes 42 821 2 ha out of 78 204 04 ha of natural area utilized for the shrimp farms the district has 15 communes of which six communes e g tan trung ta an khuong ta an khuong dong ta an khuong nam tan duc and tan thuan commune obtained for 23144 89 ha used for aquaculture practices ddpc 2019 2020 the extensive and improved extensive systems are understood to have a relatively low density of shrimp and rely mainly on natural feeds but a small amount of organic fertilizers is sometimes supplemented into ponds while a greater input of fertilizers and supplemental feeds is added to the intensive and advanced intensive systems with a high density of shrimp thi et al 2011 pollutants from anthropogenic activities in the upstream region and along the ganh hao river have been reported to have insignificant effects on the study area dowrm 2017 therefore changes in water quality are understood to be mainly associated with aquaculture practices along the river reach which made the primary contributions to the receiving waters in the study area 2 2 sample collection and analytical procedures 2 2 1 sample collection samples were collected consecutively during the ebb and flood tides in the dry march 22 2019 and wet september 5 2019 seasons at 25 observed sites 0 5 km apart fig 1b to obtain representative data for the study area the sampling campaigns were performed consecutively during ebb and flood tides starting from downstream to the upstream boundary of the river towards landward therefore the sample collection was conducted in all tidal phases the sampling site locations were determined using satellite images and information from interviews with the local authorities the selected sites were then certified in situ by investigating the actual land use and discovering potential disturbing factors e g presence of shrimp farms or land use mixtures water samples were collected using a boat which traveled from the lower boundary to the upper boundary of the river sampling avoided closely riverbanks where stagnation and direct wastewater discharges could lead to unrepresentative water samples samples for nutrients and organic component analyses were collected at a depth of 30 cm below the water surface against the water flow direction to prevent the intrusion of floating debris following the guidelines of the ministry of natural resources and environment monre 2018 samples for the analysis of heavy metals were collected using vandorn equipment at three different depths at each sampling site high density polyethylene hdpe bottles 1 l were prewashed with 10 hno3 and repeatedly rinsed with distilled water to avoid contamination from metal and non metal ions before sampling the sample bottles were labeled and rinsed three times with river water for the measurement of heavy metal concentrations 65 hno3 was added to each sample immediately to bring the ph to 2 to prevent metal adsorption onto the walls of the bottle immediately after sampling the bottles were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory apha 1999 sediment samples were collected at the same sampling sites as the water samples using a peterson grab from the sediment surface to the depth of 10 cm before sampling polyethylene bags were washed with a 10 hno3 solution and rinsed with distilled water each sample had a weight of 2 3 kg and was placed in one of the pre cleaned polyethylene bags to avoid exposure to light samples were brought to the laboratory where they were dried at room temperature before being crushed and sieved 0 5 mm mesh to a dry weight of 0 5 1 kg 2 2 2 analytical procedures for the surface water samples the temperature electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do salinity and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a handy lab 680 fk instrument si analytics gmbh germany ammonium nitrogen n nh4 nitrite nitrogen n no2 nitrate nitrogen n no3 phosphate phosphorus p po4 3 and total phosphorus tp were measured using the spectrometric method tcvn 6179 1 1996 iso 7150 1 1984 smeww 4500 no2 b 2017 smeww 4500 no3 e 2017 smeww 4500 p e 2017 and smeww 4500 p b e 2017 at wavelengths of 600 nm 540 nm 540 nm 880 nm and 880 nm respectively the concentrations ranges were 0 003 0 008 mg l 1 0 005 0 1 mg l 1 0 05 1 0 mg l 1 0 01 6 0 mg l 1 and 0 03 6 0 mg l 1 for n nh4 n no2 n no3 p po4 3 and tp respectively for the analysis of total nitrogen tn tcvn 6638 2000 iso 10048 1991 devarda s alloy was used to reduce nitrogen compounds to ammonium nitrogen was subsequently transferred to ammonium sulfate in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid containing a high content of potassium sulfate to raise the boiling point of the mixture in the presence of copper as a catalyst ammonia was released from the mixture and collected in a flask in the presence of a boric solution ammonium was measured by titration with boric acid the chemical oxygen demand cod smeww 5220 c 2017 of the sample was determined by oxidizing the organic substances using a boiling mixture of chromic and sulfuric acids then the samples were refluxed in a strong acid solution with a known excess of potassium dichromate after digestion the remaining excess of potassium dichromate was titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate to determine the amount of reacted potassium dichromate and the oxidizing agent was computed in terms of the oxygen equivalent saline water samples were added mercuric sulfate to reduce chloride cl below 2000 mg l 1 hgso4 cl 10 1 for the analysis of the total suspended solids tss content smeww 2540 d 2017 well mixed samples were filtered through filters with a mesh size of 0 40 0 45 µm the residue on each filter was dried to a constant weight at 103 105 c the tss content was detected as an increase in filter weight for the sediment samples the ec and ph values were detected in situ using an hi 8633 hanna instrument multi range conductivity meters usa and an hi 99121 hanna instrument soil ph test kit usa respectively the total organic carbon toc content was analyzed using the wet combustion method described by walkley and black 1934 arsenic as copper cu lead pb and zinc zn concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo icap 6000 thermo scientific fl usa 2 2 3 quality assurance and quality control quality assurance qa and quality control qc were performed using standard samples certified reference materials crms for all parameters the crm sample was analyzed seven times the same procedure as the real samples the results of the crms were calculated as the mean and standard deviation sd which were then used to plot a graph for qc purposes the qa was performed by checking the results if the results were in the range of 2 sd to 2 sd the analysis procedures and results were considered to be accurate and reliable 2 3 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 geographical analyses were conducted using the quantum geographic information system qgis version 3 12 2 3 1 water and sediment quality assessment the datasets of surface water and sediment quality parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics mean max min and standard deviation as the replication was not met for statistical analysis the spatial variabilities of water quality parameters were compared with the surface water quality guidelines of vietnam monre 2015 and the us epa epa 2001 sediment quality parameters were compared with the vietnamese guidelines monre 2017 and with the following pollution indices 2 3 2 geoaccumulation index the deterioration of the bottom sediment quality with respect to metal concentrations was assessed based on the geo accumulation i geo index which is expressed as follows muller 1969 1 i geo log2 cn 1 5 bn where cn and bn are the measured concentration and the geochemical background concentration of metal n respectively factor 1 5 is used to account for possible variations in the background data due to lithological changes the i geo values were classified into seven grades as follows i geo 0 grade 0 unpolluted 0 i geo 1 grade 1 slightly polluted 1 i geo 2 grade 2 moderately polluted 2 i geo 3 grade 3 moderately severely polluted 3 i geo 4 grade 4 severely polluted 4 i geo 5 grade 5 severely extremely polluted i geo 5 grade 6 extremely polluted 2 3 3 contamination factor the pollution load of the sediment for heavy metals was assessed using the contamination factor cf which can be categorized into four grades for monitoring the contamination of a single metal over the study period as follows low degree cf 1 moderate degree 1 cf 3 substantial degree 3 cf 6 and very high degree cf 6 the cf is expressed as follows hakanson 1980 2 cf measured metal content background content of the same metal 2 3 4 pollution load index the pollution load index pli was used to determine the mutual pollution effect at different sites the overall toxicity status of each sampling site was then evaluated based on the pli a pli of 0 indicates excellence while a pli of 1 implies the presence of only baseline levels of pollutants a pli of 1 indicates the progressive contamination of the site and estuarine quality the pli is expressed as the nth root of the multiplications of the contents as cf metals as follows tomlinson et al 1980 3 pli cf 1 cf 2 cf 3 cfn n in this research the global mean heavy metal contents were taken as cu 45 µg g 1 as 13 µg g 1 pb 20 µg g 1 and zn 95 µg g 1 turekian and wedepohl 1961 2 3 5 temporal variabilities of surface water quality the surface water dataset for the 25 sampling sites included water quality parameters measured on march 22 2019 dry season and september 5 2019 wet season the water quality data of the two seasons were statistically compared significance level of 5 using the non parametric mann whitney u test because the data did not have a normal distribution determined by the shapiro wilk test the differences in water quality were visualized by box diagrams for the 14 representative parameters due to the low heavy metal concentrations at most sampling sites the variabilities of water quality impacted by the tidal regime were assessed based on measurements at 25 observed sites which were divided into two groups one representing the flood tide and the other representing the ebb tide the mann whitney u test was performed to observe the influence of tides on the selected water quality parameters 2 3 6 identification of source pollution the interpreting factors of temporal variations in water quality were determined using principal component analysis pca for this analysis the initial dataset of all 25 sampling sites comprising mean values for all parameters was reduced to satisfy the criteria for the test bartlett test of sphericity and kaiser meyer olkin first the as cu pb and zn data were removed because they were almost undetectable at the observed sites and had low variabilities second n nh4 was distributed in two components resulting in a significant reduction in the convergence of other components therefore this parameter was excluded as well therefore the reduced dataset included temperature ec tds tss ph cod salinity n no2 n no3 tn p po4 3 and tp and was further rotated by a varimax with kaiser normalization to indicate the loadings of the principal components 2 3 7 water quality maps water quality maps were developed using logistic regression models based on land use to identify variables influencing two groups of land use rates for extensive and improved extensive culture systems in dam doi and dong hai districts the water quality parameters including respectively ec tss tp n no2 in the dry season and ph ec n no2 tp in the wet season were selected for the highly correct rate of classification with land use as a representative of extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture see also supplementary material s1 1 the seasonal mean values of parameters at sampling sites 18 19 20 21 22 24 and 25 in the dry season and 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 and 25 in the wet season were used to develop the water quality maps because of the high probability of classification based on the model analysis the land use map for 2019 that was employed for this analysis only covered parts of the study area therefore only the water quality maps of these observed sites are illustrated the land use types of intensive and advanced intensive culture activities were not the main factor affecting the alteration of surface water quality along the river reach the statistical analysis kruskal wallis with a significance level of 5 indicated that differences among the variables were apparent in the wet season compared with the dry season however the confidence intervals for the mean values were not ordered among the land use groups this was because the area used for extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture was much greater than that of intensive and advanced intensive culture the water quality maps were produced using the inverse distance weighted idw method integrated with the qgis software and revealed seasonal changes in water quality for the selected parameters the idw method is based on estimating interpolation whereby unknown values are calculated by a linear set of values at identified points the method assumes that each input point has a local impact reduction with increasing distance and that the surfaces are generated by establishing an adjacent search of points and weighting them by a power function ahmed et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variations of water and sediment quality 3 1 1 surface water quality table 1 indicates the spatial fluctuations of the selected water quality parameters among the observed sites during the dry and wet seasons there was little variation in water temperature among the sampling sites in each season because the sites were affected by similar weather conditions in addition tropical estuaries have a more stable temperature than temperate estuaries fatema et al 2015 the measured ph values also varied little spatially in both seasons which can be explained by the direct effect of seawater on the tidal cycle of the east sea hinga 2002 reported that seawater not only greatly influenced ph levels but also had alkaline properties ph 7 5 8 4 overall the changes in ph did not exceed the allowable standards for water quality elevated values of ec tds and salinity were measured at all observed sites in both seasons although those in the wet season were considerably lower than those in the dry season the high ec and tds values probably corresponded to the elevated salinity levels owing to the direct impact of the tidal regime of the east sea moreover elevated ec values depend greatly on temperature and aquaculture practices turcios and papenbrock 2014 in particular an elevated water temperature has a strong influence on ec and causes ions to move more quickly in solution resulting in a high tds value due to the close relationship between ec and tds rusydi 2018 the pollution caused by aquaculture activities probably contributed slightly to an increase in the ec and tds values which showed minor variations among the observed sites in both seasons the ec tds and salinity values met the water quality conditions for marine aquatic life weber and duffy 2007 relatively low do concentrations were measured at most sampling sites while substantially elevated cod levels were observed at all sites in both seasons the spatial variabilities of the do and cod levels were insignificant in both seasons high tss values were detected at most sites and were approximately 2 3 times greater than the permissible water quality standard this could be explained by the intensive indirect and direct impacts of aquaculture related discharges moreover strong flow velocities in the coastal area influenced by the tidal regime were probably caused by high levels of tss peak values of tss were also observed at some sampling sites in the lower river reach because an extreme current flow impacted by semi diurnal regimes prevented the normal upstream transport of suspended solids resulting in the accumulation of high tss in the lower area augustijn and fares 2011 the relatively low do and elevated cod levels among the investigated sites in both seasons suggest that the water quality in the study area was contaminated by organic substances this could relate to intensive water use as well as waste discharges from aquaculture practices which were observed during the field campaign in addition relatively low do concentrations could also be associated with the high salinity values which may have reduced the capacity of the water to hold do deacutis 2016 although some sampling sites had do concentrations below the permissible standard all sites had cod values that exceeded the respective guideline in both seasons the concentrations of different n species were generally low compared with the water quality standards despite the direct effluent discharges of the nearby extensive and intensive shrimp culture practices the low nutrient contents could be explained by the low redox condition or do concentration in the water column leading to the dominance of nitrification processes within the n patterns additionally the presence of no3 could be changed into other forms such as n2o or n2 due to the favorable conditions supporting the process of denitrification the tidal regime also played an important role in diluting effluents containing nutrients released by aquaculture practices along the river the low n nh4 concentration was likely due to the effect of an alkaline water ph 7 0 at most sites previous studies körner et al 2001 revealed that nh4 depends greatly on ph and is promoted in an acidic water environment ph 7 0 other studies also reported that the n contents in natural water were typically within a small range and that lower values were found in coastal seawater wilbers et al 2014 however spatial variations in n no2 and n nh4 which varied significantly in both seasons and exceeded the corresponding standards were observed at several sites due to the indirect and direct effects of effluent discharges during the field surveys these spatial variations could also be due to the catchment features tabayashi and koba 2011 the p po4 3 concentration was significantly lower than the water quality guidelines and was considerably lower than the concentrations of different n species at the same sampling sites in both seasons this is because p can be easily absorbed by a high amount of suspended solids as stated by li and zuo 2020 p is in a soluble state in surface water and is greatly affected by suspended solids through adsorption thus leading to low availability of p in the aquatic environment although there were no water quality guidelines for tn and tp the findings showed that the range of values of tn 0 84 4 76 mg l 1 and tp 0 01 2 97 mg l 1 could occur plankton blooms in the water column claude and green 2002 reported that loads of tn and tp ranging from 0 1 mg l 1 to 0 75 mg l 1 and 0 001 mg l 1 to 0 1 mg l 1 respectively could lead to plankton blooms in coastal waters the heavy metal concentrations were hardly detected at all sampling sites with some being substantially lower than the water quality guidelines as observed during the field surveys the studied area has been strongly influenced by aquaculture practices which may introduce metal loid s e g in effluent into the surface water nevertheless the low metal concentrations could be associated with physicochemical processes occurring in the aquatic environment which would lower the metal concentrations the principal processes governing the distributions of different soluble forms of metals are dilution dispersion sedimentation and absorption due to high tss contents as well as the physicochemical properties of water e g ph temperature and dissolved ions namieśnik and rabajczyk 2010 additionally the study area is located in an inland area 6 km from the river estuary the river seawater interaction under the strong effect of the tidal regime produces a rotational circulation enlarging the capacity of pollutant deposition originating from the inland area within the estuary this has been confirmed by the previous studies in coastal regions nga 2010 wilbers et al 2014 3 1 2 sediment quality table 2 provides information on the spatial variations of the physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents of the river sediment at the observed sites in both seasons the ph values were slightly acidic and varied little among the observed sites in both seasons the ph values of sediment were lower than those measured in the surface water at the same sites possibly due to the decomposition of deposited organic substances derived from aquaculture practices a low ph value in sediment could be associated with the presence of humic acid formed from decaying organic substances and deposits of acid sulfate soils zhao et al 2017 high ec levels that varied considerably among the observed sites were measured in both seasons these elevated ec values were mainly associated with seawater intrusion due to the direct effects of the tidal cycle of the east sea sidi et al 2015 found that a strong positive correlation and exchange capacity among cations were remarkably affected by the influence of seawater leading to elevated ec values in sediment in situ measurement could also have been a factor resulting in the high ec values malvankar et al 2014 reported that direct conductivity measurements in reduced sediments included the ionic contribution to ec and prevented a loss of conductivity due to the air oxidation process the results showed that the toc content was relatively low despite the influence of aquaculture derived inputs this could relate to the strong impacts of the hydrodynamics and sediment components in the ganh hao river liu et al 2015 considered that sediment dispersion depended considerably on tidal flow whereby a high toc content would be beneficial to sedimentary burial within a weak hydrodynamic environment in addition the sediments along the river are primarily clay silt fine sand and green silt with many shells and had the lowest concentrations of organic substances oanh 2012 overall the variation of the toc content was within the normal range of 1 2 5 2 reported for marine sediments carrasco et al 2003 the metal loads were much lower than the respective guidelines and showed a nonsignificant variability among the investigated sites this could be explained by the effects of a low ph low toc contents high salinity and intense hydrodynamics which could cause low metal contents in the bottom sediment the ph of sediment was slightly acidic at all sites in both seasons which could drive the release of metals into the water column yang et al 2006 reported that metals were released from sediments at a ph of 6 0 this is because h ions compete with the absorbed metal ions in sediment particles driving the desorption of metals the relatively low toc loads could also explain the low metal contents of the sediment samples an increase in metal content binding to organic substances in the sediment was probably proportional to an elevated content of organic substances owing to the high mobility of metals and their strong affinity for organic matter baran et al 2019 moreover high salinity and ec levels were additional factors leading to the low metal contents of sediment samples the total adsorption of metals would have decreased with increasing salinity and ec due to the stimulated mobility and competition among heavy metals and other cations gijs et al 2008 a close relationship was also found in the exchange mechanism of metal species between the sediments and the water column whereby the metal speciation released by sediment dynamics was absorbed by the organic substances in the water and then settled to the bottom sediments jiao et al 2018 in both seasons minor or undetectable metal presence was found this could be due to the significant impacts of the tidal hydrodynamics the metal species released from the sediment would have absorbed particles in the water moving seaward thus accumulating high loads in the estuary botté et al 2010 has found that the distribution of metal loads in sediments increased progressively from the inland area to the estuarine area this relates to the mixing of seawater with polluted sediments carried by rivers which significantly affects the deposition of pollutants in estuaries as reported by tho 2007 and nga 2010 this understanding suggests a gradual increase in the metal contents from the landward area to the estuaries and tidal mudflats of the vmd the results of the quantitative indices with respect to metal loid contamination of the sediments in the study area are presented in table 3 the calculated pli values were 1 suggesting that the river sediments were not contaminated by metals a higher pli indicates sediment contamination due to a major contribution of metals from anthropogenic sources islam et al 2015 tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 the cf values for all metals except as were 1 implying a low degree of contamination in both seasons at several sites in the dry season as was at a level corresponding to a moderate degree of pollution 1 cf 3 generally the cf values in the dry season were ranked as as pb zn cu while those in the wet season were ranked as pb zn as cu the i geo values were negative for as cu pb and zn indicating a noncontaminated status of the sediment and background levels of these metals the i geo values in the dry season were ranked as cu zn pb as while those in the wet season were ranked as cu as zn pb 3 2 temporal fluctuations of water quality 3 2 1 tidal movements surface water along the ganh hao river is strongly affected by irregular semi diurnal tides from the east and west seas these cause the water level to change and influence the spatial variation of water quality due to fluctuations in the dilution of pollutants fig 2 shows that ec values were observed during ebb tide higher than ec values during the flood tide similar results were found for temperature ph tds salinity do and cod but not for the tss content which was higher during the flood tide than during the ebb tide a statistically significant difference was found between the ebb and flood tides with respect to temperature tds do cod and salinity p 0 05 while nonsignificant differences were found for ph ec and tss p 0 05 hence the changes in temperature tds do cod and salinity could be explained by the variation in the tidal regime while the changes in ph ec and tss values were probably associated with other factors the impacts of ebb and flood tides also resulted in various changes in the n and p concentrations n no2 and n nh4 concentrations were statistically higher during the ebb tide than during the flood tide p 0 05 higher n no3 tn p po4 3 and tp concentrations occurred during the flood tide than during the ebb tide although only the tn and p po4 3 concentrations were statistically higher p 0 05 davies and ugwumba 2013 also reported that the effect of tides caused significant alterations in nutrient patterns the author found that riverine inputs of pollutants during the ebb tide resulted in high nutrient concentrations while lower nutrient concentrations during the flood tide were associated with river water seawater mixing our findings are also consistent with those of other studies that observed differences in pollutant concentrations between ebb and flood tides fatema et al 2015 purnaini and purwono 2018 3 2 2 seasonality fig 3 shows that the temperature ph ec tds and salinity values were significantly higher during the dry season compared with the wet season p 0 05 while the tss content was not significantly higher during the dry season p 0 05 zhang et al 2010 found that the temperature of coastal waters was governed primarily by solar radiation and tidal flow in the vmd the highest solar radiation usually occurs during the dry season as a result this could explain that the dry season s increase in water temperature was higher than the rainy season s temperature moreover the freshwater input in the dry season is generally lower than that in the rainy season causing high water temperature in the dry season a slight decrease in the ph of surface water was observed during the wet season which may have related to higher runoff rates from acidic soils during the early part of the wet season as well as the decomposition of nutrient residues and organic substances discharged by aquaculture practices the ec tds and salinity values exhibited similar patterns with substantially higher levels in the dry season than in the wet season the elevated tds content was due to dissolved salts and agricultural runoff korey 2010 therefore the impacts of seawater and aquaculture practices coupled with low dilution from rainfall probably led to high tds contents during the dry season the level of ec 34 78 ms cm 1 and salinity 22 03 in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season 11 98 ms cm 1 and 6 88 respectively table 1 this could be because the total rainfall as input freshwater for ganh hao river during the campaign field in the dry season 19 5 mm was much lower than in the rainy season 296 1 mm leading to salinity intrusion in the dry season donre 2019 furthermore in this study the river flow data was measured in different seasons and the average water discharge in the rainy season 571 84 m3 s is lower than that in the dry season 842 09 m3 s which mainly brings seawater from the seas through the inland abdullah et al 2018 revealed that a high degree of salinity was closely linked with tds ec and salinity levels the tss concentration was greater in the dry season than in the wet season this could be due to low water levels and high flow velocities in the dry season 842 09 m3 s which caused a continuous disturbance and soil erosion in addition there was no rainfall such as freshwater input in the study area during the sampling period in the wet season however the variability of the tss concentration was statistically independent of the season p 0 05 the median do concentration varied little and was not significantly different between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 while the median cod value was significantly higher during the dry season p 0 05 the elevated cod during the dry season may be ascribed to the reduction of the water column coupled with accumulated organic and inorganic substances released by aquaculture activities along the river a similar pattern was observed by islam et al 2015 who reported that low river flows during the dry season led to a high cod the concentration of nitrogenous patterns was significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season p 0 05 various chemicals and residual feeds are added to aquaculture ponds with water being discharged to areas along the river thus aquaculture activities were probably responsible for the elevated nutrient contents during the wet season on the contrary higher p po4 3 and tp concentrations were observed in the dry season in comparison to the wet season with only slight variations in both seasons in the aquatic environment tss strongly affects p species through adsorption however the elevated p po4 3 tp and tss contents were proportional during the dry season there was a nonsignificant difference in the p po4 3 and tp concentrations between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 3 2 3 identification of pollutant sources fig 4 shows that three components with eigenvalues of 1 were extracted based on the pca which accounted for approximately 79 84 of the total variance of the water quality deterioration with respect to the selected parameters the first component explained 53 64 of the total variance and had positive high loadings for temperature ph ec tds salinity and cod but negative loadings for n no2 and n no3 this component was explained as pollution related to physicochemical properties and organic matter elevated loading for ec tds salinity and cod were probably primarily influenced by the tidal cycle and untreated wastewater discharges from shrimp culture activities both tds and ec are indicators of salinity and seawater intrusion in coastal areas a high water temperature can promote a higher dissolved ion content in addition tds includes inorganic salts and minor quantities of organic substances in water thus aquaculture practices cannot be ignored as a contributor to the tds content in the study area dauda et al 2019 high ph levels could be due to seawater intrusion moving inland between the dry and wet seasons phung et al 2015 found that generally low ph values in coastal regions were due to the influence of chemicals applied during farm operations as well as the formation of organic acids through the decomposition of organic compounds hence the high ph levels in the present research may have originated from high salinity while untreated wastewater discharges from shrimp farms could explain the elevated cod content pollution sources derived from culture systems include solid waste comprising uneaten feed and fecal droppings and dissolved waste associated with food metabolism or decomposition products solid waste material can contribute to an increased tss content and increased n species dauda et al 2019 ebeling et al 2010 reported that the discharge of accumulated solid waste associated with bacterial activity was the main cause of an increased cod content of the water column negative high loadings for n no2 and n no3 in both seasons could be related to the high salinity levels therefore low content and narrow variation of n compounds in coastal regions were due to the effects of elevated salinity levels the second component accounted for 18 43 of the total variance and included positive high loadings for tss and tp and a moderate loading for tn this component was considered to correspond to the deterioration of water quality with respect to sources of suspended solids and nutrients a large amount of solid waste generated by aquaculture practices along with strong currents on the coast that disturb settled particles could explain the high tss content the tp and tn levels in the surface water of the river were likely associated with discharges from shrimp farms products of n and p are not only representative of nutrient pollution but are also the major components of proteins found in a variety of aquatic organisms therefore elevated protein feed consists of high amounts of n and p it has been estimated that approximately 20 30 of the n and p added to feeds is released to the nearby environment kawasaki et al 2016 the third component represented pollution corresponding to do consumption this component accounted for 7 77 of the total variance and consisted of a positive loading for do and small negative loading for p po4 3 low do concentration in receiving water bodies can be associated with effluent discharges with a high content of organic matter which consumes a significant amount of oxygen through decomposition processes moreover the decreased do concentration was likely due to the relatively high temperatures during both seasons claude and green 2002 the small negative loading for p po4 3 suggests a slight effect of p on the surface water of the river because of its prompt absorption by aquatic plants or suspended substances 4 water quality map the temporal variation in water quality was found to be mainly related to land use for extensive and improved extensive culture systems based on this relationship logistic regression models were developed to specify the variables selected quality parameters exhibiting a temporally high rate of classification percentage correct with land use the regression models of the water quality patterns were utilized to generate water quality maps for the sites with a high probability of classification the maps were based on the seasonal mean contents of pollutants as determined from the water samples for both seasons fig 5 indicates that the water quality parameters were associated with the land use type in the study area mainly that of extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture systems along the river the elevated tp concentrations were visualized mainly at the middle and lower parts of the river in the dry season while the highest tp concentrations were visible at the upper and lower parts of the river in the wet season n no2 concentrations were high in areas far away from the upstream parts of the river in the wet season but they were found high concentrations at the upper and lower areas of river reach in the dry season lower tp concentrations during the dry season compared with the wet season were associated with elevated tss contents because of the potential absorption of available p to suspended solids see also supplementary material s1 1 the presence of n no2 related to land use in both seasons could be explained by the low do concentration of surface water due to the input of nutrients and organic pollutants from shrimp culture activities as an intermediate product in the n cycle n no2 was found at relatively low concentrations and the available form of n no2 was involved in the influence of do on the nitrification process in the water column pajares and ramos 2019 the ec values differed between the two seasons and reduced gradually from the upstream areas to the downstream parts of the river in the wet season compared with the dry season however the spatial differences in the ec values were relatively small over the entire area the higher ec values could be explained by the direct impact of aquaculture practices along with the tidal cycle of the east sea in addition ph was also found to relate to land use and could be explained by the impacts of effluent discharges from shrimp farms and runoff from acidic soils in the wet season see also supplementary material s1 1 trai et al 2007 found that higher pollutant concentrations were discharged by intensive shrimp culture in comparison to extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture practices in interlaced shrimp farms however our logistic model analysis suggested that extensive and improved extensive shrimp farms were very relevant to the reduced surface water quality of the river this was because a larger area of land is utilized for extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture systems in comparison to that used for intensive and advanced intensive shrimp farms this coupled with the fertilizers and chemicals used for preparing the ponds and supplemental feeds during stocking stages were specified as the main contributors to the water quality deterioration all the maps showed a relatively low diffusion of pollutants among the investigated sites partly because the sampling was carried out near the peak of the tide leading to reduced transport of contaminants moreover during the field surveys it was observed that farmers discharged wastewater from the shrimp ponds to the receiving water of the sampling sites overall the findings of this research can assist policymakers in identifying pollution hotspots and developing water resources management strategies furthermore environmental practitioners can benefit from the water quality maps because they are easier to understand than data tables and statistical model analyses wilbers et al 2014 also showed the benefit of using regression model coupling with gis based maps to identify hot spot areas of pollution at main waterways in the vmd that could support water supply companies to specify optimal areas for water extraction and develop water management strategies for policymakers in addition the findings revealed that surface water quality was impacted by various tidal regimes seasonality and areas of the watershed however the surface water quality standard has only focused on pollution sources in general the results of this study are the scientific basis for the local policy makers to develop regulations or strategies to manage better surface water quality furthermore the results were not only the local interest but also regional attention where surface water quality has been impacted considerably by natural and anthropogenic activities 5 conclusions the ganh hao river s surface water was heavily used by the locals for their daily needs surface water quality was generally poor especially when compared to guidelines and varied in terms of space and time because of the extensive direct use of surface water and contamination of the river proper water management strategies for different tidal regimes and areas of the watershed should be established to monitor water quality throughout time moreover to assess the water quality status of the region sampling is carried out not only in the river and aquaculture ponds but also in other types of land use based on the water quality maps pollution hotspots could be identified to recommend water extraction areas to meet the safe water requirements of local communities the findings revealed that land use with extensive and improved extensive shrimp systems was primarily associated with sources of pollutants influencing river water quality degradation implying that the extraction of surface water within these areas could pose future risks the research results could suggest that policy makers should consider thoroughly establishing regulations or guidelines of areas of shrimp systems on surface water quality under the different factors of influence to manage effectively surface water resources credit authorship contribution statement le van muoi data curation investigation methodology visualization writing original

7966,study region ganh hao river ca mau peninsular vietnamese mekong delta study focus the study was conducted to determine the extent of pollution by physicochemical parameters and heavy metals through seasonally sampling of the river the water quality was compared with international and vietnamese standards while sediment quality was compared with the vietnamese standard and pollution indices geo accumulation index contamination factor and pollution load index the principal component analysis pca was employed for explaining the main factors responsible for observed levels of water pollution the oscillations due to tidal cycles and seasonality were also evaluated by statistical comparison based on the logistic regression models the temporal variability of selected water quality parameters was visualized using qgis new hydrological insights the results showed that the concentrations of nutrients and organic compounds exceeded the allowable standards for surface water quality the concentrations of heavy metals were below the allowable standard for sediment quality and consistent with the background levels the influences of the tidal regime and seasonality caused significant changes in water quality aquaculture practices and tidal regimes accounted for 79 84 of the total variance in water quality characteristics the extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture activities were identified in relation to the variation in water quality and water quality maps highlighted pollution hotspots the research results could be useful not only to policymakers in developing water resources management strategies but also likely widespread implications for other rivers beyond the geographical regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords pollution indices principal component analysis surface water quality complex tidal regime ganh hao river 1 introduction river and sediment contamination has been one of the most concerning environmental issues in recent decades and it continues to pose a global threat to humans biodiversity and aquatic organisms bashir et al 2020 high pollutant concentrations in surface water and sediments pose serious environmental and health risks liang et al 2017 natural and anthropogenic activities are important factors in the accumulation of polluted sediments in streams leading to increased pollutant concentrations in the environment pollutants exist in a variety of forms in surface water bodies and their availability and mobility in surface water and sediment systems are influenced by a variety of physical and chemical processes prokop et al 2003 over the last few decades useful tools for supporting water quality management have steadily increased such as water quality models kenov et al 2014 however a considerable amount of input data are required to run the models otherwise assumptions due to insufficient data would lead to the deviation between the facts and the simulation gao and li 2014 multivariate analysis was chosen as an effective tool to discover the complex factors in the environmental system therefore complicated phenomena could be simplified to extract vital information wu and kuo 2012 pca one of the multivariate statistical techniques has been widely used to assess water quality variations mishra 2010 azhar et al 2015 zeinalzadeh and rezaei 2017 boonsrang et al 2018 chotpantarat et al 2020 wisitthammasri et al 2020 boonkaewwan et al 2021 chotpantarat and thamrongsrisakul 2021 due to the advantage of the pca method complicated databases would be simplified to provide a better understanding of water quality singh et al 2005 charuseiam et al 2022 the ca mau peninsula located in the southernmost section of the vietnamese mekong delta vmd fig 1a is within the seawater intrusion zone which is influenced by both east and west sea tidal regimes resulting in unsuitable water quality for irrigation during the dry season hoanh et al 2009 as a consequence of seawater intrusion traditional rice production was limited to only one wet season crop this resulted in a constraint of priority policy for agriculture led growth since the 1990 s as a result up until the year 2000 a series of coastal embankments and tidal sluices had been completed to prevent seawater intrusion for rice farming when freshwater within protected zones was supplied adequately for rice production increasing in double or triple rice crops conflicts occurred among stakeholders who used brackish and saline water for aquaculture practices as a result a new strategy for the balanced development of aquaculture and agriculture practices adopted in 2000 considerably promoted the region s economic growth brennan et al 2000 hoanh et al 2003 nevertheless negative environmental impacts on surface water quality caused by aquaculture and agricultural activities were not considered sufficiently hori 2000 over the last few decades there has been a prompt increase in the modified landscape due to land use and seawater intrusion management which have resulted in remarkable effects on surface water quality in the ca mau peninsula the surface water quality at main rivers has been polluted due to urbanization and aquaculture and agriculture practices fanslow et al 2005 chea et al 2016 the discharge of domestic agriculture and aquaculture wastewater entering the receiving waters which found the most apparent consequences of water pollution in the ganh hao river caused the negative effects making changes in physicochemical characteristics of surface water dinh 2019 tri et al 2019 for instance the surface water quality at ganh hao river and tributaries were deteriorated due to high concentrations of nutrients and organic substances the dissolved oxygen do ammonium n nh4 and phosphorous p po4 3 varied respectively from 3 32 to 7 12 mg l 1 0 195 1 577 mg l 1 and 0 019 0 185 mg l 1 in the dry season toan et al 2007 high contents of arsenic as were found in the surface water and sediment at main rivers and ganh hao river in ca mau province particularly as contents varied from 2 13 to 2 27 µg l 1 and 0 4 23 33 µg l 1 in the surface water in the dry and wet seasons respectively while the contents of the as in sediment presented respectively in a range of 4 9 6 7 mg kg 1 and 10 77 14 97 mg kg 1 in the dry and wet seasons tho 2007 elevated as contents tended to increase from the inland to the estuaries in the surface water and sediment which ranged respectively from 15 43 to 78 41 µg l 1 and 7 10 12 4 mg kg 1 at main rivers in ca mau province nga 2010 long 2015 indicated that the water quality of canals and rivers belonging to ca mau province has been polluted due to agricultural and aquaculture practices the concentrations e g do n nh4 p po4 3 were detected in a range of 1 37 7 95 mg l 1 0 3 111 mg l 1 and 0 008 0 963 mg l 1 surface water pollution has not only remarkably influenced aquatic life but also inhabitants who have relied mainly on the surface water resources for daily activities chi et al 2018 however few studies assessed entirely the variation of the surface water and sediment quality under the various drivers of influence the previous studies just investigated either the content of pollutants in the surface water or sediment at a large scale it is difficult to assume that the water and sediment quality of tributary systems are similar to that of the key waterway therefore to fill the gap in the literature our research focused on the spatial and temporal variations in surface water and sediment quality in the ganh hao river one of the main rivers in the ca mau peninsula to determine the corresponding quality status and identify the main sources of pollution the river under investigation is important for water supplies from the seas and receives wastewater from anthropogenic activities in the area the research is based on the following hypotheses i pollution levels in the river are expected to be higher than international and national standards ii aquaculture practices cause pollution of surface water and sediment iii changes in contaminant concentrations are greatly influenced by tidal and seasonal factors to accomplish the given hypotheses the following objectives were addressed i to analyze the water and sediment quality at representative sites along the river and compare the surface water quality results with the standards of vietnam and the united states environmental protection agency and the sediment quality results with the vietnamese standards and pollution indices ii to specify factors for interpreting the temporal variability in surface water quality iii to evaluate the effects of the tidal regime and seasonality on water quality and iv to visualize spatially the water quality variation along the river to identify pollution hotspots 2 materials 2 1 study area the study area a common border between the bac lieu and ca mau provinces in the ca mau peninsula vmd is located at a lower part of the ganh hao river fig 1a the river is influenced significantly by the tidal regimes of the east and west seas inundated twice daily at various tidal amplitudes the east sea is characterized by a mixed semi diurnal tidal cycle with a tidal range of up to 3 m and has two ebb and flood tides daily while the west sea has a diurnal tide with a smaller tidal range of 0 8 m albers and stolzenwald 2015 the weather is characterized by the east asian summer monsoon leading to a dry season from december to late april and a wet season from may to november the average annual rainfall is nearly 2000 mm with warm temperatures all year 20 c 35 c kontgis et al 2019 saline water is dominated in the study area due to the direct impact of the vietnamese west and east seas inundated twice daily at various tidal amplitudes it is one of four main rivers bringing seawater from the seas and receiving wastewater from anthropogenic activities in this region since economic growth in bac lieu and ca mau provinces has focused mainly on aquaculture practices therefore the discharge of untreated wastewater into the surface water has caused significant degradation of water quality over the last decades freshwater for agricultural practices in the eastern part of bac lieu province is mainly provided through the quan lo phung hiep canal that connects to the bassac river the main branch of the mekong river in vmd ngo dang et al 2016 however the seasonal dams and sluices that prevent seawater intrusion have prevented fresh water from reaching the study area during the rainy season rainfall runoff is the major source of freshwater for the river the predominant land use in the study area is mostly characterized by intensive advanced intensive extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture activities particularly the dong hai district of the bac lieu province has a natural area of 57 008 74 ha of which shrimp culture obtained for 39 387 5 ha the district consists of 11 communes of which three communes e g dinh thanh an trach and an phuc commune accounted for 11 095 12 ha used for shrimp farms dhpc 2019 2020 while the dam doi district of the ca mau province includes 42 821 2 ha out of 78 204 04 ha of natural area utilized for the shrimp farms the district has 15 communes of which six communes e g tan trung ta an khuong ta an khuong dong ta an khuong nam tan duc and tan thuan commune obtained for 23144 89 ha used for aquaculture practices ddpc 2019 2020 the extensive and improved extensive systems are understood to have a relatively low density of shrimp and rely mainly on natural feeds but a small amount of organic fertilizers is sometimes supplemented into ponds while a greater input of fertilizers and supplemental feeds is added to the intensive and advanced intensive systems with a high density of shrimp thi et al 2011 pollutants from anthropogenic activities in the upstream region and along the ganh hao river have been reported to have insignificant effects on the study area dowrm 2017 therefore changes in water quality are understood to be mainly associated with aquaculture practices along the river reach which made the primary contributions to the receiving waters in the study area 2 2 sample collection and analytical procedures 2 2 1 sample collection samples were collected consecutively during the ebb and flood tides in the dry march 22 2019 and wet september 5 2019 seasons at 25 observed sites 0 5 km apart fig 1b to obtain representative data for the study area the sampling campaigns were performed consecutively during ebb and flood tides starting from downstream to the upstream boundary of the river towards landward therefore the sample collection was conducted in all tidal phases the sampling site locations were determined using satellite images and information from interviews with the local authorities the selected sites were then certified in situ by investigating the actual land use and discovering potential disturbing factors e g presence of shrimp farms or land use mixtures water samples were collected using a boat which traveled from the lower boundary to the upper boundary of the river sampling avoided closely riverbanks where stagnation and direct wastewater discharges could lead to unrepresentative water samples samples for nutrients and organic component analyses were collected at a depth of 30 cm below the water surface against the water flow direction to prevent the intrusion of floating debris following the guidelines of the ministry of natural resources and environment monre 2018 samples for the analysis of heavy metals were collected using vandorn equipment at three different depths at each sampling site high density polyethylene hdpe bottles 1 l were prewashed with 10 hno3 and repeatedly rinsed with distilled water to avoid contamination from metal and non metal ions before sampling the sample bottles were labeled and rinsed three times with river water for the measurement of heavy metal concentrations 65 hno3 was added to each sample immediately to bring the ph to 2 to prevent metal adsorption onto the walls of the bottle immediately after sampling the bottles were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory apha 1999 sediment samples were collected at the same sampling sites as the water samples using a peterson grab from the sediment surface to the depth of 10 cm before sampling polyethylene bags were washed with a 10 hno3 solution and rinsed with distilled water each sample had a weight of 2 3 kg and was placed in one of the pre cleaned polyethylene bags to avoid exposure to light samples were brought to the laboratory where they were dried at room temperature before being crushed and sieved 0 5 mm mesh to a dry weight of 0 5 1 kg 2 2 2 analytical procedures for the surface water samples the temperature electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do salinity and total dissolved solids tds were measured in situ using a handy lab 680 fk instrument si analytics gmbh germany ammonium nitrogen n nh4 nitrite nitrogen n no2 nitrate nitrogen n no3 phosphate phosphorus p po4 3 and total phosphorus tp were measured using the spectrometric method tcvn 6179 1 1996 iso 7150 1 1984 smeww 4500 no2 b 2017 smeww 4500 no3 e 2017 smeww 4500 p e 2017 and smeww 4500 p b e 2017 at wavelengths of 600 nm 540 nm 540

respectively for the analysis of total nitrogen tn tcvn 6638 2000 iso 10048 1991 devarda s alloy was used to reduce nitrogen compounds to ammonium nitrogen was subsequently transferred to ammonium sulfate in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid containing a high content of potassium sulfate to raise the boiling point of the mixture in the presence of copper as a catalyst ammonia was released from the mixture and collected in a flask in the presence of a boric solution ammonium was measured by titration with boric acid the chemical oxygen demand cod smeww 5220 c 2017 of the sample was determined by oxidizing the organic substances using a boiling mixture of chromic and sulfuric acids then the samples were refluxed in a strong acid solution with a known excess of potassium dichromate after digestion the remaining excess of potassium dichromate was titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate to determine the amount of reacted potassium dichromate and the oxidizing agent was computed in terms of the oxygen equivalent saline water samples were added mercuric sulfate to reduce chloride cl below 2000 mg l 1 hgso4 cl 10 1 for the analysis of the total suspended solids tss content smeww 2540 d 2017 well mixed samples were filtered through filters with a mesh size of 0 40 0 45 µm the residue on each filter was dried to a constant weight at 103 105 c the tss content was detected as an increase in filter weight for the sediment samples the ec and ph values were detected in situ using an hi 8633 hanna instrument multi range conductivity meters usa and an hi 99121 hanna instrument soil ph test kit usa respectively the total organic carbon toc content was analyzed using the wet combustion method described by walkley and black 1934 arsenic as copper cu lead pb and zinc zn concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes thermo icap 6000 thermo scientific fl usa 2 2 3 quality assurance and quality control quality assurance qa and quality control qc were performed using standard samples certified reference materials crms for all parameters the crm sample was analyzed seven times the same procedure as the real samples the results of the crms were calculated as the mean and standard deviation sd which were then used to plot a graph for qc purposes the qa was performed by checking the results if the results were in the range of 2 sd to 2 sd the analysis procedures and results were considered to be accurate and reliable 2 3 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 20 0 geographical analyses were conducted using the quantum geographic information system qgis version 3 12 2 3 1 water and sediment quality assessment the datasets of surface water and sediment quality parameters were analyzed using descriptive statistics mean max min and standard deviation as the replication was not met for statistical analysis the spatial variabilities of water quality parameters were compared with the surface water quality guidelines of vietnam monre 2015 and the us epa epa 2001 sediment quality parameters were compared with the vietnamese guidelines monre 2017 and with the following pollution indices 2 3 2 geoaccumulation index the deterioration of the bottom sediment quality with respect to metal concentrations was assessed based on the geo accumulation i geo index which is expressed as follows muller 1969 1 i geo log2 cn 1 5 bn where cn and bn are the measured concentration and the geochemical background concentration of metal n respectively factor 1 5 is used to account for possible variations in the background data due to lithological changes the i geo values were classified into seven grades as follows i geo 0 grade 0 unpolluted 0 i geo 1 grade 1 slightly polluted 1 i geo 2 grade 2 moderately polluted 2 i geo 3 grade 3 moderately severely polluted 3 i geo 4 grade 4 severely polluted 4 i geo 5 grade 5 severely extremely polluted i geo 5 grade 6 extremely polluted 2 3 3 contamination factor the pollution load of the sediment for heavy metals was assessed using the contamination factor cf which can be categorized into four grades for monitoring the contamination of a single metal over the study period as follows low degree cf 1 moderate degree 1 cf 3 substantial degree 3 cf 6 and very high degree cf 6 the cf is expressed as follows hakanson 1980 2 cf measured metal content background content of the same metal 2 3 4 pollution load index the pollution load index pli was used to determine the mutual pollution effect at different sites the overall toxicity status of each sampling site was then evaluated based on the pli a pli of 0 indicates excellence while a pli of 1 implies the presence of only baseline levels of pollutants a pli of 1 indicates the progressive contamination of the site and estuarine quality the pli is expressed as the nth root of the multiplications of the contents as cf metals as follows tomlinson et al 1980 3 pli cf 1 cf 2 cf 3 cfn n in this research the global mean heavy metal contents were taken as cu 45 µg g 1 as 13 µg g 1 pb 20 µg g 1 and zn 95 µg g 1 turekian and wedepohl 1961 2 3 5 temporal variabilities of surface water quality the surface water dataset for the 25 sampling sites included water quality parameters measured on march 22 2019 dry season and september 5 2019 wet season the water quality data of the two seasons were statistically compared significance level of 5 using the non parametric mann whitney u test because the data did not have a normal distribution determined by the shapiro wilk test the differences in water quality were visualized by box diagrams for the 14 representative parameters due to the low heavy metal concentrations at most sampling sites the variabilities of water quality impacted by the tidal regime were assessed based on measurements at 25 observed sites which were divided into two groups one representing the flood tide and the other representing the ebb tide the mann whitney u test was performed to observe the influence of tides on the selected water quality parameters 2 3 6 identification of source pollution the interpreting factors of temporal variations in water quality were determined using principal component analysis pca for this analysis the initial dataset of all 25 sampling sites comprising mean values for all parameters was reduced to satisfy the criteria for the test bartlett test of sphericity and kaiser meyer olkin first the as cu pb and zn data were removed because they were almost undetectable at the observed sites and had low variabilities second n nh4 was distributed in two components resulting in a significant reduction in the convergence of other components therefore this parameter was excluded as well therefore the reduced dataset included temperature ec tds tss ph cod salinity n no2 n no3 tn p po4 3 and tp and was further rotated by a varimax with kaiser normalization to indicate the loadings of the principal components 2 3 7 water quality maps water quality maps were developed using logistic regression models based on land use to identify variables influencing two groups of land use rates for extensive and improved extensive culture systems in dam doi and dong hai districts the water quality parameters including respectively ec tss tp n no2 in the dry season and ph ec n no2 tp in the wet season were selected for the highly correct rate of classification with land use as a representative of extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture see also supplementary material s1 1 the seasonal mean values of parameters at sampling sites 18 19 20 21 22 24 and 25 in the dry season and 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 and 25 in the wet season were used to develop the water quality maps because of the high probability of classification based on the model analysis the land use map for 2019 that was employed for this analysis only covered parts of the study area therefore only the water quality maps of these observed sites are illustrated the land use types of intensive and advanced intensive culture activities were not the main factor affecting the alteration of surface water quality along the river reach the statistical analysis kruskal wallis with a significance level of 5 indicated that differences among the variables were apparent in the wet season compared with the dry season however the confidence intervals for the mean values were not ordered among the land use groups this was because the area used for extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture was much greater than that of intensive and advanced intensive culture the water quality maps were produced using the inverse distance weighted idw method integrated with the qgis software and revealed seasonal changes in water quality for the selected parameters the idw method is based on estimating interpolation whereby unknown values are calculated by a linear set of values at identified points the method assumes that each input point has a local impact reduction with increasing distance and that the surfaces are generated by establishing an adjacent search of points and weighting them by a power function ahmed et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variations of water and sediment quality 3 1 1 surface water quality table 1 indicates the spatial fluctuations of the selected water quality parameters among the observed sites during the dry and wet seasons there was little variation in water temperature among the sampling sites in each season because the sites were affected by similar weather conditions in addition tropical estuaries have a more stable temperature than temperate estuaries fatema et al 2015 the measured ph values also varied little spatially in both seasons which can be explained by the direct effect of seawater on the tidal cycle of the east sea hinga 2002 reported that seawater not only greatly influenced ph levels but also had alkaline properties ph 7 5 8 4 overall the changes in ph did not exceed the allowable standards for water quality elevated values of ec tds and salinity were measured at all observed sites in both seasons although those in the wet season were considerably lower than those in the dry season the high ec and tds values probably corresponded to the elevated salinity levels owing to the direct impact of the tidal regime of the east sea moreover elevated ec values depend greatly on temperature and aquaculture practices turcios and papenbrock 2014 in particular an elevated water temperature has a strong influence on ec and causes ions to move more quickly in solution resulting in a high tds value due to the close relationship between ec and tds rusydi 2018 the pollution caused by aquaculture activities probably contributed slightly to an increase in the ec and tds values which showed minor variations among the observed sites in both seasons the ec tds and salinity values met the water quality conditions for marine aquatic life weber and duffy 2007 relatively low do concentrations were measured at most sampling sites while substantially elevated cod levels were observed at all sites in both seasons the spatial variabilities of the do and cod levels were insignificant in both seasons high tss values were detected at most sites and were approximately 2 3 times greater than the permissible water quality standard this could be explained by the intensive indirect and direct impacts of aquaculture related discharges moreover strong flow velocities in the coastal area influenced by the tidal regime were probably caused by high levels of tss peak values of tss were also observed at some sampling sites in the lower river reach because an extreme current flow impacted by semi diurnal regimes prevented the normal upstream transport of suspended solids resulting in the accumulation of high tss in the lower area augustijn and fares 2011 the relatively low do and elevated cod levels among the investigated sites in both seasons suggest that the water quality in the study area was contaminated by organic substances this could relate to intensive water use as well as waste discharges from aquaculture practices which were observed during the field campaign in addition relatively low do concentrations could also be associated with the high salinity values which may have reduced the capacity of the water to hold do deacutis 2016 although some sampling sites had do concentrations below the permissible standard all sites had cod values that exceeded the respective guideline in both seasons the concentrations of different n species were generally low compared with the water quality standards despite the direct effluent discharges of the nearby extensive and intensive shrimp culture practices the low nutrient contents could be explained by the low redox condition or do concentration in the water column leading to the dominance of nitrification processes within the n patterns additionally the presence of no3 could be changed into other forms such as n2o or n2 due to the favorable conditions supporting the process of denitrification the tidal regime also played an important role in diluting effluents containing nutrients released by aquaculture practices along the river the low n nh4 concentration was likely due to the effect of an alkaline water ph 7 0 at most sites previous studies körner et al 2001 revealed that nh4 depends greatly on ph and is promoted in an acidic water environment ph 7 0 other studies also reported that the n contents in natural water were typically within a small range and that lower values were found in coastal seawater wilbers et al 2014 however spatial variations in n no2 and n nh4 which varied significantly in both seasons and exceeded the corresponding standards were observed at several sites due to the indirect and direct effects of effluent discharges during the field surveys these spatial variations could also be due to the catchment features tabayashi and koba 2011 the p po4 3 concentration was significantly lower than the water quality guidelines and was considerably lower than the concentrations of different n species at the same sampling sites in both seasons this is because p can be easily absorbed by a high amount of suspended solids as stated by li and zuo 2020 p is in a soluble state in surface water and is greatly affected by suspended solids through adsorption thus leading to low availability of p in the aquatic environment although there were no water quality guidelines for tn and tp the findings showed that the range of values of tn 0 84 4 76 mg l 1 and tp 0 01 2 97 mg l 1 could occur plankton blooms in the water column claude and green 2002 reported that loads of tn and tp ranging from 0 1 mg l 1 to 0 75 mg l 1 and 0 001 mg l 1 to 0 1 mg l 1 respectively could lead to plankton blooms in coastal waters the heavy metal concentrations were hardly detected at all sampling sites with some being substantially lower than the water quality guidelines as observed during the field surveys the studied area has been strongly influenced by aquaculture practices which may introduce metal loid s e g in effluent into the surface water nevertheless the low metal concentrations could be associated with physicochemical processes occurring in the aquatic environment which would lower the metal concentrations the principal processes governing the distributions of different soluble forms of metals are dilution dispersion sedimentation and absorption due to high tss contents as well as the physicochemical properties of water e g ph temperature and dissolved ions namieśnik and rabajczyk 2010 additionally the study area is located in an inland area 6 km from the river estuary the river seawater interaction under the strong effect of the tidal regime produces a rotational circulation enlarging the capacity of pollutant deposition originating from the inland area within the estuary this has been confirmed by the previous studies in coastal regions nga 2010 wilbers et al 2014 3 1 2 sediment quality table 2 provides information on the spatial variations of the physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents of the river sediment at the observed sites in both seasons the ph values were slightly acidic and varied little among the observed sites in both seasons the ph values of sediment were lower than those measured in the surface water at the same sites possibly due to the decomposition of deposited organic substances derived from aquaculture practices a low ph value in sediment could be associated with the presence of humic acid formed from decaying organic substances and deposits of acid sulfate soils zhao et al 2017 high ec levels that varied considerably among the observed sites were measured in both seasons these elevated ec values were mainly associated with seawater intrusion due to the direct effects of the tidal cycle of the east sea sidi et al 2015 found that a strong positive correlation and exchange capacity among cations were remarkably affected by the influence of seawater leading to elevated ec values in sediment in situ measurement could also have been a factor resulting in the high ec values malvankar et al 2014 reported that direct conductivity measurements in reduced sediments included the ionic contribution to ec and prevented a loss of conductivity due to the air oxidation process the results showed that the toc content was relatively low despite the influence of aquaculture derived inputs this could relate to the strong impacts of the hydrodynamics and sediment components in the ganh hao river liu et al 2015 considered that sediment dispersion depended considerably on tidal flow whereby a high toc content would be beneficial to sedimentary burial within a weak hydrodynamic environment in addition the sediments along the river are primarily clay silt fine sand and green silt with many shells and had the lowest concentrations of organic substances oanh 2012 overall the variation of the toc content was within the normal range of 1 2 5 2 reported for marine sediments carrasco et al 2003 the metal loads were much lower than the respective guidelines and showed a nonsignificant variability among the investigated sites this could be explained by the effects of a low ph low toc contents high salinity and intense hydrodynamics which could cause low metal contents in the bottom sediment the ph of sediment was slightly acidic at all sites in both seasons which could drive the release of metals into the water column yang et al 2006 reported that metals were released from sediments at a ph of 6 0 this is because h ions compete with the absorbed metal ions in sediment particles driving the desorption of metals the relatively low toc loads could also explain the low metal contents of the sediment samples an increase in metal content binding to organic substances in the sediment was probably proportional to an elevated content of organic substances owing to the high mobility of metals and their strong affinity for organic matter baran et al 2019 moreover high salinity and ec levels were additional factors leading to the low metal contents of sediment samples the total adsorption of metals would have decreased with increasing salinity and ec due to the stimulated mobility and competition among heavy metals and other cations gijs et al 2008 a close relationship was also found in the exchange mechanism of metal species between the sediments and the water column whereby the metal speciation released by sediment dynamics was absorbed by the organic substances in the water and then settled to the bottom sediments jiao et al 2018 in both seasons minor or undetectable metal presence was found this could be due to the significant impacts of the tidal hydrodynamics the metal species released from the sediment would have absorbed particles in the water moving seaward thus accumulating high loads in the estuary botté et al 2010 has found that the distribution of metal loads in sediments increased progressively from the inland area to the estuarine area this relates to the mixing of seawater with polluted sediments carried by rivers which significantly affects the deposition of pollutants in estuaries as reported by tho 2007 and nga 2010 this understanding suggests a gradual increase in the metal contents from the landward area to the estuaries and tidal mudflats of the vmd the results of the quantitative indices with respect to metal loid contamination of the sediments in the study area are presented in table 3 the calculated pli values were 1 suggesting that the river sediments were not contaminated by metals a higher pli indicates sediment contamination due to a major contribution of metals from anthropogenic sources islam et al 2015 tiankao and chotpantarat 2018 the cf values for all metals except as were 1 implying a low degree of contamination in both seasons at several sites in the dry season as was at a level corresponding to a moderate degree of pollution 1 cf 3 generally the cf values in the dry season were ranked as as pb zn cu while those in the wet season were ranked as pb zn as cu the i geo values were negative for as cu pb and zn indicating a noncontaminated status of the sediment and background levels of these metals the i geo values in the dry season were ranked as cu zn pb as while those in the wet season were ranked as cu as zn pb 3 2 temporal fluctuations of water quality 3 2 1 tidal movements surface water along the ganh hao river is strongly affected by irregular semi diurnal tides from the east and west seas these cause the water level to change and influence the spatial variation of water quality due to fluctuations in the dilution of pollutants fig 2 shows that ec values were observed during ebb tide higher than ec values during the flood tide similar results were found for temperature ph tds salinity do and cod but not for the tss content which was higher during the flood tide than during the ebb tide a statistically significant difference was found between the ebb and flood tides with respect to temperature tds do cod and salinity p 0 05 while nonsignificant differences were found for ph ec and tss p 0 05 hence the changes in temperature tds do cod and salinity could be explained by the variation in the tidal regime while the changes in ph ec and tss values were probably associated with other factors the impacts of ebb and flood tides also resulted in various changes in the n and p concentrations n no2 and n nh4 concentrations were statistically higher during the ebb tide than during the flood tide p 0 05 higher n no3 tn p po4 3 and tp concentrations occurred during the flood tide than during the ebb tide although only the tn and p po4 3 concentrations were statistically higher p 0 05 davies and ugwumba 2013 also reported that the effect of tides caused significant alterations in nutrient patterns the author found that riverine inputs of pollutants during the ebb tide resulted in high nutrient concentrations while lower nutrient concentrations during the flood tide were associated with river water seawater mixing our findings are also consistent with those of other studies that observed differences in pollutant concentrations between ebb and flood tides fatema et al 2015 purnaini and purwono 2018 3 2 2 seasonality fig 3 shows that the temperature ph ec tds and salinity values were significantly higher during the dry season compared with the wet season p 0 05 while the tss content was not significantly higher during the dry season p 0 05 zhang et al 2010 found that the temperature of coastal waters was governed primarily by solar radiation and tidal flow in the vmd the highest solar radiation usually occurs during the dry season as a result this could explain that the dry season s increase in water temperature was higher than the rainy season s temperature moreover the freshwater input in the dry season is generally lower than that in the rainy season causing high water temperature in the dry season a slight decrease in the ph of surface water was observed during the wet season which may have related to higher runoff rates from acidic soils during the early part of the wet season as well as the decomposition of nutrient residues and organic substances discharged by aquaculture practices the ec tds and salinity values exhibited similar patterns with substantially higher levels in the dry season than in the wet season the elevated tds content was due to dissolved salts and agricultural runoff korey 2010 therefore the impacts of seawater and aquaculture practices coupled with low dilution from rainfall probably led to high tds contents during the dry season the level of ec 34 78 ms cm 1 and salinity 22 03 in the dry season was higher than in the rainy season 11 98 ms cm 1 and 6 88 respectively table 1 this could be because the total rainfall as input freshwater for ganh hao river during the campaign field in the dry season 19 5 mm was much lower than in the rainy season 296 1 mm leading to salinity intrusion in the dry season donre 2019 furthermore in this study the river flow data was measured in different seasons and the average water discharge in the rainy season 571 84 m3 s is lower than that in the dry season 842 09 m3 s which mainly brings seawater from the seas through the inland abdullah et al 2018 revealed that a high degree of salinity was closely linked with tds ec and salinity levels the tss concentration was greater in the dry season than in the wet season this could be due to low water levels and high flow velocities in the dry season 842 09 m3 s which caused a continuous disturbance and soil erosion in addition there was no rainfall such as freshwater input in the study area during the sampling period in the wet season however the variability of the tss concentration was statistically independent of the season p 0 05 the median do concentration varied little and was not significantly different between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 while the median cod value was significantly higher during the dry season p 0 05 the elevated cod during the dry season may be ascribed to the reduction of the water column coupled with accumulated organic and inorganic substances released by aquaculture activities along the river a similar pattern was observed by islam et al 2015 who reported that low river flows during the dry season led to a high cod the concentration of nitrogenous patterns was significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season p 0 05 various chemicals and residual feeds are added to aquaculture ponds with water being discharged to areas along the river thus aquaculture activities were probably responsible for the elevated nutrient contents during the wet season on the contrary higher p po4 3 and tp concentrations were observed in the dry season in comparison to the wet season with only slight variations in both seasons in the aquatic environment tss strongly affects p species through adsorption however the elevated p po4 3 tp and tss contents were proportional during the dry season there was a nonsignificant difference in the p po4 3 and tp concentrations between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 3 2 3 identification of pollutant sources fig 4 shows that three components with eigenvalues of 1 were extracted based on the pca which accounted for approximately 79 84 of the total variance of the water quality deterioration with respect to the selected parameters the first component explained 53 64 of the total variance and had positive high loadings for temperature ph ec tds salinity and cod but negative loadings for n no2 and n no3 this component was explained as pollution related to physicochemical properties and organic matter elevated loading for ec tds salinity and cod were probably primarily influenced by the tidal cycle and untreated wastewater discharges from shrimp culture activities both tds and ec are indicators of salinity and seawater intrusion in coastal areas a high water temperature can promote a higher dissolved ion content in addition tds includes inorganic salts and minor quantities of organic substances in water thus aquaculture practices cannot be ignored as a contributor to the tds content in the study area dauda et al 2019 high ph levels could be due to seawater intrusion moving inland between the dry and wet seasons phung et al 2015 found that generally low ph values in coastal regions were due to the influence of chemicals applied during farm operations as well as the formation of organic acids through the decomposition of organic compounds hence the high ph levels in the present research may have originated from high salinity while untreated wastewater discharges from shrimp farms could explain the elevated cod content pollution sources derived from culture systems include solid waste comprising uneaten feed and fecal droppings and dissolved waste associated with food metabolism or decomposition products solid waste material can contribute to an increased tss content and increased n species dauda et al 2019 ebeling et al 2010 reported that the discharge of accumulated solid waste associated with bacterial activity was the main cause of an increased cod content of the water column negative high loadings for n no2 and n no3 in both seasons could be related to the high salinity levels therefore low content and narrow variation of n compounds in coastal regions were due to the effects of elevated salinity levels the second component accounted for 18 43 of the total variance and included positive high loadings for tss and tp and a moderate loading for tn this component was considered to correspond to the deterioration of water quality with respect to sources of suspended solids and nutrients a large amount of solid waste generated by aquaculture practices along with strong currents on the coast that disturb settled particles could explain the high tss content the tp and tn levels in the surface water of the river were likely associated with discharges from shrimp farms products of n and p are not only representative of nutrient pollution but are also the major components of proteins found in a variety of aquatic organisms therefore elevated protein feed consists of high amounts of n and p it has been estimated that approximately 20 30 of the n and p added to feeds is released to the nearby environment kawasaki et al 2016 the third component represented pollution corresponding to do consumption this component accounted for 7 77 of the total variance and consisted of a positive loading for do and small negative loading for p po4 3 low do concentration in receiving water bodies can be associated with effluent discharges with a high content of organic matter which consumes a significant amount of oxygen through decomposition processes moreover the decreased do concentration was likely due to the relatively high temperatures during both seasons claude and green 2002 the small negative loading for p po4 3 suggests a slight effect of p on the surface water of the river because of its prompt absorption by aquatic plants or suspended substances 4 water quality map the temporal variation in water quality was found to be mainly related to land use for extensive and improved extensive culture systems based on this relationship logistic regression models were developed to specify the variables selected quality parameters exhibiting a temporally high rate of classification percentage correct with land use the regression models of the water quality patterns were utilized to generate water quality maps for the sites with a high probability of classification the maps were based on the seasonal mean contents of pollutants as determined from the water samples for both seasons fig 5 indicates that the water quality parameters were associated with the land use type in the study area mainly that of extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture systems along the river the elevated tp concentrations were visualized mainly at the middle and lower parts of the river in the dry season while the highest tp concentrations were visible at the upper and lower parts of the river in the wet season n no2 concentrations were high in areas far away from the upstream parts of the river in the wet season but they were found high concentrations at the upper and lower areas of river reach in the dry season lower tp concentrations during the dry season compared with the wet season were associated with elevated tss contents because of the potential absorption of available p to suspended solids see also supplementary material s1 1 the presence of n no2 related to land use in both seasons could be explained by the low do concentration of surface water due to the input of nutrients and organic pollutants from shrimp culture activities as an intermediate product in the n cycle n no2 was found at relatively low concentrations and the available form of n no2 was involved in the influence of do on the nitrification process in the water column pajares and ramos 2019 the ec values differed between the two seasons and reduced gradually from the upstream areas to the downstream parts of the river in the wet season compared with the dry season however the spatial differences in the ec values were relatively small over the entire area the higher ec values could be explained by the direct impact of aquaculture practices along with the tidal cycle of the east sea in addition ph was also found to relate to land use and could be explained by the impacts of effluent discharges from shrimp farms and runoff from acidic soils in the wet season see also supplementary material s1 1 trai et al 2007 found that higher pollutant concentrations were discharged by intensive shrimp culture in comparison to extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture practices in interlaced shrimp farms however our logistic model analysis suggested that extensive and improved extensive shrimp farms were very relevant to the reduced surface water quality of the river this was because a larger area of land is utilized for extensive and improved extensive shrimp culture systems in comparison to that used for intensive and advanced intensive shrimp farms this coupled with the fertilizers and chemicals used for preparing the ponds and supplemental feeds during stocking stages were specified as the main contributors to the water quality deterioration all the maps showed a relatively low diffusion of pollutants among the investigated sites partly because the sampling was carried out near the peak of the tide leading to reduced transport of contaminants moreover during the field surveys it was observed that farmers discharged wastewater from the shrimp ponds to the receiving water of the sampling sites overall the findings of this research can assist policymakers in identifying pollution hotspots and developing water resources management strategies furthermore environmental practitioners can benefit from the water quality maps because they are easier to understand than data tables and statistical model analyses wilbers et al 2014 also showed the benefit of using regression model coupling with gis based maps to identify hot spot areas of pollution at main waterways in the vmd that could support water supply companies to specify optimal areas for water extraction and develop water management strategies for policymakers in addition the findings revealed that surface water quality was impacted by various tidal regimes seasonality and areas of the watershed however the surface water quality standard has only focused on pollution sources in general the results of this study are the scientific basis for the local policy makers to develop regulations or strategies to manage better surface water quality furthermore the results were not only the local interest but also regional attention where surface water quality has been impacted considerably by natural and anthropogenic activities 5 conclusions the ganh hao river s surface water was heavily used by the locals for their daily needs surface water quality was generally poor especially when compared to guidelines and varied in terms of space and time because of the extensive direct use of surface water and contamination of the river proper water management strategies for different tidal regimes and areas of the watershed should be established to monitor water quality throughout time moreover to assess the water quality status of the region sampling is carried out not only in the river and aquaculture ponds but also in other types of land use based on the water quality maps pollution hotspots could be identified to recommend water extraction areas to meet the safe water requirements of local communities the findings revealed that land use with extensive and improved extensive shrimp systems was primarily associated with sources of pollutants influencing river water quality degradation implying that the extraction of surface water within these areas could pose future risks the research results could suggest that policy makers should consider thoroughly establishing regulations or guidelines of areas of shrimp systems on surface water quality under the different factors of influence to manage effectively surface water resources credit authorship contribution statement le van muoi data curation investigation methodology visualization writing original

7967,study region the varaždin alluvial aquifer located in the drava river valley study focus the study area is characterized by agricultural activity which raised concerns due to the high nitrate concentration in groundwater the present study aims to evaluate future nitrate concentrations in groundwater using the numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling the regional model was generated in gms software using the modflow code for steady state groundwater flow model and mt3dms code for nitrate transport model advective dispersive transport was simulated without a chemical retardation process the calibrated model was used to investigate the evolution of groundwater nitrate concentrations for the next 20 years under four scenarios a current nitrate input b zero input from wastewater c agricultural input reduced by 50 d input from natural vegetation and surface water new hydrological insights for the region the scenario analysis demonstrated that reducing the nitrate input from agricultural areas yields a considerable reduction of nitrate in groundwater while the impact of wastewater is negligible neither of the scenarios reached concentrations below threshold value of 50 mg l for the entire aquifer in the next 20 years the nitrate concentration in the northern part of the aquifer will remain low mainly due to the dilution from river the central part of the aquifer is highly dependent on changing the on ground nitrate concentration showing inertia regarding the nitrate attenuation in groundwater keywords numerical modeling nitrate transport water budget varaždin alluvial aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of drinking water in croatia groundwater that can meet the water supply needs of the region or large cities in terms of quantity and quality and ensure significant economic and social development is recognized as strategic groundwater resource in croatia official gazette 91 08 2021 the varaždin aquifer is a part of strategic groundwater resources ensuring water for agriculture industry and domestic consumption for approximately 170 000 inhabitants of the varaždin county in nw croatia long term agricultural activity industry and population growth have considerably affected the groundwater quality regarding nitrate concentration in the varaždin aquifer which raised concerns and increased the public interest in the groundwater protection nitrate is identified as one of the most common contaminants of groundwater worldwide lee et al 2006 almasri 2007 rivett et al 2007 high nitrate concentrations in groundwater present a serious environmental issue due to deterioration of groundwater quality and eutrophication of surface waters also nitrate ingestion can have negative impact on human health causing various diseases such as gastric cancer non hodgkin s lymphoma and methemoglobinemia walton 1951 winneberger 1982 who 1985 in response to nitrate contamination the european union 98 83 ec 1998 and world health organization who 2004 have established the maximum contaminant level mcl of 50 mg l no3 in drinking water moreover nitrates represent one of the two groundwater quality standards according to the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec 2006 due to major problems with nitrate contamination in groundwater from agricultural sources the european union adopted the nitrate directive 91 676 eec 1991 the document which promotes the use of good agricultural practices and recommends measures to reduce nitrate contamination in addition to the application of fertilizers and manure in agriculture nitrate in groundwater may derive from other anthropogenic sources e g wastewater from septic tanks and sewage system industrial sites and landfills wakida and lerner 2005 almasri 2007 nitrate in groundwater also originates from natural sources such as rocks soil and atmospheric nitrate deposition williams et al 1998 nitrogen n is a vital nutrient to enhance plant growth once in the soil it is transformed through major process of fixation assimilation ammonification nitrification and denitrification dinitrogen gas is first fixed to ammonia which is assimilated into organic nitrogen followed by the degradation of organic nitrogen ammonification which releases a molecule of ammonia nitrification occurs under aerobic conditions in presence of the nitrifying bacteria formed nitrate is partially up taken by plants and the remains are leached to the water table due to its negative charge nitrate is not likely to bind to the aquifer matrix by adsorption based on the literature review nitrate is quite mobile in groundwater and the distribution coefficient which represents adsorption is essentially zero shamrukh et al 2001 krupka et al 2004 seo and lee 2005 conversely ammonium is a cation and tends to adsorb to the soil particles resulting that most of the nitrogen that transports through the soil into the groundwater is in the form of nitrate denitrification is considered as the main natural process attenuating nitrate concentration in groundwater otero et al 2009 jahangir et al 2013 puig et al 2017 it is a multi step process and it can occur when anaerobic conditions exist with the presence of denitrifying bacteria and the dissolved organic carbon otero et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 rivett et al 2008 nitrate investigation presents a complex task because nitrogen transformation processes occur in three zones of interest soil unsaturated zone and saturated zone according to almasri 2007 spatio temporal occurrence of nitrate in groundwater depends on on ground nitrogen loading soil characteristics and groundwater properties groundwater flow and solute transport modeling has become an essential tool for studying spatio temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater the modeling framework most commonly relies on either utilizing lumped models e g lpms in hajhamad and almasri 2009 e hype in hansen et al 2018 biche in surdyk et al 2021 or spatially distributed models e g integrating the modflow code for the simulation of the groundwater flow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms code for the simulation of nitrate transport zheng and wang 1999 numerous regional studies have been conducted by combining modflow and mt3dms codes as the problem with nitrate contamination of groundwater occurs worldwide molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 used modflow and mt3dms to simulate groundwater flow and nitrate transport under steady state conditions in central brittany france the scenario analysis indicated that a significant decrease of stream nitrate concentration can be expected following a decrease in nitrate leaching along the hillslope almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 coupled a soil model with the modflow and mt3d code to model the nitrate contamination in an agricultural watershed in washington state and explored different protection alternatives to reduce the nitrate contamination in groundwater jiang and somers 2008 examined nitrate contamination in groundwater on the eastern coast of canada the groundwater flow and transport model results showed that it would take several years to reduce the nitrate concentration in the shallow portion of the aquifer and several decades or more to restore water quality in the deeper portions of the aquifer psarropoulou and karatzas 2014 developed the nitrate transport model of the coastal aquifer in greece based on a previously established transient groundwater flow model the authors observed seasonal variations in nitrate concentrations and concluded that approach coupling a transient groundwater flow model with a simple transport model yielded acceptable results zhang and hiscock 2016 used groundwater flow modflow and mass transport modeling mt3dms to investigate the response of groundwater nitrate concentration to different land use change scenarios in the britain s second largest aquifer based on the simulation results the greatest future decrease in nitrate concentration was associated with the replacement of agricultural land with forest this paper is part of a broader study being conducted in varaždin region with the aim of investigating the origin fate and the transport of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer the findings of this study help to better understand the spatio temporal distribution of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer by developing a numerical groundwater flow and nitrate transport model a regional groundwater flow and transport model was developed for the study area using modflow and mt3dms codes which are an integral part of the software package groundwater modeling system gms aquaveo 2018 processes in the soil and unsaturated zone were not modeled within this paper prior to the modeling analysis was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of denitrification process and the main transport processes were identified the nitrate transport was simulated using advection dispersion equation without retardation due to denitrification the main research objectives of the modeling were to 1 understand the groundwater flow paths and define water budget 2 accurately simulate nitrate concentrations in the groundwater for the period 2007 2020 3 predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations for different scenarios based on the changes in on ground nitrate input 4 identify the limitations of using the model for management strategies and suggest future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out in the drava river valley within the varaždin aquifer system located in varaždin region in nw croatia fig 1 the aquifer represents an important source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes in the varaždin area the study site occupies an area of about 200 km2 and was selected as the groundwater flow and transport model domain due to the well defined boundary conditions and the fact that this area has been reported to be greatly affected by high nitrate concentrations the climate of the study area is classified as a warm temperate climate in the cfb group according to the köppen geiger classification system nimac and perčec tadić 2016 with annual mean temperature of 10 6 c and annual mean precipitation of 832 mm zaninović et al 2008 the varaždin aquifer consists of quaternary alluvial deposits prelogović and velić 1988 mainly represented by gravel and sand with lenses and interbeds of silt and clay babić et al 1978 urumović et al 1990 the aquifer is thinnest in the nw part having thickness of less than 5 m and the thickest in the se part of the study area with thickness of 65 m in average marković et al 2020 the size of gravel and sand particles gets gradually smaller from the northwestern part downstream as a result of the decrease in energy of the drava river larva 2008 according to the conceptual model the aquifer system can be divided into three layers upper aquifer semipermeable interlayer and lower aquifer karlović et al 2021a both aquifers are hydraulically connected and the upper aquifer is in direct contact with the drava river the basement of the aquifer consists of very low permeable marl silt and clay hydrodynamically the varaždin aquifer is unconfined the covering layer of the aquifer is not continuous meaning there is a high infiltration potential favorable for nitrate leaching general regional groundwater flow direction is nw se aquifer is recharged naturally by surface water and by infiltration of precipitation groundwater discharge within the aquifer occurs through draining to the derivation channel and plitvica stream and groundwater abstraction at the wellfield vinokovšćak another water budget component that influences groundwater discharge but also recharge is irrigation the problem is that it cannot be measured because there is unregistered pumping for irrigation via small capacity domestic wells throughout the study area further details on the aquifer characteristics can be found in a recent study karlović et al 2021a the favorable climate flat terrain and available groundwater have enabled intensive agricultural practices resulting that majority of the study area is under agricultural land use fig 1 about 68 of the land can be attributed to agriculture by combining 3 classes non irrigated arable land complex cultivation patterns land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation from the corine land cover database clc 2018 urban and industrial areas occupy around 11 forests and shrub around 10 pastures around 7 and surface water around 3 the remaining 1 consists of several other land use types historically agricultural production was the main economic activity in the study area for many decades the problems with high nitrate concentrations in groundwater date back to the 1970s it is important to mention that the documented concentration of nitrate at wellfield varaždin in 1973 was only 4 4 mg l no3 grđan et al 1991 this value can be considered as natural nitrate concentration or the background value without anthropogenic influence after the construction of the varaždin hydroelectric power plant and the filling of the accumulation lake the natural state of groundwater was disturbed and groundwater levels rose followed by leaching of nitrates accumulated in the unsaturated aquifer zone from that point on the alluvial aquifer is characterized by high nitrate concentrations resulting in shutting down of the wellfield varaždin two active wellfields remain in the varaždin aquifer vinokovšćak a smaller wellfield located in the northeastern part of the study area fig 1 and bartolovec the main wellfield located downstream of the varaždin city outside the study area today major agricultural activities in the varaždin region include plantation of cabbage maize wheat and potato but also poultry and dairy farming agricultural production includes seasonal rotation of crop types within the agricultural fields fertilizers are applied throughout agricultural fields to enhance crop production accompanied with irrigation by sprinklers also manure from farms is being dumped in the field without any protection of leaching to groundwater the estimated nitrogen consumption on utilized agricultural land in 2012 for varaždin county is 7396 t n of which 65 is attributed to mineral fertilizers and 35 to organic fertilizers romić et al 2014 this n input is subject to different transformation processes and plant uptake in the soil zone and the rest of it leaches to groundwater as nitrate compared to the previous estimation of nitrogen consumption in 2000 mesić et al 2002 there is a drop in fertilizer consumption in 2012 of approximately 13 also there has been a decrease in agricultural surfaces in the past 10 15 years followed by an increase in the urban area by 12 jogun et al 2017 however the application of synthetic fertilizers and manure in agricultural production is still considered the main source of nitrate contamination in groundwater followed by wastewater from urban areas karlović et al 2021b 2 2 groundwater flow model a three dimensional groundwater flow model of the varaždin aquifer was constructed using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 within gms software interface under steady state conditions modflow solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation using finite difference method and cell centered approach the steady state groundwater flow equation can be expressed as 3 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z 0 where k x k y and k z are the hydraulic conductivity values in the x y and z directions l t 1 h is the value of the hydraulic head at any point in a three dimensional flow field l steady state conditions were defined based on the observation from karlović et al 2021a which suggested that surface water in the varaždin region i e the accumulation lake and the drava river governs the groundwater levels maintaining the quasi steady state during the long term period without significant oscillation in groundwater levels water levels on october 14 2013 were selected as representative medium groundwater conditions for period 2006 2020 head contour map for medium groundwater levels was constructed using kriging interpolation method and groundwater level data from 32 observation wells fig 2 the data were provided by the croatian meteorological and hydrological service the input data for the groundwater flow model include a detailed definition of geometry flow parameters and boundary conditions of the aquifer the model domain in the horizontal direction consist of 209 columns and 193 rows with 100 100 m and total number of active cells is 62 415 the vertical discretization of the model domain was based on the conceptual model by which the aquifer system is divided into three layers presenting hydrogeological units of quaternary sediments with different characteristics upper aquifer semipermeable interlayer and lower aquifer fig 3 impermeable layer was assumed for the bottom of the model according to the head contour map the varaždin aquifer has an inflow boundary from drava river and accumulation lake varaždin on the northwest and north no flow boundary on the west and south and an outflow boundary on the east of the aquifer system see fig 2 these boundaries were characterized in the model either as dirichlet or neumann boundary condition dirichlet boundary condition specifies the value of the head along the boundary while neumann boundary condition specifies the flux across the boundary anderson and woessner 2002 the drava river accumulation lake plitvica stream and derivation channel of hydropower plant varaždin were defined using the specified head package for modflow dirichlet the western and southern edge of the model was simulated as no flow boundary neumann the eastern boundary was defined using the specified flux package for modflow neumann based on the darcy s law the outflow from the varaždin aquifer on the east was estimated to be 55 000 m3 day for the upper aquifer layer and 2000 m3 day for the lower aquifer layer the spatial distribution of precipitation infiltration was derived from wetspass m model for the long term mean annual values karlović et al 2021a and was defined in modflow using recharge package neumann data on groundwater abstraction from the wellfield vinokovšćak was obtained from varaždin utility company varkom three pumping wells were simulated in the model using the well package of modflow neumann with total abstraction rate of 7847 m3 day measured on the october 14 2013 the flow parameters required for the model include hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient i e specific yield these input parameters have been assigned to each layer separately the initial values of hydraulic conductivity were obtained from former hydrogeological studies where pumping tests were performed related to the development of wellfields and for the construction of hydropower plant the hydraulic conductivity values based on the pumping test results at five different locations within the study area range from 147 to 242 m day for upper and around 100 m day for the lower aquifer layer the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity was defined by assigning simple zonation based on the reported values from pumping tests and assuming gradual drop in water flow energy during sedimentation resulting in decreasing the grain size and thus decreasing hydraulic conductivity from west to east fig 4 following this sedimentation criteria the initial values of hydraulic conductivity ranged from 300 m day in the west to 100 m day in the east for upper aquifer layer and from 150 m day in the west to 50 m day in the east for lower aquifer layer the lowest hydraulic conductivity of 40 m day was assigned to the narrow zone along the no flow boundary due to the lower permeability of the sediment in this area the ratio of vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set at 0 1 because of data scarcity and regional scale of the model uniform values of specific yield sy 0 3 and storage coefficient ss 5 10 4 1 m were defined in upper and lower aquifer layer based on the type of sediment spitz and moreno 1996 for the semipermeable interlayer the assigned values of hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and specific yield were 5 10 4 m day 5 10 4 1 m and 0 05 respectively the calibration of the groundwater flow model was carried out in steady state mode corresponding to medium groundwater levels october 14 2013 calibration was performed by comparing simulated and measured groundwater levels in the 32 observation wells located within the varaždin aquifer fig 2 the flow model was calibrated through manual trial and error procedure by adjusting hydraulic conductivity values within reasonable ranges to predefined zones having higher values in the western part of the model area other flow parameters were not changed in calibration procedure after each simulation only one hydraulic conductivity value was changed this procedure was iterative until a good fit between measured and computed groundwater heads was achieved to evaluate the performance of the model analysis of residual statistics such as minimum maximum mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse was performed the me indicates model bias depending on the magnitude and direction of the mean away from zero mckee and clark 2003 a negative mean indicates the model tends to overpredict simulated hydraulic heads greater than observed and a positive mean indicates underprediction simulated hydraulic heads less than observed the mae is a better indicator than the me because in this case the positive and negative residuals cannot cancel out the error anderson and woessner 2002 the rmse has widely been used in model evaluation studies and is determined using the equation 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n h 0 h c 2 where n is number of measured head values h 0 is measured head value h c is computed head value 2 3 nitrate transport model after successful calibration of groundwater flow model nitrate transport model was developed to study the spatio temporal variability of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer the simulation of nitrate transport was established using mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 within gms software interface using the same finite difference grid as in modflow mt3dms is a modular three dimensional transport model for the simulation of advection dispersion and chemical reactions of dissolved constituents in groundwater systems zheng et al 2012 mt3dms solves the partial differential equation for contaminant fate and transport zheng and wang 1999 3 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k q s c s k r n where θ is the effective porosity of the aquifer c k is the species k concentration m l 3 t is time t x i j is the distance along the cartesian coordinate axis l d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 v i is the linear pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit aquifer volume t 1 c s k is the concentration of k in the source or sink flux m l 3 and σ r n is the chemical reaction rate term m l 3 t 1 the two main mechanisms that determine a contaminant transport in groundwater are advection and dispersion advection is the process by which contaminants are transported by the bulk flow of groundwater spitz and moreno 1996 the pore water velocity i e effective velocity is described by darcy s law as the darcy flux divided by the effective porosity therefore the process depends strongly on groundwater flow and it is important to define the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient well during the construction of groundwater flow model hydrodynamic dispersion results from spreading of contaminants around advective path spitz and moreno 1996 caused by a combined transport mechanism of mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion wilson and moore 1998 although molecular diffusion may be a significant transport mechanism in cases where flow velocities are very low zheng and bennett 2002 in practical cases its role is usually very small and it is most often neglected bačani and posavec 2011 the mechanical dispersion coefficient depends on the effective velocity and dispersivity the value of dispersivity depends on the observation scale i e the distance between the entry of pollutants into the system and the observation point gelhar et al 1992 synthesized data on longitudinal in the direction of the flow and transverse normal to the flow dispersivity values obtained at different test sites data indicate a systematic increase of dispersivity with observation scale potential chemical reaction process i e denitrification was evaluated according to existing data of chemical indicators in varaždin aquifer karlović et al 2021b measured do average values in nine observation wells in the study area range between 1 5 and 8 9 mg l o2 indicating a highly aerobic environment also calculated redox conditions of groundwater show that general redox category is oxic the average dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations varied in the range of 0 35 1 33 mg l which is not a sufficient source of organic carbon for denitrification average nitrate concentrations in groundwater varied significantly between 5 1 and 96 7 mg l depending on proximity to surface waters and land use practices reported no2 values range from 0 1 to 0 4 mg l confirming its instability low values of nh4 were also measured between 0 02 and 0 05 mg l on average according to the chemical indicators potential for denitrification in the varaždin aquifer is limited by very low concentrations of doc and increased do level contrary high do values and combination of low ammonium with permanently high nitrate values suggest the occurrence of nitrification process it should not be excluded that the denitrification process exists at pore scale where local conditions may be different but on a regional scale nitrates act as a conservative contaminant and there is no significant retardation relative to groundwater movement this suggest that nitrate attenuation within the study area is mainly driven by dilution process therefore the regional nitrate transport model was simulated by only advective dispersive mechanism considering on ground nitrate as the contamination source and nitrate in groundwater as an initial concentration accurate quantification of nitrate leaching to groundwater is difficult due to the complex interaction between land use practices on ground nitrogen loading groundwater recharge soil nitrogen dynamics and soil characteristics almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 nitrate input into the varaždin aquifer is achieved by nitrate leaching from the surface through an unsaturated zone and by percolation from surface waters the spatial distribution of on ground nitrate input into the aquifer system was characterized using the corine land cover map clc 2018 and assigning nitrate values to each of the 14 land use classes fig 1 the estimation of on ground nitrate input from agricultural and forested areas was made on the basis of previous research on the nitrate concentrations in aqueous eluates of different soil types marković 2007 zoričić 2018 the first characterization campaign of nitrate in the soil of the study area was conducted in 2004 marković 2007 the soil samples were collected by auger coring at different depths 0 125 cm from five different agricultural fields and one forest the analysed average values of nitrate were between 22 1 and 62 9 mg l in agricultural soil and 30 9 mg l in forested soil the autor noted decreasing of the nitrate concentration with depth attributing it to the approaching to the capilary fringe i e dilution of nitrate with water the second characterization campaign of nitrate in the soil of the study area was conducted in period 2017 2018 zoričić 2018 the soil samples were collected at the surface from five different agricultural fields three sampling campaigns under different seasons showed virtually identical nitrate concentration in soil within individual field regardless of the season with reported values between 14 2 and 21 1 mg l given the lack of data relating detailed spatial distribution of agricultural fields with individual crops and seasonal rotation of crop types within the agricultural fields simplification was made in form of assigning a uniform nitrate concentration of 30 mg l to all agricultural land use classes non irrigated arable land complex cultivation patterns and land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation the nitrate value for coniferous forest class was also assigned at 30 mg l while broad leaved and mixed forest were estimated with lower value of 15 mg l regarding wastewater the concentration of total n in effluents from a typical septic tank system ranges from 25 to 60 mg l with ammonia making up the vast majority of this total canter 1997 however ammonium ions in the effluents may be oxidized to nitrate especially when aerobic conditions are present the nitrate concentration in discharged water can be in the range of 20 30 mg l nitrate n assuming complete nitrification of ammonia to nitrate viers et al 2012 as the sewerage network is only present in the varaždin city and rural areas still use septic tanks in the absence of any better information nitrate input from urban areas was assumed at 25 mg l nitrate input from the drava river and the accumulation lake was assigned according to measured values in the period 2004 2006 with 8 mg l and 5 mg l respectively larva 2008 on ground nitrate inputs from other land use classes such as green urban areas pastures and transitional woodland shrub were set at 2 mg l assuming small portion of organic n mineralization and nitrification mineral extraction sites and industrial or commercial units class were assumed with zero nitrate input initial conditions represent nitrate concentration at the beginning of simulation year 2006 the initial nitrate distribution in the model area fig 5 was made using kriging interpolation method according to nitrate measurements in groundwater from previous studies marković 2007 larva 2008 the mean annual nitrate concentrations in groundwater for the year 2006 are highest in the central part of the study area where intensive agricultural production is located the most unfavorable situation is at the site of the observation well pds 5 in the center of the main contamination plume where the mean nitrate concentrations are over 100 mg l lower nitrate values are present in the north of the model area due to recharge of surface water with lower nitrate concentrations causing a dilution of the nitrate contaminated groundwater national monitoring of groundwater quality in the study area consist of six observation wells three in the catchment area of the inactive wellfield varaždin pds 5 pds 6 pds 7 and three in the catchment area of the active wellfield vinokovšćak pv 2 pv 4 pv 6 for calibration of the transport model nitrate observations in the six wells were compiled from two sources national monitoring of groundwater quality 2007 2020 and croatian geological survey database collected through tranital project 2017 2020 as the nitrate analyses within national monitoring of groundwater quality are generally conducted four times a year and croatian geological survey database consist of monthly measurements the measured values were averaged for each year to be used for calibration for the simulated period 2007 2020 one observation well from each wellfield was selected to visualize the fitness between the measured and simulated values pds 5 for the wellfield varaždin and pv 2 for the wellfield vinokovšćak the calibration period was divided into 14 stress periods where each stress period corresponds to one year the nitrate transport model was calibrated manually via trial and error approach by adjusting two critical transport parameters effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity after each simulation only one transport parameter was changed the effective porosity values were obtained from literature and were modified during calibration within a range from 13 to 30 consistent with sand and gravel sediments spitz and moreno 1996 the initial longitudinal dispersivity was set at 100 m based on the scaling of the study area and the results of the research aimed at determination of dispersivity in the catchment area of the varaždin wellfield by monitoring the migration of nacl solution in a radial flow toward the well gjetvaj 1990 subsequently it was modified between 30 and 500 m during calibration the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity was taken as 0 1 gelhar et al 1992 the model calibration was carried out until the simulated nitrate concentration values fit closely to the observed values in all monitoring wells the overall performance of the transport model was evaluated using me mae and rmse for nitrate concentration residuals in the six monitoring wells 2 4 prediction of future nitrate contamination the calibrated groundwater flow and transport model was used to predict groundwater nitrate concentration under four different scenarios for the next 20 years the total simulation time of 7300 days from 2021 to 2040 was subdivided into 20 stress periods in these scenarios it was assumed that recharge from precipitation and land use would not change the initial nitrate concentration was the computed concentration in the calibrated transport model for the year 2020 the differences between the four scenarios are based only on estimated on ground nitrate inputs for the years 2021 2040 scenario 1 represents no changes in the current estimates of on ground nitrate input in scenario 2 the impact of wastewater from urban areas has been completely removed simulating the construction of a sewer network that has recently intensified in the study area in scenario 3 with a complete reduction in nitrate input from urban areas nitrate input from agricultural areas is reduced by 50 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 used similar approach by reducing 40 in manure and fertilizer application rates according to previous studies which reported that estimated fertilizer application rate is 24 38 higher than the crop demand puckett et al 1999 scenario 4 is extreme scenario of zero on ground nitrate input from agricultural and urban areas with only nitrate input from natural vegetation and surface water remaining although unrealistic this scenario provides an estimate of evolution of nitrate concentration under ideal conditions 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow model a steady state groundwater flow model was calibrated for hydraulic conductivity the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values for the upper aquifer layer ranged from 430 m day in the western part to 120 m day in the eastern part of the model domain with exception along the no flow boundary where final hydraulic conductivity was set to 40 m day the calibrated hydraulic conductivities for lower aquifer layer were lower ranging between 60 m day in the western part and 40 m day in the eastern part of the model domain hydraulic conductivity for the semipermeable interlayer was fixed at 5 10 4 m day the resulting groundwater flow velocities ranged between 0 1 and 3 0 m day for upper 0 1 and 0 5 m day for lower aquifer layer and practically zero for the semipermeable interlayer model calibration was evaluated by comparing simulated and measured head values in 32 observation wells and by histogram of residuals fig 6 the visual inspection of scatter diagram shows very good agreement between simulated and measured hydraulic heads out of 32 observations 16 residuals were greater than or equal to zero and 16 residuals were less than zero the minimum residual is 0 m while the maximum residual is 1 16 m the me mae and rmse for the 32 wells are 0 14 m 0 31 m and 0 43 m respectively based on these results the residual statistics indicate acceptable performance of the model water budget analysis enabled more detailed determination of water quantities flowing in or out of the aquifer system from different model boundaries fig 7 the total volume of inflow outflow water was around 310 000 m3 day the water budget of the model revealed that aquifer is predominantly recharged by the surface water with 68 of the total inflow distributed between drava river 31 accumulation lake 21 plitvica stream 15 and the derivation channel 1 the remaining 32 of total inflow is attributed to infiltration of precipitation conversely the aquifer discharge occurs through derivation channel 43 plitvica stream 19 eastern model boundary 18 drava river 17 and by pumping wells at vinokovšćak wellfield 3 3 2 nitrate transport model trial and error calibration of transport parameters within predefined ranges resulted with final values of 20 for effective porosity and 100 m for longitudinal dispersivity during the calibration it has been observed that a change in effective porosity has a greater effect on nitrate transport than change of longitudinal dispersivity this confirms that nitrate transport is dominated by advection process pechlet number equals 1 which is typical for highly permeable materials spitz and moreno 1996 while dispersion has a secondary effect especially considering the diffuse nature of on ground nitrate input applied over the study area the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater in the study area for the year 2020 is depicted according to observed concentrations fig 8a and simulated concentrations fig 8b simulated values of nitrate range between 5 0 and 86 5 mg l the highest nitrate values in groundwater are still associated to the central part of the study area with intensive agriculture as 14 years earlier fig 5 however the main contamination plume has moved downstream with respect to the initial state in 2006 lower nitrate values are connected with proximity to drava river accumulation lake and plitvica stream where dilution with surface water occurs simulated nitrate concentrations were compared to the observed ones for the period 2007 2020 and are presented for two selected observation wells pds 5 in the catchment area of wellfield varaždin fig 9 and pv 2 in the catchment area of wellfield vinokovšćak fig 10 the time series of measured and simulated nitrate concentrations at observation well pds 5 shows that nitrate contamination in groundwater has been mitigated during last 14 years fig 9 the measured mean nitrate concentrations gradually decreased from 107 1 to 61 5 mg l the simulated nitrate values generally followed the same pattern as the measured values exceeding the mcl of 50 mg l for most of the time except for the last time step t 5110 days the measured mean nitrate concentrations in the observation well pv 2 ranged between 2 2 and 6 8 mg l fig 10 the simulated nitrate values are within order of magnitude and relatively close to measured values after four years they reach a steady state with a value of 5 2 mg l which is likely related to the influence of the drava river the groundwater flow is generally in n s direction in this part of the aquifer fig 2 although the yearly mean nitrate concentrations were used for calibration of the transport model both diagrams show good agreement between measured and simulated nitrate values overall assessment of model calibration showed that model performs reasonably well with me 1 7 mg l mae 5 2 mg l rmse 7 7 mg l and r2 0 96 for 84 measurements fig 11 therefore it was concluded that the developed nitrate transport model can be used to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater in response to future on ground nitrate input scenarios 3 3 prediction of future nitrate contamination the calibrated nitrate transport model was used for prediction models with simulation period from 2021 to 2040 under four different scenarios 1 no changes in the current on ground nitrate input 2 removal of nitrate input from wastewater 3 application of 50 of the current nitrate input to agricultural fields 4 cessation of on ground nitrate input from agriculture and urban areas with nitrate deriving from natural vegetation and surface water nitrogen input used in the transport model for each scenario table 1 was estimated using the calculated effective infiltration of precipitation karlović et al 2021a assigned nitrate concentrations to each land use group and corresponding land use area clc 2018 as a result the majority of nitrogen input to the groundwater in the first three scenarios come from agriculture 82 93 and 87 for the first second and third scenario respectively the spatial distribution of final nitrate values in year 2040 fig 12a d shows the continued decline of nitrate concentrations and further migration of the main contamination plume towards the east in regards to year 2020 fig 8 the time series of predicted nitrate concentrations in the observation wells pds 5 fig 13 and pv 2 fig 14 depict the evolution of nitrate concentrations for all four scenarios throughout the next 20 years according to the modeling results obtained with the first scenario the gradual decrease in nitrate concentration continues throughout the model especially in the central part where the expected nitrate value in the observation well pds 5 by the year 2040 is around 30 mg l fig 13 the northern part of the model is under the influence of the surface water and remains an area with low nitrate values generally under 15 mg l by the year 2040 fig 12a the situation at the observation well pv 2 remains the same with stabilization of nitrate value at 5 2 mg l reached at calibration phase fig 14 the results of the second scenario suggested that the removal of nitrate input from wastewater does not have great influence on nitrate concentrations in groundwater compared to the first scenario there are no significant changes in the spatial distribution of nitrate fig 12b and the predicted nitrate values at both observation wells are almost identical to the first scenario figs 12 and 13 the only difference is in the area of the varaždin city which represents urban land use class where the maximum nitrate concentration decreased from 64 mg l fig 12a to 59 mg l fig 12b in the year 2040 unlike the first two scenarios the analysis of third scenario showed that significant decrease of nitrate concentration in groundwater can be expected following a 50 reduction of nitrate input from agricultural areas fig 12c the nitrate values in observation well pds 5 were gradually decreased reaching 21 mg l in the year 2040 fig 13 the nitrate concentrations in the observation well pv 2 remained steady at 5 2 mg l as in the first two scenarios fig 14 the nitrate transport modeling of fourth scenario showed more pronounced decrease of nitrate concentrations in groundwater relative to other scenarios as expected fig 12d the model predicted constant decline of nitrate values in observation well pds 5 with value around 13 mg l in the year 2040 fig 13 barely noticeable decline is observed in the observation well pv 2 fig 14 confirming that this area is under dominant influence of the drava river however the results indicate the inertia of the system with respect to the time required for the aquifer to be gradually cleared of nitrate even with the unrealistic assumption of complete interruption of on ground nitrate input by the year 2040 most of the aquifer has nitrate concentrations below permissible limit of 50 mg l but the eastern part of the study area still has the elevated values with maximum of 56 mg l near the eastern model boundary fig 12d as a consequence of the slow contamination plume advance in the direction of groundwater flow 4 discussion and conclusions the developed groundwater flow and nitrate transport model of the varaždin aquifer provided the following conclusions 1 the steady state calibration of the groundwater flow model was acceptable according to residual statistics and water balance analysis water budget analysis provided better understanding and quantification of aquifer inflow and outflow the main aquifer recharge mechanism is the percolation of surface water with 68 while infiltration of precipitation has secondary effect with 32 of the total water inflow the total water outflow is distributed between derivation channel 43 plitvica stream 19 eastern model boundary 18 drava river 17 and vinokovšćak wellfield 3 2 a nitrate transport model was developed based on the calibrated flow model the advection is identified as the main transport process followed by dispersion while chemical reaction processes such as denitrification were not simulated the time series of the selected observation wells and calibration statistics show reasonable agreement between measured and simulated nitrate concentrations 3 the calibrated groundwater flow and transport model was used to investigate the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer for the next 20 years under four scenarios based on the changes in on ground nitrate input simulation results for all scenarios indicate that the groundwater quality regarding nitrate contamination in the northern part of the model domain including vinokovšćak wellfield will remain good mainly due to the dilution from the drava river with low nitrate concentration on the other hand the catchment area of the varaždin wellfield in central part of the aquifer is highly dependent on changing of the on ground nitrate input in this area there is a certain degree of inertia in terms of nitrate attenuation in groundwater even with the extreme scenario of zero on ground nitrate input from agriculture and urban areas although the nitrate contamination gradually decreases in the next 20 years neither of the scenarios reached nitrate concentrations below the mcl level of 50 mg l for the entire aquifer the studied nitrate contamination also has negative impact outside the study area the main contamination plume migrated to the eastern model boundary for all four scenarios further moving towards the main wellfield bartolovec situated downstream of the city of varaždin the scenario analysis demonstrated that reducing the nitrate input from agricultural areas yields a considerable reduction of nitrate in groundwater while the impact of wastewater is negligible which suggests that agriculture is a main nitrate pollutant in the study area therefore the management of the agricultural practices seems to be of critical importance towards the remediation of the groundwater quality in the varaždin aquifer 4 the regional scale methodology used to develop groundwater flow and transport model of varaždin aquifer was based on few simplifying assumptions since the aquifer was modeled in a steady state flow for medium groundwater levels and mean annual precipitation with steady on ground nitrate input in the transport model seasonal effects could not be expressed the amount of input data did not allow a detailed assessment of flow and transport parameters and their spatial distribution in each part of the varaždin aquifer so there are uncertainties related to assigned parameters in defined zones and their uniform values also the model lacks details on the on ground nitrate input as the estimated values are assigned to large areas according to the current land use map as a result the majority of nitrogen input to the groundwater in the first three scenarios is from agriculture due to its large share in land use and assigned nitrate concentrations despite these limitations the model produced indicative results for both groundwater flow and nitrate transport the methodology used in this study is applicable to most alluvial aquifers however the simplifying assumptions must be taken into consideration when applying the model to management issues this methodology can be employed for similar large scale studies to model the general impact of on ground nitrate input on groundwater contamination in watersheds with intensive agricultural activity 5 the work presented in this paper can be useful in understanding nitrate behavior in saturated zone of the aquifer however additional investigation of soil and unsaturated zone would upgrade the current understanding of nitrogen processes and achieve a better characterization of nitrate in the model future research efforts should focus on better estimation of nitrate input which eventually reaches the groundwater by utilizing a more detailed land use map preferably with individual agricultural fields and by modeling nitrogen transformation processes in unsaturated zone although nitrate concentrations are measured four times a year and were averaged within this work for the purpose of calibration they still experience seasonal changes in order to simulate these fine oscillations finer discretization in both spatial and temporal domains would be required which is currently limited by available data but is certainly the subject of future research the upgraded model could serve as an effective tool for formulating management strategies and specific measures to reduce nitrate pollution from agriculture in the varaždin aquifer system generally specific measures would include fertilization optimization considering the rates application timing and methods effective management of manure from farms rational use of irrigation methods according to crop water demand and implementation of other good agricultural practices recommendations according to the nitrate directive 91 676 eec finally agriculture is a very important activity in the study area and economic aspect of these measures should not be neglected the management strategies should consider improvement of groundwater quality but not at the expense of agricultural production this seems to be a key step for farmers to adopt the codes of good agricultural practices enabling better management of

7967,study region the varaždin alluvial aquifer located in the drava river valley study focus the study area is characterized by agricultural activity which raised concerns due to the high nitrate concentration in groundwater the present study aims to evaluate future nitrate concentrations in groundwater using the numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling the regional model was generated in gms software using the modflow code for steady state groundwater flow model and mt3dms code for nitrate transport model advective dispersive transport was simulated without a chemical retardation process the calibrated model was used to investigate the evolution of groundwater nitrate concentrations for the next 20 years under four scenarios a current nitrate input b zero input from wastewater c agricultural input reduced by 50 d input from natural vegetation and surface water new hydrological insights for the region the scenario analysis demonstrated that reducing the nitrate input from agricultural areas yields a considerable reduction of nitrate in groundwater while the impact of wastewater is negligible neither of the scenarios reached concentrations below threshold value of 50 mg l for the entire aquifer in the next 20 years the nitrate concentration in the northern part of the aquifer will remain low mainly due to the dilution from river the central part of the aquifer is highly dependent on changing the on ground nitrate concentration showing inertia regarding the nitrate attenuation in groundwater keywords numerical modeling nitrate transport water budget varaždin alluvial aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of drinking water in croatia groundwater that can meet the water supply needs of the region or large cities in terms of quantity and quality and ensure significant economic and social development is recognized as strategic groundwater resource in croatia official gazette 91 08 2021 the varaždin aquifer is a part of strategic groundwater resources ensuring water for agriculture industry and domestic consumption for approximately 170 000 inhabitants of the varaždin county in nw croatia long term agricultural activity industry and population growth have considerably affected the groundwater quality regarding nitrate concentration in the varaždin aquifer which raised concerns and increased the public interest in the groundwater protection nitrate is identified as one of the most common contaminants of groundwater worldwide lee et al 2006 almasri 2007 rivett et al 2007 high nitrate concentrations in groundwater present a serious environmental issue due to deterioration of groundwater quality and eutrophication of surface waters also nitrate ingestion can have negative impact on human health causing various diseases such as gastric cancer non hodgkin s lymphoma and methemoglobinemia walton 1951 winneberger 1982 who 1985 in response to nitrate contamination the european union 98 83 ec 1998 and world health organization who 2004 have established the maximum contaminant level mcl of 50 mg l no3 in drinking water moreover nitrates represent one of the two groundwater quality standards according to the groundwater directive 2006 118 ec 2006 due to major problems with nitrate contamination in groundwater from agricultural sources the european union adopted the nitrate directive 91 676 eec 1991 the document which promotes the use of good agricultural practices and recommends measures to reduce nitrate contamination in addition to the application of fertilizers and manure in agriculture nitrate in groundwater may derive from other anthropogenic sources e g wastewater from septic tanks and sewage system industrial sites and landfills wakida and lerner 2005 almasri 2007 nitrate in groundwater also originates from natural sources such as rocks soil and atmospheric nitrate deposition williams et al 1998 nitrogen n is a vital nutrient to enhance plant growth once in the soil it is transformed through major process of fixation assimilation ammonification nitrification and denitrification dinitrogen gas is first fixed to ammonia which is assimilated into organic nitrogen followed by the degradation of organic nitrogen ammonification which releases a molecule of ammonia nitrification occurs under aerobic conditions in presence of the nitrifying bacteria formed nitrate is partially up taken by plants and the remains are leached to the water table due to its negative charge nitrate is not likely to bind to the aquifer matrix by adsorption based on the literature review nitrate is quite mobile in groundwater and the distribution coefficient which represents adsorption is essentially zero shamrukh et al 2001 krupka et al 2004 seo and lee 2005 conversely ammonium is a cation and tends to adsorb to the soil particles resulting that most of the nitrogen that transports through the soil into the groundwater is in the form of nitrate denitrification is considered as the main natural process attenuating nitrate concentration in groundwater otero et al 2009 jahangir et al 2013 puig et al 2017 it is a multi step process and it can occur when anaerobic conditions exist with the presence of denitrifying bacteria and the dissolved organic carbon otero et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 rivett et al 2008 nitrate investigation presents a complex task because nitrogen transformation processes occur in three zones of interest soil unsaturated zone and saturated zone according to almasri 2007 spatio temporal occurrence of nitrate in groundwater depends on on ground nitrogen loading soil characteristics and groundwater properties groundwater flow and solute transport modeling has become an essential tool for studying spatio temporal distribution of nitrate in groundwater the modeling framework most commonly relies on either utilizing lumped models e g lpms in hajhamad and almasri 2009 e hype in hansen et al 2018 biche in surdyk et al 2021 or spatially distributed models e g integrating the modflow code for the simulation of the groundwater flow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms code for the simulation of nitrate transport zheng and wang 1999 numerous regional studies have been conducted by combining modflow and mt3dms codes as the problem with nitrate contamination of groundwater occurs worldwide molénat and gascuel odoux 2002 used modflow and mt3dms to simulate groundwater flow and nitrate transport under steady state conditions in central brittany france the scenario analysis indicated that a significant decrease of stream nitrate concentration can be expected following a decrease in nitrate leaching along the hillslope almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 coupled a soil model with the modflow and mt3d code to model the nitrate contamination in an agricultural watershed in washington state and explored different protection alternatives to reduce the nitrate contamination in groundwater jiang and somers 2008 examined nitrate contamination in groundwater on the eastern coast of canada the groundwater flow and transport model results showed that it would take several years to reduce the nitrate concentration in the shallow portion of the aquifer and several decades or more to restore water quality in the deeper portions of the aquifer psarropoulou and karatzas 2014 developed the nitrate transport model of the coastal aquifer in greece based on a previously established transient groundwater flow model the authors observed seasonal variations in nitrate concentrations and concluded that approach coupling a transient groundwater flow model with a simple transport model yielded acceptable results zhang and hiscock 2016 used groundwater flow modflow and mass transport modeling mt3dms to investigate the response of groundwater nitrate concentration to different land use change scenarios in the britain s second largest aquifer based on the simulation results the greatest future decrease in nitrate concentration was associated with the replacement of agricultural land with forest this paper is part of a broader study being conducted in varaždin region with the aim of investigating the origin fate and the transport of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer the findings of this study help to better understand the spatio temporal distribution of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer by developing a numerical groundwater flow and nitrate transport model a regional groundwater flow and transport model was developed for the study area using modflow and mt3dms codes which are an integral part of the software package groundwater modeling system gms aquaveo 2018 processes in the soil and unsaturated zone were not modeled within this paper prior to the modeling analysis was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of denitrification process and the main transport processes were identified the nitrate transport was simulated using advection dispersion equation without retardation due to denitrification the main research objectives of the modeling were to 1 understand the groundwater flow paths and define water budget 2 accurately simulate nitrate concentrations in the groundwater for the period 2007 2020 3 predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations for different scenarios based on the changes in on ground nitrate input 4 identify the limitations of using the model for management strategies and suggest future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out in the drava river valley within the varaždin aquifer system located in varaždin region in nw croatia fig 1 the aquifer represents an important source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes in the varaždin area the study site occupies an area of about 200 km2 and was selected as the groundwater flow and transport model domain due to the well defined boundary conditions and the fact that this area has been reported to be greatly affected by high nitrate concentrations the climate of the study area is classified as a warm temperate climate in the cfb group according to the köppen geiger classification system nimac and perčec tadić 2016 with annual mean temperature of 10 6 c and annual mean precipitation of 832 mm zaninović et al 2008 the varaždin aquifer consists of quaternary alluvial deposits prelogović and velić 1988 mainly represented by gravel and sand with lenses and interbeds of silt and clay babić et al 1978 urumović et al 1990 the aquifer is thinnest in the nw part having thickness of less than 5 m and the thickest in the se part of the study area with thickness of 65 m in average marković et al 2020 the size of gravel and sand particles gets gradually smaller from the northwestern part downstream as a result of the decrease in energy of the drava river larva 2008 according to the conceptual model the aquifer system can be divided into three layers upper aquifer semipermeable interlayer and lower aquifer karlović et al 2021a both aquifers are hydraulically connected and the upper aquifer is in direct contact with the drava river the basement of the aquifer consists of very low permeable marl silt and clay hydrodynamically the varaždin aquifer is unconfined the covering layer of the aquifer is not continuous meaning there is a high infiltration potential favorable for nitrate leaching general regional groundwater flow direction is nw se aquifer is recharged naturally by surface water and by infiltration of precipitation groundwater discharge within the aquifer occurs through draining to the derivation channel and plitvica stream and groundwater abstraction at the wellfield vinokovšćak another water budget component that influences groundwater discharge but also recharge is irrigation the problem is that it cannot be measured because there is unregistered pumping for irrigation via small capacity domestic wells throughout the study area further details on the aquifer characteristics can be found in a recent study karlović et al 2021a the favorable climate flat terrain and available groundwater have enabled intensive agricultural practices resulting that majority of the study area is under agricultural land use fig 1 about 68 of the land can be attributed to agriculture by combining 3 classes non irrigated arable land complex cultivation patterns land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation from the corine land cover database clc 2018 urban and industrial areas occupy around 11 forests and shrub around 10 pastures around 7 and surface water around 3 the remaining 1 consists of several other land use types historically agricultural production was the main economic activity in the study area for many decades the problems with high nitrate concentrations in groundwater date back to the 1970s it is important to mention that the documented concentration of nitrate at wellfield varaždin in 1973 was only 4 4 mg l no3 grđan et al 1991 this value can be considered as natural nitrate concentration or the background value without anthropogenic influence after the construction of the varaždin hydroelectric power plant and the filling of the accumulation lake the natural state of groundwater was disturbed and groundwater levels rose followed by leaching of nitrates accumulated in the unsaturated aquifer zone from that point on the alluvial aquifer is characterized by high nitrate concentrations resulting in shutting down of the wellfield varaždin two active wellfields remain in the varaždin aquifer vinokovšćak a smaller wellfield located in the northeastern part of the study area fig 1 and bartolovec the main wellfield located downstream of the varaždin city outside the study area today major agricultural activities in the varaždin region include plantation of cabbage maize wheat and potato but also poultry and dairy farming agricultural production includes seasonal rotation of crop types within the agricultural fields fertilizers are applied throughout agricultural fields to enhance crop production accompanied with irrigation by sprinklers also manure from farms is being dumped in the field without any protection of leaching to groundwater the estimated nitrogen consumption on utilized agricultural land in 2012 for varaždin county is 7396 t n of which 65 is attributed to mineral fertilizers and 35 to organic fertilizers romić et al 2014 this n input is subject to different transformation processes and plant uptake in the soil zone and the rest of it leaches to groundwater as nitrate compared to the previous estimation of nitrogen consumption in 2000 mesić et al 2002 there is a drop in fertilizer consumption in 2012 of approximately 13 also there has been a decrease in agricultural surfaces in the past 10 15 years followed by an increase in the urban area by 12 jogun et al 2017 however the application of synthetic fertilizers and manure in agricultural production is still considered the main source of nitrate contamination in groundwater followed by wastewater from urban areas karlović et al 2021b 2 2 groundwater flow model a three dimensional groundwater flow model of the varaždin aquifer was constructed using modflow code mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 within gms software interface under steady state conditions modflow solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation using finite difference method and cell centered approach the steady state groundwater flow equation can be expressed as 3 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z 0 where k x k y and k z are the hydraulic conductivity values in the x y and z directions l t 1 h is the value of the hydraulic head at any point in a three dimensional flow field l steady state conditions were defined based on the observation from karlović et al 2021a which suggested that surface water in the varaždin region i e the accumulation lake and the drava river governs the groundwater levels maintaining the quasi steady state during the long term period without significant oscillation in groundwater levels water levels on october 14 2013 were selected as representative medium groundwater conditions for period 2006 2020 head contour map for medium groundwater levels was constructed using kriging interpolation method and groundwater level data from 32 observation wells fig 2 the data were provided by the croatian meteorological and hydrological service the input data for the groundwater flow model include a detailed definition of geometry flow parameters and boundary conditions of the aquifer the model domain in the horizontal direction consist of 209 columns and 193 rows with 100 100 m and total number of active cells is 62 415 the vertical discretization of the model domain was based on the conceptual model by which the aquifer system is divided into three layers presenting hydrogeological units of quaternary sediments with different characteristics upper aquifer semipermeable interlayer and lower aquifer fig 3 impermeable layer was assumed for the bottom of the model according to the head contour map the varaždin aquifer has an inflow boundary from drava river and accumulation lake varaždin on the northwest and north no flow boundary on the west and south and an outflow boundary on the east of the aquifer system see fig 2 these boundaries were characterized in the model either as dirichlet or neumann boundary condition dirichlet boundary condition specifies the value of the head along the boundary while neumann boundary condition specifies the flux across the boundary anderson and woessner 2002 the drava river accumulation lake plitvica stream and derivation channel of hydropower plant varaždin were defined using the specified head package for modflow dirichlet the western and southern edge of the model was simulated as no flow boundary neumann the eastern boundary was defined using the specified flux package for modflow neumann based on the darcy s law the outflow from the varaždin aquifer on the east was estimated to be 55 000 m3 day for the upper aquifer layer and 2000 m3 day for the lower aquifer layer the spatial distribution of precipitation infiltration was derived from wetspass m model for the long term mean annual values karlović et al 2021a and was defined in modflow using recharge package neumann data on groundwater abstraction from the wellfield vinokovšćak was obtained from varaždin utility company varkom three pumping wells were simulated in the model using the well package of modflow neumann with total abstraction rate of 7847 m3 day measured on the october 14 2013 the flow parameters required for the model include hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient i e specific yield these input parameters have been assigned to each layer separately the initial values of hydraulic conductivity were obtained from former hydrogeological studies where pumping tests were performed related to the development of wellfields and for the construction of hydropower plant the hydraulic conductivity values based on the pumping test results at five different locations within the study area range from 147 to 242 m day for upper and around 100 m day for the lower aquifer layer the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity was defined by assigning simple zonation based on the reported values from pumping tests and assuming gradual drop in water flow energy during sedimentation resulting in decreasing the grain size and thus decreasing hydraulic conductivity from west to east fig 4 following this sedimentation criteria the initial values of hydraulic conductivity ranged from 300 m day in the west to 100 m day in the east for upper aquifer layer and from 150 m day in the west to 50 m day in the east for lower aquifer layer the lowest hydraulic conductivity of 40 m day was assigned to the narrow zone along the no flow boundary due to the lower permeability of the sediment in this area the ratio of vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity was set at 0 1 because of data scarcity and regional scale of the model uniform values of specific yield sy 0 3 and storage coefficient ss 5 10 4 1 m were defined in upper and lower aquifer layer based on the type of sediment spitz and moreno 1996 for the semipermeable interlayer the assigned values of hydraulic conductivity storage coefficient and specific yield were 5 10 4 m day 5 10 4 1 m and 0 05 respectively the calibration of the groundwater flow model was carried out in steady state mode corresponding to medium groundwater levels october 14 2013 calibration was performed by comparing simulated and measured groundwater levels in the 32 observation wells located within the varaždin aquifer fig 2 the flow model was calibrated through manual trial and error procedure by adjusting hydraulic conductivity values within reasonable ranges to predefined zones having higher values in the western part of the model area other flow parameters were not changed in calibration procedure after each simulation only one hydraulic conductivity value was changed this procedure was iterative until a good fit between measured and computed groundwater heads was achieved to evaluate the performance of the model analysis of residual statistics such as minimum maximum mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse was performed the me indicates model bias depending on the magnitude and direction of the mean away from zero mckee and clark 2003 a negative mean indicates the model tends to overpredict simulated hydraulic heads greater than observed and a positive mean indicates underprediction simulated hydraulic heads less than observed the mae is a better indicator than the me because in this case the positive and negative residuals cannot cancel out the error anderson and woessner 2002 the rmse has widely been used in model evaluation studies and is determined using the equation 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n h 0 h c 2 where n is number of measured head values h 0 is measured head value h c is computed head value 2 3 nitrate transport model after successful calibration of groundwater flow model nitrate transport model was developed to study the spatio temporal variability of nitrate in the varaždin aquifer the simulation of nitrate transport was established using mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 within gms software interface using the same finite difference grid as in modflow mt3dms is a modular three dimensional transport model for the simulation of advection dispersion and chemical reactions of dissolved constituents in groundwater systems zheng et al 2012 mt3dms solves the partial differential equation for contaminant fate and transport zheng and wang 1999 3 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k q s c s k r n where θ is the effective porosity of the aquifer c k is the species k concentration m l 3 t is time t x i j is the distance along the cartesian coordinate axis l d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor l2 t 1 v i is the linear pore water velocity l t 1 q s is the volumetric flow rate per unit aquifer volume t 1 c s k is the concentration of k in the source or sink flux m l 3 and σ r n is the chemical reaction rate term m l 3 t 1 the two main mechanisms that determine a contaminant transport in groundwater are advection and dispersion advection is the process by which contaminants are transported by the bulk flow of groundwater spitz and moreno 1996 the pore water velocity i e effective velocity is described by darcy s law as the darcy flux divided by the effective porosity therefore the process depends strongly on groundwater flow and it is important to define the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient well during the construction of groundwater flow model hydrodynamic dispersion results from spreading of contaminants around advective path spitz and moreno 1996 caused by a combined transport mechanism of mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion wilson and moore 1998 although molecular diffusion may be a significant transport mechanism in cases where flow velocities are very low zheng and bennett 2002 in practical cases its role is usually very small and it is most often neglected bačani and posavec 2011 the mechanical dispersion coefficient depends on the effective velocity and dispersivity the value of dispersivity depends on the observation scale i e the distance between the entry of pollutants into the system and the observation point gelhar et al 1992 synthesized data on longitudinal in the direction of the flow and transverse normal to the flow dispersivity values obtained at different test sites data indicate a systematic increase of dispersivity with observation scale potential chemical reaction process i e denitrification was evaluated according to existing data of chemical indicators in varaždin aquifer karlović et al 2021b measured do average values in nine observation wells in the study area range between 1 5 and 8 9 mg l o2 indicating a highly aerobic environment also calculated redox conditions of groundwater show that general redox category is oxic the average dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations varied in the range of 0 35 1 33 mg l which is not a sufficient source of organic carbon for denitrification average nitrate concentrations in groundwater varied significantly between 5 1 and 96 7 mg l depending on proximity to surface waters and land use practices reported no2 values range from 0 1 to 0 4 mg l confirming its instability low values of nh4 were also measured between 0 02 and 0 05 mg l on average according to the chemical indicators potential for denitrification in the varaždin aquifer is limited by very low concentrations of doc and increased do level contrary high do values and combination of low ammonium with permanently high nitrate values suggest the occurrence of nitrification process it should not be excluded that the denitrification process exists at pore scale where local conditions may be different but on a regional scale nitrates act as a conservative contaminant and there is no significant retardation relative to groundwater movement this suggest that nitrate attenuation within the study area is mainly driven by dilution process therefore the regional nitrate transport model was simulated by only advective dispersive mechanism considering on ground nitrate as the contamination source and nitrate in groundwater as an initial concentration accurate quantification of nitrate leaching to groundwater is difficult due to the complex interaction between land use practices on ground nitrogen loading groundwater recharge soil nitrogen dynamics and soil characteristics almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 nitrate input into the varaždin aquifer is achieved by nitrate leaching from the surface through an unsaturated zone and by percolation from surface waters the spatial distribution of on ground nitrate input into the aquifer system was characterized using the corine land cover map clc 2018 and assigning nitrate values to each of the 14 land use classes fig 1 the estimation of on ground nitrate input from agricultural and forested areas was made on the basis of previous research on the nitrate concentrations in aqueous eluates of different soil types marković 2007 zoričić 2018 the first characterization campaign of nitrate in the soil of the study area was conducted in 2004 marković 2007 the soil samples were collected by auger coring at different depths 0 125 cm from five different agricultural fields and one forest the analysed average values of nitrate were between 22 1 and 62 9 mg l in agricultural soil and 30 9 mg l in forested soil the autor noted decreasing of the nitrate concentration with depth attributing it to the approaching to the capilary fringe i e dilution of nitrate with water the second characterization campaign of nitrate in the soil of the study area was conducted in period 2017 2018 zoričić 2018 the soil samples were collected at the surface from five different agricultural fields three sampling campaigns under different seasons showed virtually identical nitrate concentration in soil within individual field regardless of the season with reported values between 14 2 and 21 1 mg l given the lack of data relating detailed spatial distribution of agricultural fields with individual crops and seasonal rotation of crop types within the agricultural fields simplification was made in form of assigning a uniform nitrate concentration of 30 mg l to all agricultural land use classes non irrigated arable land complex cultivation patterns and land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation the nitrate value for coniferous forest class was also assigned at 30 mg l while broad leaved and mixed forest were estimated with lower value of 15 mg l regarding wastewater the concentration of total n in effluents from a typical septic tank system ranges from 25 to 60 mg l with ammonia making up the vast majority of this total canter 1997 however ammonium ions in the effluents may be oxidized to nitrate especially when aerobic conditions are present the nitrate concentration in discharged water can be in the range of 20 30 mg l nitrate n assuming complete nitrification of ammonia to nitrate viers et al 2012 as the sewerage network is only present in the varaždin city and rural areas still use septic tanks in the absence of any better information nitrate input from urban areas was assumed at 25 mg l nitrate input from the drava river and the accumulation lake was assigned according to measured values in the period 2004 2006 with 8 mg l and 5 mg l respectively larva 2008 on ground nitrate inputs from other land use classes such as green urban areas pastures and transitional woodland shrub were set at 2 mg l assuming small portion of organic n mineralization and nitrification mineral extraction sites and industrial or commercial units class were assumed with zero nitrate input initial conditions represent nitrate concentration at the beginning of simulation year 2006 the initial nitrate distribution in the model area fig 5 was made using kriging interpolation method according to nitrate measurements in groundwater from previous studies marković 2007 larva 2008 the mean annual nitrate concentrations in groundwater for the year 2006 are highest in the central part of the study area where intensive agricultural production is located the most unfavorable situation is at the site of the observation well pds 5 in the center of the main contamination plume where the mean nitrate concentrations are over 100 mg l lower nitrate values are present in the north of the model area due to recharge of surface water with lower nitrate concentrations causing a dilution of the nitrate contaminated groundwater national monitoring of groundwater quality in the study area consist of six observation wells three in the catchment area of the inactive wellfield varaždin pds 5 pds 6 pds 7 and three in the catchment area of the active wellfield vinokovšćak pv 2 pv 4 pv 6 for calibration of the transport model nitrate observations in the six wells were compiled from two sources national monitoring of groundwater quality 2007 2020 and croatian geological survey database collected through tranital project 2017 2020 as the nitrate analyses within national monitoring of groundwater quality are generally conducted four times a year and croatian geological survey database consist of monthly measurements the measured values were averaged for each year to be used for calibration for the simulated period 2007 2020 one observation well from each wellfield was selected to visualize the fitness between the measured and simulated values pds 5 for the wellfield varaždin and pv 2 for the wellfield vinokovšćak the calibration period was divided into 14 stress periods where each stress period corresponds to one year the nitrate transport model was calibrated manually via trial and error approach by adjusting two critical transport parameters effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity after each simulation only one transport parameter was changed the effective porosity values were obtained from literature and were modified during calibration within a range from 13 to 30 consistent with sand and gravel sediments spitz and moreno 1996 the initial longitudinal dispersivity was set at 100 m based on the scaling of the study area and the results of the research aimed at determination of dispersivity in the catchment area of the varaždin wellfield by monitoring the migration of nacl solution in a radial flow toward the well gjetvaj 1990 subsequently it was modified between 30 and 500 m during calibration the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity was taken as 0 1 gelhar et al 1992 the model calibration was carried out until the simulated nitrate concentration values fit closely to the observed values in all monitoring wells the overall performance of the transport model was evaluated using me mae and rmse for nitrate concentration residuals in the six monitoring wells 2 4 prediction of future nitrate contamination the calibrated groundwater flow and transport model was used to predict groundwater nitrate concentration under four different scenarios for the next 20 years the total simulation time of 7300 days from 2021 to 2040 was subdivided into 20 stress periods in these scenarios it was assumed that recharge from precipitation and land use would not change the initial nitrate concentration was the computed concentration in the calibrated transport model for the year 2020 the differences between the four scenarios are based only on estimated on ground nitrate inputs for the years 2021 2040 scenario 1 represents no changes in the current estimates of on ground nitrate input in scenario 2 the impact of wastewater from urban areas has been completely removed simulating the construction of a sewer network that has recently intensified in the study area in scenario 3 with a complete reduction in nitrate input from urban areas nitrate input from agricultural areas is reduced by 50 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 used similar approach by reducing 40 in manure and fertilizer application rates according to previous studies which reported that estimated fertilizer application rate is 24 38 higher than the crop demand puckett et al 1999 scenario 4 is extreme scenario of zero on ground nitrate input from agricultural and urban areas with only nitrate input from natural vegetation and surface water remaining although unrealistic this scenario provides an estimate of evolution of nitrate concentration under ideal conditions 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow model a steady state groundwater flow model was calibrated for hydraulic conductivity the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values for the upper aquifer layer ranged from 430 m day in the western part to 120 m day in the eastern part of the model domain with exception along the no flow boundary where final hydraulic conductivity was set to 40 m day the calibrated hydraulic conductivities for lower aquifer layer were lower ranging between 60 m day in the western part and 40 m day in the eastern part of the model domain hydraulic conductivity for the semipermeable interlayer was fixed at 5 10 4 m day the resulting groundwater flow velocities ranged between 0 1 and 3 0 m day for upper 0 1 and 0 5 m day for lower aquifer layer and practically zero for the semipermeable interlayer model calibration was evaluated by comparing simulated and measured head values in 32 observation wells and by histogram of residuals fig 6 the visual inspection of scatter diagram shows very good agreement between simulated and measured hydraulic heads out of 32 observations 16 residuals were greater than or equal to zero and 16 residuals were less than zero the minimum residual is 0 m while the maximum residual is 1 16 m the me mae and rmse for the 32 wells are 0 14 m 0 31 m and 0 43 m respectively based on these results the residual statistics indicate acceptable performance of the model water budget analysis enabled more detailed determination of water quantities flowing in or out of the aquifer system from different model boundaries fig 7 the total volume of inflow outflow water was around 310 000 m3 day the water budget of the model revealed that aquifer is predominantly recharged by the surface water with 68 of the total inflow distributed between drava river 31 accumulation lake 21 plitvica stream 15 and the derivation channel 1 the remaining 32 of total inflow is attributed to infiltration of precipitation conversely the aquifer discharge occurs through derivation channel 43 plitvica stream 19 eastern model boundary 18 drava river 17 and by pumping wells at vinokovšćak wellfield 3 3 2 nitrate transport model trial and error calibration of transport parameters within predefined ranges resulted with final values of 20 for effective porosity and 100 m for longitudinal dispersivity during the calibration it has been observed that a change in effective porosity has a greater effect on nitrate transport than change of longitudinal dispersivity this confirms that nitrate transport is dominated by advection process pechlet number equals 1 which is typical for highly permeable materials spitz and moreno 1996 while dispersion has a secondary effect especially considering the diffuse nature of on ground nitrate input applied over the study area the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration in groundwater in the study area for the year 2020 is depicted according to observed concentrations fig 8a and simulated concentrations fig 8b simulated values of nitrate range between 5 0 and 86 5 mg l the highest nitrate values in groundwater are still associated to the central part of the study area with intensive agriculture as 14 years earlier fig 5 however the main contamination plume has moved downstream with respect to the initial state in 2006 lower nitrate values are connected with proximity to drava river accumulation lake and plitvica stream where dilution with surface water occurs simulated nitrate concentrations were compared to the observed ones for the period 2007 2020 and are presented for two selected observation wells pds 5 in the catchment area of wellfield varaždin fig 9 and pv 2 in the catchment area of wellfield vinokovšćak fig 10 the time series of measured and simulated nitrate concentrations at observation well pds 5 shows that nitrate contamination in groundwater has been mitigated during last 14 years fig 9 the measured mean nitrate concentrations gradually decreased from 107 1 to 61 5 mg l the simulated nitrate values generally followed the same pattern as the measured values exceeding the mcl of 50 mg l for most of the time except for the last time step t 5110 days the measured mean nitrate concentrations in the observation well pv 2 ranged between 2 2 and 6 8 mg l fig 10 the simulated nitrate values are within order of magnitude and relatively close to measured values after four years they reach a steady state with a value of 5 2 mg l which is likely related to the influence of the drava river the groundwater flow is generally in n s direction in this part of the aquifer fig 2 although the yearly mean nitrate concentrations were used for calibration of the transport model both diagrams show good agreement between measured and simulated nitrate values overall assessment of model calibration showed that model performs reasonably well with me 1 7 mg l mae 5 2 mg l rmse 7 7 mg l and r2 0 96 for 84 measurements fig 11 therefore it was concluded that the developed nitrate transport model can be used to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater in response to future on ground nitrate input scenarios 3 3 prediction of future nitrate contamination the calibrated nitrate transport model was used for prediction models with simulation period from 2021 to 2040 under four different scenarios 1 no changes in the current on ground nitrate input 2 removal of nitrate input from wastewater 3 application of 50 of the current nitrate input to agricultural fields 4 cessation of on ground nitrate input from agriculture and urban areas with nitrate deriving from natural vegetation and surface water nitrogen input used in the transport model for each scenario table 1 was estimated using the calculated effective infiltration of precipitation karlović et al 2021a assigned nitrate concentrations to each land use group and corresponding land use area clc 2018 as a result the majority of nitrogen input to the groundwater in the first three scenarios come from agriculture 82 93 and 87 for the first second and third scenario respectively the spatial distribution of final nitrate values in year 2040 fig 12a d shows the continued decline of nitrate concentrations and further migration of the main contamination plume towards the east in regards to year 2020 fig 8 the time series of predicted nitrate concentrations in the observation wells pds 5 fig 13 and pv 2 fig 14 depict the evolution of nitrate concentrations for all four scenarios throughout the next 20 years according to the modeling results obtained with the first scenario the gradual decrease in nitrate concentration continues throughout the model especially in the central part where the expected nitrate value in the observation well pds 5 by the year 2040 is around 30 mg l fig 13 the northern part of the model is under the influence of the surface water and remains an area with low nitrate values generally under 15 mg l by the year 2040 fig 12a the situation at the observation well pv 2 remains the same with stabilization of nitrate value at 5 2 mg l reached at calibration phase fig 14 the results of the second scenario suggested that the removal of nitrate input from wastewater does not have great influence on nitrate concentrations in groundwater compared to the first scenario there are no significant changes in the spatial distribution of nitrate fig 12b and the predicted nitrate values at both observation wells are almost identical to the first scenario figs 12 and 13 the only difference is in the area of the varaždin city which represents urban land use class where the maximum nitrate concentration decreased from 64 mg l fig 12a to 59 mg l fig 12b in the year 2040 unlike the first two scenarios the analysis of third scenario showed that significant decrease of nitrate concentration in groundwater can be expected following a 50 reduction of nitrate input from agricultural areas fig 12c the nitrate values in observation well pds 5 were gradually decreased reaching 21 mg l in the year 2040 fig 13 the nitrate concentrations in the observation well pv 2 remained steady at 5 2 mg l as in the first two scenarios fig 14 the nitrate transport modeling of fourth scenario showed more pronounced decrease of nitrate concentrations in groundwater relative to other scenarios as expected fig 12d the model predicted constant decline of nitrate values in observation well pds 5 with value around 13 mg l in the year 2040 fig 13 barely noticeable decline is observed in the observation well pv 2 fig 14 confirming that this area is under dominant influence of the drava river however the results indicate the inertia of the system with respect to the time required for the aquifer to be gradually cleared of nitrate even with the unrealistic assumption of complete interruption of on ground nitrate input by the year 2040 most of the aquifer has nitrate concentrations below permissible limit of 50 mg l but the eastern part of the study area still has the elevated values with maximum of 56 mg l near the eastern model boundary fig 12d as a consequence of the slow contamination plume advance in the direction of groundwater flow 4 discussion and conclusions the developed groundwater flow and nitrate transport model of the varaždin aquifer provided the following conclusions 1 the steady state calibration of the groundwater flow model was acceptable according to residual statistics and water balance analysis water budget analysis provided better understanding and quantification of aquifer inflow and outflow the main aquifer recharge mechanism is the percolation of surface water with 68 while infiltration of precipitation has secondary effect with 32 of the total water inflow the total water outflow is distributed between derivation channel 43 plitvica stream 19 eastern model boundary 18 drava river 17 and vinokovšćak wellfield 3 2 a nitrate transport model was developed based on the calibrated flow model the advection is identified as the main transport process followed by dispersion while chemical reaction processes such as denitrification were not simulated the time series of the selected observation wells and calibration statistics show reasonable agreement between measured and simulated nitrate concentrations 3 the calibrated groundwater flow and transport model was used to investigate the evolution of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer for the next 20 years under four scenarios based on the changes in on ground nitrate input simulation results for all scenarios indicate that the groundwater quality regarding nitrate contamination in the northern part of the model domain including vinokovšćak wellfield will remain good mainly due to the dilution from the drava river with low nitrate concentration on the other hand the catchment area of the varaždin wellfield in central part of the aquifer is highly dependent on changing of the on ground nitrate input in this area there is a certain degree of inertia in terms of nitrate attenuation in groundwater even with the extreme scenario of zero on ground nitrate input from agriculture and urban areas although the nitrate contamination gradually decreases in the next 20 years neither of the scenarios reached nitrate concentrations below the mcl level of 50 mg l for the entire aquifer the studied nitrate contamination also has negative impact outside the study area the main contamination plume migrated to the eastern model boundary for all four scenarios further moving towards the main wellfield bartolovec situated downstream of the city of varaždin the scenario analysis demonstrated that reducing the nitrate input from agricultural areas yields a considerable reduction of nitrate in groundwater while the impact of wastewater is negligible which suggests that agriculture is a main nitrate pollutant in the study area therefore the management of the agricultural practices seems to be of critical importance towards the remediation of the groundwater quality in the varaždin aquifer 4 the regional scale methodology used to develop groundwater flow and transport model of varaždin aquifer was based on few simplifying assumptions since the aquifer was modeled in a steady state flow for medium groundwater levels and mean annual precipitation with steady on ground nitrate input in the transport model seasonal effects could not be expressed the amount of input data did not allow a detailed assessment of flow and transport parameters and their spatial distribution in each part of the varaždin aquifer so there are uncertainties related to assigned parameters in defined zones and their uniform values also the model lacks details on the on ground nitrate input as the estimated values are assigned to large areas according to the current land use map as a result the majority of nitrogen input to the groundwater in the first three scenarios is from agriculture due to its large share in land use and assigned nitrate concentrations despite these limitations the model produced indicative results for both groundwater flow and nitrate transport the methodology used in this study is applicable to most alluvial aquifers however the simplifying assumptions must be taken into consideration when applying the model to management issues this methodology can be employed for similar large scale studies to model the general impact of on ground nitrate input on groundwater contamination in watersheds with intensive agricultural activity 5 the work presented in this paper can be useful in understanding nitrate behavior in saturated zone of the aquifer however additional investigation of soil and unsaturated zone would upgrade the current understanding of nitrogen processes and achieve a better characterization of nitrate in the model future research efforts should focus on better estimation of nitrate input which eventually reaches the groundwater by utilizing a more detailed land use map preferably with individual agricultural fields and by modeling nitrogen transformation processes in unsaturated zone although nitrate concentrations are measured four times a year and were averaged within this work for the purpose of calibration they still experience seasonal changes in order to simulate these fine oscillations finer discretization in both spatial and temporal domains would be required which is currently limited by available data but is certainly the subject of future research the upgraded model could serve as an effective tool for formulating management strategies and specific measures to reduce nitrate pollution from agriculture in the varaždin aquifer system generally specific measures would include fertilization optimization considering the rates application timing and methods effective management of manure from farms rational use of irrigation methods according to crop water demand and implementation of other good agricultural practices recommendations according to the nitrate directive 91 676 eec finally agriculture is a very important activity in the study area and economic aspect of these measures should not be neglected the management strategies should consider improvement of groundwater quality but not at the expense of agricultural production this seems to be a key step for farmers to adopt the codes of good agricultural practices enabling better management of

isotope 1 introduction nitrogen released during snowmelt have serious impacts on soil and aquatic ecosystems townsend small et al 2011 especially in watersheds with heavy agricultural activities in which the soil moisture and n conditions before snowmelt are highly influenced by agricultural water management i e irrigation and drainage activities and fertilization valipour 2015 2016a 2016b shi et al 2016 yao et al 2016 accordingly identifying the nitrogen migration paths source areas and critical influencing factors during the snowmelt period is of great importance to water and nitrogen management in these regions nitrogen distribution in snow soil and hydrology processes which are affected by a variety of factors during freezing and thawing processes are major factors affecting nitrogen loss and retention at the watershed scale during the snowmelt period zhao et al 2017 costa et al 2021 d amario et al 2021 painter et al 2021 from the micro perspective the freeze thaw process during unstable freezing and early melting periods significantly affects the conversion of soil nitrogen song et al 2017 gao et al 2018 during the freezing period the upward movement of soil water affected by temperature potential will result in a gathering of water and nitrogen at the surface soil bing et al 2015 nitrogen preferential elution processes always occur at the begging of snowmelt and result in a pulse of nitrogen export costa et al 2018 2021 in addition the existence of frozen soil with low permeability prolongs the contact time between snowmelt water and surface soil with high nitrogen content and may increase the extraction of nitrogen from soil creed et al 1998 zhao et al 2017 from a macro perspective the underlying surface of agricultural watershed is complex and nitrogen sources and hydrological processes are quite different among farmland rural areas and forests jiang et al 2010 2012 wilson et al 2019 even in farmland the distribution of soil water nitrogen and hydrological processes are quite different due to the differences in irrigation fertilization and cultivation ouyang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 additionally the processes of soil freezing and thawing as well as wind blowing snow will also enhance these differences williams et al 1998 cheng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 furthermore basic terrain characters of watersheds such as the slope and aspect will also affect the distribution of snow cover and the absorption of solar radiation energy which in turn affects the sources and export paths of water and nitrogen hinckley et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b factors affecting the production of water and nitrogen during the process of snowmelt are distinct at different snowmelt periods liu et al 2013 kepski et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 for example the nitrogen preferential elution processes nitrogen content of surface soil and the reduction of frozen soil on infiltration are controlling factors of water and nitrogen export during the early snowmelt period ireson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 costa et al 2018 however the water and nitrogen sources and migration paths will change with the melting of snow and frozen soil creed et al 1998 zhao et al 2021 previous studies in this watershed have also shown that no3 n export was mainly from maize fields that were distributed on steeper terrain with shorter flow paths and that nh4 n export mainly occurred during the early melt stages and was mainly from the riverside rural areas zhao et al 2017 thus the water and nitrogen export processes are quite different during different snowmelt periods for instance hayakawa et al 2003 found that during the early snowmelt period the nitrogen concentration changed drastically and the nh4 n concentration was higher than the no3 n concentration while the opposite results were observed during the later period darrouzet nardi et al 2012 reported that a substantial quantity of no3 n entered the stream during the early snowmelt period much less no3 n was released after this initial pulse and the nitrogen sources also changed liu et al 2013 found that the flow weighted mean concentration of total nitrogen in early and late snowmelt runoff were mostly affected by nitrogen application rate and swe respectively the above studies mostly divided the snowmelt period based on snowmelt runoff volume hayakawa et al 2003 darrouzet nardi et al 2012 liu et al 2013 2017 or hydrological and meteorological variabilities zhao et al 2017 neglecting the fact that the sources and migration paths of water and nitrogen were not synchronized and the controlling factors were different in most cases zhao et al 2017 friesen hughes et al 2021 using these methods may induce certain deviations or mistakes when studying nitrogen sources export processes or influencing factors at different snowmelt periods nonetheless hydrological processes remain the main driver of nitrogen production during snowmelt runoff zhao et al 2017 sorensen et al 2020 confirming the sources and migration paths of water is usually a prerequisite to study the nitrogen export processes jiang et al 2010 hinckley et al 2014 cheng et al 2021 d amario et al 2021 stable isotopic δ18 o is a useful tool to identify the water sources and contributions runoff pathways residence times and characteristics of hydrological systems during snowmelt runoff yang et al 2012 penna et al 2017 samuel et al 2021 therefore researching the variation in and relationship between water δ18 o and nitrogen concentrations may be an effective way to identify the origin and migration pathway of nitrogen during different snowmelt periods in this study discharge stream water δ18 o nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were monitored during the snowmelt periods of 2015 and 2016 in the 75 km2 seasonal freezing agricultural heidingzi watershed in northeastern china to 1 confirm whether the nitrogen source areas and migration paths have changed with the melting of snow and frozen soil 2 find an effective way to recognize the change points and separate nitrogen export processes to different periods during snowmelt with consideration of variations in the discharge δ18 o values and nitrogen concentration and 3 identify the source areas migration paths and critical influencing factors of nh4 n and no3 n in river water during these snowmelt periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the study was conducted within the heidingzi watershed 125 34 27 125 42 22 e 43 22 48 43 29 37 n in shuangyang district changchun jilin province china which has a basin area of 75 25 km2 maize fields forests rural areas and paddy fields are major land uses accounting for 69 1 14 0 12 5 and 4 4 of the total area respectively according to monitoring data collected at shuangyang district meteorological station from 1951 to 2016 the average annual precipitation and temperature are 624 7 mm and 4 8 c respectively the freezing period lasts from mid november to early march and the mean precipitation and temperature are 31 8 mm and 10 5 c respectively the precipitation and air temperatures during the study periods thawing periods are shown in fig 2 a five enclosed sub basins sb1 sb5 within the watershed were chosen for this study fig 1 the information describing these experimental sub basins is presented in table 1 2 2 sample collection and chemical analysis monitoring sections were set up at the outlet of the watershed and five sub basins at which water sample collection and flow discharge measurements were conducted daily during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 soil moisture freezing and thawing depth were measured by collecting soil samples from paddy and maize fields before and after freezing periods snow samples were collected before snowmelt march 11 13 2015 march 3 5 2016 and rain water was collected during the late melt period the temperature and precipitation were monitored at the shuangyang weather station located 5 9 km northwest of the heidingzi watershed outlet the monitoring sections and soil sampling points are shown in fig 1 water samples were filtered through 0 25 µm membrane filters and sent to the laboratory immediately after collection where they were kept frozen until analysis soil samples were obtained by artificial soil drilling before freezing and with a power sampling drill 10 cm in diameter after freezing thaw depths were measured by a steel probe with scale marks the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were determined for both watershed and sub basins during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 using a cleverchem 200 automatic continuous analyzer dechem tech gmbh hamburg germany stable oxygen isotopes of water samples from the watershed in 2015 and 2016 and sb3 and sb4 in 2016 were analyzed using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms paired with a thermal combustion elemental analyzer tc ea mat 253 thermo finnigan instrument inc germany the results were expressed using δ notation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as shown in eq 1 the precision of δ18 o measurement was 0 2 discharge i e flow rate at the sb or watershed outlets was measured using a

tested via analysis of variance anova because there are multicollinear relationships between land uses and topographical factors coefficients of principal component regression between land uses topographical factors and discharge nitrogen concentration and nitrogen yield during different snowmelt periods were calculated to identify the major affecting factors both the variance and principal component regression analysis were conducted using spss 17 3 results 3 1 hydrology and n concentration variation during the snowmelt period water discharge nitrogen concentration and climatic factors during the thawing period are shown in fig 2 the hydrographs of sub basins fig 2c g were similar to that of the entire watershed fig 2b in 2015 a sharp increase in discharge occurred in the middle of march when the temperature increased from 2 4 2 7 c with the peak discharge occurring on days 2 5 after the snowmelt the maximum discharges of the entire watershed and sub basin outlets were 964 1 m3 d km2 and 301 6 1204 9 m3 s respectively these discharges were followed by a decrease to 80 8 m3 d km2 and 76 6 284 7 m3 d km2 3 5 days later when the air temperature fell below the freezing point a second peak of snowmelt in 2015 occurred at the end of march when there was an obvious increase in temperature and the maximum discharge of the entire watershed and sub basin outlet was 377 0 m3 d km2 and 168 2 653 0 m3 d km2 respectively the following rain events were low and did not generate significant runoff in 2016 the hydrograph was similar to that of 2016 except that a rain on snowmelt event occurred between march 3 and march 7 which induced a short term snowmelt event the three peak discharges which occurred during the early melt period march 6 7 march 15 18 and late melt period march 25 30 were 192 4 378 9 and 246 1 m3 d km2 for the entire watershed s outlet and 103 9 475 7 253 2 661 5 and 187 1 476 7 m3 d km2 for the sub basins outlets respectively during the snowmelt period of 2015 the concentrations of nh4 n were generally highest at the beginning of the snowmelt runoff then decreased as the snowmelt progressed the no3 n concentrations increased with the yield of snowmelt water peaked on the rising limb or peak point of discharge during the early snowmelt period then decreased the variations in nh4 n concentration with discharge were greater than those of the no3 n concentration during the snowmelt period of 2016 the variations in nh4 n and no3 n concentration were basically the same with most being highest during the rain on snowmelt events or at the beginning of continuous snowmelt runoff however the no3 n concentration variation trend of sub basin 4 was quite different from other sub basins in that it was maintained at a high level without decreasing throughout the observation period the discharge was higher during the snowmelt period in 2015 than during the snowmelt period in 2016 p 0 05 except for sub basin 4 additionally the water yield of the entire watershed was lower than those of most sub basins and the water yield of sub basin 4 was lower than those of the other basins but the difference was not significant p 0 05 the discharge weighted mean ammonium nitrate nitrogen concentrations of sub basin 1 to sub basin 5 were 0 55 3 58 mg l in 2015 and 0 84 3 24 mg l in 2016 the mean nh4 n concentrations were significantly higher at the watershed outlet than those at the outlets of the sub basins during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 p 0 05 the mean nh4 n and no3 n concentrations at the outlet of sub basin 4 except for nh4 n concentration in 2016 were significantly higher than most of the other sub basins p 0 05 the nitrogen export of sub basin 4 was higher than that of the other sub basins except for the nh4 n export of sub basin 2 and no3 n export of sub basin 5 in 2016 but the differences was not significant p 0 05 3 2 stable oxygen isotope variation during the snowmelt period the water stable oxygen isotopes of stream water and different water sources are shown in table 3 the δ18 o values of snow were lowest at the beginning of the snowmelt period in both 2015 and 2016 and showed no significant differences the average δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period of 2016 was 7 9 which had no significant difference between soil water 8 1 1 0 and rain water 7 6 1 4 and was significantly higher than the δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period of 2015 11 5 1 1 stream water stable oxygen isotope variation during the snowmelt period is shown in fig 3 the δ18 o appeared to drop briefly then rose sharply at the beginning of snowmelt and this rising trend lasted 4 5 days in 2016 and 11 days in 2015 the lowest δ18 o during the thawing period of 2015 which appeared at the peak point of discharge was 13 67 while the lowest δ18 o values during the thawing period of 2016 appeared during the rain on snowmelt events and were 9 15 9 45 and 9 55 for the watershed outlet sub basin 3 and sub basin 4 respectively the δ18 o increased gradually after the obvious snowmelt period then decreased when rain events appeared the δ18 o of the entire watershed rose significantly faster than those of the sub basins the amplitude of variation of δ18 o during the thawing period of 2015 4 09 was much higher than those of 2016 being 2 64 1 88 and 2 08 for the whole watershed sub basin 3 and sub basin 4 respectively 3 3 the relationship between discharge stable oxygen isotope and nitrogen concentration as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the nitrogen concentration and discharge changed across a wide range at the begging of snowmelt but the relationship was not obvious however the nitrogen concentration had a linear relationship with δ18 o at the beginning of snowmelt and both values changed basically in one direction except for the first day following this period the nitrogen concentration and δ18 o changed back and forth within a small range especially the nitrogen concentration in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen export stages separated by the relationship between δ18 o values and nitrogen concentration the nitrogen concentrations were high and rapidly decreased at the beginning of snowmelt fig 2 this may have been a result of nitrogen preferential elution and a flushing effect the ice crystal metamorphism forces and relocation of ions within the snowpack could induce preferential elution of solutes into melt water lilbæk et al 2008 costa et al 2018 resulting in the nitrogen concentration of snowmelt water rapidly reaching the maximum value and then decreasing exponentially costa et al 2020 in addition the nitrogen content of surface soil was always higher than that of deeper layers because of fertilizer application liu et al 2020 han et al 2018 as well as the upward movement of nitrogen from lower layers along with soil water during freezing process han et al 2018 the contact of early snowmelt water and surface soil induced by the restriction of frozen soil lasted for days and nitrogen in soil was leached out zhao et al 2017 subsequently rapid lateral flow carried the leached nitrogen to rivers via surface saturation excess runoff in riparian zones and subsurface or near surface flow on hillslopes rusjan et al 2008 jiang et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 the nh4 n concentration and export of the whole watershed was significantly higher than those of sub basins this occurred because there were composting sites along the bank of the main stream that contained large amounts of nh4 n and had easy access to the river zhao et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the no3 n concentration and export of sub basin 4 were higher than those of the other sub basins and were maintained at a high level without decreasing throughout the snowmelt period table 2 fig 2 the reason for this phenomenon was that the proportion of farmland and the amount of fertilization per unit area in each basin were basically the same but the average slope of farmland in sub basin 4 was lower than those of other sub basins table 1 therefore the loss of water and nitrogen via surface runoff during the crop growing periods was reduced and more water and nitrogen were stored in soil via infiltration in sub watershed 4 fig 6 during the snowmelt period the lateral movement of water and nitrogen was dominant because of the existing of freezing soil laine kaulio et al 2015 and thus the no3 n export was higher in sub basin 4 the δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period was significantly lower in 2015 than in 2016 p 0 05 table 3 the δ18 o of discharge was lowest at the beginning of snowmelt and then rose rapidly and the increase in δ18 o value in the runoff lasted 6 7 days longer in 2015 than in 2016 fig 3 one of the reasons for this finding was that the accumulated precipitation occurred during the stable freezing period was higher in 2015 54 1 mm than that in 2016 25 4 mm and the δ18 o values of snow samples was lower in 2015 13 5 2 2 and 12 8 2 7 in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 3 an obvious temperature rise event occurred during march 1 6 2016 which induced the melting of part of the snow zhao et al 2021 the δ18 o in the remaining snow before obvious snowmelt increased because of the isotopic exchange between liquid and ice in the snow feng et al 2002 lee at al 2010 furthermore as the temperature rose the snow and frozen soil melted and the high δ18 o value soil water 8 1 1 0 table 3 that originated from lower soil layers during the freezing process was released and mixed with snowmelt water ireson et al 2013 bing et al 2015 frozen soil with ice blocked soil pores can greatly reduce soil infiltration suzuki et al 2006 ireson et al 2013 leading to saturation of the surface soil and ponding of surface water the rapidly increasing temperature also contributed to the increase in evaporative fractionation tian et al 2018 gaj et al 2019 and increased the δ18 o value in runoff as shown in table 4 the daily average temperature during the early snowmelt period of 2015 was 4 2 c lower than in 2016 a higher amount of accumulated snow along with lower temperature resulted in a higher proportion of snowmelt water in runoff a longer snowmelt period a lower soil melt rate and extended mixing of snowmelt water and surface soil water during the early snowmelt period of 2015 thus the δ18 o value in runoff was lower and the increase trend lasted longer as discussed above the variations of nitrogen and δ18 o values in the discharge were both controlled by the melting rate of snow and frozen soil at the beginning of snowmelt therefore the nitrogen concentration had a linear relationship with the δ18 o value of discharge water fig 5 during the later period of snowmelt the flow path shifted from near surface soil to subsurface soil the flushing effect of nitrogen was restricted therefore the nitrogen concentration was greatly reduced wright et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 the fluctuation within a small range of nitrogen and δ18o may have been induced by the influx and mixing of water and nitrogen from distant areas considering these significant differences the snowmelt periods can be dived into early and late according to the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration the duration of early snowmelt periods in 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 4 the method has the following advantages over separating snowmelt periods using hydrological and meteorological variables or the relationship between discharge and nitrogen 1 the δ18 o values of discharge changed in one direction and in a more discriminative way which made it easy to identify turning point with fewer mistakes caused by subjective judgment 2 water nitrogen source and variations in migration path were difficult to identify by their changes in value fig 2 and fig 4 but they can be easily recognized by the changes in the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration however the data of stream water δ18 o was not easily accessible and it was found that the thaw depth of soil and cumulative temperature were 11 18 cm and around 30 c respectively at the early snowmelt period table 4 which may be able to replace stream water δ18 o to separate the nitrogen export stages during snowmelt however a longer time series of data is needed to confirm this possibility water and nitrogen yield during the early and late snowmelt periods are shown in table 5 the early snowmelt period contributed 47 37 and 33 74 of the water discharge 67 20 and 56 29 of the nh4 n yield and 70 98 and 57 08 of the no3 n yield of the snowmelt period at the outlet of the watershed in 2015 and 2016 respectively during the early snowmelt period of 2015 the average water nh4 n and no3 n yields of 5 sub basins were 31497 04 m3 22 65 kg and 166 80 kg respectively representing 46 96 55 98 and 58 39 of the total amount of whole snowmelt period during the early snowmelt period of 2016 the average yields of water nh4 n and no3 n for five sub basins were 14308 09 m3 21 35 kg and 61 17 kg respectively or 36 48 60 24 and 44 23 of the total amount of whole snowmelt period respectively this was similar to the study results reported by kepski et al 2016 and lazarcik et al 2017 that much more nitrogen was yielded by less water during early snowmelt period 4 2 nitrogen source areas and critical influencing factors during different snowmelt periods the coefficients of principal component regression between land uses topographical factors and discharge nitrogen concentration and yield in the early late and yearly snowmelt runoff of sub basins 1 5 in 2015 a and 2016 b are shown in fig 7 the average r2 are 0 79 and 0 78 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although part of the fit did not reach the level of significance the magnitude of the regression coefficients still can be used to characterize the impact of variations in discharge and nitrogen concentration and yield to a certain extent ma et al 2021 overall pfp rap as sap 2 and sap 6 15 were found to be major factors affecting water yield nitrogen concentration and yield during the snowmelt period in both 2015 and 2016 areas closer to the river sap 2 and sap 2 6 had greater positive effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and negative effects on discharge fig 7 while sap 6 had the opposite effect this could have occurred because the snowmelt water was mainly expended by soil saturation and depression detention in areas with gentle slopes and the nitrogen in topsoil were extracted by snowmelt water during the long term contact between them welsch et al 2001 the steeper areas were prone to generate snowmelt surface or subsurface runoff creed et al 1988 which flowed into areas with gentle slopes and mixed with the relatively high nh4 n and no3 n concentration water then migrated into the river via surface or subsurface flow leading to the nitrogen flushing effect as discussed above zhao et al 2017 in addition sap 2 and sap 2 6 had weaker negative effects on nitrogen yield than that of discharge during early snowmelt periods and positive effects on both nitrogen yield and concentration during the late snowmelt period and yearly snowmelt period these findings indicate that the reserves of nitrogen in areas near the river were abundant and compensated for the negative impact of water shortage on nitrogen yield during early snowmelt periods this explains why the nitrogen yield of the watershed during the early snowmelt period was about 20 higher than that of the water in both 2015 and 2016 the corresponding average differences between the discharge and ammonium nitrate nitrogen yields of the sub basins were 9 02 and 11 43 in 2015 and 23 76 and 7 75 in 2016 respectively rap had negative effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and yield during early snowmelt periods and positive effects during late snowmelt periods except for no3 n concentration in 2016 in both 2015 and 2016 the reason could be that water and nitrogen in this area came mainly from domestic sewage and snowmelt water domestic sewage characterized by high nh4 n and low no3 n concentration was continually discharged and frozen in cesspools and drainage ditches during freezing period wang et al 2011 lekshmi et al 2015 snow covered areas can be divided into areas where snow gathers such as courtyards and pavement where the covered snow would be swept and accumulate in a certain area and snow scattered areas such as roofs gardens and uncultivated lands where snow was undisturbed and of which the average nh4 n and no3 n concentration in 2015 and 2016 were 1 21 0 50 mg l and 1 72 1 10 mg l respectively these values were quite lower than those of stream water during early snowmelt periods fig 7 during the early snowmelt period the areas with scattered snowpack received more solar radiation marks et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 and generated snowmelt water with lower nitrogen concentrations high concrete ground areas and frozen drainage ditches greatly reduced the interception and infiltration chitsazan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a 2020b thus rap had positive effects on discharge and negative effects on nitrogen concentration during early snowmelt periods during the late snowmelt period the water and nitrogen from this area came mostly from the melting of frozen domestic sewage in cesspools or drainage ditches and snow gathering areas this ice stored water was more concentrated and compact compared with snow and subjected to less solar radiation thus resulting in a long lasting high nh4 n and low no3 n concentration water yield process kane and slaughter 1972 zhao et al 2021 the differences in discharge during the early snowmelt period and the no3 n concentration during the late snowmelt period of 2016 were attributed to a temperature rise and rain on snow event during march 1 6 2016 zhao et al 2021 this event induced some of the accumulated snow to melt and refreeze as ice in drainage ditches thus reducing discharge during the early snowmelt period of 2016 zhao et al 2021 the refrozen snowmelt water contained high no3 n because of the nitrogen preferential elution effect and it contributed to the no3 n yield during the late snowmelt period costa et al 2018 pittman et al 2020 the pfp also distributed along the rivers and had dense drainage ditches thus it had similar effects on discharge and nitrogen yield process as pfp except for nitrogen concentration during early snowmelt period and discharge during late snowmelt period in 2015 this was because the snowmelt water in paddy fields may attach to soil for days before migrating into the river and extracted the nh4 n and no3 n from the paddy fields during the late snowmelt period the water contribution was greatly reduced because of the thawing of soil just as sap 2 zhao et al 2017 5 conclusion this research finds that the variation of δ18 o can synthetically characterize the information of temperature variation snow soil melting and flow paths changing the nitrogen export process during snowmelt period can be divided into two stages according to the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration pfp rap as sap 2 and sap 6 15 were the major factors affecting the water discharge nitrogen concentration and yield the nh4 n and no3 n that were released into the river were mostly driven by the water from steeper areas slope 6 while sap 6 along the river consumed the water and nitrogen the reserves of nitrogen in areas near the river were abundant and they compensated for the negative impact of water shortage on nitrogen yield during early snowmelt periods rap had negative effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and yield during early snowmelt periods and positive effects during late snowmelt periods except for no3 n concentration in 2016 paddy fields had the combined characteristics of rural and lower slope areas and had similar effects on discharge nitrogen concentration and yield to them the general results from this study are of great significance to the study and control of non point nitrogen pollution in these regions credit authorship contribution

isotope 1 introduction nitrogen released during snowmelt have serious impacts on soil and aquatic ecosystems townsend small et al 2011 especially in watersheds with heavy agricultural activities in which the soil moisture and n conditions before snowmelt are highly influenced by agricultural water management i e irrigation and drainage activities and fertilization valipour 2015 2016a 2016b shi et al 2016 yao et al 2016 accordingly identifying the nitrogen migration paths source areas and critical influencing factors during the snowmelt period is of great importance to water and nitrogen management in these regions nitrogen distribution in snow soil and hydrology processes which are affected by a variety of factors during freezing and thawing processes are major factors affecting nitrogen loss and retention at the watershed scale during the snowmelt period zhao et al 2017 costa et al 2021 d amario et al 2021 painter et al 2021 from the micro perspective the freeze thaw process during unstable freezing and early melting periods significantly affects the conversion of soil nitrogen song et al 2017 gao et al 2018 during the freezing period the upward movement of soil water affected by temperature potential will result in a gathering of water and nitrogen at the surface soil bing et al 2015 nitrogen preferential elution processes always occur at the begging of snowmelt and result in a pulse of nitrogen export costa et al 2018 2021 in addition the existence of frozen soil with low permeability prolongs the contact time between snowmelt water and surface soil with high nitrogen content and may increase the extraction of nitrogen from soil creed et al 1998 zhao et al 2017 from a macro perspective the underlying surface of agricultural watershed is complex and nitrogen sources and hydrological processes are quite different among farmland rural areas and forests jiang et al 2010 2012 wilson et al 2019 even in farmland the distribution of soil water nitrogen and hydrological processes are quite different due to the differences in irrigation fertilization and cultivation ouyang et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 additionally the processes of soil freezing and thawing as well as wind blowing snow will also enhance these differences williams et al 1998 cheng et al 2021 wang et al 2021 furthermore basic terrain characters of watersheds such as the slope and aspect will also affect the distribution of snow cover and the absorption of solar radiation energy which in turn affects the sources and export paths of water and nitrogen hinckley et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a 2020b factors affecting the production of water and nitrogen during the process of snowmelt are distinct at different snowmelt periods liu et al 2013 kepski et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 for example the nitrogen preferential elution processes nitrogen content of surface soil and the reduction of frozen soil on infiltration are controlling factors of water and nitrogen export during the early snowmelt period ireson et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 costa et al 2018 however the water and nitrogen sources and migration paths will change with the melting of snow and frozen soil creed et al 1998 zhao et al 2021 previous studies in this watershed have also shown that no3 n export was mainly from maize fields that were distributed on steeper terrain with shorter flow paths and that nh4 n export mainly occurred during the early melt stages and was mainly from the riverside rural areas zhao et al 2017 thus the water and nitrogen export processes are quite different during different snowmelt periods for instance hayakawa et al 2003 found that during the early snowmelt period the nitrogen concentration changed drastically and the nh4 n concentration was higher than the no3 n concentration while the opposite results were observed during the later period darrouzet nardi et al 2012 reported that a substantial quantity of no3 n entered the stream during the early snowmelt period much less no3 n was released after this initial pulse and the nitrogen sources also changed liu et al 2013 found that the flow weighted mean concentration of total nitrogen in early and late snowmelt runoff were mostly affected by nitrogen application rate and swe respectively the above studies mostly divided the snowmelt period based on snowmelt runoff volume hayakawa et al 2003 darrouzet nardi et al 2012 liu et al 2013 2017 or hydrological and meteorological variabilities zhao et al 2017 neglecting the fact that the sources and migration paths of water and nitrogen were not synchronized and the controlling factors were different in most cases zhao et al 2017 friesen hughes et al 2021 using these methods may induce certain deviations or mistakes when studying nitrogen sources export processes or influencing factors at different snowmelt periods nonetheless hydrological processes remain the main driver of nitrogen production during snowmelt runoff zhao et al 2017 sorensen et al 2020 confirming the sources and migration paths of water is usually a prerequisite to study the nitrogen export processes jiang et al 2010 hinckley et al 2014 cheng et al 2021 d amario et al 2021 stable isotopic δ18 o is a useful tool to identify the water sources and contributions runoff pathways residence times and characteristics of hydrological systems during snowmelt runoff yang et al 2012 penna et al 2017 samuel et al 2021 therefore researching the variation in and relationship between water δ18 o and nitrogen concentrations may be an effective way to identify the origin and migration pathway of nitrogen during different snowmelt periods in this study discharge stream water δ18 o nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were monitored during the snowmelt periods of 2015 and 2016 in the 75 km2 seasonal freezing agricultural heidingzi watershed in northeastern china to 1 confirm whether the nitrogen source areas and migration paths have changed with the melting of snow and frozen soil 2 find an effective way to recognize the change points and separate nitrogen export processes to different periods during snowmelt with consideration of variations in the discharge δ18 o values and nitrogen concentration and 3 identify the source areas migration paths and critical influencing factors of nh4 n and no3 n in river water during these snowmelt periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the study was conducted within the heidingzi watershed 125 34 27 125 42 22 e 43 22 48 43 29 37 n in shuangyang district changchun jilin province china which has a basin area of 75 25 km2 maize fields forests rural areas and paddy fields are major land uses accounting for 69 1 14 0 12 5 and 4 4 of the total area respectively according to monitoring data collected at shuangyang district meteorological station from 1951 to 2016 the average annual precipitation and temperature are 624 7 mm and 4 8 c respectively the freezing period lasts from mid november to early march and the mean precipitation and temperature are 31 8 mm and 10 5 c respectively the precipitation and air temperatures during the study periods thawing periods are shown in fig 2 a five enclosed sub basins sb1 sb5 within the watershed were chosen for this study fig 1 the information describing these experimental sub basins is presented in table 1 2 2 sample collection and chemical analysis monitoring sections were set up at the outlet of the watershed and five sub basins at which water sample collection and flow discharge measurements were conducted daily during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 soil moisture freezing and thawing depth were measured by collecting soil samples from paddy and maize fields before and after freezing periods snow samples were collected before snowmelt march 11 13 2015 march 3 5 2016 and rain water was collected during the late melt period the temperature and precipitation were monitored at the shuangyang weather station located 5 9 km northwest of the heidingzi watershed outlet the monitoring sections and soil sampling points are shown in fig 1 water samples were filtered through 0 25 µm membrane filters and sent to the laboratory immediately after collection where they were kept frozen until analysis soil samples were obtained by artificial soil drilling before freezing and with a power sampling drill 10 cm in diameter after freezing thaw depths were measured by a steel probe with scale marks the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were determined for both watershed and sub basins during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 using a cleverchem 200 automatic continuous analyzer dechem tech gmbh hamburg germany stable oxygen isotopes of water samples from the watershed in 2015 and 2016 and sb3 and sb4 in 2016 were analyzed using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms paired with a thermal combustion elemental analyzer tc ea mat 253 thermo finnigan instrument inc germany the results were expressed using δ notation relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as shown in eq 1 the precision of δ18 o measurement was 0 2 discharge i e flow rate at the sb or watershed outlets was measured using a portable propeller type current meter ls 1206b droma mechanical and electrical corporation nanjing china soil moisture was determined by the oven drying method 1 δ 18 o o 18 o 16 s a m p l e o 18 o 16

tested via analysis of variance anova because there are multicollinear relationships between land uses and topographical factors coefficients of principal component regression between land uses topographical factors and discharge nitrogen concentration and nitrogen yield during different snowmelt periods were calculated to identify the major affecting factors both the variance and principal component regression analysis were conducted using spss 17 3 results 3 1 hydrology and n concentration variation during the snowmelt period water discharge nitrogen concentration and climatic factors during the thawing period are shown in fig 2 the hydrographs of sub basins fig 2c g were similar to that of the entire watershed fig 2b in 2015 a sharp increase in discharge occurred in the middle of march when the temperature increased from 2 4 2 7 c with the peak discharge occurring on days 2 5 after the snowmelt the maximum discharges of the entire watershed and sub basin outlets were 964 1 m3 d km2 and 301 6 1204 9 m3 s respectively these discharges were followed by a decrease to 80 8 m3 d km2 and 76 6 284 7 m3 d km2 3 5 days later when the air temperature fell below the freezing point a second peak of snowmelt in 2015 occurred at the end of march when there was an obvious increase in temperature and the maximum discharge of the entire watershed and sub basin outlet was 377 0 m3 d km2 and 168 2 653 0 m3 d km2 respectively the following rain events were low and did not generate significant runoff in 2016 the hydrograph was similar to that of 2016 except that a rain on snowmelt event occurred between march 3 and march 7 which induced a short term snowmelt event the three peak discharges which occurred during the early melt period march 6 7 march 15 18 and late melt period march 25 30 were 192 4 378 9 and 246 1 m3 d km2 for the entire watershed s outlet and 103 9 475 7 253 2 661 5 and 187 1 476 7 m3 d km2 for the sub basins outlets respectively during the snowmelt period of 2015 the concentrations of nh4 n were generally highest at the beginning of the snowmelt runoff then decreased as the snowmelt progressed the no3 n concentrations increased with the yield of snowmelt water peaked on the rising limb or peak point of discharge during the early snowmelt period then decreased the variations in nh4 n concentration with discharge were greater than those of the no3 n concentration during the snowmelt period of 2016 the variations in nh4 n and no3 n concentration were basically the same with most being highest during the rain on snowmelt events or at the beginning of continuous snowmelt runoff however the no3 n concentration variation trend of sub basin 4 was quite different from other sub basins in that it was maintained at a high level without decreasing throughout the observation period the discharge was higher during the snowmelt period in 2015 than during the snowmelt period in 2016 p 0 05 except for sub basin 4 additionally the water yield of the entire watershed was lower than those of most sub basins and the water yield of sub basin 4 was lower than those of the other basins but the difference was not significant p 0 05 the discharge weighted mean ammonium nitrate nitrogen concentrations of sub basin 1 to sub basin 5 were 0 55 3 58 mg l in 2015 and 0 84 3 24 mg l in 2016 the mean nh4 n concentrations were significantly higher at the watershed outlet than those at the outlets of the sub basins during the snowmelt period of 2015 and 2016 p 0 05 the mean nh4 n and no3 n concentrations at the outlet of sub basin 4 except for nh4 n concentration in 2016 were significantly higher than most of the other sub basins p 0 05 the nitrogen export of sub basin 4 was higher than that of the other sub basins except for the nh4 n export of sub basin 2 and no3 n export of sub basin 5 in 2016 but the differences was not significant p 0 05 3 2 stable oxygen isotope variation during the snowmelt period the water stable oxygen isotopes of stream water and different water sources are shown in table 3 the δ18 o values of snow were lowest at the beginning of the snowmelt period in both 2015 and 2016 and showed no significant differences the average δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period of 2016 was 7 9 which had no significant difference between soil water 8 1 1 0 and rain water 7 6 1 4 and was significantly higher than the δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period of 2015 11 5 1 1 stream water stable oxygen isotope variation during the snowmelt period is shown in fig 3 the δ18 o appeared to drop briefly then rose sharply at the beginning of snowmelt and this rising trend lasted 4 5 days in 2016 and 11 days in 2015 the lowest δ18 o during the thawing period of 2015 which appeared at the peak point of discharge was 13 67 while the lowest δ18 o values during the thawing period of 2016 appeared during the rain on snowmelt events and were 9 15 9 45 and 9 55 for the watershed outlet sub basin 3 and sub basin 4 respectively the δ18 o increased gradually after the obvious snowmelt period then decreased when rain events appeared the δ18 o of the entire watershed rose significantly faster than those of the sub basins the amplitude of variation of δ18 o during the thawing period of 2015 4 09 was much higher than those of 2016 being 2 64 1 88 and 2 08 for the whole watershed sub basin 3 and sub basin 4 respectively 3 3 the relationship between discharge stable oxygen isotope and nitrogen concentration as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the nitrogen concentration and discharge changed across a wide range at the begging of snowmelt but the relationship was not obvious however the nitrogen concentration had a linear relationship with δ18 o at the beginning of snowmelt and both values changed basically in one direction except for the first day following this period the nitrogen concentration and δ18 o changed back and forth within a small range especially the nitrogen concentration in 2016 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen export stages separated by the relationship between δ18 o values and nitrogen concentration the nitrogen concentrations were high and rapidly decreased at the beginning of snowmelt fig 2 this may have been a result of nitrogen preferential elution and a flushing effect the ice crystal metamorphism forces and relocation of ions within the snowpack could induce preferential elution of solutes into melt water lilbæk et al 2008 costa et al 2018 resulting in the nitrogen concentration of snowmelt water rapidly reaching the maximum value and then decreasing exponentially costa et al 2020 in addition the nitrogen content of surface soil was always higher than that of deeper layers because of fertilizer application liu et al 2020 han et al 2018 as well as the upward movement of nitrogen from lower layers along with soil water during freezing process han et al 2018 the contact of early snowmelt water and surface soil induced by the restriction of frozen soil lasted for days and nitrogen in soil was leached out zhao et al 2017 subsequently rapid lateral flow carried the leached nitrogen to rivers via surface saturation excess runoff in riparian zones and subsurface or near surface flow on hillslopes rusjan et al 2008 jiang et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 the nh4 n concentration and export of the whole watershed was significantly higher than those of sub basins this occurred because there were composting sites along the bank of the main stream that contained large amounts of nh4 n and had easy access to the river zhao et al 2017 yu et al 2019 the no3 n concentration and export of sub basin 4 were higher than those of the other sub basins and were maintained at a high level without decreasing throughout the snowmelt period table 2 fig 2 the reason for this phenomenon was that the proportion of farmland and the amount of fertilization per unit area in each basin were basically the same but the average slope of farmland in sub basin 4 was lower than those of other sub basins table 1 therefore the loss of water and nitrogen via surface runoff during the crop growing periods was reduced and more water and nitrogen were stored in soil via infiltration in sub watershed 4 fig 6 during the snowmelt period the lateral movement of water and nitrogen was dominant because of the existing of freezing soil laine kaulio et al 2015 and thus the no3 n export was higher in sub basin 4 the δ18 o of stream water during the snowmelt period was significantly lower in 2015 than in 2016 p 0 05 table 3 the δ18 o of discharge was lowest at the beginning of snowmelt and then rose rapidly and the increase in δ18 o value in the runoff lasted 6 7 days longer in 2015 than in 2016 fig 3 one of the reasons for this finding was that the accumulated precipitation occurred during the stable freezing period was higher in 2015 54 1 mm than that in 2016 25 4 mm and the δ18 o values of snow samples was lower in 2015 13 5 2 2 and 12 8 2 7 in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 3 an obvious temperature rise event occurred during march 1 6 2016 which induced the melting of part of the snow zhao et al 2021 the δ18 o in the remaining snow before obvious snowmelt increased because of the isotopic exchange between liquid and ice in the snow feng et al 2002 lee at al 2010 furthermore as the temperature rose the snow and frozen soil melted and the high δ18 o value soil water 8 1 1 0 table 3 that originated from lower soil layers during the freezing process was released and mixed with snowmelt water ireson et al 2013 bing et al 2015 frozen soil with ice blocked soil pores can greatly reduce soil infiltration suzuki et al 2006 ireson et al 2013 leading to saturation of the surface soil and ponding of surface water the rapidly increasing temperature also contributed to the increase in evaporative fractionation tian et al 2018 gaj et al 2019 and increased the δ18 o value in runoff as shown in table 4 the daily average temperature during the early snowmelt period of 2015 was 4 2 c lower than in 2016 a higher amount of accumulated snow along with lower temperature resulted in a higher proportion of snowmelt water in runoff a longer snowmelt period a lower soil melt rate and extended mixing of snowmelt water and surface soil water during the early snowmelt period of 2015 thus the δ18 o value in runoff was lower and the increase trend lasted longer as discussed above the variations of nitrogen and δ18 o values in the discharge were both controlled by the melting rate of snow and frozen soil at the beginning of snowmelt therefore the nitrogen concentration had a linear relationship with the δ18 o value of discharge water fig 5 during the later period of snowmelt the flow path shifted from near surface soil to subsurface soil the flushing effect of nitrogen was restricted therefore the nitrogen concentration was greatly reduced wright et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 the fluctuation within a small range of nitrogen and δ18o may have been induced by the influx and mixing of water and nitrogen from distant areas considering these significant differences the snowmelt periods can be dived into early and late according to the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration the duration of early snowmelt periods in 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 4 the method has the following advantages over separating snowmelt periods using hydrological and meteorological variables or the relationship between discharge and nitrogen 1 the δ18 o values of discharge changed in one direction and in a more discriminative way which made it easy to identify turning point with fewer mistakes caused by subjective judgment 2 water nitrogen source and variations in migration path were difficult to identify by their changes in value fig 2 and fig 4 but they can be easily recognized by the changes in the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration however the data of stream water δ18 o was not easily accessible and it was found that the thaw depth of soil and cumulative temperature were 11 18 cm and around 30 c respectively at the early snowmelt period table 4 which may be able to replace stream water δ18 o to separate the nitrogen export stages during snowmelt however a longer time series of data is needed to confirm this possibility water and nitrogen yield during the early and late snowmelt periods are shown in table 5 the early snowmelt period contributed 47 37 and 33 74 of the water discharge 67 20 and 56 29 of the nh4 n yield and 70 98 and 57 08 of the no3 n yield of the snowmelt period at the outlet of the watershed in 2015 and 2016 respectively during the early snowmelt period of 2015 the average water nh4 n and no3 n yields of 5 sub basins were 31497 04 m3 22 65 kg and 166 80 kg respectively representing 46 96 55 98 and 58 39 of the total amount of whole snowmelt period during the early snowmelt period of 2016 the average yields of water nh4 n and no3 n for five sub basins were 14308 09 m3 21 35 kg and 61 17 kg respectively or 36 48 60 24 and 44 23 of the total amount of whole snowmelt period respectively this was similar to the study results reported by kepski et al 2016 and lazarcik et al 2017 that much more nitrogen was yielded by less water during early snowmelt period 4 2 nitrogen source areas and critical influencing factors during different snowmelt periods the coefficients of principal component regression between land uses topographical factors and discharge nitrogen concentration and yield in the early late and yearly snowmelt runoff of sub basins 1 5 in 2015 a and 2016 b are shown in fig 7 the average r2 are 0 79 and 0 78 in 2015 and 2016 respectively although part of the fit did not reach the level of significance the magnitude of the regression coefficients still can be used to characterize the impact of variations in discharge and nitrogen concentration and yield to a certain extent ma et al 2021 overall pfp rap as sap 2 and sap 6 15 were found to be major factors affecting water yield nitrogen concentration and yield during the snowmelt period in both 2015 and 2016 areas closer to the river sap 2 and sap 2 6 had greater positive effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and negative effects on discharge fig 7 while sap 6 had the opposite effect this could have occurred because the snowmelt water was mainly expended by soil saturation and depression detention in areas with gentle slopes and the nitrogen in topsoil were extracted by snowmelt water during the long term contact between them welsch et al 2001 the steeper areas were prone to generate snowmelt surface or subsurface runoff creed et al 1988 which flowed into areas with gentle slopes and mixed with the relatively high nh4 n and no3 n concentration water then migrated into the river via surface or subsurface flow leading to the nitrogen flushing effect as discussed above zhao et al 2017 in addition sap 2 and sap 2 6 had weaker negative effects on nitrogen yield than that of discharge during early snowmelt periods and positive effects on both nitrogen yield and concentration during the late snowmelt period and yearly snowmelt period these findings indicate that the reserves of nitrogen in areas near the river were abundant and compensated for the negative impact of water shortage on nitrogen yield during early snowmelt periods this explains why the nitrogen yield of the watershed during the early snowmelt period was about 20 higher than that of the water in both 2015 and 2016 the corresponding average differences between the discharge and ammonium nitrate nitrogen yields of the sub basins were 9 02 and 11 43 in 2015 and 23 76 and 7 75 in 2016 respectively rap had negative effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and yield during early snowmelt periods and positive effects during late snowmelt periods except for no3 n concentration in 2016 in both 2015 and 2016 the reason could be that water and nitrogen in this area came mainly from domestic sewage and snowmelt water domestic sewage characterized by high nh4 n and low no3 n concentration was continually discharged and frozen in cesspools and drainage ditches during freezing period wang et al 2011 lekshmi et al 2015 snow covered areas can be divided into areas where snow gathers such as courtyards and pavement where the covered snow would be swept and accumulate in a certain area and snow scattered areas such as roofs gardens and uncultivated lands where snow was undisturbed and of which the average nh4 n and no3 n concentration in 2015 and 2016 were 1 21 0 50 mg l and 1 72 1 10 mg l respectively these values were quite lower than those of stream water during early snowmelt periods fig 7 during the early snowmelt period the areas with scattered snowpack received more solar radiation marks et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 and generated snowmelt water with lower nitrogen concentrations high concrete ground areas and frozen drainage ditches greatly reduced the interception and infiltration chitsazan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a 2020b thus rap had positive effects on discharge and negative effects on nitrogen concentration during early snowmelt periods during the late snowmelt period the water and nitrogen from this area came mostly from the melting of frozen domestic sewage in cesspools or drainage ditches and snow gathering areas this ice stored water was more concentrated and compact compared with snow and subjected to less solar radiation thus resulting in a long lasting high nh4 n and low no3 n concentration water yield process kane and slaughter 1972 zhao et al 2021 the differences in discharge during the early snowmelt period and the no3 n concentration during the late snowmelt period of 2016 were attributed to a temperature rise and rain on snow event during march 1 6 2016 zhao et al 2021 this event induced some of the accumulated snow to melt and refreeze as ice in drainage ditches thus reducing discharge during the early snowmelt period of 2016 zhao et al 2021 the refrozen snowmelt water contained high no3 n because of the nitrogen preferential elution effect and it contributed to the no3 n yield during the late snowmelt period costa et al 2018 pittman et al 2020 the pfp also distributed along the rivers and had dense drainage ditches thus it had similar effects on discharge and nitrogen yield process as pfp except for nitrogen concentration during early snowmelt period and discharge during late snowmelt period in 2015 this was because the snowmelt water in paddy fields may attach to soil for days before migrating into the river and extracted the nh4 n and no3 n from the paddy fields during the late snowmelt period the water contribution was greatly reduced because of the thawing of soil just as sap 2 zhao et al 2017 5 conclusion this research finds that the variation of δ18 o can synthetically characterize the information of temperature variation snow soil melting and flow paths changing the nitrogen export process during snowmelt period can be divided into two stages according to the relationship between δ18 o and nitrogen concentration pfp rap as sap 2 and sap 6 15 were the major factors affecting the water discharge nitrogen concentration and yield the nh4 n and no3 n that were released into the river were mostly driven by the water from steeper areas slope 6 while sap 6 along the river consumed the water and nitrogen the reserves of nitrogen in areas near the river were abundant and they compensated for the negative impact of water shortage on nitrogen yield during early snowmelt periods rap had negative effects on nh4 n and no3 n concentration and yield during early snowmelt periods and positive effects during late snowmelt periods except for no3 n concentration in 2016 paddy fields had the combined characteristics of rural and lower slope areas and had similar effects on discharge nitrogen concentration and yield to them the general results from this study are of great significance to the study and control of non point nitrogen pollution in these regions credit authorship contribution

7969,study region north china plain ncp china study focus this paper investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater storage gws changes in the ncp during 2003 2020 using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global navigation satellite system gnss measurements with a focus on the subperiods separated by the implementation december 2014 of the south to north water diversion middle route project mrp new hydrological insights for the region grace derived results demonstrate that gws depleted at rates of 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr for subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively suggesting that gws continued decreasing after the mrp however the spatial distribution of average monthly gws shows an evident southwest northeast band distribution and the gws depletion in the northwest has been alleviated compared with the southeast the gnss stations in the beijing area show accelerated increasing rates of vertical displacements while those in the plain areas of hebei and tianjin show continuous declining rates implying that gws in the beijing area recovered faster after the mrp while the gws depletion in plain areas of hebei and tianjin continued in addition precipitation is the main driving factor to gws variability during the whole study period with grey correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 75 this strong correlation explains the significant reduction in gws caused by the large precipitation deficit in 2019 which leads to a larger gws depletion rate for the 2015 2020 period abbreviations cf center of figure cmdsc china

diversion middle rout project 1 introduction the detection of groundwater storage gws depletion using space geodetic sensors such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and continuous global navigation satellite system gnss has successfully been performed worldwide in the last two decades rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 he et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 fok and liu 2019 due to its advantages in high and even spatiotemporal resolution of these sensors the gws is of great importance in the economy and agriculture of the north china plain ncp fig 1 where the annual available water resources per capita 910 m3 year are far below the recommended global water stress baseline 1700 m3 year more than 40 of fresh water and agricultural irrigation in the ncp comes from groundwater hrwcc 2003 2020 problems due to overexploitation of groundwater such as gws depletion and surface deformation have become more and more serious with rapid urbanization and agricultural development over the past decades cai 2008 gong et al 2018 therefore monitoring the gws variation in the ncp is essential the grace monthly time variable gravity field over land surface mainly reflects the seasonal hydrologic mass redistribution which provides an opportunity for remotely monitoring global and regional gws changes using grace derived terrestrial water storage and soil water estimates from a hydrological model rodell et al 2009 provided the groundwater decline rates in northwest india scanlon et al 2012 and wang et al 2013 conducted similar investigation in the california central valley and the canadian prairies respectively and validated the grace derived gws changes by using ground based well data many similar studies have been conducted on the gws changes in the ncp based on grace datasets moiwo et al 2013 feng et al 2013 and wang et al 2017 identified a decreasing gws trend 16 8 27 2 mm yr different subperiods within 2002 2012 in the vast north china 370 000 2086 000 km2 by using grace spherical harmonic coefficients shcs furthermore considering the influence of reservoir regulation coal transport and water diversion tang et al 2013 estimated a groundwater depletion rate of 14 0 to 8 4 mm yr in north china 3000 000 km2 from 2003 to 2011 combining grace mascon products and in situ groundwater observations gong et al 2018 calculated a long term 1971 2015 decline trend of gws of 17 8 0 1 mm yr in the ncp zhao et al 2019 merged grace mascon products from different datasets and found an accelerated gws depletion rate of 38 0 1 mm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 in the ncp large scale gws changes induce downward and upward vertical displacements of the earth s surface which can be continuously monitored by gnss networks removing the effects of surface fluid mass redistribution gnss station coordinate time series mainly reflect gws variations abidin et al 2008 studied the land subsidence characteristics of jakarta using gnss and found that the observed subsidence rates showed a positive correlation with known groundwater extraction chen et al 2010 revealed the high correlation between gnss measured vertical surface displacements and groundwater level in the choshuichi alluvial fan of central taiwan moreau and dauteuil 2013 examined the surface deformation caused by variable time scale hydrological process showing that gnss measurements have ability to track groundwater level changes further silverii et al 2016 found that gnss derived horizontal surface displacements near large karst aquifers were controlled by karst aquifer response to the seasonal and interannual recharge discharge process zhao et al 2019 found that the changes of surface subsidence rates in the ncp as observed by gnss revealed an acceleration of gws depletion with good agreement with well data and grace results ali et al 2021 used gnss data and a time dependent spatial regression method to estimate monthly groundwater level in west central taiwan over the period of 2016 2017 and found that gnss measured deformations provided an alternative approach for estimating seasonal changes in gws in this paper the spatiotemporal characteristics of gws changes in the ncp will also be investigated and discussed based on grace and gnss measurements however in contrast to previous similar studies we will focus on the subperiods separated by the completion of the middle route project mrp of the south to north water diversion snwd which has been reported being effective on groundwater recovery in the ncp based on hydrological data zhang et al 2020 and has not been well studied with geodetic measurements to date we deal with the following questions can the reported effectiveness of the snwd to groundwater recovery be seen in geodetic time series both grace and gnss what are the differences in gws variability in subperiods as detected by geodetic measurements and what is the dominant factor affecting gws in the ncp nowadays in this study the assessment will be based on level 3 grace data both spherical harmonic sh solutions and mass concentration mascon solutions 2003 2020 continuous gnss vertical coordinate observations see fig 1 for location hydrologic model simulations in situ groundwater level gw level measurements available from 2005 to 2016 see fig 1 for location of wells and precipitation datasets we compare and analyze the estimates of gws changes in subperiods from grace with the in situ gw level measurements and literature results depict the land surface deformation at 22 sites and conduct analysis of precipitation impacts on gws in the ncp 2 research area and data 2 1 study region the region of interest in this study is the ncp which refers to the east of the taihang mountains south of yan mountains and north of the yellow river 140 000 km2 with elevation not exceeding 100 m as shown in fig 1 the ncp has a complex hydrogeologic environment from the piedmont plain to the east central plain the aquifer system gradually evolves from single to multi layer lithologic particles change from coarse to fine and the thickness of a compressible clay layer becomes thicker groundwater has been exploited extensively since 1970 s providing water for agricultural urban and industrial use the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge accounting for about 60 90 of the total recharge with the majority in summer due to the uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and large water demand the ncp has experienced the most severe groundwater depletion and surface subsidence in china 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data the rl06 level 3 version4 monthly 1 0 1 0 gridded land water storage data in the form of equivalent water height and relative to the mean of 2004 000 2009

nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land in order to isolate the terrestrial water storage signal post processing corrections are applied to the shcs the low degree coefficients of c20 and c30 terms are replaced by the results from satellite laser ranging slr cheng 2011 loomis et al 2019 note that c20 is replaced in both grace and grace fo sh solutions while c30 only in grace fo sh solutions degree 1 coefficients corrections are applied in order to transform the mass change results into terrestrial reference frame swenson et al 2008 glacial isostatic adjustment gia effects are removed based on the ice6g d model provided by peltier et al 2018 a destriping filter is applied to reduce the effects of correlated errors at geo potential resonant orders swenson et al 2006 to reduce the north south stripes and errors at high degrees a gaussian smoothing with average radius of 300 km is employed to the shcs since the post processing of smoothing to shcs tend to attenuate true signals the sh solutions should be adjusted by scaling factors here the scaling factors gained from a hydrological model are employed more details of data processing and gain factor derivation can be found in landerer and swenson 2012 the monthly global total water storage tws data derived from three mascon solutions relative to the average of 2004 000 2009 999 provided by csr jpl and gsfc goddard space flight center are also used in this study https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html https earth gsfc nasa gov geo data grace mascons the csr mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 save et al 2016 jpl mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese et al 2018 watkins et al 2015 landerer et al 2020 the gsfc mascon is the release 6 version 1 0 compared with grace sh solutions the low degree c20 c30 and degree 1 terms and gia corrections to mascon solutions are almost the same however mascon solutions based on the estimation of local mass anomalies at specified mass concentration blocks or grid location are not affected by longitudinal stripes by applying regularization constraints at least according to the providers thus they do not require gaussian smoothing or de striping filtering watkins et al 2015 however xiang et al 2022 noted that destriping of mascons may not be perfect at least in some areas of the world the grace derived tws in the ncp from different organizations are shown in fig 2 except for jpl mascon results the tws estimations are in good agreement in their phase and any difference is mainly reflected in the seasonal amplitude for the tws time series derived from jpl mascon solutions the results are consistent with others for the period of 2003 2013 but those for the period of 2014 2020 show significant over estimation than other results the comparison of mean tws anomalies of 3 sh and 3 mascon solutions are provided in the supplementary material text s1 fig s1 and table s1 the method used to estimate the uncertainties of different datasets and obtain the averaged tws anomalies will be illustrated in section 3 1 2 2 2 in situ groundwater level data the monthly in situ gw level measurements are collected from the annual groundwater yearbook provided by the institution of china geological environment monitoring due to different starting time of observation the periods of available data vary from station to station in this study only the well stations with missing data of less than 20 and consecutive gaps spanning less than 1 year are used following this strict quality control a total of 59 monitoring well stations are selected including both shallow and deep aquifers the spatial distribution of these wells is plotted in fig 1 averaged gw level sequences of the shallow and the deep aquifers can be found in the supplementary material text s2 and fig s2 the in situ gws changes are obtained by multiplying groundwater level anomalies with the specific yield of each well referenced from the spatial distribution map of specific yields in the ncp which is provided by the china geological survey bureau zhang and fei 2009 in this study the specific yields between 0 05 and 0 07 as found by feng et al 2013 are adopted to convert the gw level measurements to gws changes 2 2 3 hydrometeorological data the global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model is developed jointly by nasa s gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in this paper the soil moisture content from three land surface models lms in gldas version 2 are used the three lsms are the noah model the clsm model and the vic model in gldas version 2 data products the number of vertical levels for soil moisture is model specific noah has 4 layers with depth interval of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm respectively vic has 3 layers 1 10 cm for the surface layer and variable depth for the second and bottom layers clsm does not have explicit vertical levels for soil moisture which instead is represented in surface 0 2 cm root zone 0 100 cm and profile in this study soil moisture in all layers of noah and vic as well as profile soil moisture of clsm are used monthly precipitation data from the china meteorological data service center cmdsc http data cma cn which provides meteorological data products of precipitation land surface atmosphere and ocean at multiple time scales daily monthly and annual in the form of site and grid are used to understand the climate change in the ncp grid datasets of monthly surface precipitation in china v2 0 from january 2003 to december 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 are used in this work for the surface water storage the storage capacity changes of major reservoirs in the ncp are mainly considered water storage of 10 major reservoirs with at least 90 time coverage during the study period of 2003 2020 are collected from the haihe river water conservancy commission the absent monthly water storage data are interpolated using the spline method 2 2 4 gnss vertical displacements and post processing in this study 22 gnss vertical displacement observations provided by the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc and china meteorological administration are used to investigate the surface deformation in the ncp part of which are available on the website ftp ftp gnss ac cn products position gamit the longitude and latitude of the gnss stations are listed in table 1 as well as the observation time span selected in this study in order to obtain daily loosely constrained coordinates time series the gamit globk package version 10 4 based on double differenced model is employed to process the rinex files of all stations in this process solid earth tides pole tides ocean tides and tropospheric delays are corrected by models gérard and brian 2010 schmid et al 2016 böhm et al 2006 besides datum transformation is performed to obtain gnss station coordinate time series with respect to the international terrestrial reference frame itrf 2014 and then the daily vertical displacement time series are obtained 3 methods and data processing 3 1 the generalized three cornered hat method the three cornered hat tch method premoli et al 1993 galindo et al 2001 is adopted to estimate the bias among different datasets unlike a traditional uncertainty estimation method the tch approach does not require any a priori knowledge of the true mass change to assess the uncertainty of three or more sets of observation sequences in the case of no true value the classic triangle hat method is suitable to assess uncertainties for three datasets while the generalized three cornered hat gtch method is suitable for more than three datasets detailed information on this method can be found in premoli and tavella 1993 this method has been proven to be effective in quantifying uncertainties of grace data yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 which makes it suitable for this study the gtch method is employed to calculate variances and covariances among the tws changes from six grace datasets the covariances between different datasets are ignored here since the gtch method may not provide good estimation of the covariances koot et al 2006 and the values of covariance are very close to zero then the tws changes are obtained by weighting them on average 1 x i 1 n w i x i where x i and w i denotes the grace derived tws estimates from different institutions and corresponding weights which are determined based on the estimated variances 2 w i 1 r ii j 1 n 1 r jj in which r ii is the variance of the i th tws time series estimated by the gtch method the above processes are carried out grid by grid until all the weights of the six datasets are obtained 3 2 deriving groundwater storage changes from grace solutions in ncp regions where the snow water equivalents are negligible feng et al 2013 the regional tws can be simply expressed as integration of water stored in soil moisture sms groundwater aquifers gws and reservoir water reservoirs rws as 3 tws sms gws rws in which the tws and sms changes can be modeled by grace solutions and lsm respectively in this study in order to obtain the grace derived gws changes the sms changes simulated by the average of the three lsms noah clsm and vic from gldas and the observed rws changes provided by haihe river water conservancy commission are subtracted from the tws changes inferred by grace solutions the gtch and weighted least square methods are employed to estimate the tws changes and the uncertainties are determined by the maximum differences between the averaged solution and the six original solutions however due to the systematic biases among different models the gtch methods are not applied to the three lsm datasets the average of the sms from three models are taken as the mean sms to keep consistence with grace derived tws changes which are relative to the 2004 000 2009 999 time mean baseline the sms and rws anomalies are also estimated by removing the average between 2004 000 and 2009 999 respectively 3 3 post processing of gnss vertical displacements the gross error detection method of interquartile statistics nikolaidis 2002 and the least squares linear fitting method are used to remove the gross errors and jumps in gnss vertical displacement time series then the kriged kalman filter method from liu et al 2018 is employed to interpolate the missing data fig 3 shows the original blue and filtered red gnss derived vertical displacement time series for szax station it can be seen that the filtering process can suppress the high frequency errors remove the jump around 2014 and fill the missing data in the vertical displacements the atmospheric non tidal oceanic and the hydrological loading displacements in the center of figure cf frame are removed by the esmgfz products which are provided by gfz http rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository all the vertical elastic surface loading deformation are calculated with green s functions farrell 1972 the annual amplitudes of atmospheric non tidal oceanic and hydrological load range from 4 7 to 5 6 mm 0 5 mm and 1 4 2 4 mm respectively the hydrological mass loads in esmgfz products are composed of soil moisture snow surface water and water in rivers and lakes not including groundwater therefore the residual vertical displacements are mainly due to the gws variations 4 results 4 1 grace derived and in situ based gws changes fig 4 shows the gws anomalies derived by removing the sms and rws from the tws changes compared with in situ observation based estimates as shown in fig 4 the contribution of sms and rws variations to the grace derived tws changes compared with gws are quite insignificant proving that the water loss of tws in the ncp is mainly induced by gws depletion the tws and gws time series all show obviously long term downward trend and seasonal fluctuations with minimum and maximum values in summer around june and winter around december respectively the remarkable seasonal variations reflect the seasonal hydrologic process which is mainly determined by agricultural groundwater extraction and atmospheric precipitation groundwater is largely pumped for agricultural usage in late spring and summer while the water from infiltration of precipitation in autumn and winter remains in aquifers till next spring due to the lower irrigation demand in those months the grace derived gws monthly anomalies have a high correlation with in situ gws measurements from 2005 to 2016 r2 0 91 with decreasing rates of 2 21 0 15 cm yr and 2 11 0 11 cm yr during 2005 2016 respectively the good agreement is mainly due to the consistency in the annual phases since this statistical method mainly measures the match in timing the effect of grace grace fo gaps on linear rate estimations is very small and thus can be ignored see more details in text s3 fig s3 and table s2 the mrp under the snwd designed to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in hanjiang river basin to the water scarce ncp started its operation in december 2014 in order to investigate the effectiveness of the mrp to diminish gws depletion the study period is divided into two subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 before and after the start of mrp the annual change rates of gws for the two sub periods and the whole period are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr 2 76 0 55 cm yr and 2 18 0 11 cm yr based on the grace derived gws time series which suggests that taking the ncp as an entire area the gws depletion rate has continued and even declined faster in the 2015 2020 period based on the grace derived gws anomalies the spatial distribution of averaged gws for each month in the two subperiods is achieved as presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively note that the color bars for the two figures are different as shown in autumn and winter gws variation is relatively low while in spring and summer gws depletion is severe and spatial differences gradually become larger the pattern of relative gws shows a gradient from the northwest to the southeast with less intra annual gws variations in the northwestern pre mountain plain than in the southeast i e henan shandong and southeastern hebei which contribute more to the gws variation in the ncp for the 2015 2020 period the entire ncp showed a more serious gws decrease than during the 2003 2014 period compared with the results of the 2003 2014 period the spatial distribution of gws in the 2015 2020 period shows some distinct characteristics for autumn and winter in the 2003 2014 period the groundwater reserves in the western region were less than those in the eastern region and those in the southern region were less than those in the northern region while the gws depletion was more serious in the southeast than in the northwest for the 2015 2020 period those findings imply that compared with the southeast region the gws depletion in northwest has been alleviated to some extent which should be partially attributed to the mrp delivered water with a designed water delivery rate of 9 5 km3 yr from the danjiangkou reservoir to northern areas of the ncp and the southeast region contributes more to the gws loss of the ncp 4 2 land displacements due to groundwater changes vertical positions of gnss stations record both the earth s elastic and porous response accompanied by groundwater extraction and recovery however the porous response is 10 100 times greater than the elastic response fu et al 2015 thus the vertical displacements of gnss stations located on top of aquifers mainly reveal the porous response of earth s surface due to soil compaction and expansion which means the vertical displacement falls when the aquifer is pumped and rises when the aquifer is recharged with water see more details in text s4 and fig s4 in this study we only choose gnss stations on top of aquifers to infer the temporal variation of groundwater changes from vertical displacements a least squares fitting with linear trend annual and semi annual terms is applied to the vertical coordinate time series before and after 2015 to calculate the corresponding displacement rates the results are shown in table 1 except for stations located in beijing area all the other ones show continuous decrease rates of vertical displacement implying that the gws depletion in plain areas of tianjin and hebei continued after the operation of mrp the majority of the stations does not show obvious rate variation before and after 2015 while few stations present significant accelerated e g hecx szwq or decelerated e g tjbh kc02 declining rates fig 7 depicts the accelerated uplift of vertical displacements in bjsh and bjyq seasonal variations are very small before 2015 the linear trends of vertical displacements at these stations were relatively stable or slightly increasing but these increasing rates accelerated after 2015 these findings indicate that the severe water condition in beijing has been mitigated before 2015 and this should be partially attributed to the strict policies on reduced irrigation and restrictions on groundwater exploration after 2015 the operation of the mrp project further reduces cumulative gws depletion resulting in quicker groundwater recovery in the beijing area 4 3 impacts of precipitation on groundwater changes in a recent analysis of ncp gws changes based on the water balance equation tws t p et r zhao et al 2019 found that precipitation p variation compared with runoff r and evapotranspiration et was the dominant factor that affected gws changes in the ncp therefore we only select precipitation to consider the climate impacts on gws changes fig 8 shows the monthly and annual precipitation and smoothed grace derived gws changes where a 13 point moving average was applied to remove the high frequency signals contained in the monthly time series the long term average precipitation in the ncp is 544 mm as presented in fig 8 the annual precipitation of 2006 2014 and 2019 was obviously below the long term average while that of 2003 2012 and 2016 was significantly above the average along with changes in precipitation gws decreases when the annual precipitation is less than the long term average e g 2005 2007 2013 2015 and 2019 whereas the gws decline rate becomes slightly slower when precipitation exceeds the long term average e g 2003 2009 2011 in order to deeply explore the impacts of precipitation on gws variations in the ncp before and after 2015 the grey relational analysis gra method is adopted to quantify the effects of precipitation on gws changes over the two subperiods the gra method is usually used to analyze and determine the degree of influence between different discrete sequences a reference sequence and at least one comparison sequence based on the geometric proximity between different sequences described by the grey correlation coefficient the larger the correlation coefficient the stronger the influence of the comparison sequence on the reference sequence more information about grey relational analysis is available in the literature wong et al 2006 li et al 2014 the grace derived gws time series is taken as the reference sequence and the precipitation data series from the cmdsc is the comparison series groundwater recharge has a time lag hocking and kelly 2016 rossman et al 2014 therefore in gra processing the cmdsc precipitation series is moved forward by 1 3 months precipitation 0 represents the original precipitation time series while precipitation 1 precipitation 2 and precipitation 3 represent the ones moved forward by 1 month 2 months and 3 months respectively the resulting grey relational coefficients between the sequences are presented in table 2 the grey correlation coefficients of the four precipitation sequences are about 0 66 and 0 75 for 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively it indicates that gws in the ncp is more strongly correlated with precipitation in the 2015 2020 period for the 2003 2014 period the difference of grey correlation coefficients among the four precipitation sequences is very small 0 0012 0 0017 and precipitation 1 is the largest 0 6658 for the 2015 2020 period the largest grey correlation coefficient 0 7662 emerges at precipitation 0 which is obvious higher than other precipitation sequences these results suggest that gws changes in the ncp are more significantly influenced by and more quickly response to precipitations after the completion of the mrp 5 discussion the mrp under the snwd designed to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the hanjiang river basin to the water scarce ncp started its operation in december 2014 in order to illustrate the gws variations before and after mrp implementation in the ncp zhang et al 2020 calculated the annual trends of gws in water table wells over periods of 2005 2014 and 2015 2018 they found that the annual trend of gws during 2005 2014 was decreasing 1 6 cm yr whereas that during 2015 2018 was slightly increasing 0 2 cm yr in this study similar computations are conducted the study period is divided into two subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 before and after the start of mrp the annual change rates of gws for the two subperiods are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr based on the grace derived gws time series from a longer time period 2015 2020 vs 2015 2018 the gws over the entire ncp area continues decreasing and the effectiveness of mrp on groundwater restoration cannot be seen in the grace derived results upon closer inspection of fig 4 the gws increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 and it was impossible to judge the situation in 2017 due to the grace data gap between 07 2017 and 05 2018 but the gws clearly showed a decreasing trend from 2018 to 2020 therefore in this situation it is not possible to judge the efficiency of the mrp in mitigating groundwater depletion from grace derived gws anomalies alone moreover as presented in fig 8 the minimum precipitation occurred in 2014 while that was close to or above the long term average for each year of 2015 2018 considering the influence of precipitation to gws discussed in section 4 3 we believe the slightly increasing rate 0 2 cm yr for the 2015 2018 period reported by zhang et al 2020 should be more attributed to the increased precipitation rather than being effects of the mrp we collect and analyze groundwater extraction in the ncp for the 2003 2020 period from the official water resources bulletins annually published by chinese government hrwcc 2003 2020 as shown in fig 9 the amount of groundwater extraction declines faster after the mrp and the proportion of groundwater supply in the total water consumption decreases year by year together with the stronger correlation between precipitation and gws for the 2015 2020 period we think the larger decreasing rate 2 18 0 11 cm yr of the 2015 2020 period in this study should be largely attributed to the significant precipitation deficit in 2019 the spatial distribution of average monthly grace derived gws reflects that the gws depletion has been mitigated in the northwest region while that in the southeast continues to be severe gnss observation data are used for further validation as shown in table 1 all the gnss stations located in the plain areas of tianjin and hebei show continuous gws declining rates while the ones located in the beijing area show an upward trend since around 2010 and this upward trend began to accelerate after 2015 which indicates that the groundwater in this area is recovering in recent years these results agree with the earlier reported results of zhang et al 2020 and long et al 2020 the operation of mrp has alleviated the water scarcity in beijing within climate variability and policies on reduced irrigation and groundwater restrictions 6 conclusion in this study grace derived groundwater storage and gnss measured vertical displacements are used to investigate the gws changes before and after december 2014 when the mrp under the snwd started operation the gtch and the least square methods are employed to average six different grace tws datasets into one based on this averaged grace solution the groundwater changes rates are estimated to be 2 11 0 11 cm yr from 2004 to 2016 which agrees well with the estimates 2 21 0 15 cm yr based on in situ groundwater level measurements r2 0 91 this confirms the ability of grace to detect gws changes the grace based gws change rates in the ncp are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr for periods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively which implies that gws taking the ncp as an entire area has continued declining after the operation of the mrp this conclusion is inconsistent with the published finding by zhang et al 2020 which we think is mainly due to the difference in precipitation during the different study periods however the spatial distribution of average monthly gws shows the effectiveness of the mrp in the northwest region of the ncp and reflects that the southeast region contributes more to the gws loss in the ncp also the gnss measured vertical displacements reveal that gws in beijing area recovered faster after 2015 which should be partially attributed to the mrp the gws variability in the ncp is strongly correlated with precipitation the grey correlation analysis of these two sequences shows strong correlation in both two subperiods with coefficients around 0 66 and 0 75 respectively this indicates that up to now precipitation has been the major factor that causes the gws variability even during the operation period of the mrp furthermore it is found that the influence of precipitation on gws is stronger after the completion of the mrp and gws seems to recover more quickly owing to recharge from precipitation this strong correlation explains the significant reduction in gws caused by the large precipitation deficit in 2019 which leads to a larger

7969,study region north china plain ncp china study focus this paper investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of groundwater storage gws changes in the ncp during 2003 2020 using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and global navigation satellite system gnss measurements with a focus on the subperiods separated by the implementation december 2014 of the south to north water diversion middle route project mrp new hydrological insights for the region grace derived results demonstrate that gws depleted at rates of 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr for subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively suggesting that gws continued decreasing after the mrp however the spatial distribution of average monthly gws shows an evident southwest northeast band distribution and the gws depletion in the northwest has been alleviated compared with the southeast the gnss stations in the beijing area show accelerated increasing rates of vertical displacements while those in the plain areas of hebei and tianjin show continuous declining rates implying that gws in the beijing area recovered faster after the mrp while the gws depletion in plain areas of hebei and tianjin continued in addition precipitation is the main driving factor to gws variability during the whole study period with grey correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 75 this strong correlation explains the significant reduction in gws caused by the large precipitation deficit in 2019 which leads to a larger gws depletion rate for the 2015 2020 period abbreviations cf center of figure cmdsc china

diversion middle rout project 1 introduction the detection of groundwater storage gws depletion using space geodetic sensors such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and continuous global navigation satellite system gnss has successfully been performed worldwide in the last two decades rodell et al 2009 scanlon et al 2012 he et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 fok and liu 2019 due to its advantages in high and even spatiotemporal resolution of these sensors the gws is of great importance in the economy and agriculture of the north china plain ncp fig 1 where the annual available water resources per capita 910 m3 year are far below the recommended global water stress baseline 1700 m3 year more than 40 of fresh water and agricultural irrigation in the ncp comes from groundwater hrwcc 2003 2020 problems due to overexploitation of groundwater such as gws depletion and surface deformation have become more and more serious with rapid urbanization and agricultural development over the past decades cai 2008 gong et al 2018 therefore monitoring the gws variation in the ncp is essential the grace monthly time variable gravity field over land surface mainly reflects the seasonal hydrologic mass redistribution which provides an opportunity for remotely monitoring global and regional gws changes using grace derived terrestrial water storage and soil water estimates from a hydrological model rodell et al 2009 provided the groundwater decline rates in northwest india scanlon et al 2012 and wang et al 2013 conducted similar investigation in the california central valley and the canadian prairies respectively and validated the grace derived gws changes by using ground based well data many similar studies have been conducted on the gws changes in the ncp based on grace datasets moiwo et al 2013 feng et al 2013 and wang et al 2017 identified a decreasing gws trend 16 8 27 2 mm yr different subperiods within 2002 2012 in the vast north china 370 000 2086 000 km2 by using grace spherical harmonic coefficients shcs furthermore considering the influence of reservoir regulation coal transport and water diversion tang et al 2013 estimated a groundwater depletion rate of 14 0 to 8 4 mm yr in north china 3000 000 km2 from 2003 to 2011 combining grace mascon products and in situ groundwater observations gong et al 2018 calculated a long term 1971 2015 decline trend of gws of 17 8 0 1 mm yr in the ncp zhao et al 2019 merged grace mascon products from different datasets and found an accelerated gws depletion rate of 38 0 1 mm yr from mid 2013 to mid 2016 in the ncp large scale gws changes induce downward and upward vertical displacements of the earth s surface which can be continuously monitored by gnss networks removing the effects of surface fluid mass redistribution gnss station coordinate time series mainly reflect gws variations abidin et al 2008 studied the land subsidence characteristics of jakarta using gnss and found that the observed subsidence rates showed a positive correlation with known groundwater extraction chen et al 2010 revealed the high correlation between gnss measured vertical surface displacements and groundwater level in the choshuichi alluvial fan of central taiwan moreau and dauteuil 2013 examined the surface deformation caused by variable time scale hydrological process showing that gnss measurements have ability to track groundwater level changes further silverii et al 2016 found that gnss derived horizontal surface displacements near large karst aquifers were controlled by karst aquifer response to the seasonal and interannual recharge discharge process zhao et al 2019 found that the changes of surface subsidence rates in the ncp as observed by gnss revealed an acceleration of gws depletion with good agreement with well data and grace results ali et al 2021 used gnss data and a time dependent spatial regression method to estimate monthly groundwater level in west central taiwan over the period of 2016 2017 and found that gnss measured deformations provided an alternative approach for estimating seasonal changes in gws in this paper the spatiotemporal characteristics of gws changes in the ncp will also be investigated and discussed based on grace and gnss measurements however in contrast to previous similar studies we will focus on the subperiods separated by the completion of the middle route project mrp of the south to north water diversion snwd which has been reported being effective on groundwater recovery in the ncp based on hydrological data zhang et al 2020 and has not been well studied with geodetic measurements to date we deal with the following questions can the reported effectiveness of the snwd to groundwater recovery be seen in geodetic time series both grace and gnss what are the differences in gws variability in subperiods as detected by geodetic measurements and what is the dominant factor affecting gws in the ncp nowadays in this study the assessment will be based on level 3 grace data both spherical harmonic sh solutions and mass concentration mascon solutions 2003 2020 continuous gnss vertical coordinate observations see fig 1 for location hydrologic model simulations in situ groundwater level gw level measurements available from 2005 to 2016 see fig 1 for location of wells and precipitation datasets we compare and analyze the estimates of gws changes in subperiods from grace with the in situ gw level measurements and literature results depict the land surface deformation at 22 sites and conduct analysis of precipitation impacts on gws in the ncp 2 research area and data 2 1 study region the region of interest in this study is the ncp which refers to the east of the taihang mountains south of yan mountains and north of the yellow river 140 000 km2 with elevation not exceeding 100 m as shown in fig 1 the ncp has a complex hydrogeologic environment from the piedmont plain to the east central plain the aquifer system gradually evolves from single to multi layer lithologic particles change from coarse to fine and the thickness of a compressible clay layer becomes thicker groundwater has been exploited extensively since 1970 s providing water for agricultural urban and industrial use the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge accounting for about 60 90 of the total recharge with the majority in summer due to the uneven seasonal distribution of precipitation and large water demand the ncp has experienced the most severe groundwater depletion and surface subsidence in china 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace data the rl06 level 3 version4 monthly 1 0 1 0 gridded land water storage data in the form of equivalent water height and relative to the mean of 2004 000 2009

nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land in order to isolate the terrestrial water storage signal post processing corrections are applied to the shcs the low degree coefficients of c20 and c30 terms are replaced by the results from satellite laser ranging slr cheng 2011 loomis et al 2019 note that c20 is replaced in both grace and grace fo sh solutions while c30 only in grace fo sh solutions degree 1 coefficients corrections are applied in order to transform the mass change results into terrestrial reference frame swenson et al 2008 glacial isostatic adjustment gia effects are removed based on the ice6g d model provided by peltier et al 2018 a destriping filter is applied to reduce the effects of correlated errors at geo potential resonant orders swenson et al 2006 to reduce the north south stripes and errors at high degrees a gaussian smoothing with average radius of 300 km is employed to the shcs since the post processing of smoothing to shcs tend to attenuate true signals the sh solutions should be adjusted by scaling factors here the scaling factors gained from a hydrological model are employed more details of data processing and gain factor derivation can be found in landerer and swenson 2012 the monthly global total water storage tws data derived from three mascon solutions relative to the average of 2004 000 2009 999 provided by csr jpl and gsfc goddard space flight center are also used in this study https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html https earth gsfc nasa gov geo data grace mascons the csr mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 save et al 2016 jpl mascon is the release 6 version 2 0 with the coastal resolution improvement filter wiese et al 2018 watkins et al 2015 landerer et al 2020 the gsfc mascon is the release 6 version 1 0 compared with grace sh solutions the low degree c20 c30 and degree 1 terms and gia corrections to mascon solutions are almost the same however mascon solutions based on the estimation of local mass anomalies at specified mass concentration blocks or grid location are not affected by longitudinal stripes by applying regularization constraints at least according to the providers thus they do not require gaussian smoothing or de striping filtering watkins et al 2015 however xiang et al 2022 noted that destriping of mascons may not be perfect at least in some areas of the world the grace derived tws in the ncp from different organizations are shown in fig 2 except for jpl mascon results the tws estimations are in good agreement in their phase and any difference is mainly reflected in the seasonal amplitude for the tws time series derived from jpl mascon solutions the results are consistent with others for the period of 2003 2013 but those for the period of 2014 2020 show significant over estimation than other results the comparison of mean tws anomalies of 3 sh and 3 mascon solutions are provided in the supplementary material text s1 fig s1 and table s1 the method used to estimate the uncertainties of different datasets and obtain the averaged tws anomalies will be illustrated in section 3 1 2 2 2 in situ groundwater level data the monthly in situ gw level measurements are collected from the annual groundwater yearbook provided by the institution of china geological environment monitoring due to different starting time of observation the periods of available data vary from station to station in this study only the well stations with missing data of less than 20 and consecutive gaps spanning less than 1 year are used following this strict quality control a total of 59 monitoring well stations are selected including both shallow and deep aquifers the spatial distribution of these wells is plotted in fig 1 averaged gw level sequences of the shallow and the deep aquifers can be found in the supplementary material text s2 and fig s2 the in situ gws changes are obtained by multiplying groundwater level anomalies with the specific yield of each well referenced from the spatial distribution map of specific yields in the ncp which is provided by the china geological survey bureau zhang and fei 2009 in this study the specific yields between 0 05 and 0 07 as found by feng et al 2013 are adopted to convert the gw level measurements to gws changes 2 2 3 hydrometeorological data the global land data assimilation system gldas hydrological model is developed jointly by nasa s gsfc and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa in this paper the soil moisture content from three land surface models lms in gldas version 2 are used the three lsms are the noah model the clsm model and the vic model in gldas version 2 data products the number of vertical levels for soil moisture is model specific noah has 4 layers with depth interval of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm respectively vic has 3 layers 1 10 cm for the surface layer and variable depth for the second and bottom layers clsm does not have explicit vertical levels for soil moisture which instead is represented in surface 0 2 cm root zone 0 100 cm and profile in this study soil moisture in all layers of noah and vic as well as profile soil moisture of clsm are used monthly precipitation data from the china meteorological data service center cmdsc http data cma cn which provides meteorological data products of precipitation land surface atmosphere and ocean at multiple time scales daily monthly and annual in the form of site and grid are used to understand the climate change in the ncp grid datasets of monthly surface precipitation in china v2 0 from january 2003 to december 2020 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 are used in this work for the surface water storage the storage capacity changes of major reservoirs in the ncp are mainly considered water storage of 10 major reservoirs with at least 90 time coverage during the study period of 2003 2020 are collected from the haihe river water conservancy commission the absent monthly water storage data are interpolated using the spline method 2 2 4 gnss vertical displacements and post processing in this study 22 gnss vertical displacement observations provided by the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc and china meteorological administration are used to investigate the surface deformation in the ncp part of which are available on the website ftp ftp gnss ac cn products position gamit the longitude and latitude of the gnss stations are listed in table 1 as well as the observation time span selected in this study in order to obtain daily loosely constrained coordinates time series the gamit globk package version 10 4 based on double differenced model is employed to process the rinex files of all stations in this process solid earth tides pole tides ocean tides and tropospheric delays are corrected by models gérard and brian 2010 schmid et al 2016 böhm et al 2006 besides datum transformation is performed to obtain gnss station coordinate time series with respect to the international terrestrial reference frame itrf 2014 and then the daily vertical displacement time series are obtained 3 methods and data processing 3 1 the generalized three cornered hat method the three cornered hat tch method premoli et al 1993 galindo et al 2001 is adopted to estimate the bias among different datasets unlike a traditional uncertainty estimation method the tch approach does not require any a priori knowledge of the true mass change to assess the uncertainty of three or more sets of observation sequences in the case of no true value the classic triangle hat method is suitable to assess uncertainties for three datasets while the generalized three cornered hat gtch method is suitable for more than three datasets detailed information on this method can be found in premoli and tavella 1993 this method has been proven to be effective in quantifying uncertainties of grace data yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 which makes it suitable for this study the gtch method is employed to calculate variances and covariances among the tws changes from six grace datasets the covariances between different datasets are ignored here since the gtch method may not provide good estimation of the covariances koot et al 2006 and the values of covariance are very close to zero then the tws changes are obtained by weighting them on average 1 x i 1 n w i x i where x i and w i denotes the grace derived tws estimates from different institutions and corresponding weights which are determined based on the estimated variances 2 w i 1 r ii j 1 n 1 r jj in which r ii is the variance of the i th tws time series estimated by the gtch method the above processes are carried out grid by grid until all the weights of the six datasets are obtained 3 2 deriving groundwater storage changes from grace solutions in ncp regions where the snow water equivalents are negligible feng et al 2013 the regional tws can be simply expressed as integration of water stored in soil moisture sms groundwater aquifers gws and reservoir water reservoirs rws as 3 tws sms gws rws in which the tws and sms changes can be modeled by grace solutions and lsm respectively in this study in order to obtain the grace derived gws changes the sms changes simulated by the average of the three lsms noah clsm and vic from gldas and the observed rws changes provided by haihe river water conservancy commission are subtracted from the tws changes inferred by grace solutions the gtch and weighted least square methods are employed to estimate the tws changes and the uncertainties are determined by the maximum differences between the averaged solution and the six original solutions however due to the systematic biases among different models the gtch methods are not applied to the three lsm datasets the average of the sms from three models are taken as the mean sms to keep consistence with grace derived tws changes which are relative to the 2004 000 2009 999 time mean baseline the sms and rws anomalies are also estimated by removing the average between 2004 000 and 2009 999 respectively 3 3 post processing of gnss vertical displacements the gross error detection method of interquartile statistics nikolaidis 2002 and the least squares linear fitting method are used to remove the gross errors and jumps in gnss vertical displacement time series then the kriged kalman filter method from liu et al 2018 is employed to interpolate the missing data fig 3 shows the original blue and filtered red gnss derived vertical displacement time series for szax station it can be seen that the filtering process can suppress the high frequency errors remove the jump around 2014 and fill the missing data in the vertical displacements the atmospheric non tidal oceanic and the hydrological loading displacements in the center of figure cf frame are removed by the esmgfz products which are provided by gfz http rz vm115 gfz potsdam de 8080 repository all the vertical elastic surface loading deformation are calculated with green s functions farrell 1972 the annual amplitudes of atmospheric non tidal oceanic and hydrological load range from 4 7 to 5 6 mm 0 5 mm and 1 4 2 4 mm respectively the hydrological mass loads in esmgfz products are composed of soil moisture snow surface water and water in rivers and lakes not including groundwater therefore the residual vertical displacements are mainly due to the gws variations 4 results 4 1 grace derived and in situ based gws changes fig 4 shows the gws anomalies derived by removing the sms and rws from the tws changes compared with in situ observation based estimates as shown in fig 4 the contribution of sms and rws variations to the grace derived tws changes compared with gws are quite insignificant proving that the water loss of tws in the ncp is mainly induced by gws depletion the tws and gws time series all show obviously long term downward trend and seasonal fluctuations with minimum and maximum values in summer around june and winter around december respectively the remarkable seasonal variations reflect the seasonal hydrologic process which is mainly determined by agricultural groundwater extraction and atmospheric precipitation groundwater is largely pumped for agricultural usage in late spring and summer while the water from infiltration of precipitation in autumn and winter remains in aquifers till next spring due to the lower irrigation demand in those months the grace derived gws monthly anomalies have a high correlation with in situ gws measurements from 2005 to 2016 r2 0 91 with decreasing rates of 2 21 0 15 cm yr and 2 11 0 11 cm yr during 2005 2016 respectively the good agreement is mainly due to the consistency in the annual phases since this statistical method mainly measures the match in timing the effect of grace grace fo gaps on linear rate estimations is very small and thus can be ignored see more details in text s3 fig s3 and table s2 the mrp under the snwd designed to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in hanjiang river basin to the water scarce ncp started its operation in december 2014 in order to investigate the effectiveness of the mrp to diminish gws depletion the study period is divided into two subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 before and after the start of mrp the annual change rates of gws for the two sub periods and the whole period are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr 2 76 0 55 cm yr and 2 18 0 11 cm yr based on the grace derived gws time series which suggests that taking the ncp as an entire area the gws depletion rate has continued and even declined faster in the 2015 2020 period based on the grace derived gws anomalies the spatial distribution of averaged gws for each month in the two subperiods is achieved as presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively note that the color bars for the two figures are different as shown in autumn and winter gws variation is relatively low while in spring and summer gws depletion is severe and spatial differences gradually become larger the pattern of relative gws shows a gradient from the northwest to the southeast with less intra annual gws variations in the northwestern pre mountain plain than in the southeast i e henan shandong and southeastern hebei which contribute more to the gws variation in the ncp for the 2015 2020 period the entire ncp showed a more serious gws decrease than during the 2003 2014 period compared with the results of the 2003 2014 period the spatial distribution of gws in the 2015 2020 period shows some distinct characteristics for autumn and winter in the 2003 2014 period the groundwater reserves in the western region were less than those in the eastern region and those in the southern region were less than those in the northern region while the gws depletion was more serious in the southeast than in the northwest for the 2015 2020 period those findings imply that compared with the southeast region the gws depletion in northwest has been alleviated to some extent which should be partially attributed to the mrp delivered water with a designed water delivery rate of 9 5 km3 yr from the danjiangkou reservoir to northern areas of the ncp and the southeast region contributes more to the gws loss of the ncp 4 2 land displacements due to groundwater changes vertical positions of gnss stations record both the earth s elastic and porous response accompanied by groundwater extraction and recovery however the porous response is 10 100 times greater than the elastic response fu et al 2015 thus the vertical displacements of gnss stations located on top of aquifers mainly reveal the porous response of earth s surface due to soil compaction and expansion which means the vertical displacement falls when the aquifer is pumped and rises when the aquifer is recharged with water see more details in text s4 and fig s4 in this study we only choose gnss stations on top of aquifers to infer the temporal variation of groundwater changes from vertical displacements a least squares fitting with linear trend annual and semi annual terms is applied to the vertical coordinate time series before and after 2015 to calculate the corresponding displacement rates the results are shown in table 1 except for stations located in beijing area all the other ones show continuous decrease rates of vertical displacement implying that the gws depletion in plain areas of tianjin and hebei continued after the operation of mrp the majority of the stations does not show obvious rate variation before and after 2015 while few stations present significant accelerated e g hecx szwq or decelerated e g tjbh kc02 declining rates fig 7 depicts the accelerated uplift of vertical displacements in bjsh and bjyq seasonal variations are very small before 2015 the linear trends of vertical displacements at these stations were relatively stable or slightly increasing but these increasing rates accelerated after 2015 these findings indicate that the severe water condition in beijing has been mitigated before 2015 and this should be partially attributed to the strict policies on reduced irrigation and restrictions on groundwater exploration after 2015 the operation of the mrp project further reduces cumulative gws depletion resulting in quicker groundwater recovery in the beijing area 4 3 impacts of precipitation on groundwater changes in a recent analysis of ncp gws changes based on the water balance equation tws t p et r zhao et al 2019 found that precipitation p variation compared with runoff r and evapotranspiration et was the dominant factor that affected gws changes in the ncp therefore we only select precipitation to consider the climate impacts on gws changes fig 8 shows the monthly and annual precipitation and smoothed grace derived gws changes where a 13 point moving average was applied to remove the high frequency signals contained in the monthly time series the long term average precipitation in the ncp is 544 mm as presented in fig 8 the annual precipitation of 2006 2014 and 2019 was obviously below the long term average while that of 2003 2012 and 2016 was significantly above the average along with changes in precipitation gws decreases when the annual precipitation is less than the long term average e g 2005 2007 2013 2015 and 2019 whereas the gws decline rate becomes slightly slower when precipitation exceeds the long term average e g 2003 2009 2011 in order to deeply explore the impacts of precipitation on gws variations in the ncp before and after 2015 the grey relational analysis gra method is adopted to quantify the effects of precipitation on gws changes over the two subperiods the gra method is usually used to analyze and determine the degree of influence between different discrete sequences a reference sequence and at least one comparison sequence based on the geometric proximity between different sequences described by the grey correlation coefficient the larger the correlation coefficient the stronger the influence of the comparison sequence on the reference sequence more information about grey relational analysis is available in the literature wong et al 2006 li et al 2014 the grace derived gws time series is taken as the reference sequence and the precipitation data series from the cmdsc is the comparison series groundwater recharge has a time lag hocking and kelly 2016 rossman et al 2014 therefore in gra processing the cmdsc precipitation series is moved forward by 1 3 months precipitation 0 represents the original precipitation time series while precipitation 1 precipitation 2 and precipitation 3 represent the ones moved forward by 1 month 2 months and 3 months respectively the resulting grey relational coefficients between the sequences are presented in table 2 the grey correlation coefficients of the four precipitation sequences are about 0 66 and 0 75 for 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively it indicates that gws in the ncp is more strongly correlated with precipitation in the 2015 2020 period for the 2003 2014 period the difference of grey correlation coefficients among the four precipitation sequences is very small 0 0012 0 0017 and precipitation 1 is the largest 0 6658 for the 2015 2020 period the largest grey correlation coefficient 0 7662 emerges at precipitation 0 which is obvious higher than other precipitation sequences these results suggest that gws changes in the ncp are more significantly influenced by and more quickly response to precipitations after the completion of the mrp 5 discussion the mrp under the snwd designed to transfer water from the danjiangkou reservoir in the hanjiang river basin to the water scarce ncp started its operation in december 2014 in order to illustrate the gws variations before and after mrp implementation in the ncp zhang et al 2020 calculated the annual trends of gws in water table wells over periods of 2005 2014 and 2015 2018 they found that the annual trend of gws during 2005 2014 was decreasing 1 6 cm yr whereas that during 2015 2018 was slightly increasing 0 2 cm yr in this study similar computations are conducted the study period is divided into two subperiods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 before and after the start of mrp the annual change rates of gws for the two subperiods are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr based on the grace derived gws time series from a longer time period 2015 2020 vs 2015 2018 the gws over the entire ncp area continues decreasing and the effectiveness of mrp on groundwater restoration cannot be seen in the grace derived results upon closer inspection of fig 4 the gws increased slightly in 2016 compared to 2015 and it was impossible to judge the situation in 2017 due to the grace data gap between 07 2017 and 05 2018 but the gws clearly showed a decreasing trend from 2018 to 2020 therefore in this situation it is not possible to judge the efficiency of the mrp in mitigating groundwater depletion from grace derived gws anomalies alone moreover as presented in fig 8 the minimum precipitation occurred in 2014 while that was close to or above the long term average for each year of 2015 2018 considering the influence of precipitation to gws discussed in section 4 3 we believe the slightly increasing rate 0 2 cm yr for the 2015 2018 period reported by zhang et al 2020 should be more attributed to the increased precipitation rather than being effects of the mrp we collect and analyze groundwater extraction in the ncp for the 2003 2020 period from the official water resources bulletins annually published by chinese government hrwcc 2003 2020 as shown in fig 9 the amount of groundwater extraction declines faster after the mrp and the proportion of groundwater supply in the total water consumption decreases year by year together with the stronger correlation between precipitation and gws for the 2015 2020 period we think the larger decreasing rate 2 18 0 11 cm yr of the 2015 2020 period in this study should be largely attributed to the significant precipitation deficit in 2019 the spatial distribution of average monthly grace derived gws reflects that the gws depletion has been mitigated in the northwest region while that in the southeast continues to be severe gnss observation data are used for further validation as shown in table 1 all the gnss stations located in the plain areas of tianjin and hebei show continuous gws declining rates while the ones located in the beijing area show an upward trend since around 2010 and this upward trend began to accelerate after 2015 which indicates that the groundwater in this area is recovering in recent years these results agree with the earlier reported results of zhang et al 2020 and long et al 2020 the operation of mrp has alleviated the water scarcity in beijing within climate variability and policies on reduced irrigation and groundwater restrictions 6 conclusion in this study grace derived groundwater storage and gnss measured vertical displacements are used to investigate the gws changes before and after december 2014 when the mrp under the snwd started operation the gtch and the least square methods are employed to average six different grace tws datasets into one based on this averaged grace solution the groundwater changes rates are estimated to be 2 11 0 11 cm yr from 2004 to 2016 which agrees well with the estimates 2 21 0 15 cm yr based on in situ groundwater level measurements r2 0 91 this confirms the ability of grace to detect gws changes the grace based gws change rates in the ncp are estimated to be 1 66 0 17 cm yr and 2 76 0 55 cm yr for periods of 2003 2014 and 2015 2020 respectively which implies that gws taking the ncp as an entire area has continued declining after the operation of the mrp this conclusion is inconsistent with the published finding by zhang et al 2020 which we think is mainly due to the difference in precipitation during the different study periods however the spatial distribution of average monthly gws shows the effectiveness of the mrp in the northwest region of the ncp and reflects that the southeast region contributes more to the gws loss in the ncp also the gnss measured vertical displacements reveal that gws in beijing area recovered faster after 2015 which should be partially attributed to the mrp the gws variability in the ncp is strongly correlated with precipitation the grey correlation analysis of these two sequences shows strong correlation in both two subperiods with coefficients around 0 66 and 0 75 respectively this indicates that up to now precipitation has been the major factor that causes the gws variability even during the operation period of the mrp furthermore it is found that the influence of precipitation on gws is stronger after the completion of the mrp and gws seems to recover more quickly owing to recharge from precipitation this strong correlation explains the significant reduction in gws caused by the large precipitation deficit in 2019 which leads to a larger gws depletion rate for the 2015 2020 period funding sources this work was funded by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc grant numbers 41877159 and 41974015 credit authorship
