10375,this research was conducted to study the role of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi amf in response to different irrigation water sources on nemesia nemesia hybridus plants three sources of irrigation water tap water treated waste water and well water were tested on positive and negative mycorrhizal plants with decontaminated soil in pots this study presented that irrigation with waste water increased growth parameters mineral composition gas exchange parameters photosynthetic pigments and leaf water status indicators for all sources of irrigation water mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased all studied parameters transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration and net photosynthesis rate of the negative mycorrhizal plants was lower than those of positive mycorrhizal plants the majority of the vegetative growth flower yield mineral composition leaf water status and photosynthetic parameters varied with the mycorrhizal colonization the results of this research provide strong indication that amf inoculation can improve flower yield and growth quality of nemesia plants this is seen particularly in plants irrigated with treated waste water that had improved mineral uptake photosynthetic status and leaf water relations this study recommends irrigation with treated waste water with amf inoculation for nemesia production amf will enhance the response of the plant to irrigation with treated waste water and reduce the cost associated with using other water sources keywords amf gas exchange leaf water relations mineral composition pigment content treated waste water well water 1 introduction drought stress has a damaging effect on plant production globally especially in semi arid and arid zones like egypt and is predictable to increase with climate change as worldwide temperature and soil drought increase eea 2011 therefore it is necessary to think about using unconventional water sources for example treated waste water and well water for the growth and production of plants these water sources are currently untapped in the egyptian environment and have a low cost of use compared to scarce fresh water in semi arid and arid environments crop water requirements are mainly supplied through irrigation water that usually contains large amounts of dissolved mineral salts consequently salinity control is often the main goal of irrigation water management dehyer and gordon 2004 in high salinity conditions there is often widespread abiotic stress that is the limiting factor in crop productivity and plant distribution qin et al 2010 kao et al 2003 reported that salt stress has several effects on plant eco physiological processes including properties of photosynthesis vicissitudes in plant growth maeda and nakazawa 2008 membrane permeability dogan et al 2010 mineral elements distribution yang et al 2008 and protective enzyme activities wu et al 2010 waste water is utilized for plants irrigation as an alternative to fresh water waste water has been used in agriculture for many years and is now common practice in numerous countries around the world nagajyothi et al 2009 waste water crop irrigation presents both opportunities and challenges with regards to its usages plus its health and environmental influences in semi arid and arid areas of the world waste water crop irrigation has to a large extent alleviated water deficits the nutritional worth of waste water has also been an attractive quality of its extensive usage in crop irrigation gatta et al 2015 small concentrations of micro nutrients are useful for the growth and metabolism of plants however are poisonous when present in excess kocak et al 2005 sou et al 2013 therefore untreated waste water irrigation can be detrimental to human health and the environment one of the major issues associated with this practice is the accumulation of heavy metals hm in the soil plants food chains and eventually in humans khalid et al 2018 nagajyothi et al 2009 most terrestrial plants have symbiotic associations with soil fungi arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are associated with approximately 85 95 of herbaceous plants trappe 1987 krishna 2005 the plants in this association benefit from protection against environmental stresses sylvia and williams 1992 including salinity pollution drought and desertification augé 2001 augé et al 2007 nemesia nemesia hybridus belongs to the scrophulariaceae family nemesia plants are tender annuals and perennials that are typically native to southern africa in the usa cultivars of nemesia strumosa numerous of which are hybrids between n versicolor and n strumosa are usually grown as cool weather flowering annuals they have two lipped tubular flowers in small terminal racemes flower can be most colors except green r h s 2008 uses in the garden include in mixed borders containers and rock gardens the objective of this investigation was to determine the effect of different water irrigation

three randomly chosen nemesia plants were selected and picked up from each pot within the morning 9 30 am than fm was measured immediately then leaves were floated for 2 h on distilled water in closed petri dishes at room temperature of about 23 2 c under conditions without light in order to obtain the turgid mass tm the dm was measured after over drying at 110 c for 24 h rwc fm dm tm dm 100 leaf water potential ψ w was estimated using a water potential system psypro wescor ut usa and replicated three times for each treatment each leaf tested was fitted into the leaf hygrometer we recorded these between 11 15 to 12 10 am flowering stage the cycle was as follows 25 s measurement periods 5 s read average seconds 5 s plateau delay and 15 s cooling time 2 4 8 mycorrhizal colonization levels to estimate the levels of mycorrhizal colonization the root system of the plants was washed carefully straight after harvest with fresh water to remove soil the washed roots were then cut into 0 25 0 5 cm pieces the root pieces were cleaned in 10 potassium hydroxide solution koh the cleaned root pieces were then stained following the method reported by phillips and hayman 1970 by using lactophenol with 0 05 trypan blue pigment stained root fragments were studied below a compound microscope at 40x magnification the colonization frequency cf mycorrhizal infection intensity mi and arbuscular development frequency ad in the infected roots were calculated according to the methods trouvelot et al 1986 using the mycocalc software 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental design was split plot through three replications three irrigation water treatments were randomly allocated to the main plots and two amf inoculation treatments amf without and amf with were applied within the sub plots there were four plants per treatment for each replication and an experimental unit consists of 72 pots 3 irrigation water sources 2 amf inoculation 3 replicates the collected data were statistically analyzed using sas program sas version 9 2 institute cary n c u s a software differences among means were analyzed with a revised least significant difference l s d test at the significance level of p 0 05 steel and torrie 1986 3 results the analyses of variance anova for the studied parameters are presented in table 2 the results showed highly significant differences among irrigation water sources main plots amf inoculation treatments sub plots as well as their interaction across all studied parameters with the exception of flower dry mass in the second season 3 1 vegetative growth plant height leaf number leaf area branch number root length sdm and rdm were affected by different irrigation water treatments tables 3 and 4 irrigation with waste water produced the highest values of plant height leaf number leaf area branch number and sdm in both seasons for amf and amf nemesia plants in amf plants an increase in plant height leaf number leaf area and sdm occurred as a result of response to irrigation water treated waste water tap water well water root length and rdm values however were higher in amf plants irrigated with tap water 3 2 flower yield flower dm flowering date flower diameter spike number spike length and flower number were significantly different with different irrigation water sources for both amf and amf nemesia plants and both seasons tables 4 and 5 the increases in flower yield parameters early flowering flower number spike length and flower diameter due to different irrigation water sources tap water treated waste water well water were more pronounced in amf than amf in nemesia plants the amf plants also had a higher spike number and fdm than the amf plants these values also varied with irrigation water source treated waste water well water tap water 3 3 gas exchange c i and pn were higher in amf plants compared to amf plants for all the irrigation water treatments in amf nemesia plants the values of gs and e increased in tap water and waste water treatments and decreased in well water treatment fig 1 a b c and d values of gs and c i were higher in amf plants treated with waste water compared to those treated with tap water in amf plants irrigated with well water the pn content increased during the growth stage in plants irrigated with waste water it did not the value of e decreased in amf plants irrigated with tap water and increased in amf plants irrigated with well water 3 4 proline content the proline content in amf and amf nemesia plant leaves varied with irrigation water source tap water treated waste water well water fig 2 a an increase in proline content was related to the degree of the mycorrhizal infection in all irrigation water treatments amf plants had a lower proline content in their leaves than amf plants 3 5 mineral composition leaves of amf nemesia plants had higher contents of total p na cl ca and k than those of amf plants fig 2 b d in amf plants irrigated with tap water the total p ca and k recorded was higher than in waste water and well water irrigation both amf and amf plants irrigated with tap water had lower na and cl contents fig 2 c and e than plants irrigated with waste water and well water reduction in plant mineral contents due to irrigation water source was greater in amf than amf plants 3 6 photosynthetic pigments irrigation with well water significantly decreased ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents in nemesia leaves and this decrease was greater in amf plants fig 3 ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents in leaves were significantly higher in amf plants treated with waste water compared with other treatments irrigation with well water significantly decreased the content of carotenoids and anthocyanin in the leaves of amf and amf plants the anthocyanin content in leaves of amf plants was significantly higher than in leaves of amf plants in all irrigation water treatments 3 7 leaf water status relative water content percentage rwc was highly affected by the amf inoculation and water irrigation source fig 4 a rwc was significantly higher in amf plants than amf plants and in tap water treated waste water well water leaf water potential was higher significantly in amf plants than in amf plants for all water sources it was also higher negative in plants irrigated with well water fig 4 b 3 8 mycorrhizal colonization levels no mycorrhizal colonization was detected in the amf nemesia plants the cf ad and mi in nemesia root materials varied significantly with different sources of irrigation water table 6 the cf and ad levels in roots of amf plants were significantly higher in plants irrigated with tap water compared to waste water and well water 4 discussion in this study amf inoculation significantly enhanced plant height leaf number shoot and root dry mass and leaf area this may be due to a larger allocation of carbohydrates to the shoot than root tissues shokri and maadi 2009 in general plants colonized with amf had a greater flower yield than amf plants this agrees with previous findings in other ornamental plants augé et al 1987 ismaiel et al 2014 li and li 2009 waste water irrigation resulted in a greater flower yield flower dry mass spike length spike numbers and flower numbers well water irrigation caused reductions in a few flower parameters and delayed flowering in both amf and amf nemesia plants compared with other irrigation water treatments in this investigation the rate of growth in response to mycorrhizal inoculation varied with irrigation water source gómez bellot et al 2014 ismaiel et al 2014 increases in growth parameters of nemesia plants were directly proportional to the levels of cf and ad reductions in amf colonization levels and mycorrhizal dependence with wastewater and well water were observed this is inconsistent with previous studies of ismaiel et al 2014 wang et al 2018 it has been also observed during this study that beneficial effects of amf on flowering growth of nemesia plants are more pronounced in tap water wastewater than well water these positive effects may be due to the improvement of phosphorus and nitrogen nutrition smith et al 2011 the enhancement of gas exchange parameters augé 2001 and to the increase of root density bryle and duniway 1997 heightened growth influences of amf on plants are often related to improved acquisition of p and other elements cl k na and ca al karaki 1997 augé 2001 the total p concentration of plants irrigated with well water was significantly lower compared with tap water and waste water reduction of total p acceptance in saline soils is attributed to precipitation of h2po4 with ca2 ions in the soil as well as ca and k competition with na ions marschner 1995 a large influence of amf on the uptake of total p was observed even in plants irrigated with tap water furthermore it has been specified that the major mechanism for enhancing irrigation in amf plants was the improvement in total p nutrition giri et al 2007 it is also considered one of the major causes for amelioration of growth in amf plants irrigated with well water ruiz lozano and aroca 2010 under phosphorus limited conditions mycorrhizal association improves phosphorus supply to the infected roots of host plants bucher 2007 for example pi uptake rate was markedly improved in the amf colonized maize plants garcés ruiz et al 2017 increased photosynthetic activities and other leaf functions are directly related to improved growth frequency of amf inoculation that is directly linked to the uptake of n p and carbon which move towards roots and promote the development of tubers it has been observed that amf maintain p and n uptake ultimately helping in plant development at higher and lower p levels under different irrigation regimes liu et al 2014 2018 the interaction of salinity stress and amf significantly affects the concentrations of p and n and the n p ratio in plant shoots wang et al 2018 na and cl concentrations were significantly higher in leaves of well water irrigated amf plants than amf plants ca and k were significantly greater in the leaves of tap water irrigated amf plants than amf plants higher k buildup in amf plants irrigated with well water could be useful to maintain a high k na ratio and by inducing the ionic equilibrium of the cytoplasm or na efflux from plants el nashar 2014 giri et al 2007 na content was lower in amf than amf plants in all irrigation treatments the deficiency of response to na content in amf plants may be explained by the dilution influences of the improvement in plant growth caused by amf colonization morte et al 2000 giri et al 2007 the presence of amf and k concentration in plants was positively correlated which shows amf protects nemesia plants from the negative effects of waste water and well water ruiz lozano and azcón 1995 the result of waste water irrigation on the soil nutrient status and nutrient use efficacy is mentioned in terms of vegetable plant production the yield of marketable plants was higher with waste water treatment compared to well water gatta et al 2015 this agrees with previous research that showed waste water irrigation significantly increased the leaf numbers leaf area dry mass setaria italica yield and flower yield of plants in comparison with the well water treatment aghtape et al 2011 cirelli et al 2012 irrigation water has inorganic constituents including salts and dissolved nutrients these salts vary greatly in both concentration and structure the main components of dissolved salts are cations including na ca2 and mg2 and anions including cl hco3 and so4 2 connor et al 2017 soil irrigation with treated waste water usually significantly enhances amounts of cations and their salts for example chlorides bicarbonates phosphates and sulfates connor et al 2017 alghobar and suresha 2015 furthermore the concentration of these cations in the soil varies with the kind of vegetable cultivated as the nutrient uptake and accumulation varies with plant species khalid et al 2017 blok et al 2017 numerous studies report an increase in the concentrations of k na and ca in the soil and in vegetables due to irrigation with waste water thapliyal et al 2011 khalid et al 2017 during the different growth stages of nemesia plants inoculation with amf significantly improved the photosynthetic capacity by increasing the ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents of the plant fig 3 a plants irrigated with waste water and inoculated with amf had a greater increase in chl content than amf plants irrigated with tap water plants irrigation with well water and inoculated with amf had a greater increase in chl content than amf plants inoculation was shown to increase the carotenoids and anthocyanin content of leaves of tested plants which has previously been shown in the literature bhattacharjee and sharma 2012 irrigation with well water decreased both pigments in all plants pigment increase in amf plants may be as a result of an increase in transpiration photosynthesis stomatal conductance and enhanced plant growth scagel 2003 rajasekaran et al 2006 it could also have been caused by the presence of large and more numerous package sheath chloroplasts in the inoculated leaves krishna and bagyaraj 1984 sou et al 2013 in inoculated plants that were irrigated with waste water and tap water a greater stimulatory effect on the ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents was observed than for plants irrigated with well water similar conclusions were found for the pigeon pea plant by bhattacharjee and sharma 2012 carotenoids and anthocyanin form part of the antioxidant system of the plant mittler 2002 the increase in chl carotenoids and anthocyanin content in amf inoculated plants has been shown to meet the carbon requirements of these plants lalitha and santhaguru 2012 the development of the stress tolerance mechanism through amf symbiosis is often connected with the amelioration of the antioxidant activities in plants baslam and goicoechea 2012 on other hand it was apparent from fig 3 a and b that irrigation with waste water resulted in reduced ch1 a and ch1 b contents in nemesia plants than plants irrigated with fresh water these discoveries are supported by those of shanker et al 2005 who described the inefficiency of the chloroplast ultrastructure and inhibition of electron transport processes in plants grown in high concentrations of heavy metals the differences between g s e and the salt stresses were significant the decrease of gs and e under well water stress may be an adaptive response to decreased dw or may not be correlated to tap water and waste water treatments but rather persuaded by the physical or chemical signal materials of roots stimulated by salt zheng et al 2002 pn of a plant usually decreases with rising salt stress koyro 2006 however this study results indicated that pn and ci of snapdragon did not decrease but increased slightly under moderate well water only when the intensity of waste water was the pn decreased within the normal physiological adaptability of snapdragon its growth reduction was a result of decreasing photosynthetic area and was independent of its pn reduced plant pn under waste water and well water is probably a result of the reduction of ci partial pressure caused by stomatal closure although non stomatal factors have also been mentioned bethke and drew 1992 water status parameters in the leaves of amf and amf nemesia plants were greatly reduced by irrigation with well water however all amf nemesia plants had a significantly higher rwc than amf plants as previously shown this is due to amf absorbing water and mineral elements that increases the water uptake ability and water use effectiveness in these plants allen 1982 abdel salam et al 2018 in this study the low water potential of amf plants irrigated with well water indicates that amf symbiosis improved depending on irrigation source the mycorrhizal colonization percentage in roots irrigated with well water was lower than roots irrigated with tap water generally it was observed that the highest mycorrhizal colonization was in plants irrigated with waste water at the harvest stage similarly abdel salam et al 2018 reported that mycorrhizal colonization increased in rose roots at the harvest it then reduced and this led to an increase in n and photosynthate that are mobilized and translocated from vegetative tissues to reproductive tissues abdel salam et al 2018 it has been mentioned that amf are useful to plant element uptake specifically p uptake smith and read 2008 amf associated with plants are a vital link for effective phosphorus nutrition augé 2001 xavier and germida 2003 and to increase root density bryle and duniway 1997 in our results we showed a general reduction in the number of nodules attained per waste water irrigated plant at harvest stage this reduction is caused by the effect of toxic heavy metals on the growth of amf bhandal et al 1990 waste water irrigation may be a source of useful bacteria for soils covarrubias et al 2012 an increase in the action of some enzymes including phosphatase cellulases laccases proteolytic and hydrolytic has been reported in soils irrigated with treated waste water duran and esposito 2000 frenk et al 2014 this influence may be due to the delivery of organic carbon as suggested by the simultaneous increase in the action of dehydrogenase that is commonly a parameter indicating biological oxidation of the organic materials frenk et al 2014 irrigation with waste water is expected to stimulate different metabolic pathways and organisms through organic compounds and supply of nutrients therefore we suggest that irrigation with waste water may stimulate micro organism activity involved in the biochemical balance of the components c n k and total p daims et al 2001 hanjra et al 2012 nevertheless the stimulation of large amounts of soil microbial activity may have damaging effects on soil properties this study shows that waste water irrigation of crops has both negative and positive effects however by applying cautionary measures and practices these harmful influences of waste water use can be reduced and make it a safe and dependable source of irrigation khalid et al 2018 5 conclusions in many semi arid and arid regions drought stress affects the physiological morphological and biochemical processes of plants this can result in changes in flower yield growth and metabolic pathways a decrease in plant growth in drought is due to the osmotic stress caused by reduced mineral nutrient uptake and soil water potential this investigation presented that amf inoculation significantly alleviated the damaging effects of waste water and well water on nemesia plants nemesia hybridus through improving flower yield and vegetative growth in conclusion amf inoculation can alleviate the harmful effects of waste water and well water on the flower yield and vegetative growth of

increased growth parameters mineral composition gas exchange parameters photosynthetic pigments and leaf water status indicators for all sources of irrigation water mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased all studied parameters transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration and net photosynthesis rate of the negative mycorrhizal plants was lower than those of positive mycorrhizal plants the majority of the vegetative growth flower yield mineral composition leaf water status and photosynthetic parameters varied with the mycorrhizal colonization the results of this research provide strong indication that amf inoculation can improve flower yield and growth quality of nemesia plants this is seen particularly in plants irrigated with treated waste water that had improved mineral uptake photosynthetic status and leaf water relations this study recommends irrigation with treated waste water with amf inoculation for nemesia production amf will enhance the

content treated waste water well water 1 introduction drought stress has a damaging effect on plant production globally especially in semi arid and arid zones like egypt and is predictable to increase with climate change as worldwide temperature and soil drought increase eea 2011 therefore it is necessary to think about using unconventional water sources for example treated waste water and well water for the growth and production of plants these water sources are currently untapped in the egyptian environment and have a low cost of use compared to scarce fresh water in semi arid and arid environments crop water requirements are mainly supplied through irrigation water that usually contains large amounts of dissolved mineral salts consequently salinity control is often the main goal of irrigation water management dehyer and gordon 2004 in high salinity conditions there is often widespread abiotic stress that is the limiting factor in crop productivity and plant distribution qin et

opportunities and challenges with regards to its usages plus its health and environmental influences in semi arid and arid areas of the world waste water crop irrigation has to a large extent alleviated water deficits the nutritional worth of waste water has also been an attractive quality of its extensive usage in crop irrigation gatta et al 2015 small concentrations of micro nutrients are useful for the growth and metabolism of plants however are poisonous when present in excess kocak et al 2005 sou et al 2013 therefore untreated waste water irrigation can be detrimental to human health and the environment one of the major issues associated with this practice is the accumulation of heavy metals hm in the soil plants food chains and eventually in humans khalid et al 2018 nagajyothi et al 2009 most terrestrial plants have symbiotic associations with soil fungi arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are associated with approximately 85 95 of herbaceous plants trappe 1987 krishna

three randomly chosen nemesia plants were selected and picked up from each pot within the morning 9 30 am than fm was measured immediately then leaves were floated for 2 h on distilled water in closed petri dishes at room temperature of about 23 2 c under conditions without light in order to obtain the turgid mass tm the dm was measured after over drying at 110 c for 24 h rwc fm dm tm dm 100 leaf water potential ψ w was estimated using a water potential system psypro wescor ut usa and replicated three times for each treatment each leaf tested was fitted into the leaf hygrometer we recorded these between 11 15 to 12 10 am flowering stage the cycle was as follows 25 s measurement periods 5 s read average seconds 5 s plateau delay and 15 s cooling time 2 4 8 mycorrhizal colonization levels to estimate the levels of mycorrhizal colonization the root system of the plants was washed carefully straight after harvest with fresh water to remove soil the washed roots were then cut into 0 25 0 5 cm pieces the root pieces were cleaned in 10 potassium hydroxide solution koh the cleaned root pieces were then stained following the method reported by phillips and hayman 1970 by using lactophenol with 0 05 trypan blue pigment stained root fragments were studied below a compound microscope at 40x magnification the colonization frequency cf mycorrhizal infection intensity mi and arbuscular development frequency ad in the infected roots were calculated according to the methods trouvelot et al 1986 using the mycocalc software 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental design was split plot through three replications three irrigation water treatments were randomly allocated to the main plots and two amf inoculation treatments amf without and amf with were applied within the sub plots there were four plants per treatment for each replication and an experimental unit consists of 72 pots 3 irrigation water sources 2 amf inoculation 3 replicates the collected data were statistically analyzed using sas program sas version 9 2 institute cary n c u s a software differences among means were analyzed with a revised least significant difference l s d test at the significance level of p 0 05 steel and torrie 1986 3 results the analyses of variance anova for the studied parameters are presented in table 2 the results showed highly significant differences among irrigation water sources main plots amf inoculation treatments sub plots as well as their interaction across all studied parameters with the exception of flower dry mass in the second season 3 1 vegetative growth plant height leaf number leaf area branch number root length sdm and rdm were affected by different irrigation water treatments tables 3 and 4 irrigation with waste water produced the highest values of plant height leaf number leaf area branch number and sdm in both seasons for amf and amf nemesia plants in amf plants an increase in plant height leaf number leaf area and sdm occurred as a result of response to irrigation water treated waste water tap water well water root length and rdm values however were higher in amf plants irrigated with tap water 3 2 flower yield flower dm flowering date flower diameter spike number spike length and flower number were significantly different with different irrigation water sources for both amf and amf nemesia plants and both seasons tables 4 and 5 the increases in flower yield parameters early flowering flower number spike length and flower diameter due to different irrigation water sources tap water treated waste water well water were more pronounced in amf than amf in nemesia plants the amf plants also had a higher spike number and fdm than the amf plants these values also varied with irrigation water source treated waste water well water tap water 3 3 gas exchange c i and pn were higher in amf plants compared to amf plants for all the irrigation water treatments in amf nemesia plants the values of gs and e increased in tap water and waste water treatments and decreased in well water treatment fig 1 a b c and d values of gs and c i were higher in amf plants treated with waste water compared to those treated with tap water in amf plants irrigated with well water the pn content increased during the growth stage in plants irrigated with waste water it did not the value of e decreased in amf plants irrigated with tap water and increased in amf plants irrigated with well water 3 4 proline content the proline content in amf and amf nemesia plant leaves varied with irrigation water source tap water treated waste water well water fig 2 a an increase in proline content was related to the degree of the mycorrhizal infection in all irrigation water treatments amf plants had a lower proline content in their leaves than amf plants 3 5 mineral composition leaves of amf nemesia plants had higher contents of total p na cl ca and k than those of amf plants fig 2 b d in amf plants irrigated with tap water the total p ca and k recorded was higher than in waste water and well water irrigation both amf and amf plants irrigated with tap water had lower na and cl contents fig 2 c and e than plants irrigated with waste water and well water reduction in plant mineral contents due to irrigation water source was greater in amf than amf plants 3 6 photosynthetic pigments irrigation with well water significantly decreased ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents in nemesia leaves and this decrease was greater in amf plants fig 3 ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents in leaves were significantly higher in amf plants treated with waste water compared with other treatments irrigation with well water significantly decreased the content of carotenoids and anthocyanin in the leaves of amf and amf plants the anthocyanin content in leaves of amf plants was significantly higher than in leaves of amf plants in all irrigation water treatments 3 7 leaf water status relative water content percentage rwc was highly affected by the amf inoculation and water irrigation source fig 4 a rwc was significantly higher in amf plants than amf plants and in tap water treated waste water well water leaf water potential was higher significantly in amf plants than in amf plants for all water sources it was also higher negative in plants irrigated with well water fig 4 b 3 8 mycorrhizal colonization levels no mycorrhizal colonization was detected in the amf nemesia plants the cf ad and mi in nemesia root materials varied significantly with different sources of irrigation water table 6 the cf and ad levels in roots of amf plants were significantly higher in plants irrigated with tap water compared to waste water and well water 4 discussion in this study amf inoculation significantly enhanced plant height leaf number shoot and root dry mass and leaf area this may be due to a larger allocation of carbohydrates to the shoot than root tissues shokri and maadi 2009 in general plants colonized with amf had a greater flower yield than amf plants this agrees with previous findings in other ornamental plants augé et al 1987 ismaiel et al 2014 li and li 2009 waste water irrigation resulted in a greater flower yield flower dry mass spike length spike numbers and flower numbers well water irrigation caused reductions in a few flower parameters and delayed flowering in both amf and amf nemesia plants compared with other irrigation water treatments in this investigation the rate of growth in response to mycorrhizal inoculation varied with irrigation water source gómez bellot et al 2014 ismaiel et al 2014 increases in growth parameters of nemesia plants were directly proportional to the levels of cf and ad reductions in amf colonization levels and mycorrhizal dependence with wastewater and well water were observed this is inconsistent with previous studies of ismaiel et al 2014 wang et al 2018 it has been also observed during this study that beneficial effects of amf on flowering growth of nemesia plants are more pronounced in tap water wastewater than well water these positive effects may be due to the improvement of phosphorus and nitrogen nutrition smith et al 2011 the enhancement of gas exchange parameters augé 2001 and to the increase of root density bryle and duniway 1997 heightened growth influences of amf on plants are often related to improved acquisition of p and other elements cl k na and ca al karaki 1997 augé 2001 the total p concentration of plants irrigated with well water was significantly lower compared with tap water and waste water reduction of total p acceptance in saline soils is attributed to precipitation of h2po4 with ca2 ions in the soil as well as ca and k competition with na ions marschner 1995 a large influence of amf on the uptake of total p was observed even in plants irrigated with tap water furthermore it has been specified that the major mechanism for enhancing irrigation in amf plants was the improvement in total p nutrition giri et al 2007 it is also considered one of the major causes for amelioration of growth in amf plants irrigated with well water ruiz lozano and aroca 2010 under phosphorus limited conditions mycorrhizal association improves phosphorus supply to the infected roots of host plants bucher 2007 for example pi uptake rate was markedly improved in the amf colonized maize plants garcés ruiz et al 2017 increased photosynthetic activities and other leaf functions are directly related to improved growth frequency of amf inoculation that is directly linked to the uptake of n p and carbon which move towards roots and promote the development of tubers it has been observed that amf maintain p and n uptake ultimately helping in plant development at higher and lower p levels under different irrigation regimes liu et al 2014 2018 the interaction of salinity stress and amf significantly affects the concentrations of p and n and the n p ratio in plant shoots wang et al 2018 na and cl concentrations were significantly higher in leaves of well water irrigated amf plants than amf plants ca and k were significantly greater in the leaves of tap water irrigated amf plants than amf plants higher k buildup in amf plants irrigated with well water could be useful to maintain a high k na ratio and by inducing the ionic equilibrium of the cytoplasm or na efflux from plants el nashar 2014 giri et al 2007 na content was lower in amf than amf plants in all irrigation treatments the deficiency of response to na content in amf plants may be explained by the dilution influences of the improvement in plant growth caused by amf colonization morte et al 2000 giri et al 2007 the presence of amf and k concentration in plants was positively correlated which shows amf protects nemesia plants from the negative effects of waste water and well water ruiz lozano and azcón 1995 the result of waste water irrigation on the soil nutrient status and nutrient use efficacy is mentioned in terms of vegetable plant production the yield of marketable plants was higher with waste water treatment compared to well water gatta et al 2015 this agrees with previous research that showed waste water irrigation significantly increased the leaf numbers leaf area dry mass setaria italica yield and flower yield of plants in comparison with the well water treatment aghtape et al 2011 cirelli et al 2012 irrigation water has inorganic constituents including salts and dissolved nutrients these salts vary greatly in both concentration and structure the main components of dissolved salts are cations including na ca2 and mg2 and anions including cl hco3 and so4 2 connor et al 2017 soil irrigation with treated waste water usually significantly enhances amounts of cations and their salts for example chlorides bicarbonates phosphates and sulfates connor et al 2017 alghobar and suresha 2015 furthermore the concentration of these cations in the soil varies with the kind of vegetable cultivated as the nutrient uptake and accumulation varies with plant species khalid et al 2017 blok et al 2017 numerous studies report an increase in the concentrations of k na and ca in the soil and in vegetables due to irrigation with waste water thapliyal et al 2011 khalid et al 2017 during the different growth stages of nemesia plants inoculation with amf significantly improved the photosynthetic capacity by increasing the ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents of the plant fig 3 a plants irrigated with waste water and inoculated with amf had a greater increase in chl content than amf plants irrigated with tap water plants irrigation with well water and inoculated with amf had a greater increase in chl content than amf plants inoculation was shown to increase the carotenoids and anthocyanin content of leaves of tested plants which has previously been shown in the literature bhattacharjee and sharma 2012 irrigation with well water decreased both pigments in all plants pigment increase in amf plants may be as a result of an increase in transpiration photosynthesis stomatal conductance and enhanced plant growth scagel 2003 rajasekaran et al 2006 it could also have been caused by the presence of large and more numerous package sheath chloroplasts in the inoculated leaves krishna and bagyaraj 1984 sou et al 2013 in inoculated plants that were irrigated with waste water and tap water a greater stimulatory effect on the ch1 a ch1 b and ch1 a b contents was observed than for plants irrigated with well water similar conclusions were found for the pigeon pea plant by bhattacharjee and sharma 2012 carotenoids and anthocyanin form part of the antioxidant system of the plant mittler 2002 the increase in chl carotenoids and anthocyanin content in amf inoculated plants has been shown to meet the carbon requirements of these plants lalitha and santhaguru 2012 the development of the stress tolerance mechanism through amf symbiosis is often connected with the amelioration of the antioxidant activities in plants baslam and goicoechea 2012 on other hand it was apparent from fig 3 a and b that irrigation with waste water resulted in reduced ch1 a and ch1 b contents in nemesia plants than plants irrigated with fresh water these discoveries are supported by those of shanker et al 2005 who described the inefficiency of the chloroplast ultrastructure and inhibition of electron transport processes in plants grown in high concentrations of heavy metals the differences between g s e and the salt stresses were significant the decrease of gs and e under well water stress may be an adaptive response to decreased dw or may not be correlated to tap water and waste water treatments but rather persuaded by the physical or chemical signal materials of roots stimulated by salt zheng et al 2002 pn of a plant usually decreases with rising salt stress koyro 2006 however this study results indicated that pn and ci of snapdragon did not decrease but increased slightly under moderate well water only when the intensity of waste water was the pn decreased within the normal physiological adaptability of snapdragon its growth reduction was a result of decreasing photosynthetic area and was independent of its pn reduced plant pn under waste water and well water is probably a result of the reduction of ci partial pressure caused by stomatal closure although non stomatal factors have also been mentioned bethke and drew 1992 water status parameters in the leaves of amf and amf nemesia plants were greatly reduced by irrigation with well water however all amf nemesia plants had a significantly higher rwc than amf plants as previously shown this is due to amf absorbing water and mineral elements that increases the water uptake ability and water use effectiveness in these plants allen 1982 abdel salam et al 2018 in this study the low water potential of amf plants irrigated with well water indicates that amf symbiosis improved depending on irrigation source the mycorrhizal colonization percentage in roots irrigated with well water was lower than roots irrigated with tap water generally it was observed that the highest mycorrhizal colonization was in plants irrigated with waste water at the harvest stage similarly abdel salam et al 2018 reported that mycorrhizal colonization increased in rose roots at the harvest it then reduced and this led to an increase in n and photosynthate that are mobilized and translocated from vegetative tissues to reproductive tissues abdel salam et al 2018 it has been mentioned that amf are useful to plant element uptake specifically p uptake smith and read 2008 amf associated with plants are a vital link for effective phosphorus nutrition augé 2001 xavier and germida 2003 and to increase root density bryle and duniway 1997 in our results we showed a general reduction in the number of nodules attained per waste water irrigated plant at harvest stage this reduction is caused by the effect of toxic heavy metals on the growth of amf bhandal et al 1990 waste water irrigation may be a source of useful bacteria for soils covarrubias et al 2012 an increase in the action of some enzymes including phosphatase cellulases laccases proteolytic and hydrolytic has been reported in soils irrigated with treated waste water duran and esposito 2000 frenk et al 2014 this influence may be due to the delivery of organic carbon as suggested by the simultaneous increase in the action of dehydrogenase that is commonly a parameter indicating biological oxidation of the organic materials frenk et al 2014 irrigation with waste water is expected to stimulate different metabolic pathways and organisms through organic compounds and supply of nutrients therefore we suggest that irrigation with waste water may stimulate micro organism activity involved in the biochemical balance of the components c n k and total p daims et al 2001 hanjra et al 2012 nevertheless the stimulation of large amounts of soil microbial activity may have damaging effects on soil properties this study shows that waste water irrigation of crops has both negative and positive effects however by applying cautionary measures and practices these harmful influences of waste water use can be reduced and make it a safe and dependable source of irrigation khalid et al 2018 5 conclusions in many semi arid and arid regions drought stress affects the physiological morphological and biochemical processes of plants this can result in changes in flower yield growth and metabolic pathways a decrease in plant growth in drought is due to the osmotic stress caused by reduced mineral nutrient uptake and soil water potential this investigation presented that amf inoculation significantly alleviated the damaging effects of waste water and well water on nemesia plants nemesia hybridus through improving flower yield and vegetative growth in conclusion amf inoculation can alleviate the harmful effects of waste water and well water on the flower yield and vegetative growth of

10376,field experiment was performed on the loess plateau of china in 2018 and 2019 to investigate the effects of intercropping with nitrogen n management on proso millet growth and resource utilization a split plot experimental design for the planting pattern sole proso millet sp and proso millet mung bean intercropping pm and n fertilizer application rate n0 0 kg n ha 1 n60 60 kg n ha 1 n120 120 kg n ha 1 and n180 180 kg n ha 1 for proso millet was used results showed that intercropping combined with n fertilization enhanced the leaf photosynthetic efficiency of proso millet by facilitating stomatal opening and such improvements were conducive to increasing the maximal quantum yield of psii photochemistry and the photochemical quenching coefficient specifically intercropping combined with the n120 treatment was an efficient farming practice that increased radiation use efficiency by 18 1 and 17 9 water use efficiency by 60 2 and 61 8 and n uptake by 96 0 and 71 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with those parameters in the n0 treatment in the sole planting system similar improvements were observed for grain yield which reached maximum values at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the pm treatment these responses resulted in an increased harvest index and land equivalent ratio consequently intercropping combined with moderate n inputs reduces the chemical fertilizer application rate and increases crop productivity and is considered to be a reasonable strategy for field management keywords proso millet intercropping n fertilization resource use efficiency grain yield 1 introduction the global population is predicted to increase to 9 3 billion in 2050 which will lead to serious food security issues gerland et al 2014 accordingly crop yield must be improved to meet this demand and ensure food security under conditions of limited arable land and other resources although chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen n fertilizers increase crop productivity zhu and chen 2002 excessive fertilizer inputs result in severe biodiversity loss and environmental harm such as lake eutrophication soil acidification and global warming guo et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 intercropping an effective agricultural practice that involves growing two or more crops simultaneously in the same field can take full advantage of resources including light water nutrients and land reduce the demand for chemical compound inputs and increase farmland productivity li et al 2001 dhima et al 2007 compared with sole cropping intercropping is also an effective way to control pests diseases and weeds guo et al 2020 therefore intercropping is well known as the new green revolution that can increase land productivity by exploiting species complementarity and provide more opportunities for sustainable agricultural intensification martin guay et al 2018 cereal legume intercropping systems are a bright spot in modern agriculture in these systems the two species do not compete for precisely the same niche and adequately use resources in a complementary manner li et al 2009 buhk et al 2017 symbiotic n2 fixation is the dominant source of n for cereals through nutrient sharing under soil n deficiency conditions li et al 2009 hu et al 2017 in general the amount of n fixed by forage legumes is the same as the amount of n fertilizer used in conventional agriculture thus the n fertilizer application rate and environmental feedbacks can be reduced which facilitates cereal intercropping with legumes this technique is becoming popular in developing and european countries buhk et al 2017 in addition to n light is particularly important for crop growth and a linear correlation between the intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar and accumulated biomass is often observed in field crops mahallati et al 2015 wang et al 2017 productivity improvements result from higher ipar greater radiation use efficiency rue or a combination of the two willey 1990 zahedi et al 2015 intercrop combinations with distinct canopy structures including maize peanut awal et al 2006 and maize soybean liu et al 2017b increase light capture over space by reducing the proportion of light that reaches the ground previous studies have shown that in cereal legume intercropping systems crop productivity may be more affected by belowground than aboveground species interactions lv et al 2014 yang et al 2017 a deep rooted crop intercropped with a shallow rooted crop greatly improves water use efficiency wue by facilitating water use and reducing competition between the crops tanwar et al 2014 due to the complementary growth patterns of the crops in cereal legume intercropping crop yield is observably increased with lower inputs and higher efficiency herridge et al 2008 the loess plateau which is mainly located in northern central china represents a typical dryland agriculture region wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2019a although this region receives plentiful sunlight the low annual precipitation and high average temperatures seriously limit agricultural production and farmer incomes zhao et al 2013 the intercropping combination of proso millet panicum miliaceum l and mung bean vigna radiata l has been regarded as a technically sound method that is based on the ecological principles of facilitation and complementarity thus this practice has been rapidly applied in northwest china gong et al 2019 2020a 2020b to date most studies have focused on the advantages of intercropping and on nutrient acquisition for food crop species planted over large areas such as wheat maize and soybean few studies have highlighted the growth dynamics under proso millet mung bean intercropping systems with different n application levels additionally although the function of legumes in n2 fixation has been recognized the optimal n management practices for crop productivity and n requirements in cereal based intercropping systems still need more study therefore we hypothesized that intercropping combined with an n input rate lower than the maximum in this study would maintain yield stability and resource use efficiency in proso millet fields the main objectives of this research were to i explore the influences of intercropping with different n inputs on the crop growth of proso millet over time ii analyze the effects of canopy structure and nutrient content changes due to intercropping and n management on the leaf photosynthetic characteristics and iii compare the resource radiation n water and land capture and use efficiency and proso millet grain yield under the different n treatments in order to provide scientific guidance for recommending this practice 2 materials

grains were separately threshed and weighed as their corresponding yields at a 12 14 moisture content five plants were randomly selected from each plot for a total of 20 plants to determine the grain yield per plant and the 1000 grain weight the harvest index hi was calculated by dividing the grain yield and the aboveground dry matter accumulation by the unit area 2 3 8 land equivalent ratio ler the land equivalent ratio ler is defined as the yield advantage from intercropping and was calculated as follows willey 1979 11 l e r y i p y s p y i m y s m where yip and ysp represent the intercropped and sole grain yield of proso millet and yim and ysm represent the intercropped and sole grain yield of mung bean respectively if the ler is greater than 1 the results of intercropping are superior to those of sole cropping 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using statistical analysis software spss software 19 0 spss inst ltd usa and figures were drawn with origin 2018 analysis of variance anova was conducted with the standard split plot design analysis method to determine the significance of year and treatment effects and their interactions the mean values were compared with a least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 plant height and dry matter accumulation the plant height of proso millet showed a similar change trend over the two years and plant height increased as plant growth progressed fig 2 across n fertilizer treatments and years the average plant height in sp was less than that in pm and a significant difference was found between cropping systems p 0 01 table s1 similarly n fertilization significantly promoted plant growth p 0 05 across cropping systems and years compared to that under n0 the average plant height was 3 0 6 2 and 6 5 higher under the n60 n120 and n180 treatments respectively the dry matter accumulation of individual proso millet plants in the vegetative growth stages seeding jointing and heading varied greatly from that in the reproductive growth stages flowering filling and maturity fig 2 intercropping and n fertilization significantly improved the dry matter accumulation of individual proso millet plants and the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 table s1 on average across the n fertilizer treatments and years intercropped proso millet had 9 8 higher dry matter accumulation than monocultured proso millet in the same conditions similarly in the two cropping systems compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization consistently led to greater dry matter accumulation in proso millet resulting in increases of 14 9 32 4 in 2018 and 13 0 27 2 in 2019 3 2 chlorophyll content spad value and leaf area index lai the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction on the spad value was significant p 0 01 fig 3 and table s1 the average n fertilized spad value in the intercropping system was 1 5 and 5 9 higher than that in the monocropping system in 2018 and 2019 respectively n fertilization also increased the spad value averaged across the years the spad value was 3 0 9 1 and 10 4 higher at n60 n120 and n180 respectively than at n0 for the intercropped proso millet and 4 8 7 7 and 11 4 higher respectively than at n0 for the monocultured proso millet there were significant differences in the lai of proso millet between the intercropping and sole crop systems fig 3 and table s1 the effect of the year n treatment interaction on lai was significant p 0 05 and the average n fertilized lai in the intercropping system was 7 0 and 5 1 higher than that under the monocropping system in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly in both cropping systems compared with that under the n0 treatment n fertilization achieved consistently higher lai resulting in increases of 8 9 27 2 in 2018 and 9 7 21 7 in 2019 3 3 photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence the photosynthetic capacity of proso millet was greatly enhanced by the cropping systems and n fertilization at various growth stages fig 4 compared with that under sp pm significantly increased the leaf net photosynthetic rate a by an average of 5 2 and 9 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly n fertilization also produced a higher a value than the n0 treatment in both cropping systems and the percent increases were 11 4 for n60 21 3 for n120 and 23 0 for n180 in 2018 and 11 3 for n60 20 6 for n120 and 19 5 for n180 in 2019 however there was no significant effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction on the a value of proso millet table s2 similar improvements and impacts were observed in the transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance gs of proso millet the intercropping pattern and n fertilization increased the e and gs values over the two growing seasons on average which were 7 1 and 17 6 higher than those of the monocropping system and the n0 treatment respectively in contrast although the intercellular co2 concentration ci was improved by the cropping system and n fertilization the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 the chlorophyll fluorescence of proso millet had a similar change trend over the two years fig 5 overall neither intercropping nor n fertilization had a significant effect on the maximal quantum yield of psii photochemistry fv fm or the nonphotochemical quenching coefficient npq table s3 however fv fm was greatly improved by n fertilization at the filling stage especially in the n60 treatment which reached the maximum observed fv fm values in the two study years in contrast intercropping and n fertilization had a significant effect on the photochemical quenching coefficient qp at the early and later stages and the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 table s3 3 4 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar and radiation use efficiency rue the ipar of the proso millet was significantly increased by the intercropping system and n fertilization fig 6 the average ipar under the pm treatment increased by 4 7 in 2018 and 2 2 in 2019 over that in the sp treatment and the effect was significant in 2018 similarly over the cropping systems and compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization achieved consistently higher ipar resulting in increases of 9 8 17 2 in 2018 and 4 3 11 9 in 2019 in addition the intercropping system and n fertilization increased the rue and the improvement was 5 1 in 2018 and 4 0 in 2019 in the pm treatment the effect of the n treatment on rue was greater than that of the intercropping pattern and the effect was significant over the two study years fig 6 compared with the n0 treatment the rue was 5 5 higher for n60 11 5 higher for n120 and 15 4 higher for n180 in 2018 and 15 4 higher for n60 13 1 higher for n120 and 17 1 higher for n180 in 2019 3 5 soil water content swc soil water storage sws evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue water use was greatly influenced by the planting pattern fig 7 and table 1 in the whole soil profile swc was generally ranked as follows pm 6 6 in 2018 and 8 2 in 2019 sp 6 3 in 2018 and 5 4 in 2019 for the planting patterns and n0 6 6 in 2018 and 7 2 in 2019 n120 6 6 in 2018 and 7 1 in 2019 n60 6 4 in 2018 and 6 8 in 2019 n180 6 1 in 2018 and 6 3 in 2019 for the n fertilizer treatments fig 7 the regulation of sws led to changes in water characteristics accordingly compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization significantly increased sws and decreased et under the traditional system whereas the opposite results were observed in the intercropping system except for n60 with the sp treatment and n180 with the pm treatment in 2019 table 1 nevertheless across all treatments the wue was significantly improved p 0 05 and was 12 2 and 24 7 higher in intercropping treatments in 2018 and 2019 and 24 2 and 22 7 higher in n fertilizer treatments in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with the controls sp and n0 3 6 n uptake and n use efficiency n uptake and n use efficiency revealed substantial differences between the different planting patterns table 2 the n content in the grain and total plant of proso millet were significantly improved compared with those in the controls sp and n0 intercropping increased n uptake by an average of 15 4 and 7 8 in 2018 and 2019 and the increase was 47 4 and 42 9 under n fertilization in 2018 and 2019 respectively these results indicated enhanced n translocation and uptake from vegetative organs to grains however intercropping and n fertilization produced lower nue and nhi than those in the sp and n0 treatments additionally similar trends were observed in nupe and npe which had maximum values in the n60 treatment with pm over the two growing seasons 3 7 grain yield harvest index hi and land equivalent ratio ler as shown in table 3 the intercropping system and n fertilization significantly improved proso millet productivity compared with those in the controls sp and n0 the 1000 grain weight and grain yield per plant were increased under intercropping and n fertilization to some extent accordingly similar improvements were observed in grain yield which reached maximum values at n180 5631 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5646 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the sp treatment and at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the pm treatment the hi was significantly increased by intercropping and n fertilization and the effect of year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 05 furthermore based on the mung bean grain yield table s4 the ler was calculated as an indicator of land productivity the lers for the intercropping patterns were all greater than unity 1 and n fertilization significantly increased the lers which reached a maximum value at n120 2 07 in 2018 and 2 00 in 2019 in the pm treatment this indicated that intercropping and n fertilization contributed to land use efficiency improvement 4 discussion 4 1 crop growth photosynthesis is the basis of plant growth and development and is the main factor that determines the components of crop productivity fang et al 2018 intercropping used for crop cultivation has been found to change micro environmental factors especially light liu et al 2017a chi et al 2019 which strongly regulates the thermal conditions of agricultural soils in the current study the pm treatment produced greater improvements in spad than the sp treatment fig 3 the same trend occurred for photosynthesis fig 4 these results could be explained by the tall short canopy structure in the pm treatment which resulted in greater light capture and uptake this was also directly verified by the increased lai fig 6a which allowed the proso millet canopy to intercept more par stomatal conductance regulates the exchange of co2 and h2o between leaves and the environment and increased stomatal conductance is an adaptative mechanism by which plants enhance leaf photosynthesis mauney et al 1994 during the later stages of proso millet growth intercropping significantly induced leaf stomata opening which contributed to an increase in a and e the close relationship between a and stomatal conductance indicated that intercropping improved the photosynthetic apparatus and contributed to the increase in co2 assimilation duchene et al 2017 therefore the increased dry matter accumulation in proso millet under the pm treatment was attributed to the increased photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the enhanced spad a e gs and ci in addition based on the spatial compensation effect after mung bean early maturing was harvested the roots of proso millet late maturing could expand to the underground space previously occupied by mung bean leading to the absorption of more nutrients and water gong et al 2020a as a result the growth rate of proso millet accelerated and its dry matter accumulation increased in this study the average crop growth rate of the sole cropping system based on the aboveground dry matter accumulation of the late maturing proso millet from flowering to maturity was 45 0 accordingly the crop growth rate of the intercropping system was 50 9 across the two studied years fig 2b these results are consistent with findings from previous intercropping combinations yin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 suggesting that intercropped proso millet can compensate for its substandard growth during co growth with mung bean by rapidly improving its dry matter accumulation after the mung bean harvest the photosynthetic characteristics of leaves are closely related to n nutrition since proteins in the thylakoids and the calvin cycle represent most of the leaf n evans 1989 to a certain extent n fertilization allows a highly efficient transformation of co2 into carbohydrates leading to increased crop dry matter accumulation and grain yield rambo et al 2010 in the current study supplying n fertilizer optimized the canopy structure of proso millet leading to higher spad a e gs and ci figs 3 and 4 in both the sp and pm treatments compared with those with no fertilizer plants in the n treatment had a more obvious lai advantage fig 3b thereby reducing light leakage losses and increasing the plant assimilate supply capacity liu et al 2018 however the leaf photosynthetic capacity decreased with the increase in n fertilizer from 120 kg ha 1 to 180 kg ha 1 in the intercropping pattern whereas the maximum values were achieved at n180 in the sole cropping system the reason for this phenomenon might be that the effect of the n2 fixation of the intercropped mung bean on proso millet is stronger under a low soil n status than under a high soil n status and abundant n nutrition may restrain leaf development chlorophyll fluorescence is a good way to assess the absorption and utilization of light energy by leaves cordon et al 2016 chloroplasts serve as storage units for n and more than 70 of n in plants is stored in chloroplasts therefore since chlorophyll is synthesized from compounds containing n leaf photosynthetic characteristics are directly affected by exposure to different n levels wen et al 2019 accordingly in this study fv fm and qp were greatly improved by n fertilization at the filling stage especially with the n60 treatment in the intercropping system which attained the maximum fv fm and qp values in both study years fig 5 these findings are consistent with a previous study showing that n supply improved leaf photosynthetic activity in maize and delayed plant senescence kitonyo et al 2018 however under the traditional planting pattern the increase in qp was maximized by the high fertilizer treatment n180 indicating that low n fertilizer combined with legume intercropping was conducive to increasing the electron transfer quantum efficiency of psii and the use of excess light energy which might reduce the dissipation of excess energy as heat 4 2 intercropping advantages and resource radiation water n and land use efficiency many studies have reported that intercropping with legumes has a significant impact on increasing the grain yield of the intercropped cereal such as in a maize cowpea intercropping combination maize grain yield was increased by 25 latati et al 2014 and a wheat soybean intercropping combination wheat grain yield was increased by 29 li et al 2001 similar results were found in our experiment the grain yield of proso millet was improved by 10 3 in 2018 and 17 5 in 2019 in the intercropping system with mung bean compared to that of the sole proso millet treatments table 3 this may be attributable to the interspecific facilitation and competition that occurs when proso millet is the dominant species gong et al 2020a n is an important element in the competitive or supplementary use of crops tan et al 2020 cereals in intercropping systems primarily obtain soil inorganic n via competition with the other intercropping species crozat et al 1994 in comparison legumes mainly depend on symbiotic n2 fixation by their root nodules for n and abundant fertilization may inhibit n2 fixation weakening crop productivity li et al 2009 in this study n fertilization significantly increased the grain yield of proso millet which was 16 6 35 3 and 11 7 26 1 higher than that in the n0 treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively however the maximum values were attained at n180 5631 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5646 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the sp treatment and at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the pm treatment this indicates that n plays greater role in improving crop productivity than intercropping and suitable n management is one of main practices in achieving the advantages of intercropping in terms of grain yield mung bean facilitated n nutrition of proso millet in intercropping and achieved high proso millet grain yield and enhanced land productivity by reducing the input requirement for chemical n fertilizer based on the significant effect of the cropping system n treatment interaction table 3 decreases in hi and ler with n rates based on grain yield were found in present study which further indicated that the yield advantage of intercropping can be modulated by n supply in a legume based intercropping system such as proso millet mung bean intercropping this is important for farmers to develop legume based intercropping with low inputs and high outputs our findings elucidate there is large space to reduce n fertilizer for current proso millet and mung bean production in the northwest of china furthermore over application restrained n2 fixation leading to low n efficiency and substantial negative environmental impacts chen et al 2014b hu et al 2016 intercropping systems are more productive than a single crop often due to increased light capture or more efficient use of light awal et al 2006 the yield advantage of intercropped proso millet in this study was mainly attributed to a combination of these two since significantly increases in ipar and rue were found for intercropped species fig 6 which was due to the same density as sole proso millet cropping and the border row effect for both rows of intercropped proso millet plants our results showed that dry matter accumulation in intercropping was higher than those in monoculture indicating that intercropping promoted the vegetative growth of the taller proso millet plants additionally the interception and utilization of canopy light were increased with n fertilizer n180 reached the maximum ipar 1688 4 mj m 2 and rue 3 19 g mj 1 for sole system across average two years in contrast the maximum ipar 1732 8 mj m 2 and rue 3 16 g mj 1 for the intercropping system were reached at n120 fig 6 these differences might have arisen because an abundant n supply in a legume based intercropping system has a negative effect on radiation capture by regulating the physiology and structure of cereal leaves wang et al 2015b during the co growth period of intercropped species the roots of the early maturity crop early sown crop can spread into the territory of the late maturity crop late sown crop and compete for soil water with the late maturity crop in contrast the roots of late maturity crops may extend into the root zones of early maturity crops to absorb the remaining soil water after the early maturity crops are harvested which is conducive to increasing the compensatory effect of water on the late maturity crops gao et al 2010 chen et al 2014a yin et al 2018 in our study through the soil column swc was generally ranked as pm 6 6 in 2018 and 8 2 in 2019 sp 6 3 in 2018 and 5 4 in 2019 in the two planting patterns table 1 the sws in the upper soil was significantly higher than that in the lower soil which may be driven by the root water potential lafolie et al 1999 in this case the intercropping system increased the ability of plants to utilize soil water via exchanges between the different soil layers as shown by the higher sws and wue and lower et of late maturity proso millet in fact strong plant transpiration in crop photosynthetic systems is the physiological basis for efficient water use especially in semiarid regions ashraf and harris 2013 therefore although n fertilizer did not similarly increase or decrease sws or et the n supply was beneficial for improving the wue of proso millet the greatest effect was found in the n120 and n180 treatments in the intercropping system in 2018 and 2019 table 1 as indicated by the higher grain yield than that in the control therefore when n fertilization was combined with intercropping the capacity for soil water conservation in this arid environment was greatly improved n fertilization is a double edged sword it can increase agricultural production but the excessive use of n fertilizer reduces nue and has harmful environmental impacts consequently management strategies aimed at maintaining farmland productivity and minimizing environmental costs are urgently needed zhu and chen 2002 du et al 2020 in the present study proso millet and mung bean were relay planted in a strip intercropping system with different n management regimes the n content and uptake of sole proso millet were highest at n180 while those of intercropped proso millet were highest at n120 table 2 this difference was probably caused by n loss and n mineralization under intercropping and the corresponding monocultures chen et al 2019 in addition compared to those under n0 n fertilization significantly decreased the nue and nhi under the sole cropping system but no change trend was observed under the intercropping system averaged across the years this indicates that while the n demand of proso millet growth could be met by biological n2 fixation under the cereal legume intercropping system when mineral n was insufficient if more n were supplied the nutrition would be not absorbed by plants and would be harmful to the environment however this study mainly discussed the effects of n fertilization on n absorption and utilization in proso millet in proso millet mung bean intercropping the performance characteristics of mung bean need further study figs 7 and 8 5 conclusions proso millet mung bean intercropping increased the land use efficiency and grain yield of proso millet compared to those under monocropping on the loess plateau of china intercropping combined with n fertilization promoted proso millet growth as shown by the increased photosynthetic activity and dry matter accumulation accordingly this practice enhanced the capacity of proso millet plants to take up nutrients capture soil water and intercept par resulting in increased crop productivity however the intercropping advantage of proso millet under high fertilization was restrained as measured by its weaker growth state and lower resource use efficiency than at lower fertilization levels the highest grain yield of proso millet was observed at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 in the intercropping system intercropping combined with a moderate n fertilizer application rate increased grain yield by promoting proso millet growth and resource use efficiency based on the improvement in crop productivity without additional n input therefore this valuable cropping system would be a promising alternative farming practice for the loess plateau of china and other areas with similar ecosystems declaration of competing interest none

10376,field experiment was performed on the loess plateau of china in 2018 and 2019 to investigate the effects of intercropping with nitrogen n management on proso millet growth and resource utilization a split plot experimental design for the planting pattern sole proso millet sp and proso millet mung bean intercropping pm and n fertilizer application rate n0 0 kg n ha 1 n60 60 kg n ha 1 n120 120 kg n ha 1 and n180 180 kg n ha 1 for proso millet was used results showed that intercropping combined with n fertilization enhanced the leaf photosynthetic efficiency of proso millet by facilitating stomatal opening and such improvements were conducive to increasing the maximal quantum yield of psii photochemistry and the photochemical quenching coefficient specifically intercropping combined with the n120 treatment was an efficient farming practice that increased radiation use efficiency by 18 1 and 17 9 water use efficiency by 60 2 and 61 8 and n uptake by 96 0 and 71 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with those parameters in the n0 treatment in the sole planting system similar improvements were observed for grain yield which reached maximum values at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the pm treatment these responses resulted in an increased harvest index and land equivalent ratio consequently intercropping combined with moderate n inputs reduces the chemical fertilizer application rate and increases crop productivity and is considered to be a reasonable strategy for field management keywords proso millet intercropping n fertilization resource use efficiency grain yield 1 introduction the global population is predicted to increase to 9 3 billion in 2050 which will lead to serious food security issues gerland et al 2014 accordingly crop yield must be improved to meet this demand and ensure food security under conditions of limited arable land and other resources although chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen n fertilizers increase crop productivity zhu and chen 2002 excessive fertilizer inputs result in severe biodiversity loss and environmental harm such as lake eutrophication soil acidification and global warming guo et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 intercropping an effective agricultural practice that involves growing two or more crops simultaneously in the same field can take full advantage of resources including light water nutrients and land reduce the demand for chemical compound inputs and increase farmland productivity li et al 2001 dhima et al 2007 compared with sole cropping intercropping is also an effective way to control pests diseases and weeds guo et al 2020 therefore intercropping is well known as the new green revolution that can increase land productivity by exploiting species complementarity and provide more opportunities for sustainable agricultural intensification martin guay et al 2018 cereal legume intercropping systems are a bright spot in modern agriculture in these systems the two species do not compete for precisely the same niche and adequately use resources in a complementary manner li et al 2009 buhk et al 2017 symbiotic n2 fixation is the dominant source of n for cereals through nutrient sharing under soil n deficiency conditions li et al 2009 hu et al 2017 in general the amount of n fixed by forage legumes is the same as the amount of n fertilizer used in conventional agriculture thus the n fertilizer application rate and environmental feedbacks can be reduced which facilitates cereal intercropping with legumes this technique is becoming popular in developing and european countries buhk et al 2017 in addition to n light is particularly important for crop growth and a linear correlation between the intercepted

liu et al 2017b increase light capture over space by reducing the proportion of light that reaches the ground previous studies have shown that in cereal legume intercropping systems crop productivity may be more affected by belowground than aboveground species interactions lv et al 2014 yang et al 2017 a deep rooted crop intercropped with a shallow rooted crop greatly improves water use efficiency wue by facilitating water use and reducing competition between the crops tanwar et al 2014 due to the complementary growth patterns of the crops in cereal legume intercropping crop yield is observably increased with lower inputs and higher efficiency herridge et al 2008 the loess plateau which is mainly located in northern central china represents a typical dryland agriculture region wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2019a although this region receives plentiful sunlight the low annual precipitation and high average temperatures seriously limit agricultural production and farmer incomes zhao et al 2013 the intercropping combination of proso millet panicum miliaceum l and mung bean vigna radiata l has been regarded as a technically sound method that is based on the ecological principles of facilitation and complementarity thus this practice has been rapidly applied in northwest china gong et al 2019 2020a 2020b to date most studies have focused on the advantages of intercropping and on nutrient acquisition for food crop species planted over large areas such as wheat maize and soybean few studies have highlighted the growth dynamics under proso millet mung bean intercropping systems with different n application levels additionally although the function of legumes in n2 fixation has been recognized the optimal n management practices for crop productivity and n requirements in cereal based intercropping systems still need more study therefore we hypothesized that intercropping combined with an n input rate lower than the maximum in this study would maintain yield stability and resource use efficiency in proso millet fields the main objectives of this research were to i explore the influences of intercropping with different n inputs on the crop growth of proso millet over time ii analyze the effects of canopy structure and nutrient content changes due to intercropping and n management on the leaf photosynthetic characteristics and iii compare the resource radiation n water and land capture and use efficiency and proso millet grain yield under the different n treatments in order to provide scientific guidance for recommending this practice 2 materials

grains were separately threshed and weighed as their corresponding yields at a 12 14 moisture content five plants were randomly selected from each plot for a total of 20 plants to determine the grain yield per plant and the 1000 grain weight the harvest index hi was calculated by dividing the grain yield and the aboveground dry matter accumulation by the unit area 2 3 8 land equivalent ratio ler the land equivalent ratio ler is defined as the yield advantage from intercropping and was calculated as follows willey 1979 11 l e r y i p y s p y i m y s m where yip and ysp represent the intercropped and sole grain yield of proso millet and yim and ysm represent the intercropped and sole grain yield of mung bean respectively if the ler is greater than 1 the results of intercropping are superior to those of sole cropping 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed using statistical analysis software spss software 19 0 spss inst ltd usa and figures were drawn with origin 2018 analysis of variance anova was conducted with the standard split plot design analysis method to determine the significance of year and treatment effects and their interactions the mean values were compared with a least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 3 results 3 1 plant height and dry matter accumulation the plant height of proso millet showed a similar change trend over the two years and plant height increased as plant growth progressed fig 2 across n fertilizer treatments and years the average plant height in sp was less than that in pm and a significant difference was found between cropping systems p 0 01 table s1 similarly n fertilization significantly promoted plant growth p 0 05 across cropping systems and years compared to that under n0 the average plant height was 3 0 6 2 and 6 5 higher under the n60 n120 and n180 treatments respectively the dry matter accumulation of individual proso millet plants in the vegetative growth stages seeding jointing and heading varied greatly from that in the reproductive growth stages flowering filling and maturity fig 2 intercropping and n fertilization significantly improved the dry matter accumulation of individual proso millet plants and the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 table s1 on average across the n fertilizer treatments and years intercropped proso millet had 9 8 higher dry matter accumulation than monocultured proso millet in the same conditions similarly in the two cropping systems compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization consistently led to greater dry matter accumulation in proso millet resulting in increases of 14 9 32 4 in 2018 and 13 0 27 2 in 2019 3 2 chlorophyll content spad value and leaf area index lai the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction on the spad value was significant p 0 01 fig 3 and table s1 the average n fertilized spad value in the intercropping system was 1 5 and 5 9 higher than that in the monocropping system in 2018 and 2019 respectively n fertilization also increased the spad value averaged across the years the spad value was 3 0 9 1 and 10 4 higher at n60 n120 and n180 respectively than at n0 for the intercropped proso millet and 4 8 7 7 and 11 4 higher respectively than at n0 for the monocultured proso millet there were significant differences in the lai of proso millet between the intercropping and sole crop systems fig 3 and table s1 the effect of the year n treatment interaction on lai was significant p 0 05 and the average n fertilized lai in the intercropping system was 7 0 and 5 1 higher than that under the monocropping system in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly in both cropping systems compared with that under the n0 treatment n fertilization achieved consistently higher lai resulting in increases of 8 9 27 2 in 2018 and 9 7 21 7 in 2019 3 3 photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence the photosynthetic capacity of proso millet was greatly enhanced by the cropping systems and n fertilization at various growth stages fig 4 compared with that under sp pm significantly increased the leaf net photosynthetic rate a by an average of 5 2 and 9 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively similarly n fertilization also produced a higher a value than the n0 treatment in both cropping systems and the percent increases were 11 4 for n60 21 3 for n120 and 23 0 for n180 in 2018 and 11 3 for n60 20 6 for n120 and 19 5 for n180 in 2019 however there was no significant effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction on the a value of proso millet table s2 similar improvements and impacts were observed in the transpiration rate e and stomatal conductance gs of proso millet the intercropping pattern and n fertilization increased the e and gs values over the two growing seasons on average which were 7 1 and 17 6 higher than those of the monocropping system and the n0 treatment respectively in contrast although the intercellular co2 concentration ci was improved by the cropping system and n fertilization the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 the chlorophyll fluorescence of proso millet had a similar change trend over the two years fig 5 overall neither intercropping nor n fertilization had a significant effect on the maximal quantum yield of psii photochemistry fv fm or the nonphotochemical quenching coefficient npq table s3 however fv fm was greatly improved by n fertilization at the filling stage especially in the n60 treatment which reached the maximum observed fv fm values in the two study years in contrast intercropping and n fertilization had a significant effect on the photochemical quenching coefficient qp at the early and later stages and the effect of the year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 01 table s3 3 4 intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar and radiation use efficiency rue the ipar of the proso millet was significantly increased by the intercropping system and n fertilization fig 6 the average ipar under the pm treatment increased by 4 7 in 2018 and 2 2 in 2019 over that in the sp treatment and the effect was significant in 2018 similarly over the cropping systems and compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization achieved consistently higher ipar resulting in increases of 9 8 17 2 in 2018 and 4 3 11 9 in 2019 in addition the intercropping system and n fertilization increased the rue and the improvement was 5 1 in 2018 and 4 0 in 2019 in the pm treatment the effect of the n treatment on rue was greater than that of the intercropping pattern and the effect was significant over the two study years fig 6 compared with the n0 treatment the rue was 5 5 higher for n60 11 5 higher for n120 and 15 4 higher for n180 in 2018 and 15 4 higher for n60 13 1 higher for n120 and 17 1 higher for n180 in 2019 3 5 soil water content swc soil water storage sws evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue water use was greatly influenced by the planting pattern fig 7 and table 1 in the whole soil profile swc was generally ranked as follows pm 6 6 in 2018 and 8 2 in 2019 sp 6 3 in 2018 and 5 4 in 2019 for the planting patterns and n0 6 6 in 2018 and 7 2 in 2019 n120 6 6 in 2018 and 7 1 in 2019 n60 6 4 in 2018 and 6 8 in 2019 n180 6 1 in 2018 and 6 3 in 2019 for the n fertilizer treatments fig 7 the regulation of sws led to changes in water characteristics accordingly compared with the n0 treatment n fertilization significantly increased sws and decreased et under the traditional system whereas the opposite results were observed in the intercropping system except for n60 with the sp treatment and n180 with the pm treatment in 2019 table 1 nevertheless across all treatments the wue was significantly improved p 0 05 and was 12 2 and 24 7 higher in intercropping treatments in 2018 and 2019 and 24 2 and 22 7 higher in n fertilizer treatments in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared with the controls sp and n0 3 6 n uptake and n use efficiency n uptake and n use efficiency revealed substantial differences between the different planting patterns table 2 the n content in the grain and total plant of proso millet were significantly improved compared with those in the controls sp and n0 intercropping increased n uptake by an average of 15 4 and 7 8 in 2018 and 2019 and the increase was 47 4 and 42 9 under n fertilization in 2018 and 2019 respectively these results indicated enhanced n translocation and uptake from vegetative organs to grains however intercropping and n fertilization produced lower nue and nhi than those in the sp and n0 treatments additionally similar trends were observed in nupe and npe which had maximum values in the n60 treatment with pm over the two growing seasons 3 7 grain yield harvest index hi and land equivalent ratio ler as shown in table 3 the intercropping system and n fertilization significantly improved proso millet productivity compared with those in the controls sp and n0 the 1000 grain weight and grain yield per plant were increased under intercropping and n fertilization to some extent accordingly similar improvements were observed in grain yield which reached maximum values at n180 5631 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5646 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the sp treatment and at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the pm treatment the hi was significantly increased by intercropping and n fertilization and the effect of year cropping system n treatment interaction was significant p 0 05 furthermore based on the mung bean grain yield table s4 the ler was calculated as an indicator of land productivity the lers for the intercropping patterns were all greater than unity 1 and n fertilization significantly increased the lers which reached a maximum value at n120 2 07 in 2018 and 2 00 in 2019 in the pm treatment this indicated that intercropping and n fertilization contributed to land use efficiency improvement 4 discussion 4 1 crop growth photosynthesis is the basis of plant growth and development and is the main factor that determines the components of crop productivity fang et al 2018 intercropping used for crop cultivation has been found to change micro environmental factors especially light liu et al 2017a chi et al 2019 which strongly regulates the thermal conditions of agricultural soils in the current study the pm treatment produced greater improvements in spad than the sp treatment fig 3 the same trend occurred for photosynthesis fig 4 these results could be explained by the tall short canopy structure in the pm treatment which resulted in greater light capture and uptake this was also directly verified by the increased lai fig 6a which allowed the proso millet canopy to intercept more par stomatal conductance regulates the exchange of co2 and h2o between leaves and the environment and increased stomatal conductance is an adaptative mechanism by which plants enhance leaf photosynthesis mauney et al 1994 during the later stages of proso millet growth intercropping significantly induced leaf stomata opening which contributed to an increase in a and e the close relationship between a and stomatal conductance indicated that intercropping improved the photosynthetic apparatus and contributed to the increase in co2 assimilation duchene et al 2017 therefore the increased dry matter accumulation in proso millet under the pm treatment was attributed to the increased photosynthetic capacity as indicated by the enhanced spad a e gs and ci in addition based on the spatial compensation effect after mung bean early maturing was harvested the roots of proso millet late maturing could expand to the underground space previously occupied by mung bean leading to the absorption of more nutrients and water gong et al 2020a as a result the growth rate of proso millet accelerated and its dry matter accumulation increased in this study the average crop growth rate of the sole cropping system based on the aboveground dry matter accumulation of the late maturing proso millet from flowering to maturity was 45 0 accordingly the crop growth rate of the intercropping system was 50 9 across the two studied years fig 2b these results are consistent with findings from previous intercropping combinations yin et al 2017 tan et al 2020 suggesting that intercropped proso millet can compensate for its substandard growth during co growth with mung bean by rapidly improving its dry matter accumulation after the mung bean harvest the photosynthetic characteristics of leaves are closely related to n nutrition since proteins in the thylakoids and the calvin cycle represent most of the leaf n evans 1989 to a certain extent n fertilization allows a highly efficient transformation of co2 into carbohydrates leading to increased crop dry matter accumulation and grain yield rambo et al 2010 in the current study supplying n fertilizer optimized the canopy structure of proso millet leading to higher spad a e gs and ci figs 3 and 4 in both the sp and pm treatments compared with those with no fertilizer plants in the n treatment had a more obvious lai advantage fig 3b thereby reducing light leakage losses and increasing the plant assimilate supply capacity liu et al 2018 however the leaf photosynthetic capacity decreased with the increase in n fertilizer from 120 kg ha 1 to 180 kg ha 1 in the intercropping pattern whereas the maximum values were achieved at n180 in the sole cropping system the reason for this phenomenon might be that the effect of the n2 fixation of the intercropped mung bean on proso millet is stronger under a low soil n status than under a high soil n status and abundant n nutrition may restrain leaf development chlorophyll fluorescence is a good way to assess the absorption and utilization of light energy by leaves cordon et al 2016 chloroplasts serve as storage units for n and more than 70 of n in plants is stored in chloroplasts therefore since chlorophyll is synthesized from compounds containing n leaf photosynthetic characteristics are directly affected by exposure to different n levels wen et al 2019 accordingly in this study fv fm and qp were greatly improved by n fertilization at the filling stage especially with the n60 treatment in the intercropping system which attained the maximum fv fm and qp values in both study years fig 5 these findings are consistent with a previous study showing that n supply improved leaf photosynthetic activity in maize and delayed plant senescence kitonyo et al 2018 however under the traditional planting pattern the increase in qp was maximized by the high fertilizer treatment n180 indicating that low n fertilizer combined with legume intercropping was conducive to increasing the electron transfer quantum efficiency of psii and the use of excess light energy which might reduce the dissipation of excess energy as heat 4 2 intercropping advantages and resource radiation water n and land use efficiency many studies have reported that intercropping with legumes has a significant impact on increasing the grain yield of the intercropped cereal such as in a maize cowpea intercropping combination maize grain yield was increased by 25 latati et al 2014 and a wheat soybean intercropping combination wheat grain yield was increased by 29 li et al 2001 similar results were found in our experiment the grain yield of proso millet was improved by 10 3 in 2018 and 17 5 in 2019 in the intercropping system with mung bean compared to that of the sole proso millet treatments table 3 this may be attributable to the interspecific facilitation and competition that occurs when proso millet is the dominant species gong et al 2020a n is an important element in the competitive or supplementary use of crops tan et al 2020 cereals in intercropping systems primarily obtain soil inorganic n via competition with the other intercropping species crozat et al 1994 in comparison legumes mainly depend on symbiotic n2 fixation by their root nodules for n and abundant fertilization may inhibit n2 fixation weakening crop productivity li et al 2009 in this study n fertilization significantly increased the grain yield of proso millet which was 16 6 35 3 and 11 7 26 1 higher than that in the n0 treatment in 2018 and 2019 respectively however the maximum values were attained at n180 5631 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 5646 9 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the sp treatment and at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 for the pm treatment this indicates that n plays greater role in improving crop productivity than intercropping and suitable n management is one of main practices in achieving the advantages of intercropping in terms of grain yield mung bean facilitated n nutrition of proso millet in intercropping and achieved high proso millet grain yield and enhanced land productivity by reducing the input requirement for chemical n fertilizer based on the significant effect of the cropping system n treatment interaction table 3 decreases in hi and ler with n rates based on grain yield were found in present study which further indicated that the yield advantage of intercropping can be modulated by n supply in a legume based intercropping system such as proso millet mung bean intercropping this is important for farmers to develop legume based intercropping with low inputs and high outputs our findings elucidate there is large space to reduce n fertilizer for current proso millet and mung bean production in the northwest of china furthermore over application restrained n2 fixation leading to low n efficiency and substantial negative environmental impacts chen et al 2014b hu et al 2016 intercropping systems are more productive than a single crop often due to increased light capture or more efficient use of light awal et al 2006 the yield advantage of intercropped proso millet in this study was mainly attributed to a combination of these two since significantly increases in ipar and rue were found for intercropped species fig 6 which was due to the same density as sole proso millet cropping and the border row effect for both rows of intercropped proso millet plants our results showed that dry matter accumulation in intercropping was higher than those in monoculture indicating that intercropping promoted the vegetative growth of the taller proso millet plants additionally the interception and utilization of canopy light were increased with n fertilizer n180 reached the maximum ipar 1688 4 mj m 2 and rue 3 19 g mj 1 for sole system across average two years in contrast the maximum ipar 1732 8 mj m 2 and rue 3 16 g mj 1 for the intercropping system were reached at n120 fig 6 these differences might have arisen because an abundant n supply in a legume based intercropping system has a negative effect on radiation capture by regulating the physiology and structure of cereal leaves wang et al 2015b during the co growth period of intercropped species the roots of the early maturity crop early sown crop can spread into the territory of the late maturity crop late sown crop and compete for soil water with the late maturity crop in contrast the roots of late maturity crops may extend into the root zones of early maturity crops to absorb the remaining soil water after the early maturity crops are harvested which is conducive to increasing the compensatory effect of water on the late maturity crops gao et al 2010 chen et al 2014a yin et al 2018 in our study through the soil column swc was generally ranked as pm 6 6 in 2018 and 8 2 in 2019 sp 6 3 in 2018 and 5 4 in 2019 in the two planting patterns table 1 the sws in the upper soil was significantly higher than that in the lower soil which may be driven by the root water potential lafolie et al 1999 in this case the intercropping system increased the ability of plants to utilize soil water via exchanges between the different soil layers as shown by the higher sws and wue and lower et of late maturity proso millet in fact strong plant transpiration in crop photosynthetic systems is the physiological basis for efficient water use especially in semiarid regions ashraf and harris 2013 therefore although n fertilizer did not similarly increase or decrease sws or et the n supply was beneficial for improving the wue of proso millet the greatest effect was found in the n120 and n180 treatments in the intercropping system in 2018 and 2019 table 1 as indicated by the higher grain yield than that in the control therefore when n fertilization was combined with intercropping the capacity for soil water conservation in this arid environment was greatly improved n fertilization is a double edged sword it can increase agricultural production but the excessive use of n fertilizer reduces nue and has harmful environmental impacts consequently management strategies aimed at maintaining farmland productivity and minimizing environmental costs are urgently needed zhu and chen 2002 du et al 2020 in the present study proso millet and mung bean were relay planted in a strip intercropping system with different n management regimes the n content and uptake of sole proso millet were highest at n180 while those of intercropped proso millet were highest at n120 table 2 this difference was probably caused by n loss and n mineralization under intercropping and the corresponding monocultures chen et al 2019 in addition compared to those under n0 n fertilization significantly decreased the nue and nhi under the sole cropping system but no change trend was observed under the intercropping system averaged across the years this indicates that while the n demand of proso millet growth could be met by biological n2 fixation under the cereal legume intercropping system when mineral n was insufficient if more n were supplied the nutrition would be not absorbed by plants and would be harmful to the environment however this study mainly discussed the effects of n fertilization on n absorption and utilization in proso millet in proso millet mung bean intercropping the performance characteristics of mung bean need further study figs 7 and 8 5 conclusions proso millet mung bean intercropping increased the land use efficiency and grain yield of proso millet compared to those under monocropping on the loess plateau of china intercropping combined with n fertilization promoted proso millet growth as shown by the increased photosynthetic activity and dry matter accumulation accordingly this practice enhanced the capacity of proso millet plants to take up nutrients capture soil water and intercept par resulting in increased crop productivity however the intercropping advantage of proso millet under high fertilization was restrained as measured by its weaker growth state and lower resource use efficiency than at lower fertilization levels the highest grain yield of proso millet was observed at n120 6331 8 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 6531 3 kg ha 1 in 2019 in the intercropping system intercropping combined with a moderate n fertilizer application rate increased grain yield by promoting proso millet growth and resource use efficiency based on the improvement in crop productivity without additional n input

10377,reducing soil evaporation especially in temperate climate zones increases crop production plastic mulch films pmfs are very efficient in conserving soil water conservation however plastic pollution is raising environmental and human health concerns therefore a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm technology was tested for its ability to conserve soil water suppress weeds modify soil temperature and improve crop yields two year field experiments were performed in tomato and watermelon cropping systems where sbpm was compared to no mulch and pmf controls sbpm loadings were 3 0 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 with fumigation f and without fumigation nf in tomato and 1 5 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in watermelon in tomato the soil volumetric water content vwc in the topsoil was significantly higher for all treatments compared to the control in the following order 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in 2016 17 and 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf in 2018 with watermelon in 2017 vwc was lower in the topsoil of the sbpm treatments than with pmf but higher during the 2018 trial when no crop was grown the amount of conserved soil water appeared to be determined by the physical integrity unevenness holes tears of the sbpm and pmfs soil salinity increase decrease was associated with the volume of infiltrating water in the different treatments soil temperature increased significantly under the highest sbpm loading of 3 kg m 2 nf using a 55 cm width of polymer coverage the yield responses across treatments were not significant field experiments proved the effectiveness of the sbpm technology but also highlighted some limitations of it when compared with conventional pmfs the sbpm technology needs ongoing refinement to improve its sprayability durability biodegradability and cost effectiveness keywords water use efficiency soil evaporation soil water content soil temperature biodegradation 1 introduction with a rapidly growing global population improvements in cropping systems management to overcome challenges related to future food security are required fao 2017 efficient use of water and agricultural inputs e g nutrients pesticides must support agronomic practices to increase crop yields since the late 1950s one of the most effective technologies used in agricultural production for improving water use efficiency is to combine efficient irrigation strategies e g surface subsurface drip irrigation with plastic mulch films pmfs pmfs are now a common cropping practice due to a variety of benefits to the crop mostly regarding increased biomass production pmfs can be used to i modify soil temperature which promotes earlier sowing faster growth and earlier harvests ii suppress weeds farmers use fewer pesticides iii reduce nutrient losses by leaching iv prevent fruit contact with soil and v reduce soil water loss by minimizing soil evaporation fritz 2012 filipović et al 2016 kader et al 2017 pmfs while providing benefits to crop growth still have disadvantages due to disposal problems and environmental pollution as reported in sander 2019 the global agricultural mulch film market will reach 7 5 million tons by 2021 with china applying an estimated 1 4 million tons of applied plastic mulch per year gao et al 2019 recovery of pmfs from the soil surface is costly labor intensive time consuming and can affect successive crop yields and cause environmental pollution with microplastics due to the increasingly stringent regulations regarding the use of non degradable plastic in agriculture plastic mulches are likely to be phased out in the near future to minimize environmental plastic pollution various biodegradable and oxo degradable mulches and also spray on mulch films have been developed in the last decade kairajan and ngouajio 2012 vox et al 2013 adhikari et al 2016 sintim et al 2019 chen et al 2019 the number of publications regarding the development of preformed biodegradable mulch films is in an uprising trend e g sintim and flury 2017 gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 filipović et al 2020 sprayable mulch coatings are now also receiving increasing attention globally as a next generation alternative because of their environmental benefits and ease of application adhikari et al 2019 sartore et al 2013 2018 braunack et al 2020a 2020b many of the management practices e g costs labor disposal and environmental concerns e g persistent chemicals toxicity can be eliminated by using a sbpm technology ideally the formulation of sprayable biodegradable polymers used in agriculture will enable water to infiltrate into the soil while simultaneously forming a barrier to prevent soil water evaporation from the soil surface johnston et al 2017 for now the goal is to develop and use a polymer formulation that is biodegradable sprayable and nontoxic while providing the same beneficial effects of preformed pmfs a field trial conducted by al kalbani et al 2003 using polysiloxane polymer aqueous spray showed water savings of 25 50 and increased yields by 10 80 it also reduced wind dispersed weeds because of the polymer membrane adhikari et al 2016 reported a new water dispersible sprayable biodegradable polymer which forms a membrane on the soil surface to minimize soil evaporation these authors also demonstrated on small field plots that compared with bare soil 28 less irrigation water was able to sustain melon yields under controlled laboratory conditions the biodegradable spray on polymer also reduced soil evaporation by more than 60 compared with the bare soil control to increase the versatility of the polymer membrane the addition of black pigment was used to help suppress weeds sartore et al 2018 in their research used polymeric protein based biocomposites as water dispersions to generate in situ bio based mulch coatings by spraying as an alternative to low density polyethylene mulch films a greenhouse study was carried out using seedling test plots to investigate the performance of spray coatings and their effect on crop and soil properties the biodegradable coatings showed that the agronomic performances were comparable with the ones of a commercial low density polyethylene mulch film which produced a similar rate of plant growth and dry matter accumulation in a recently reported glasshouse study braunack et al 2020a 2020b the agronomic potential of the sbpm technology was identified the aims were to i evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing soil evaporation and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective sbpm bandwidth 100 vs 150 mm and sbpm application rate to conserve seedbed water the study demonstrated that the high application rate 1 kg m 2 is effective in reducing soil evaporation but it also reduced crop emergence if applied after sowing the sbpm suppressed weed growth similar to the conventional mulch film and was the most effective at 0 5 kg m 2 with a 150 mm application width there is still only a limited number of studies regarding the use of the sbpm technology in field trials with most research performed under controlled conditions in greenhouse glasshouse experiments the reason for this small scale testing is that the majority of published studies focussed on the properties of the polymer itself which is appropriate for an early stage product the current study aims to identify the potential of the sbpm technology to conserve soil water and increase soil temperature as well as to observe its effect on soil salinity and crop yield during a 2 year field trial with tomatoes and watermelons the sbpm applied at various rates was compared to controls of standard practice i e no mulch tomato and pmf watermelon bare soil the novel sprayable biodegradable polymer tested on a field scale is designed to improve the germination and establishment of crops in conditions where surface soil dries quickly by providing a protective barrier that reduces soil evaporation suppresses weeds and moderates soil surface temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbpm field experiment with tomatoes field experiments were conducted on two sites owned by csiro co operators located near echuca victoria australia 36 229533s 144 79575e during the 2016 17 experiment 1 e1 and 2017 18 experiment 2 e2 seasons the soil at both sites was classified as a chromosol isbell 2016 the field experiments at e1 had a random strip layout consisting of raised soil beds with a single row of processing tomatoes planted on top of the bed plots were 50 m long with a 5 m buffer between the plots there were three x 3 replicates for each treatment a similar layout was employed in e2 using three beds with two rows of tomatoes planted 30 cm apart centrally on the beds fig 1 a during 2016 17 treatments of a banded 20 cm surface application of the sbpm at loadings of 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 either fumigated f with metham from nufarm australia or non fumigated nf were compared with no mulch control the top of the beds was sprayed with the polymer adhikari et al 2015 on 19th december 2016 with two nozzles t jet oc 08 pressure 50 kpa on either side of the plant line giving a narrow bandwidth of 20 cm on the top of each bed the polymer loadings were 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 respectively during 2017 18 bed tops were sprayed with polymer

the membrane showed phase mixed morphology with a low temperature glass transition temperature 50 c and broad melting endotherms above 200 c associated with the ordering of hard segments the non pigmented membrane showed a contact angle of 101 66 with 8 water absorption in 17 h time at room temperature compared to pigmented membrane showing 25 water absorption the non pigmented membrane showed a tensile strength 14 29 mpa and young s modulus 2 52 mpa the polymer ester and amide linkages are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis enzymatic light and thermal degradation processes and acidity of soil adhikari et al 2015 processing tomato seeds solanum lycopersicum cv h2401 h1175 both from heinz seed company were planted on 9th december 2016 a single row and 10th november 2017 twin rows with a planter before planting 30 and 66 units of nitrogen n and phosphorus p respectively were applied to the beds during the season n p ca calcium and zn zinc were applied as a liquid fertilizer for season s totals of 313 95 44 and 1 2 units respectively on a seven day fertigation program the experiment was irrigated with a drip tape located centrally in each bed at a depth of 25 cm as per the farm schedule with 448 and 614 mm applied in 2016 and 2017 respectively treatments were unable to be irrigated independently as the standard on farm practice used this holistic irrigation system layout however each plot received the same amount of irrigation soil capacitance probes enviropro from mea australia were installed on the 15th and 16th december 2016 and on the 22nd november 2017 to monitor volumetric soil water content soil temperature and soil electrical conductivity at 10 cm intervals from the soil surface down to 80 cm depth e g 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm and 80 cm depth one probe was installed in each plot positioned 10 cm from the drip line and between two emitters the position was constrained by tomato plants so a probe may not have been placed exactly between emitters data were collected by field station and transmitted through a field hub to a web site for real time data acquisition every 30 min mea australia data reported is the average of three plots a weather station was also installed to monitor rainfall air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and direction with data recorded at 15 min intervals and transmitted to the web site at mea australia the processing tomatoes were machine harvested on 8th may 2017 and 13th march 2018 from e1 and e2 respectively from the single or double rows of tomato for the full 50 m plot length the sensor network was removed from the field before machine harvesting of tomatoes to prevent damage to sensors and connecting cables no irrigations took place between sensors removal and harvest 2 2 sbpm field experiment with watermelon a field experiment with watermelon was conducted in 2017 and a no crop field experiment in 2018 on a csiro co operators property located near finley new south wales australia 35 567131s 145 415676e both experiments were conducted on the same site using sbpm loadings of 1 5 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 the soil at the field site was classified as a red kandosol isbell 2016 the field experiment had a random strip layout consisting of raised soil beds with plots 25 m long for the sbpm treatments and the plastic mulch film control control pmf with a 5 m buffer between the plots and with three replicates for each treatment fig 1b the drip tape was located centrally in the beds 15 cm below the soil surface the surface of the beds was sprayed with sbpm adhikari et al 2015 on 10th january 2017 and 22nd february 2018 with six nozzles pressure 310 kpa configured in three pairs 0 6 m apart t jet brown 05 30 cm between pairs giving a bandwidth of 80 cm on the surface of each bed the polymer loadings were 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in 2017 and 1 5 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in 2018 a fine mesh filter 50 μm was initially used in the spray line but continued blockages necessitated replacement with a courser mesh filter 150 μm which was cleaned at the end of each 100 m run the standard practice of the black pfm was mechanically applied over the bed with the edges buried at the base of the bed covering completely raised soil in contrast the sprayable polymer was only applied to the top of the bed watermelon seedlings citrullus lanatus cv nightshade were planted on 10th january 2017 before planting rustica plus1 12 n 5 p 14 k 9 s 3 1 ca 1 2 mg 0 1 zn and 0 02 b was applied at 500 kg ha 1 supplemental n p and k were applied as a liquid fertilizer calcium nitrate nitro p1 and thio k1 for a season total of 400 150 and 50 l ha 1 on a seven day fertigation program during the crop growth no crop was planted during the 2018 season soil capacitance probes enviropro were installed 10 cm from one side of the drip tape and between emitters on 10th 12th january 2017 and 20th 21st february 2018 to monitor volumetric soil water content soil temperature and soil electrical conductivity in 10 cm increments from the 10 cm depth down to the 80 cm depth data were collected by field stations and transmitted through a field hub to a web site for a real time data acquisition every 30 min mea australia a weather station was also installed to monitor rainfall air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and direction with data recorded at 15 min intervals and transmitted to the web site mea australia failure of the field hub resulted in no data being collected until 17th january 2017 and another failure delayed data acquisition in 2018 till 2nd march 2018 when replacements were installed other data outages occurred due to the native animals chewing sensor wiring the sensor network was removed from the field before the hand harvesting of watermelon to prevent damage to connecting cables watermelons were hand harvested on 5th april 2017 with all watermelons collected no crop was planted in 2018 providing an opportunity to monitor soil water temperature and salinity under the black plastic and the sbpm treatments which excluded the effects of a watermelon crop allowing assessment of the sbpm effectiveness in conserving initial soil profile water over time 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis of experimental field data soil water content soil temperature soil electrical conductivity and crop yield was performed using the statistical analysis software sas sas institute 2001 analysis of variance was performed using one way anova the significance of differences between the means was determined using tukey s honestly significant difference test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climatic parameters measured at the experimental sites long term monthly average climate data for both sites are shown in table 1 they closely reflect the conditions experienced during the field experiments at echuca fig 2 a b for example the long term rainfall total for december to may is 136 mm while the actual amount during the experiment was 140 mm average daily climatic conditions at finley for the period from planting through to harvest of melons also reflect the long term data fig 2c d the long term average temperature for january is 21 c rainfall 33 mm relative humidity 46 and the prevailing wind being from a southerly direction at an average wind speed 3 1 m s 1 the measured parameters for january 2017 are all within the long term average for the area table 1 3 2 sbpm field experiments with tomatoes soil water soil temperature soil salinity and yield during both tomato growing seasons 2016 17 2017 18 the soil profile water increased with depth fig 3 a d with some variations between treatments observed soil profile water at 10 cm was significantly different across treatment plots compared to the control no mulch with the 1 kg m 2 fumigated treatment having the highest average water content 39 5 and the control showing the lowest average water content 28 5 in the 2016 17 growing season table 2 similar trends occurred in the 2017 18 season where the 3 kg m 2 non fumigated treatment was significantly wetter than the control 34 8 vs 28 5 in the 2016 17 season all treatments showed higher water contents compared to the control plot 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in the 2017 18 season only the plot with the highest application of sbpm 3 kg m 2 nf had a higher average water content at the 10 cm depth compared to the control plot 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf this was reflected in the soil water content at different depths in the soil profile 10 80 cm where at each depth in plots treated with 1 and 3 kg m 2 of polymer the soil was consistently wetter than at the corresponding depths in the other treatments and control plots soil temperatures were variable during the 2016 17 season the soil in all treated plots tended to be cooler than in the control plot except for the 0 5 kg fumigated treatment which was warmer than the control treatments at depths of 30 and 40 cm and again 70 and 80 cm as the season progressed fig 3b soil temperature changes corresponded to the changes in the soil water content as the soil water content increased soil temperature decreased fig 3a b however during the 2017 18 season soil in all treated plots was warmer than in the control plot fig 3e soil temperature also decreased with depth but not to the same extent as during the previous season fig 3e the only polymer treatment which showed a significant difference in soil temperature at the 10 cm depth compared to the control was the 3 kg m2 non fumigated treatment likely due to better membrane thickness and integrity surface layer without any major cracks soil profile salinity electrical conductivity varied between the treatments and also with the soil depth during both seasons fig 3c f salinity was significantly higher in the soil in all treated plots during the 2016 17 season table 2 while during 2017 18 only the 3 kg non fumigated treatment showed a significant increase in soil salinity compared to the control plot this effect is probably due to the absence of rainfall and the lack of water infiltration into the soil however average salinity levels in the soil profile ranged from 0 44 ds m 1 at 10 cm to 0 92 ds m 1 at 60 cm during 2016 17 and from 0 2 to 0 4 ds m 1 at 10 cm to from 0 9 to 1 2 ds m 1 at 80 cm during 2017 18 which could not influence tomato yield significantly nsw dpi 2016 during both seasons there was no significant effect of the polymer treatments on tomato yields possibly because of a very variable yield among the treatment repetitions ranging from 55 to 151 t ha 1 in 2016 17 and from 42 to 151 t ha 1 in 2017 18 during both experimental years the highest tomato yield was obtained from the plots that were treated with sbpm 129 t ha 1 in the 0 5 kg m 2 fumigated plot and 117 t ha 1 in the 3 kg m 2 fumigated plot indicating that the effect of the sbpm treatments on tomato yield should be further investigated to further illustrate the difference between the sbpm technology and no mulch control comparison between average values of the soil profile water mm calculated from vwc data soil temperature c and electrical conductivity ds m 1 is presented in fig 4 average air temperatures were 20 4 and 22 9 c in seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively which also influenced evapotranspiration during the 2016 17 season the soil in all treated plots 1 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf and 0 5 kg m 2 f was wetter than in the control plot resulting in lower soil temperatures in the majority of treated plots than that in the control plot fig 4a b in contrast salinity was higher in the sbpm treated plots than in the control plot as already stated this is possibly due to a lack of rainfall infiltration in plots with sbpm fig 4c in the 2017 18 season the results were not as straightforward although the 3 kg m 2 nf treatment showed the largest difference in the soil water content at the first two measurement depths with increased soil temperature through the entire soil profile fig 4d e furthermore soil salinity was variable in all experimental plots with no clear indication of a trend fig 4f 3 3 sbpm field experiments with watermelon and no crop soil water soil temperature electrical conductivity and yield in the second experiment at finley watermelons were grown during the first season in 2017 while no crop was grown during the 2018 season in contrast to the first set of experiments with tomatoes the control plot was covered with pmf to estimate if the sbpm technology could compete with conventional mulching practices treatments using lesser amounts of sbpm were chosen to ascertain whether their performance was competitive with relatively low cost pmfs the results presented in table 3 show that the pmf plot was significantly wetter and cooler at the 10 cm soil depth indicating that the pmf outperformed the sbpm at least in the case of growing watermelon during the 2016 17 season although the highest watermelon yield of 53 5 t ha 1 was recorded in the pmf plot there was no significant difference in watermelon yield between the pfm plot and the sbpm plots due to high variations among replicates of each treatment the soil in all treated plots was drier than in the control pmf plot measured in the top 20 cm of the soil profile after planting watermelon as the season progressed the soil in the plot with the 1 kg m 2 sbpm treatment became significantly wetter at soil depths of 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 cm and remained wetter than in the control pmf plot fig 5 a the volumetric soil water content at 10 cm showed a decreasing trend with the amount of polymer applied control pmf 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 this trend also occurred in the watermelon yield where the highest yield was recorded in the control pmf plot although it was not significant 53 5 t ha 1 in the pmf plot followed by 43 2 t ha 1 obtained in the 3 kg m 2 sbpm treatment plot during the 2018 season when no crop was grown a different trend in the soil water content 10 cm table 3 was recorded a significantly higher soil water content was found at all sbpm treated plots compared to the control pmf as follows 1 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 control pmf however the differences among the sbpm treatments were not significant an interesting observation was that without any crop grown sbpm retained a higher soil water content than the pmf as shown in fig 5d the soil profile water content increased with depth with all sbpm treatments wetter than the pmf control lsd p 0 05 except for the 0 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment which was drier than the pmf control but only at 80 cm fig 5d the soil profile under the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm loading contained significantly lsd p 0 05 more water than the other treatments down to the 60 cm depth while there was no significant difference between the 1 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 loadings below this depth fig 5d soil temperature was lower in all sbpm treatments compared to the pmf control at all depths during the 2017 season fig 5b table 3 a similar trend was observed in the 2018 season except at the 70 cm depth where soil temperature in all sbpm plots was warmer than in the pmf control plot fig 5e it is clear that the sbpm cannot compete with the conventional pmf in terms of increasing soil temperature however in the absence of crop this difference was insignificant fig 5b vs e with a few exceptions soil salinity electrical conductivity was lower in the sbpm treated plots than in the pmf control plot during the 2017 watermelon season fig 5c table 3 during the 2017 season soil salinity increased with depth throughout the soil profile in all sbpm treatment plots fig 5c profile electrical conductivity was variable during 2018 and also significantly increased with the treatment and depth lsd p 0 05 over the period of measurements fig 5f the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment plot had higher electrical conductivity than all other treatments throughout the season and at all depths except for 80 cm fig 5f the comparison between the average values of soil profile water mm calculated from vmc data soil temperature c and electrical conductivity ds m 1 measured in the control pmf plot and the sbpm treated plots is presented in fig 6 to illustrate the differences between the sbpm technology and a conventional pmf it further shows that the vwc in the topsoil under treatment was lower in 2017 under watermelon while it was higher in 2018 under the sbpm treatments fig 6a and d soil temperature was lower in both years under the sbpm treatments fig 6b e while electrical conductivity showed variable results mostly associated with the amount of infiltration fig 6c and f electrical conductivity was generally lower in the sbpm plots than in the control pmf plot during the year 2018 when no crop was grown larger variability in electrical conductivity was observed the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment consistently had higher electrical conductivity than the control plot while the 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 treatments had lower electrical conductivity in the surface soil than the control pmf plot but higher electrical conductivity deeper throughout the soil profile fig 6f the soil vwc showed significant treatment depth and time differences fig 6d lsd p 0 05 3 4 seasonal water dynamics under the sbpm the vwc recorded at the 10 cm depth during each growing season at the echuca and finley sites in relation to rainfall mm and irrigation is presented in fig 7 in experiments with tomatoes during the 2016 17 season the vwc at the control plot was lower than for all sbpm treatments while during the 2017 18 season only the highest level of the sbpm application 3 kg m 2 nf had a larger volumetric water content than the bare soil control for the second set of experiments with watermelon and the pmf used as a control it seems that the sbpm did not perform at the same level as the pmf however it can also be seen that the 1 kg m 2 sbpm plots had a higher vwc than the control pmf plot during the mid season in 2017 this was also the case in the 2018 season when no crop was grown when the vwc did not respond so rapidly to rainfall patterns and displayed a smoother line throughout the experiment 4 discussion as reported in kader et al 2017 in addition to reducing soil evaporation conserving soil moisture and effecting soil temperature and soil structure soil mulching also suppresses weed growth by limiting photosynthetically active radiation par all of which affect the soil microbiology and soil health the main challenge facing current plastic based soil mulching practices is to replace these materials that can avoid the potential to pollute the environment while being nontoxic and biodegradable sintim and flury 2017 filipović et al 2020 the sbpm used in our field experiments was developed as an environmentally sustainable product because it is biodegradable and breaks down into non harmful by products such as carbon dioxide water and soil microbial biomass adhikari et al 2015 biodegradability of the product can have a large impact on reducing the expenses needed for mulch disposal while the use of nontoxic compounds is eliminating the possibility of environmental pollution the largest positive effect on soil water content was observed for the sbpm treatments with higher loadings 1 and 3 kg m 2 that formed a thicker more uniform membrane that reduced soil water evaporation in a previous sbpm glasshouse study braunack et al 2020a the water conservation trend was similar with soil water content decreasing with decreasing loading 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 no mulch control in the field experiments presented here we observed a similar trend where the highest average soil water content was observed in treatments with high polymer loadings 1 kg m 2 f in the tomato experiment in 2016 17 39 5 3 kg m 2 nf in the tomato experiment in 2017 18 34 8 1 5 kg m 2 in the experiment with no crop and the pmf in 2018 23 5 the exception was the 2017 watermelon experiment where a 1 kg m 2 loading resulted in the highest soil water content 38 4 of all sbpm treatments but lower than in the pmf control 42 3 improvements in the soil water conservation aspect of the sbpm technology were demonstrated in the presented field trials one experiment no crop in 2018 showed greater water conservation in the soil profile than the conventional pmf the latter result is likely attributable to the presence cracks breakages in the pmf which can occur quite commonly that allow increased water evaporation in contrast the sbpm does not lay over the soil but adheres to the soil surface and biodegrades rather than breaking into small fragments like plastic mulch films do resulting in environmental pollution with microplastics kairajan and ngouajio 2012 similar results were presented by adhikari et al 2015 2016 who reported a reduction in soil water evaporation of up to 28 and 60 in field trials and under controlled laboratory conditions respectively the field scale results with the sbpm confirm that the sbpm should be further tested and fine tuned to replace pmfs which are currently causing significant pollution of soils and water systems gao et al 2019 braunack et al 2020b vaicekauskaite et al 2019 presented a biodegradable spray on mulch based on sodium alginate which was developed as an alternative to thin plastic films for potential use in horticulture similarly sartore et al 2018 tested polymeric protein based biodegradable spray coatings in greenhouse trials which showed agronomic performances comparable to the commercial low density polyethylene mulch film during the 2016 17 tomato season the average vwc in the soil profile increased with soil depth in all sbpm treated plots although the sbpm treatments maintained more water in the soil profile than the bare soil crop yield was not significantly affected table 2 contrary to previously observed yield increases with the application of preformed and biodegradable plastic mulch films bilck et al 2010 kairajan and ngouajio 2012 the higher polymer loadings appear to perform similarly to pmfs by maintaining more water in the soil profile compared to bare soil in both tomato seasons the soil profile water was variable with the 1 kg m 2 f and 3 kg m 2 nf treatments resulting in wetter soil profiles than the other polymer treatments and the no mulch control the fact that the average soil profile water content was higher under the polymer treatment was not expected because only a 20 cm wide strip was applied with no side application 2016 17 however this is consistent with studies using the pmf where the soil vwc was higher under the film compared to bare soil kairajan and ngouajio 2012 soil profile moisture decreased as the season progressed and the crop matured with the mid season peaks corresponding to the frequency of irrigation and rainfall events similarly chen et al 2019 compared the pmf with a biodegradable film in a 2 year field trial they showed that during early and middle crop growth periods the soil water content was similar in the biodegradable and pmf scenarios significant differences in the soil vwc were observed only after the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the sbpm was larger than about 40 which occurred late in the season this emphasizes the importance of sbpm biodegradation properties which should be adjusted to the cultivated crop in both tomato seasons yields were not the highest for plants grown on the sbpm treated plots with the highest average vwc 1 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 nf surprisingly they were highest for plants grown on other sbpm treated plots 0 5 kg m 2 nf and 3 kg m 2 f which is likely attributable to waterlogging deeper in the soil profile as reported in a previous study that evaluated drip irrigation scenarios with pmf straw mulch and bare soil tomato yield and water use efficiency were higher under mulched treatments when less water was applied e g biswas et al 2015 the effects of sbpm on soil temperature are not clearly apparent suggesting that the current sbpm polymer cannot compete with pmfs table 3 however the results showed that compared to the no mulch control plot the sbpm applied at higher rates i e 3 kg m 2 increased soil temperature similar results were presented by sun et al 2015 who studied whether the biodegradable film could accommodate changing soil conditions during different crop seasons sun et al 2018 used six different treatments which included four different ratios of starch polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat biodegradable mulching films in their experiment it was found that the soil temperature under the biodegradable films was 0 4 2 9 c 0 8 2 8 c 0 6 2 0 c and 0 1 1 3 c lower than under pmfs at soil depths of 5 10 15 and 20 cm respectively when applying the sbpm to surface soil the practice is to incorporate a carbon black pigment into it to absorb solar radiation creating a light barrier to inhibit prevent photosynthetic weed growth and convert it to heat to promote growth kinetics sartore et al 2018 braunack et al 2020a used the same pigmented sbpm formulation as in this study they observed that when they used a wider application band of the sbpm on the soil surface 150 mm wide strips soil water evaporation was reduced and the soil vwc and temperature increased compared to the control this agrees with our study in which higher soil temperatures were observed on plots with wider and higher sbpm applications e g 3 kg m 2 sbpm and 55 cm wide strips presumably because a thicker membrane covered a larger surface area uniform coverage of the sbpm on the soil s surface during application is critical to forming a uniform membrane to provide effective water barrier properties differential wicking adsorption to soil of the polymer into the soil can result in inconsistencies in membrane thickness leading to inferior water barrier performance adhikari et al 2019 proposed that increasing the viscosity of the sprayable polymer was a way to reduce wicking and control the amount of polymer delivered to form an effective water barrier membrane providing that the increased viscosity did not compromise polymer s sprayability and film formation ability the highest levels of salinity electrical conductivity were recorded in soil with the highest topsoil water content tomato 2016 17 1 kg m 2 f tomato 2017 18 3 kg m 2 nf watermelon 2017 2018 control pmf no crop 2018 1 5 kg m 2 generally increased soil vwc was a result of lower soil evaporation under the most effective mulch covers the amount of non irrigated water rainfall infiltrating the soil was reduced in turn inhibiting salt leaching into the deeper soil under the conditions of increased vwc salt transport effects from non irrigation water rainfall entering the system appeared to be lower under these conditions non irrigation water mostly ran off raised beds causing minimal salt leaching into deeper soils consequently transverse salt transport at the surface would be expected to predominate as vertical resistance to mass transport and diffusion is greater than transverse resistances effectively resulting in desalination of the surface profile similar findings were also obtained by qi et al 2018 who investigated the combined effects of tillage and mulching on soil water contents and salt transfers under drip irrigation qi et al 2018 tested the following mulch management practices ridge tillage with partial or full film mulching and flat tillage with partial or full film mulching in all of these treatments salts were pushed to the edge of the soil wetting front simulations also confirmed that increasing the amount of irrigation water induces soil desalination electrical conductivity in our study did not reach levels that would significantly compromise crop yield this is in contrast to previously reported results 1 5 2 4 and 3 8 ds m 1 for no yield loss 19 and 25 yield loss respectively nsw dpi 2016 also it was observed that salinity increased with soil depth with the highest values recorded deeper in the soil profile in experiments with crops which may indicate that roots were extracting applied fertilizer down to the 50 cm depth thus lowering the overall electrical conductivity values as reported in chen et al 2018 the spatial distribution of roots is affected by mulch and salinity electrical conductivity with irrigation management also having a measurable effect our results show that the electrical conductivity level in the topsoil was primarily affected by the amount of infiltration this finding is supported by abd el wahed et al 2017 who recorded the lowest soil salinity value at the plot receiving the highest amount of irrigation the sbpm technology tested here is the first of its kind tested at the field scale most other sprayable products have predominantly been tested using hand sprayers in greenhouses controlled environments where conditions are less variable e g vox et al 2013 sartore et al 2013 2018 braunack et al 2020a 2020b future perspective needs to be focused on fine tuning the polymer formulation to balance mechanical properties that maintain a firm elastic binding with soil and durability throughout the crop growing season the sbpm research should focus on increasing its performance while at the same time limiting the cost of production to a minimum the researchers will need to test various biodegradable polymer formulations in long term field trials under different climatic conditions to define to what extent the sbpm technology can compete with conventional plastic mulch films 5 conclusions the newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm technology was tested for its ability to conserve soil water suppress weeds modify soil temperature change salinity i e electrical conductivity and improve crop yields two year field scale experiments were performed in tomato and watermelon production systems where the sbpm was compared to no mulch and plastic mulch film pmf treatments systematically varied sbpm application loadings were investigated across two crops 3 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 with or without fumigation in experiments with tomato and 1 5 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in experiments with watermelon with no fumigation during two year field experiments in the tomato experiment the soil profile water content at the 10 cm depth was significantly different in all sbpm treated plots compared to the control plot no mulch with the trend being 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in 2016 17 and 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf in 2018 this was also reflected in the soil water content measured using sensors at other depths in the soil profile 10 80 cm where at each depth the soil under 1 and 3 kg m 2 of sbpm polymer was consistently wetter than the soil at the corresponding depth at the other sbpm treated plots and the control as expected field results were more variable compared to previous glasshouse experiments due to the seasonal climatic variations and less homogeneous soil conditions when compared with the pmf as the control used in the experiments with watermelon the topsoil water content was lower in all sbpm treated plots during the 2017 season however when no crop was present in the experimental plots 2018 the topsoil water content was higher in all sbpm treated plots which was explained by the consistency in the formation of a thick sbpm membrane at the soil surface in contrast to the breakages which regularly appear in plastic mulch films in examining influencing parameters soil temperature significantly increased only in treatments receiving the highest sbpm application rate 3 kg m 2 nf and a coverage width of 55 cm yield response was not significant although the highest recorded average yields were from plants grown on plots under the sbpm treatments increased soil water contents were a response to lower evaporation rates under the most efficient mulch cover which also reduced the amount of water rainfall passing through the soil thus decreasing soil desalinization earlier field experiments proved that the sbpm indeed resulted in better soil water conservation while indicating that there are still some performance restrictions when compared to conventional plastic mulch films sbpm technology should be further improved and tested while ensuring its sprayability biodegradability and non toxicity the research should focus on the uniformity of the sbpm management while keeping the application rate as low as possible to reduce costs to increase the sbpm performance to a level comparable with plastic mulch films as a prerequisite for the common use of the sbpm technology in various crop production systems declaration of competing interest the

10377,reducing soil evaporation especially in temperate climate zones increases crop production plastic mulch films pmfs are very efficient in conserving soil water conservation however plastic pollution is raising environmental and human health concerns therefore a newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm technology was tested for its ability to conserve soil water suppress weeds modify soil temperature and improve crop yields two year field experiments were performed in tomato and watermelon cropping systems where sbpm was compared to no mulch and pmf controls sbpm loadings were 3 0 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 with fumigation f and without fumigation nf in tomato and 1 5 1 0 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in watermelon in tomato the soil volumetric water content vwc in the topsoil was significantly higher for all treatments compared to the control in the following order 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in 2016 17 and 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf in 2018 with watermelon in 2017 vwc was lower in the topsoil of the sbpm treatments than with pmf but higher during the 2018 trial when no crop was grown the amount of conserved soil water appeared to be determined by the physical integrity unevenness holes tears of the sbpm and pmfs soil salinity increase decrease was associated with the volume of infiltrating water in the different treatments soil temperature increased significantly under the highest sbpm loading of 3 kg m 2 nf using a 55 cm width of polymer coverage the yield responses across treatments were not significant field experiments proved the effectiveness of the sbpm technology but also highlighted some limitations of it when compared with conventional pmfs the sbpm technology needs ongoing refinement to improve its sprayability durability biodegradability and cost effectiveness keywords water use efficiency soil evaporation soil water content soil temperature biodegradation 1 introduction with a rapidly growing global population improvements in cropping systems management to overcome challenges related to future food security are required fao 2017 efficient use of water and agricultural inputs e g nutrients pesticides must support agronomic practices to increase crop yields since the late 1950s one of the most effective technologies used in agricultural production for improving water use efficiency is to combine efficient irrigation strategies e g surface subsurface drip irrigation with plastic mulch films pmfs pmfs are now a common cropping practice due to a variety of benefits to the crop mostly regarding increased biomass production pmfs can be used to i modify soil temperature which promotes earlier sowing faster growth and earlier harvests ii suppress weeds farmers use fewer pesticides iii reduce nutrient losses by leaching iv prevent fruit contact with soil and v reduce soil water loss by minimizing soil evaporation fritz 2012 filipović et al 2016 kader et al 2017 pmfs while providing benefits to crop growth still have disadvantages due to disposal problems and environmental pollution as reported in sander 2019 the global agricultural mulch film market will reach 7 5 million tons by 2021 with china applying an estimated 1 4 million tons of applied plastic mulch per year gao et al 2019 recovery of pmfs from the soil surface is costly labor intensive time consuming and can affect successive crop yields and cause environmental pollution with microplastics due to the increasingly stringent regulations regarding the use of non degradable plastic in agriculture plastic mulches are likely to be phased out in the near future to minimize environmental plastic pollution various biodegradable and oxo degradable mulches and also spray on mulch films have been developed in the last decade kairajan and ngouajio 2012 vox et al 2013 adhikari et al 2016 sintim et al 2019 chen et al 2019 the number of publications regarding the development of preformed biodegradable mulch films is in an uprising trend e g sintim and flury 2017 gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 filipović et al 2020 sprayable mulch coatings are now also receiving increasing attention globally as a next generation alternative because of their environmental benefits and ease of application adhikari et al 2019 sartore et al 2013 2018 braunack et al 2020a 2020b many of the management practices e g costs labor disposal and environmental concerns e g persistent chemicals toxicity can be eliminated by using a sbpm technology ideally the formulation of sprayable biodegradable polymers used in agriculture will enable water to infiltrate into the soil while simultaneously forming a barrier to prevent soil water evaporation from the soil surface johnston et al 2017 for now the goal is to develop and use a polymer formulation that is biodegradable sprayable and nontoxic while providing the same beneficial effects of preformed pmfs a field trial conducted by al kalbani et al 2003 using polysiloxane polymer aqueous spray showed water savings of 25 50 and increased yields by 10 80 it also reduced wind dispersed weeds because of the polymer membrane adhikari et al 2016 reported a new water dispersible sprayable biodegradable polymer which forms a membrane on the soil surface to minimize soil evaporation these authors also demonstrated on small field plots that compared with bare soil 28 less irrigation water was able to sustain melon yields under controlled laboratory conditions the biodegradable spray on polymer also reduced soil evaporation by more than 60 compared with the bare soil control to increase the versatility of the polymer membrane the addition of black pigment was used to help suppress weeds sartore et al 2018 in their research used polymeric protein based biocomposites as water dispersions to generate in situ bio based mulch coatings by spraying as an alternative to low density polyethylene mulch films a greenhouse study was carried out using seedling test plots to investigate the performance of spray coatings and their effect on crop and soil properties the biodegradable coatings showed that the agronomic performances were comparable with the ones of a commercial low density polyethylene mulch film which produced a similar rate of plant growth and dry matter accumulation in a recently reported glasshouse study braunack et al 2020a 2020b the agronomic potential of the sbpm technology was identified the aims were to i evaluate the effectiveness of the sbpm in reducing soil evaporation and its effect on seedling emergence and ii to determine an effective sbpm bandwidth 100 vs 150 mm and sbpm application rate to conserve seedbed water the study demonstrated that the high application rate 1 kg m 2 is effective in reducing soil evaporation but it also reduced crop emergence if applied after sowing the sbpm suppressed weed growth similar to the conventional mulch film and was the most effective at 0 5 kg m 2 with a 150 mm application width there is still only a limited number of studies regarding the use of the sbpm technology in field trials with most research performed under controlled conditions in greenhouse glasshouse experiments the reason for this small scale testing is that the majority of published studies focussed on the properties of the polymer itself which is appropriate for an early stage product the current study aims to identify the potential of the sbpm technology to conserve soil water and increase soil temperature as well as to observe its effect on soil salinity and crop yield during a 2 year field trial with tomatoes and watermelons the sbpm applied at various rates was compared to controls of standard practice i e no mulch tomato and pmf watermelon bare soil the novel sprayable biodegradable polymer tested on a field scale is designed to improve the germination and establishment of crops in conditions where surface soil dries quickly by providing a protective barrier that reduces soil evaporation suppresses weeds and moderates soil surface temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 sbpm field experiment with tomatoes field experiments were conducted on two sites owned by csiro co operators located near echuca victoria australia 36 229533s 144 79575e during the 2016 17 experiment 1 e1 and 2017 18 experiment 2 e2 seasons the soil at both sites was classified as a chromosol isbell 2016 the field experiments at e1 had a random strip layout consisting of raised soil beds with a single row of processing tomatoes planted on top of the bed plots were 50 m long with a 5 m buffer between the plots there were three x 3 replicates for each treatment a similar layout was employed in e2 using three beds with two rows of tomatoes planted 30 cm apart centrally on the beds fig 1 a during 2016 17 treatments of a banded 20 cm surface application of the sbpm at loadings of 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 either fumigated f with metham from nufarm australia or non fumigated nf were compared with no mulch control the top of the beds was sprayed with the polymer adhikari et al 2015 on 19th december 2016 with two nozzles t jet oc 08 pressure 50 kpa on either side of the plant line giving a narrow bandwidth of 20 cm on the top of each bed the polymer loadings were 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 respectively during 2017 18 bed tops were sprayed with polymer

the membrane showed phase mixed morphology with a low temperature glass transition temperature 50 c and broad melting endotherms above 200 c associated with the ordering of hard segments the non pigmented membrane showed a contact angle of 101 66 with 8 water absorption in 17 h time at room temperature compared to pigmented membrane showing 25 water absorption the non pigmented membrane

acidity of soil adhikari et al 2015 processing tomato seeds solanum lycopersicum cv h2401 h1175 both from heinz seed company were planted on 9th december 2016 a single row and 10th november 2017 twin rows with a planter before planting 30 and 66 units of nitrogen n and phosphorus p respectively were applied to the beds during the season n p ca calcium and zn zinc were applied as a liquid fertilizer for season s totals of 313 95 44 and 1 2 units respectively on a seven day fertigation program the experiment was irrigated with a drip tape located centrally in each bed at a depth of 25 cm as per the farm schedule with 448 and 614 mm applied in 2016 and 2017 respectively treatments were unable to be irrigated independently as the standard on farm practice used this holistic irrigation system layout however each plot received the same amount of irrigation soil capacitance probes enviropro from mea australia were installed on the 15th and 16th december 2016 and on the 22nd november 2017 to monitor volumetric soil water content soil temperature and soil electrical conductivity at 10 cm intervals from the soil surface down to 80 cm depth e g 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 50 cm 60 cm 70 cm and 80 cm depth one probe was installed in each plot positioned 10 cm from the drip line and between two emitters the position was constrained by tomato plants so a probe may not have been placed exactly between emitters data were collected by field station and transmitted through a field hub to a web site for real time data acquisition every 30 min mea australia data reported is the average of three plots a weather station was also installed to monitor rainfall air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and direction with data recorded at 15 min intervals and transmitted to the web site at mea australia the processing tomatoes were machine harvested on 8th may 2017 and 13th march 2018 from e1 and e2 respectively from the single or double rows of tomato for the full 50 m plot length the sensor network was removed from the field before machine harvesting of tomatoes to prevent damage to sensors and connecting cables no irrigations took place between sensors removal and harvest 2 2 sbpm field experiment with watermelon a field experiment with watermelon was conducted in 2017 and a no crop field experiment in 2018 on a csiro co operators property located near finley new south wales australia 35 567131s 145 415676e both experiments were conducted on the same site using sbpm loadings of 1 5 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 the soil at the field site was classified as a red kandosol isbell 2016 the field experiment had a random strip layout consisting of raised soil beds with plots 25 m long for the sbpm treatments and the plastic mulch film control control pmf with a 5 m buffer between the plots and with three replicates for each treatment fig 1b the drip tape was located centrally in the beds 15 cm below the soil surface the surface of the beds was sprayed with sbpm adhikari et al 2015 on 10th january 2017 and 22nd february 2018 with six nozzles pressure 310 kpa configured in three pairs 0 6 m apart t jet brown 05 30 cm between pairs giving a bandwidth of 80 cm on the surface of each bed the polymer loadings were 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in 2017 and 1 5 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in 2018 a fine mesh filter 50 μm was initially used in the spray line but continued blockages necessitated replacement with a courser mesh filter 150 μm which was cleaned at the end of each 100 m run the standard practice of the black pfm was mechanically applied over the bed with the edges buried at the base of the bed covering completely raised soil in contrast the sprayable polymer was only applied to the top of the bed watermelon seedlings citrullus lanatus cv nightshade were planted on 10th january 2017 before planting rustica plus1 12 n 5 p 14 k 9 s 3 1 ca 1 2 mg 0 1 zn and 0 02 b was applied at 500 kg ha 1 supplemental n p and k were applied as a liquid fertilizer calcium nitrate nitro p1 and thio k1 for a season total of 400 150 and 50 l ha 1 on a seven day fertigation program during the crop growth no crop was planted during the 2018 season soil capacitance probes enviropro were installed 10 cm from one side of the drip tape and between emitters on 10th 12th january 2017 and 20th 21st february 2018 to monitor volumetric soil water content soil temperature and soil electrical conductivity in 10 cm increments from the 10 cm depth down to the 80 cm depth data were collected by field stations and transmitted through a field hub to a web site for a real time data acquisition every 30 min mea australia a weather station was also installed to monitor rainfall air temperature solar radiation and wind speed and direction with data recorded at 15 min intervals and transmitted to the web site mea australia failure of the field hub resulted in no data being collected until 17th january 2017 and another failure delayed data acquisition in 2018 till 2nd march 2018 when replacements were installed other data outages occurred due to the native animals chewing sensor wiring the sensor network was removed from the field before the hand harvesting of watermelon to prevent damage to connecting cables watermelons were hand harvested on 5th april 2017 with all watermelons collected no crop was planted in 2018 providing an opportunity to monitor soil water temperature and salinity under the black plastic and the sbpm treatments which excluded the effects of a watermelon crop allowing assessment of the sbpm effectiveness in conserving initial soil profile water over time 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis of experimental field data soil water content soil temperature soil electrical conductivity and crop yield was performed using the statistical analysis software sas sas institute 2001 analysis of variance was performed using one way anova the significance of differences between the means was determined using tukey s honestly significant difference test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 climatic parameters measured at the experimental sites long term monthly average climate data for both sites are shown in table 1 they closely reflect the conditions experienced during the field experiments at echuca fig 2 a b for example the long term rainfall total for december to may is 136 mm while the actual amount during the experiment was 140 mm average daily climatic conditions at finley for the period from planting through to harvest of melons also reflect the long term data fig 2c d the long term average temperature for january is 21 c rainfall 33 mm relative humidity 46 and the prevailing wind being from a southerly direction at an average wind speed 3 1 m s 1 the measured parameters for january 2017 are all within the long term average for the area table 1 3 2 sbpm field experiments with tomatoes soil water soil temperature soil salinity and yield during both tomato growing seasons 2016 17 2017 18 the soil profile water increased with depth fig 3 a d with some variations between treatments observed soil profile water at 10 cm was significantly different across treatment plots compared to the control no mulch with the 1 kg m 2 fumigated treatment having the highest average water content 39 5 and the control showing the lowest average water content 28 5 in the 2016 17 growing season table 2 similar trends occurred in the 2017 18 season where the 3 kg m 2 non fumigated treatment was significantly wetter than the control 34 8 vs 28 5 in the 2016 17 season all treatments showed higher water contents compared to the control plot 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in the 2017 18 season only the plot with the highest application of sbpm 3 kg m 2 nf had a higher average water content at the 10 cm depth compared to the control plot 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf this was reflected in the soil water content at different depths in the soil profile 10 80 cm where at each depth in plots treated with 1 and 3 kg m 2 of polymer the soil was consistently wetter than at the corresponding depths in the other treatments and control plots soil temperatures were variable during the 2016 17 season the soil in all treated plots tended to be cooler than in the control plot except for the 0 5 kg fumigated treatment which was warmer than the control treatments at depths of 30 and 40 cm and again 70 and 80 cm as the season progressed fig 3b soil temperature changes corresponded to the changes in the soil water content as the soil water content increased soil temperature decreased fig 3a b however during the 2017 18 season soil in all treated plots was warmer than in the control plot fig 3e soil temperature also decreased with depth but not to the same extent as during the previous season fig 3e the only polymer treatment which showed a significant difference in soil temperature at the 10 cm depth compared to the control was the 3 kg m2 non fumigated treatment likely due to better membrane thickness and integrity surface layer without any major cracks soil profile salinity electrical conductivity varied between the treatments and also with the soil depth during both seasons fig 3c f salinity was significantly higher in the soil in all treated plots during the 2016 17 season table 2 while during 2017 18 only the 3 kg non fumigated treatment showed a significant increase in soil salinity compared to the control plot this effect is probably due to the absence of rainfall and the lack of water infiltration into the soil however average salinity levels in the soil profile ranged from 0 44 ds m 1 at 10 cm to 0 92 ds m 1 at 60 cm during 2016 17 and from 0 2 to 0 4 ds m 1 at 10 cm to from 0 9 to 1 2 ds m 1 at 80 cm during 2017 18 which could not influence tomato yield significantly nsw dpi 2016 during both seasons there was no significant effect of the polymer treatments on tomato yields possibly because of a very variable yield among the treatment repetitions ranging from 55 to 151 t ha 1 in 2016 17 and from 42 to 151 t ha 1 in 2017 18 during both experimental years the highest tomato yield was obtained from the plots that were treated with sbpm 129 t ha 1 in the 0 5 kg m 2 fumigated plot and 117 t ha 1 in the 3 kg m 2 fumigated plot indicating that the effect of the sbpm treatments on tomato yield should be further investigated to further illustrate the difference between the sbpm technology and no mulch control comparison between average values of the soil profile water mm calculated from vwc data soil temperature c and electrical conductivity ds m 1 is presented in fig 4 average air temperatures were 20 4 and 22 9 c in seasons 2016 17 and 2017 18 respectively which also influenced evapotranspiration during the 2016 17 season the soil in all treated plots 1 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf and 0 5 kg m 2 f was wetter than in the control plot resulting in lower soil temperatures in the majority of treated plots than that in the control plot fig 4a b in contrast salinity was higher in the sbpm treated plots than in the control plot as already stated this is possibly due to a lack of rainfall infiltration in plots with sbpm fig 4c in the 2017 18 season the results were not as straightforward although the 3 kg m 2 nf treatment showed the largest difference in the soil water content at the first two measurement depths with increased soil temperature through the entire soil profile fig 4d e furthermore soil salinity was variable in all experimental plots with no clear indication of a trend fig 4f 3 3 sbpm field experiments with watermelon and no crop soil water soil temperature electrical conductivity and yield in the second experiment at finley watermelons were grown during the first season in 2017 while no crop was grown during the 2018 season in contrast to the first set of experiments with tomatoes the control plot was covered with pmf to estimate if the sbpm technology could compete with conventional mulching practices treatments using lesser amounts of sbpm were chosen to ascertain whether their performance was competitive with relatively low cost pmfs the results presented in table 3 show that the pmf plot was significantly wetter and cooler at the 10 cm soil depth indicating that the pmf outperformed the sbpm at least in the case of growing watermelon during the 2016 17 season although the highest watermelon yield of 53 5 t ha 1 was recorded in the pmf plot there was no significant difference in watermelon yield between the pfm plot and the sbpm plots due to high variations among replicates of each treatment the soil in all treated plots was drier than in the control pmf plot measured in the top 20 cm of the soil profile after planting watermelon as the season progressed the soil in the plot with the 1 kg m 2 sbpm treatment became significantly wetter at soil depths of 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 cm and remained wetter than in the control pmf plot fig 5 a the volumetric soil water content at 10 cm showed a decreasing trend with the amount of polymer applied control pmf 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 this trend also occurred in the watermelon yield where the highest yield was recorded in the control pmf plot although it was not significant 53 5 t ha 1 in the pmf plot followed by 43 2 t ha 1 obtained in the 3 kg m 2 sbpm treatment plot during the 2018 season when no crop was grown a different trend in the soil water content 10 cm table 3 was recorded a significantly higher soil water content was found at all sbpm treated plots compared to the control pmf as follows 1 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 control pmf however the differences among the sbpm treatments were not significant an interesting observation was that without any crop grown sbpm retained a higher soil water content than the pmf as shown in fig 5d the soil profile water content increased with depth with all sbpm treatments wetter than the pmf control lsd p 0 05 except for the 0 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment which was drier than the pmf control but only at 80 cm fig 5d the soil profile under the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm loading contained significantly lsd p 0 05 more water than the other treatments down to the 60 cm depth while there was no significant difference between the 1 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 loadings below this depth fig 5d soil temperature was lower in all sbpm treatments compared to the pmf control at all depths during the 2017 season fig 5b table 3 a similar trend was observed in the 2018 season except at the 70 cm depth where soil temperature in all sbpm plots was warmer than in the pmf control plot fig 5e it is clear that the sbpm cannot compete with the conventional pmf in terms of increasing soil temperature however in the absence of crop this difference was insignificant fig 5b vs e with a few exceptions soil salinity electrical conductivity was lower in the sbpm treated plots than in the pmf control plot during the 2017 watermelon season fig 5c table 3 during the 2017 season soil salinity increased with depth throughout the soil profile in all sbpm treatment plots fig 5c profile electrical conductivity was variable during 2018 and also significantly increased with the treatment and depth lsd p 0 05 over the period of measurements fig 5f the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment plot had higher electrical conductivity than all other treatments throughout the season and at all depths except for 80 cm fig 5f the comparison between the average values of soil profile water mm calculated from vmc data soil temperature c and electrical conductivity ds m 1 measured in the control pmf plot and the sbpm treated plots is presented in fig 6 to illustrate the differences between the sbpm technology and a conventional pmf it further shows that the vwc in the topsoil under treatment was lower in 2017 under watermelon while it was higher in 2018 under the sbpm treatments fig 6a and d soil temperature was lower in both years under the sbpm treatments fig 6b e while electrical conductivity showed variable results mostly associated with the amount of infiltration fig 6c and f electrical conductivity was generally lower in the sbpm plots than in the control pmf plot during the year 2018 when no crop was grown larger variability in electrical conductivity was observed the 1 5 kg m 2 sbpm treatment consistently had higher electrical conductivity than the control plot while the 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 treatments had lower electrical conductivity in the surface soil than the control pmf plot but higher electrical conductivity deeper throughout the soil profile fig 6f the soil vwc showed significant treatment depth and time differences fig 6d lsd p 0 05 3 4 seasonal water dynamics under the sbpm the vwc recorded at the 10 cm depth during each growing season at the echuca and finley sites in relation to rainfall mm and irrigation is presented in fig 7 in experiments with tomatoes during the 2016 17 season the vwc at the control plot was lower than for all sbpm treatments while during the 2017 18 season only the highest level of the sbpm application 3 kg m 2 nf had a larger volumetric water content than the bare soil control for the second set of experiments with watermelon and the pmf used as a control it seems that the sbpm did not perform at the same level as the pmf however it can also be seen that the 1 kg m 2 sbpm plots had a higher vwc than the control pmf plot during the mid season in 2017 this was also the case in the 2018 season when no crop was grown when the vwc did not respond so rapidly to rainfall patterns and displayed a smoother line throughout the experiment 4 discussion as reported in kader et al 2017 in addition to reducing soil evaporation conserving soil moisture and effecting soil temperature and soil structure soil mulching also suppresses weed growth by limiting photosynthetically active radiation par all of which affect the soil microbiology and soil health the main challenge facing current plastic based soil mulching practices is to replace these materials that can avoid the potential to pollute the environment while being nontoxic and biodegradable sintim and flury 2017 filipović et al 2020 the sbpm used in our field experiments was developed as an environmentally sustainable product because it is biodegradable and breaks down into non harmful by products such as carbon dioxide water and soil microbial biomass adhikari et al 2015 biodegradability of the product can have a large impact on reducing the expenses needed for mulch disposal while the use of nontoxic compounds is eliminating the possibility of environmental pollution the largest positive effect on soil water content was observed for the sbpm treatments with higher loadings 1 and 3 kg m 2 that formed a thicker more uniform membrane that reduced soil water evaporation in a previous sbpm glasshouse study braunack et al 2020a the water conservation trend was similar with soil water content decreasing with decreasing loading 1 kg m 2 0 5 kg m 2 0 25 kg m 2 no mulch control in the field experiments presented here we observed a similar trend where the highest average soil water content was observed in treatments with high polymer loadings 1 kg m 2 f in the tomato experiment in 2016 17 39 5 3 kg m 2 nf in the tomato experiment in 2017 18 34 8 1 5 kg m 2 in the experiment with no crop and the pmf in 2018 23 5 the exception was the 2017 watermelon experiment where a 1 kg m 2 loading resulted in the highest soil water content 38 4 of all sbpm treatments but lower than in the pmf control 42 3 improvements in the soil water conservation aspect of the sbpm technology were demonstrated in the presented field trials one experiment no crop in 2018 showed greater water conservation in the soil profile than the conventional pmf the latter result is likely attributable to the presence cracks breakages in the pmf which can occur quite commonly that allow increased water evaporation in contrast the sbpm does not lay over the soil but adheres to the soil surface and biodegrades rather than breaking into small fragments like plastic mulch films do resulting in environmental pollution with microplastics kairajan and ngouajio 2012 similar results were presented by adhikari et al 2015 2016 who reported a reduction in soil water evaporation of up to 28 and 60 in field trials and under controlled laboratory conditions respectively the field scale results with the sbpm confirm that the sbpm should be further tested and fine tuned to replace pmfs which are currently causing significant pollution of soils and water systems gao et al 2019 braunack et al 2020b vaicekauskaite et al 2019 presented a biodegradable spray on mulch based on sodium alginate which was developed as an alternative to thin plastic films for potential use in horticulture similarly sartore et al 2018 tested polymeric protein based biodegradable spray coatings in greenhouse trials which showed agronomic performances comparable to the commercial low density polyethylene mulch film during the 2016 17 tomato season the average vwc in the soil profile increased with soil depth in all sbpm treated plots although the sbpm treatments maintained more water in the soil profile than the bare soil crop yield was not significantly affected table 2 contrary to previously observed yield increases with the application of preformed and biodegradable plastic mulch films bilck et al 2010 kairajan and ngouajio 2012 the higher polymer loadings appear to perform similarly to pmfs by maintaining more water in the soil profile compared to bare soil in both tomato seasons the soil profile water was variable with the 1 kg m 2 f and 3 kg m 2 nf treatments resulting in wetter soil profiles than the other polymer treatments and the no mulch control the fact that the average soil profile water content was higher under the polymer treatment was not expected because only a 20 cm wide strip was applied with no side application 2016 17 however this is consistent with studies using the pmf where the soil vwc was higher under the film compared to bare soil kairajan and ngouajio 2012 soil profile moisture decreased as the season progressed and the crop matured with the mid season peaks corresponding to the frequency of irrigation and rainfall events similarly chen et al 2019 compared the pmf with a biodegradable film in a 2 year field trial they showed that during early and middle crop growth periods the soil water content was similar in the biodegradable and pmf scenarios significant differences in the soil vwc were observed only after the average fraction of the disintegrated area of the sbpm was larger than about 40 which occurred late in the season this emphasizes the importance of sbpm biodegradation properties which should be adjusted to the cultivated crop in both tomato seasons yields were not the highest for plants grown on the sbpm treated plots with the highest average vwc 1 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 nf surprisingly they were highest for plants grown on other sbpm treated plots 0 5 kg m 2 nf and 3 kg m 2 f which is likely attributable to waterlogging deeper in the soil profile as reported in a previous study that evaluated drip irrigation scenarios with pmf straw mulch and bare soil tomato yield and water use efficiency were higher under mulched treatments when less water was applied e g biswas et al 2015 the effects of sbpm on soil temperature are not clearly apparent suggesting that the current sbpm polymer cannot compete with pmfs table 3 however the results showed that compared to the no mulch control plot the sbpm applied at higher rates i e 3 kg m 2 increased soil temperature similar results were presented by sun et al 2015 who studied whether the biodegradable film could accommodate changing soil conditions during different crop seasons sun et al 2018 used six different treatments which included four different ratios of starch polybutyrate adipate terephthalate pbat biodegradable mulching films in their experiment it was found that the soil temperature under the biodegradable films was 0 4 2 9 c 0 8 2 8 c 0 6 2 0 c and 0 1 1 3 c lower than under pmfs at soil depths of 5 10 15 and 20 cm respectively when applying the sbpm to surface soil the practice is to incorporate a carbon black pigment into it to absorb solar radiation creating a light barrier to inhibit prevent photosynthetic weed growth and convert it to heat to promote growth kinetics sartore et al 2018 braunack et al 2020a used the same pigmented sbpm formulation as in this study they observed that when they used a wider application band of the sbpm on the soil surface 150 mm wide strips soil water evaporation was reduced and the soil vwc and temperature increased compared to the control this agrees with our study in which higher soil temperatures were observed on plots with wider and higher sbpm applications e g 3 kg m 2 sbpm and 55 cm wide strips presumably because a thicker membrane covered a larger surface area uniform coverage of the sbpm on the soil s surface during application is critical to forming a uniform membrane to provide effective water barrier properties differential wicking adsorption to soil of the polymer into the soil can result in inconsistencies in membrane thickness leading to inferior water barrier performance adhikari et al 2019 proposed that increasing the viscosity of the sprayable polymer was a way to reduce wicking and control the amount of polymer delivered to form an effective water barrier membrane providing that the increased viscosity did not compromise polymer s sprayability and film formation ability the highest levels of salinity electrical conductivity were recorded in soil with the highest topsoil water content tomato 2016 17 1 kg m 2 f tomato 2017 18 3 kg m 2 nf watermelon 2017 2018 control pmf no crop 2018 1 5 kg m 2 generally increased soil vwc was a result of lower soil evaporation under the most effective mulch covers the amount of non irrigated water rainfall infiltrating the soil was reduced in turn inhibiting salt leaching into the deeper soil under the conditions of increased vwc salt transport effects from non irrigation water rainfall entering the system appeared to be lower under these conditions non irrigation water mostly ran off raised beds causing minimal salt leaching into deeper soils consequently transverse salt transport at the surface would be expected to predominate as vertical resistance to mass transport and diffusion is greater than transverse resistances effectively resulting in desalination of the surface profile similar findings were also obtained by qi et al 2018 who investigated the combined effects of tillage and mulching on soil water contents and salt transfers under drip irrigation qi et al 2018 tested the following mulch management practices ridge tillage with partial or full film mulching and flat tillage with partial or full film mulching in all of these treatments salts were pushed to the edge of the soil wetting front simulations also confirmed that increasing the amount of irrigation water induces soil desalination electrical conductivity in our study did not reach levels that would significantly compromise crop yield this is in contrast to previously reported results 1 5 2 4 and 3 8 ds m 1 for no yield loss 19 and 25 yield loss respectively nsw dpi 2016 also it was observed that salinity increased with soil depth with the highest values recorded deeper in the soil profile in experiments with crops which may indicate that roots were extracting applied fertilizer down to the 50 cm depth thus lowering the overall electrical conductivity values as reported in chen et al 2018 the spatial distribution of roots is affected by mulch and salinity electrical conductivity with irrigation management also having a measurable effect our results show that the electrical conductivity level in the topsoil was primarily affected by the amount of infiltration this finding is supported by abd el wahed et al 2017 who recorded the lowest soil salinity value at the plot receiving the highest amount of irrigation the sbpm technology tested here is the first of its kind tested at the field scale most other sprayable products have predominantly been tested using hand sprayers in greenhouses controlled environments where conditions are less variable e g vox et al 2013 sartore et al 2013 2018 braunack et al 2020a 2020b future perspective needs to be focused on fine tuning the polymer formulation to balance mechanical properties that maintain a firm elastic binding with soil and durability throughout the crop growing season the sbpm research should focus on increasing its performance while at the same time limiting the cost of production to a minimum the researchers will need to test various biodegradable polymer formulations in long term field trials under different climatic conditions to define to what extent the sbpm technology can compete with conventional plastic mulch films 5 conclusions the newly developed sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane sbpm technology was tested for its ability to conserve soil water suppress weeds modify soil temperature change salinity i e electrical conductivity and improve crop yields two year field scale experiments were performed in tomato and watermelon production systems where the sbpm was compared to no mulch and plastic mulch film pmf treatments systematically varied sbpm application loadings were investigated across two crops 3 1 and 0 5 kg m 2 with or without fumigation in experiments with tomato and 1 5 1 0 5 and 0 25 kg m 2 in experiments with watermelon with no fumigation during two year field experiments in the tomato experiment the soil profile water content at the 10 cm depth was significantly different in all sbpm treated plots compared to the control plot no mulch with the trend being 1 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf 1 kg m 2 nf 0 5 kg m 2 f control in 2016 17 and 3 kg m 2 nf control 0 5 kg m 2 f 3 kg m 2 f 0 5 kg m 2 nf in 2018 this was also reflected in the soil water content measured using sensors at other depths in the soil profile 10 80 cm where at each depth the soil under 1 and 3 kg m 2 of sbpm polymer was consistently wetter than the soil at the corresponding depth at the other sbpm treated plots and the control as expected field results were more variable compared to previous glasshouse experiments due to the seasonal climatic variations and less homogeneous soil conditions when compared with the pmf as the control used in the experiments with watermelon the topsoil water content was lower in all sbpm treated plots during the 2017 season however when no crop was present in the experimental plots 2018 the topsoil water content was higher in all sbpm treated plots which was explained by the consistency in the formation of a thick sbpm membrane at the soil surface in contrast to the breakages which regularly appear in plastic mulch films in examining influencing parameters soil temperature significantly increased only in treatments receiving the highest sbpm application rate 3 kg m 2 nf and a coverage width of 55 cm yield response was not significant although the highest recorded average yields were from plants grown on plots under the sbpm treatments increased soil water contents were a response to lower evaporation rates under the most efficient mulch cover which also reduced the amount of water rainfall passing through the soil thus decreasing soil desalinization earlier field experiments proved that the sbpm indeed resulted in better soil water conservation while indicating that there are still some performance restrictions when compared to conventional plastic mulch films sbpm technology should be further improved and tested while ensuring its sprayability biodegradability and non toxicity the research should focus on the uniformity of the sbpm management while keeping the application rate as low as possible to reduce costs to increase the sbpm performance to a level comparable with plastic mulch films as a prerequisite for the common use of the sbpm technology in various crop production systems declaration of competing interest the

10378,in the assessment of irrigation schemes the accuracy of performance indicators related to the water balance could be improved by estimating crop evapotranspiration etc using remote sensing techniques the two main remote sensing approaches to estimating etc are the surface energy balance and the fao56 based approach that uses the ability of vegetation indices vi to trace the crop coefficient both approaches were evaluated comparatively at the río dulce irrigation scheme in argentina where the predominant crops are cotton alfalfa and maize using products from the landsat 7 and 8 sensors provided by the eeflux application the first analysis used field specific vi derived basal crop coefficients obtained for 1743 fields using series of 9 29 satellite images along the 2014 15 irrigation campaign the second analysis used 30 fields grown with cotton and maize where the actual irrigation schedules in the 2014 15 irrigation campaign were known a root zone soil water balance was computed in these fields using the fao56 dual approach with field specific vi derived basal crop coefficients the etc obtained from the water balance was compared with the etc estimated using a single crop coefficient approach that uses field specific vi and takes into account soil evaporation herein called synthetic approach and with the etc obtained with the metric surface energy balance model as facilitated by the eeflux application the third analysis was a simulation analysis of errors in the estimation of the etc due to the interpolation to daily values of single crop coefficients and basal crop coefficients determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day the vi derived basal crop coefficient curves obtained for the 1743 fields of the first analysis were below the locally adopted standard not field specific basal crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration in the 8005 ha covered by this analysis was about 20 higher when applying standard non field specific curves than when applying vi derived curves this difference pointed to the importance of using field specific estimations of etc in the analysis carried out on the 30 selected fields the etc estimated using the vi based approach agreed well with the etc obtained from the water balance except under water deficit conditions the crop coefficients obtained for these fields using the metric model correlated with those obtained by applying the vi based method although the former tended to be higher than the latter in the lower value range the analysis of interpolation errors showed that when satellite overpass frequency is greater than one week and water deficit is mild or inexistent the interpolation of crop coefficients for instance of those derived from an energy balance gives errors of etc estimations that are greater than those resulting from the vi based approach under water deficit conditions the vi based approach systematically overestimates

imperative in a world with an increasing population and food demand where water scarcity is constraining agricultural production more and more and emerging sectors compete for the available water resources several efforts have been made in the last decades to formulate a framework and guidelines for irrigation scheme performance assessment relevant examples of these efforts are the performance assessment program of the international water management institute molden et al 1998 the guidelines for benchmarking in the irrigation and drainage sector of the international programme for technology and research in irrigation and drainage malano and burton 2001 and the task force on benchmarking of irrigation and drainage projects of the international commission on irrigation and drainage malano et al 2004 a prominent set of performance indicators the outcome of these efforts refers to the water balance these indicators have been widely applied to the internal assessment e g morábito et al 1998 lozano and mateos 2008 and benchmarking e g rodríguez díaz et al 2008 borgia et al 2013 zema et al 2018 of irrigation schemes the accuracy of performance indicators related to the water balance could be improved by estimating evapotranspiration et using remote sensing techniques bos et al 2005 some of the latter s early applications in the evaluation of irrigation scheme performance were carried out in south america menenti et al 1989 roerink et al 1997 bastiaanssen et al 2001 with the advent of the google earth engine a computing platform based primarily on satellite imagery that allows users to run planetary scale geospatial analysis on google s infrastructure this type of application is increasingly within the reach of researchers developers and water managers two main approaches to estimating crop evapotranspiration etc assisted by remote sensing techniques have become common in agricultural water use studies gonzalez dugo et al 2009 taghvaeian and neale 2011 the first approach partitions the available energy by using the radiometric surface temperature derived from thermal band imagery to estimate the sensible heat flux and compute latent heat as a residual to the surface energy balance e g kustas and norman 1996 bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007a the second approach is based on the ability of multispectral vegetation indices vi derived from surface reflectance data to trace the crop s growth and estimate the crop coefficient bausch and neale 1989 pôças et al 2020 this approach is unable to detect the reduction in etc due to stomata closure but it generates spatially distributed crop coefficients that multiplied by a reference evapotranspiration estimated daily from local weather station data provide estimates of field specific potential stomatal conductance not limited by water deficit evapotranspiration gonzalez dugo et al 2009 various forms of the remote sensing surface energy balance approach have been applied to upscale the estimations of et to project scale for example droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 combined the hydrological model swap with et estimated with the sebal surface energy balance algorithm for land bastiaanssen et al 1998 model to evaluate the performance of an irrigation district in turkey similarly taghvaeian et al 2018 calculated a water balance with et also estimated with sebal to obtain irrigation performance indicators for an irrigation district in southern california allen et al 2007a mapped et across irrigation districts in idaho california and new mexico using metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration allen et al 2007b and santos et al 2008 used the same model for similar purposes in southern spain the reset remote sensing of evapotranspiration elhaddad and garcia 2011 model has been used to map et across an irrigation district in california elhaddad and garcia 2014 and to feed a water balance for obtaining irrigation performance assessment indicators in an irrigation district in spain chalghaf et al 2015 however the vi based crop coefficient approach has been used less on a large scale examples are in gonzalez dugo et al 2013 and segovia cardozo et al 2019 but more for irrigation advisory services d urso et al 2010 melton et al 2012 calera et al 2017 in both approaches remote measurements are taken at time intervals which depend on the sensor overpass frequency to estimate etc for dates between measurements daily interpolation is needed and the error due to this interpolation may depend on the remote sensing approach used to estimate etc satellite overpass frequency varies from satellite to satellite in addition a compromise between temporal and spatial resolution is needed to meet the goals of agricultural applications high spatial resolution 100 m is required in most cases for these applications the number of sensors on board of satellites that meet the condition of high spatial resolution is limited this limitation is even greater if the energy balance approach is to be used i e if measurements of radiometric surface temperature are needed a time resolution of less than one week is rare two to four weeks is common although the use of constellations of satellites may help in some situations to increase the time resolution these constraints condition the accuracy of the two main remote sensing approaches to estimating etc making the selection of the method a challenge the objective of this study was a comparative evaluation of the two remote sensing approaches for the estimation of etc in the performance assessment of irrigation schemes the two methods evaluated were the fao56 method allen et al 1998 with crop coefficients derived from a vegetation index following mateos et al 2013 and the metric model allen et al 2007a as executed by the earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application allen et al 2015 the evaluation used the río dulce irrigation scheme in the province of santiago del estero argentina as a study case first the study compared estimations of etc for individual crops and for the entire cultivated area of 8005 ha using standard not field specific crop coefficients with estimations using field specific vi based crop coefficients second in a set of 30 fields where the irrigation schedule was known the study compared the field specific vi based approach with metric finally the study included an evaluation of errors in the estimation of the crop s evapotranspiration due to the interpolation to daily values of single crop coefficients and basal crop coefficients determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day the evaluation of interpolation errors was related to the comparative evaluation of the two remote sensing approaches for etc estimation as both approaches were based on measurements made at discontinuous satellite overpass dates so interpolation at intermediate dates was necessary 2 material and methods 2 1 remote sensing based evapotranspiration models 2 1 1 the fao56 method to obtain kc and vi derived kc the method proposed by the fao to estimate etc consists of multiplying a reference evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 from meteorological variables measured at ground weather stations the crop coefficient kc is the quotient between the etc of the crop concerned and eto therefore 1 e t c k c e t o kc may be a single coefficient or be split into two components dual approach direct evaporation from the soil surface and plant transpiration allen et al 1998 2 k c k cb k s k e where kcb is the basal crop coefficient addressing plant transpiration under unstressed conditions ks quantifies the reduction in crop transpiration due to soil water deficit and ke is the soil evaporation coefficient the standard procedure allen et al 1998 for developing the kc and kcb curves requires three characteristic value those during the initial stage kc ini kcb ini the mid season stage kc mid kcb mid and at the end of the late season stage kc end kcb end the curves are constructed by connecting straight line segments through each of the four growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season horizontal lines are drawn through kc ini in the initial stage and through kc mid in the mid season stage straight lines are drawn from kc ini to kc mid in the course of the crop development stage and from kc mid to kc end in the course of the late season stage herein the kc and kcb curves developed like this will be called kc standard and kcb standard respectively since both kcb and multispectral vis obtained by remote sensing techniques represent crop development choudhury et al 1994 kcb can be derived from vi bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 the relation between some vis and the ground cover fraction fc is approximately linear in the range from bare soil to near full ground cover huete et al 1985 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 thus 3 f c vi v i min v i max v i min where vimin and vimax are the values of vi for fc 0 and fc 1 respectively on the other hand researches have obtained different linear relationships between vis and kcb pôças et al 2020 mateos et al 2013 validated the following normalized form of these linear relationships to obtain the generic expression 4 k cb vi min k cb max k cb max f c kcbmax vi v i min v i max v i min according to this equation the linear increase of kcb with vi is from the value of vi vimin corresponding to bare soil fc 0 to the value of vi vimax corresponding to pure vegetation fc 1 kcb max is the maximum value of kcb generally equal to kcb mid kcb mid corresponds to fc fc max pereira et al 2020a b if for some reason the crop in the region of interest is different from the standard crop then a local value of kcb max can be used in eq 10 in this case associated to its specific fc fc kcbmax since fc 1 is not always achieved allen and pereira 2009 eq 4 ensures that the computed kcb does not exceeds kcb max achieved at fc fc kcbmax and also ensures coherence with the fao 56 method to determine actual kcb although allen et al 1998 recommended a minimum value of kcb close to 0 15 for simplicity eq 4 assumes kcb 0 for fc 0 setting kcb to zero acknowledges the fact that evaporation of bare soil will reduce to zero or nearly zero over extended drying periods allen et al 2005 anyway choosing a minimum kcb closer to 0 15 would have required adapting eq 4 but the effect on the comparisons presented in this paper would have been negligible ks equals one for unstressed crops thus the potential crop coefficient of a specific crop may be obtained from eq 2 making ks 1 for water stressed crops ks may be computed as allen et al 1998 5a k s taw d r 1 p taw if dr 1 p taw 5b k s 1 if dr 1 p taw where dr is the root zone water depletion mm twa is the root zone total available water mm and p is the fraction of the taw below which transpiration is reduced the depth of the root zone zr m may be calculated as 6 z r z r min z r max z r min k cb k cb max where zr max m and zr min m are the maximum effective root depth and the effective root depth during the initial stage of crop growth therefore taw is 7 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp z

given irrigation strategy or measured depending on the application sections 2 4 and 2 5 the soil evaporation coefficient ke is calculated taking into consideration topsoil wetting events due to irrigation or rainfall and the availability of energy at the soil surface allen et al 1998 9 k e min k c max f ew k r k c max k cb where kr is an evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted from the topsoil kc max is the maximum value of kc following rain or irrigation with kcb kcb max and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed 1 fc and wetted following rain or irrigation kr 1 as the soil surface dries kr is reduced linearly with cumulative evaporation to become zero when no water is left for evaporation in the upper soil layer allen et al 1998 therefore the application of the dual crop coefficient requires computing a water balance at the upper soil layer and a soil root zone water balance if crop water stress is to be considered computing any of the two water balances implies knowing the dates and depths of irrigation and rainfall events on every field which is rarely viable when dealing with large irrigation areas in this case the single crop coefficient approach is more practical since it assumes typical not field specific wetting conditions however satellites provide vis across large irrigation areas at high spatial resolution thus one may want to profit from field specific vis to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of the estimation of etc the most straightforward alternative would be applying eq 1 with kc estimated using one relationships between vi and kc for instance this was the method chosen by segovia cardozo et al 2019 to estimate etc in spanish irrigation schemes based on the linear vi kc relationship proposed by calera et al 2005 another alternative would be eq 2 with kcb obtained from one of the published vi kcb linear relationships calera et al 2017 and running a water balance to obtain ke and ks this second option chosen for instance by pôças et al 2015 requires knowing or assuming the irrigation schedules of the fields in the area of study a third option somehow intermediate between the two previous ones uses field specific vis to obtain field specific kcb vi eq 4 and then uses approximate soil wetting information rainfall data measures at local weather stations and typical irrigation frequencies to approximate kc to field specific conditions one way to make such an approximation is in mateos et al 2013 where the approximate kc was called the synthetic crop coefficient kc synthetic so as not to be confused with the fao 56 single crop coefficient 10a k c synthetic k c bare soil 1 k c bare soil k cb vi if k cb vi 1 10b k c synthetic 1 k c max 1 k cb max 1 k cb vi 1 if k cb vi 1 where kc bare soil is ke computed with eq 9 applied to bare soil kcb 0 and averaged on the time interval corresponding to each satellite overpass for which vi and thus kcb vi was available if kcb vi 1 on a given date then kc synthetic will depend only on the kcb vi for that date and on the crop characteristic parameters kc max and kcb max otherwise kc synthetic will depend on kcb vi on the date of concern but also on kc bare soil kc synthetic will increase with respect to kcb vi as kc bare soil is lower the reader may find more details about the rationale behind eq 10 in mateos et al 2013 note that crop evapotranspiration estimated using kc synthetic etc synthetic is field specific but does not take into account eventual reduction of transpiration due to stomatal closure provoked by water deficit 2 1 2 earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application the earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application allen et al 2015 uses landsat imagery

spanish located in the province of santiago del estero argentina at latitude 27 47 s and longitude 64 16 w the area irrigated in srrd is around 80 000 ha extending over the river alluvial plain the climate is semiarid mesothermal with a mean annual rainfall of 600 mm concentrated in summer morello and adámoli 1974 maximum monthly rainfall occurs in january 111 mm and minimum in july 2 mm mean annual eto is 1300 mm with peak values in december 5 6 mm d 1 and minimum in june 1 6 mm d 1 mean annual maximum temperature is 27 5 c 33 6 c in january and 20 c in june and mean annual minimum temperature is 12 7 c 3 7 c in july and 19 6 c in january all climatic data are from the instituto nacional de tecnología agropecuaria inta weather station fig 1 soils of alluvial origin are deep of a silty loam texture and a low content in organic matter and nitrogen angueira and zamora 2007 galizzi et al 2015 the río dulce water is of good quality predominant crops are cotton and alfalfa followed by maize soybean wheat oat and vegetables onion melon and watermelon water is distributed through an open channel network according to a fixed rotation delivery schedule with turns every 25 30 days a turnout flow rate of 300 l s 1 and duration of delivery of 50 min ha 1 giving a gross irrigation depth of 90 mm per irrigation surface irrigation is the predominant on farm irrigation method with application efficiency and distribution uniformity of around 70 angella et al 2011 srrd is divided into five administrative areas this study covered two of these subsystems apaz iv canal san martín and el alto apaz iv includes 15 000 ha with irrigation rights out of a total area of 70 000 ha equipped for irrigation while el alto covers 4000 ha of which only 2100 ha have irrigation rights fig 1 the analysis was carried out in the 2014 15 irrigation season in that season the main crops in apaz iv were alfalfa 58 of the area with water rights cotton 27 and maize 4 while in el alto the main crops were cotton 67 and alfalfa 12 other crops soybean onion melon watermelon and oat were present in both subsystems but occupying relatively small areas 2 3 crop weather soils and satellite image data an updated geographical information system was provided by the irrigation service of srrd an entity that depends on the provincial government of santiago del estero the geographical information contained conventional maps like roads rivers canals land use and detailed data about the irrigable plots total area and area with permanent water right crop information for each field was provided by the respective managers of the apaz iv and el alto subsystems for the 2014 15 irrigation season meteorological data to compute daily eto with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and daily rainfall were obtained from the weather station of the national weather service smn for el alto and from the inta weather station for apaz iv fig 1 soil information was taken from the soil maps of the apaz iv area produced by angueira and zamora 2007 the soils in the study area of alluvial origin are relatively homogeneous two similar soil classes named el simbol and la maría according to the inta classification echevehere 1976 occupy most of the area 75 of the total area and about 90 of the cultivated area the main characteristics of the respective typical soil profiles are in table 1 the soils deeper than 1 5 m do not present restriction to crop root growth texture is silty loam soil water holding capacity in the typical soil profiles of the el simbol and la maría soil classes is 179 mm m 1 and 176 mm m 1 respectively soil water contents at field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp were derived from the soil water retention curves provided in angueira and zamora 2007 for the typical soil profiles using the method by rawles and brakensiek 1982 the result was essentially the same for both soil profiles thus given the relatively low resolution of the soil maps and the relative homogeneity of the soils the values of θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 were used for the whole apaz iv subsystem regarding el alto subsystem although it falls just outside the area covered by the available soil maps based on the experience of inta researchers we assumed that most cultivated soils in this subsystem belonged to either el simbol or la maría class therefore in the soil water balances applied to fields in the el alto subsystem we used the same θfc and θwp values obtained for the apaz iv subsystem a set of 16 ndvi images from landsat 7 path row 229 80 230 79 and 230 80 and 14 ndvi images from landsat 8 path row 229 80 and 230 79 was downloaded from eeflux table 2 the images selected were all cloud free path rows 230 79 and 230 80 covered the entire srrd 14 images in total while path row 229 80 16 images covered only part of srrd the images were re projected to the coordinate reference system posgar 98 argentina 4 european petroleum survey group epsg 22174 geographical analysis was performed with the qgis 3 10 qgis development team 2019 application a free and open source software that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data the images from the same date were merged and clipped to the area of interest with qgis then the zonal statistics tool of qgis was used to extract the mean ndvi value for each image and crop field date 2 4 analyses applied to cultivated fields in srrd the first analysis concerned all cultivated fields in el alto and apaz iv 161 and 1582 respectively etc standard etc obtained from the fao56 standard procedure using kc standard i e without using remote sensing data etc synthetic etc obtained using vi derived kc synthetic and etc viopt etc obtained using kcb vi and computing ks and ke running the water balance simulating optimal irrigation schedule that is triggering irrigation when the soil water content reaches the allowable depletion were calculated for these fields soil water contents at field capacity and wilting point were θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 the crop parameters taken to apply the fao56 method are in table 3 as well as the number of fields and area for each crop the growing calendars were set based on the information from farmers and subsystem managers kc values were taken from fao56 and adjusted for the frequency of wetting and climatic conditions following the recommendations of fao56 allen et al 1998 and based on the local knowledge of the first author values of fc max or fc kcbmax were not readily available in the literature thus we set the conservative values of 0 8 for all crops within the range compiled in the reviews by pereira et al 2020a b ndvimin was specifically obtained from the landsat images selecting fields with bare soil and ndvimax was set to 0 9 for all crops based on gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 and carpintero et al 2020 the second analysis used 30 fields 23 of cotton and 7 of maize for which the actual irrigation schedule and growing itinerary from planting to harvesting were available in these fields etc viact etc obtained using kcb vi and computing ks and ke running the water balance using actual irrigation depths was compared with etc synthetic and etc eeflux the selected fields were located in the apaz iv subsystem fig 1 with their size ranging between 8 and 60 ha their soils belonged to the la maría soil class thus the characteristic water contents used in the water balance were θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 cotton planting dates were between november 1 and december 10 2014 while all selected maize fields were planted on january 1 2015 the number of irrigations varied between 1 and 4 in the cotton fields and was 2 in the maize fields for these fields in addition to the images of ndvi two other eeflux products were downloaded eto and etc eeflux six landsat 7 path row 230 79 and 230 80 and five landsat 8 path row 230 79 table 2 a buffer along the crop field borders was eliminated to prevent external pixel contamination 2 5 simulation analysis of interpolation errors the third analysis was a simulation analysis to evaluate the errors in the estimation of etc due to the interpolation to daily values of 1 kcb used to obtain kc synthetic and 2 kc both determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day although the context of the interpolation analysis was the application of satellite imagery to estimate etc by the vi and energy balance based methods the analysis did not need to apply those methods or use satellite imagery it only needed assumptions about the frequency of satellite overpasses and supposedly known truth values of kcb and kc at the satellite overpass dates the first step for the interpolation analysis was depicting the curve representing the daily kcb of an ideal cotton crop grown in the environment of santiago del estero from november 1 to april 15 under non limiting conditions this particular kcb curve was taken as being the truth truth as opposed to interpolated for the interpolation analysis and named kcb truth second the values of kcb truth corresponding to dates at intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 days were selected this selection resulted in 9 series of values of truth coefficients supposedly corresponding to their respective satellite overpass frequencies the number of assumed satellite overpasses during the period of analysis october 1 to may 1 varied from 212 to 5 corresponding to assumed satellite revisit time of 1 day and 40 days respectively third the values of kcb truth in each series were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimations of kcb named kcb interpolated fourth kc synthetic was calculated from eq 10 replacing kcb vi by kcb interpolated the value of kc bare soil also necessary to apply eq 10 was ke eq 9 applied to bare soil considering rainfall events and averaged on the time interval centred on each of the assumed satellite overpasses in order to account for the effect of weather variability the simulation period was 30 years july 1 1988 to june 30 2018 using weather data from the inta weather station fig 1 other parameters needed in eqs 9 and 10 were taken from table 3 finally kc synthetic was multiplied by daily eto to obtain daily etc synthetic for the analysis of errors in the interpolation of kc the assumed truth daily kc curve of the ideal cotton crop was generated applying the dual crop coefficient approach eq 2 using kcb truth since the dual approach requires knowing the soil wetting dates rainfall was obtained from the inta weather station and the irrigation dates for the ideal cotton crop were simulated using the soil water balance the simulation period and weather data were the same as for the analysis of interpolation of kcb used to obtain kc synthetic i e july 1 1988 to june 30 2018 inta weather station therefore while the analysis used a unique kcb truth curve the kc truth curve varied from year to year moreover two surface irrigation strategies were simulated consisting of refilling the soil to field capacity when the crop depleted the readily available water estimated as 65 of the root zone soil water holding capacity or 80 of the root zone soil water holding capacity for the full and deficit irrigation strategies respectively then the values of kc truth corresponding to dates at intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 days were selected and the truth coefficients of each series were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimations of crop coefficient named kc interpolated finally kc interpolated was multiplied by daily eto to obtain daily etc interpolated the interpolation errors were evaluated by means of the root mean square error rmse of daily etc and the relative error re of seasonal etc the former was obtained from the square of the difference between the daily values of etc obtained using kc truth and obtained with the corresponding daily values of kc synthetic or kc interpolated re was computed as the relative difference between seasonal etc computed using kc truth and computed with kc synthetic or kc interpolated the connection of the interpolation analysis with the comparison of methods of estimating etc carried out in the study case is as follows the vi based approach used satellite data to obtain kcb on the days of satellite overpass if it was assumed that kcb can be derived from vis accurately then the kcb truth curve could be reproduced with complete accuracy using daily vis if the temporal frequency of kcb determination kcb vi was less than daily then daily kcb vi values would have to be obtained by interpolation thus making interpolation errors on the other hand the energy balance approach determined kc as the quotient between etc and eto determined on the days of satellite overpass kc eeflux in our study if it was assumed that this kc can be obtained with complete accuracy then the interpolated kc eeflux curve would reproduce kc truth if satellite overpass was daily otherwise daily kc eeflux values would have to be obtained by interpolation thus making interpolation errors that would depend on the satellite overpass frequency the hypothesis behind the interpolation analysis is as follows since the evolution of vis along the crop growing cycle follows a rather determined trend kcb can be interpolated confidently between dates of image acquisition however the vi based approach needs a complementary procedure to account for soil wetting events to obtain kc synthetic in the approach adopted in this study and is unable to detect crop water stress in contrast the energy balance approach gives the crop coefficient directly considering effects of water deficit as well but the interpolation to daily crop coefficients may be unreliable because both numerator and denominator in the quotient etc eto used to determine kc are highly affected by day to day weather variability therefore the objective of the interpolation analysis was to assess the errors of each method as a function of the temporal frequency of the satellite images this analysis was intended to specifically address the errors due to interpolation therefore it did not take into account the inaccuracy of the methods used to determining kcb vi kc synthetic and kc eeflux 3 results 3 1 comparison of methods of estimating etc fig 2 a shows the fao56 standard kcb kcb standard curve for cotton consisting of 4 straight lines the curve was constructed before determining vi taking the three kcb characteristic values and the duration of the growth stages from table 3 during the crop development and mid season stages kcb vi was less than kcb standard in both the apaz iv and el alto subsystems this can be seen in the mean and standard deviation of the kcb vi corresponding to the cotton fields in both el alto and apaz iv at the dates of satellite overpass fig 2a similar observations are in fig 2c for the alfalfa fields kcb standard refers to a pristine crop thus the deviation of kcb vi from kcb standard reflects the cropping performance gap and points to the convenience of the field specific approach for scheme water consumption assessment actually average cotton yield in srrd is about 3 tn ha 1 while attainable yield yield of the best performing crops is 5 tn ha 1 angella et al 2016 during the late season stage the mean kcb vi of cotton was slightly greater than the kcb standard the declining slope of the late season kcb standard implies the recommended practice of forcing defoliation to accelerate boll opening the milder slope of kcb vi reflects the indeterminate nature of cotton that often regrows during and after the harvesting period while weeds may proliferate below the cotton canopy distorting the kcb vi estimate this discussion on kcb can be transferred in the same terms to kc with the addition that in kc soil wetting also intervenes during the cotton development mid season stages kc synthetic was less than kc standard in both the apaz iv and el alto subsystems fig 2b during the initial and early cotton development stages kc synthetic on the satellite overpass dates triangles and squares in fig 2b deviated from kc standard showing that the former takes into account the occurrence of rainfall and dry periods in the case of alfalfa fig 2d the locally assumed kc standard that is based on the cutting frequency in the different seasons was greater than kc synthetic especially in winter and autumn note that the field to field variability of kc synthetic could be evaluated not only on the dates of the satellite overpass indicated in fig 2bd by standard deviation bars on the days of the satellite overpass but also on the interpolated dates as shown in fig 2bd with the area shaded by daily standard deviation bars for the sake of brevity we restricted the description of standard vs vi based kcb and kc to cotton and alfalfa the two main crops in srrd however similar analyses would apply to other crops fig 2b reinforces the recommendation of using the vi based field specific approach in srrd as segovia cardozo et al 2019 also remarked for their study area and the adequacy of the synthetic crop coefficient approach to approximate the effect on kc of rainfall events when field irrigation data are not available alternatively one could use the dual crop coefficient with kcb vi and compute the soil evaporation coefficient allen et al 1998 for an arbitrary irrigation schedule the results of applying one or other method on a system scale are in table 4 seasonal etc in apaz iv was greater than in el alto mainly due to the cropping pattern alfalfa occupies 58 of the area in apaz iv and 12 in el alto subsystem etc was much greater about 20 when using kc standard the difference in system etc estimated with kc synthetic and applying the dual crop coefficient with an optimal irrigation schedule etc viopt was only 2 table 4 the same comparison is in fig 3 for the 30 selected fields with known irrigation schedules in the sample of cotton fields etc synthetic correlated very well with etc estimated from vi and the actual irrigation schedule etc viact fig 3 however in the maize fields etc synthetic was greater than etc viact note that the water balance computed to estimate etc viact takes into account etc reduction due to water deficit while the computation of etc synthetic ignores it fig 3 suggests that water deficit was more pronounced in the maize fields than in the cotton fields for economic reasons in srrd it is common practice to apply one irrigation only the pre irrigation to the maize crops and rely on rainfall for the rest of the growing season while cotton crops typically receive one or two irrigations in addition to the pre irrigation therefore considering the crop water deficit could be important when estimating et over systems such as srrd however the vi based approach is incapable of detecting the reduction in et due to stomatal closure unless it is coupled to a water balance fed with field specific irrigation data in theory the energy balance approach to estimating etc may overcome this limitation this was examined for the selected fields with known irrigation schedules fig 4 a represents kc on the days of satellite overpass provided by eeflux kc eeflux against kc viact overall kc eeflux was greater than kc viact particularly at low kc part of this deviation could be due to small differences between the typical values of θfc and θwp used in the water balance and the actual values of each selected field however this could not be assessed part of the scatter root mean square error rmse 0 23 could be due to differences in the reference evapotranspiration used by eeflux and that obtained from the weather stations recall that eeflux uses gridded weather data stored in earth engine and the asce standardized penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 while the eto from the weather stations is computed using measured data and fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 nevertheless the correlation between reference evapotranspiration derived from the two sources was unbiased and relatively good with rmse 0 9 mm fig 5 however the field irrigation schedules across the srrd system are unknown therefore field daily etc is estimated more adequately using kc synthetic which is represented vs kc eeflux in fig 4b for the selected fields this figure highlights deviations as a consequence of applying the kc synthetic method the symbols circled with a continuous line correspond to satellite overpass dates soon after pre irrigation and before crop emergence kc eeflux detected the wet soil that resulted in high evapotranspiration the upper and lower circle mark data points corresponding to 1 and 4 days after pre irrigation respectively while the middle circle indicates data points corresponding to 3 days after pre irrigation conversely the smoothing feature of kc synthetic resulted in kc synthetic less than that actually expected for that soil surface wetness the opposite circumstance occurred for the five data points circled with a discontinuous line on that satellite overpass date the plants were small or had not emerged the previous soil wetting event had occurred 6 days before thus the soil surface was already dry and a posterior rainfall event occurred 2 days later in this case the smoothing feature of kc synthetic resulted in higher values than those actually expected for the soil surface wetness on the day of the satellite overpass the difficulties of applying the energy balance for instance using metric have been overcome by platforms like eeflux however the number of satellites providing thermal data remains a limitation in our analysis of srrd over a 12 month period the number of useful landsat images varied across the scheme from 9 to 29 with frequency varying from biweekly to monthly 3 2 interpolation results the question is with this frequency of images which would be more appropriate to interpolate kc directly for instance output of the energy balance approach or interpolate kcb for instance output of the vi approach and use an algorithm to derive kc for instance the synthetic method fig 6 depicts daily kcb and kc for the ideal cotton crop that represents the truth in the interpolation analysis that follows kcb truth and kc truth respectively the irrigation strategy in fig 6 was full irrigation kcb interpolated and kc interpolated resulted from the linear interpolation of their respective truth values on the assumed days of satellite overpass marked by diamonds at the top of each fig 6 and kc synthetic resulted from applying the synthetic methodology using kcb interpolated as an input kcb interpolated and kc interpolated would coincide with the respective truth coefficients if the satellite overpass were to be daily fig 6a presents the five crop coefficient curves assuming an overpass interval of 15 days the main observations were that kcb interpolated represented kcb truth very well kc interpolated fluctuated greatly capturing some of the variations of kc truth but missing others and kc synthetic smoothed the fluctuations of kc truth similarly fig 6b presents the same five crop coefficient curves although assuming an overpass interval of 35 days kcb interpolated still represented kcb truth quite well kc interpolated deviated highly from kc truth during most days of the initial and crop development stages and kc synthetic smoothed the fluctuations of kc truth to a curve that was even flatter than that generated for the overpass interval of 15 days this was just an example resulting from the specific rainfall pattern and irrigation schedule of a specific year fig 7 shows the rmse of the estimation of daily etc with the water balance run for the 30 years of weather data under the full irrigation strategy using either kc interpolated or kc synthetic for short overpass intervals the rmse result of using kc synthetic was greater than that employing kc interpolated the curves crossed at an overpass interval of about 4 days reaching a practically constant difference of about 0 3 mm day 1 for overpass intervals longer than 10 days although the difference between both rmse was relatively small it was noticeable that the standard deviation of rmse was greater using kc interpolated than using kc synthetic re of seasonal etc synthetic was close to zero and showed little year to year variability when the water balance was run to prevent water deficit fig 8 a however under the deficit irrigation strategy seasonal etc synthetic was systematically greater bias of about 5 than the seasonal etc obtained from kc truth fig 8b contrarily the re of seasonal etc obtained from kc interpolated did not differ from zero and was similar under full irrigation and deficit irrigation however year to year variability was notably large this is important because one of the advantages of the energy balance approach is its capacity to detect etc reduction due to crop water stress fig 9 a compares seasonal etc eeflux with etc viact computed for the 2014 15 irrigation season on the 30 selected fields the satellite overpass interval for these computations varied from 24 to 66 days it can be observed that cotton seasonal etc eeflux was greater overall than the corresponding etc viact fig 9a the rmse of seasonal etc eeflux vs seasonal etc viact was 75 mm and 27 mm for cotton and maize respectively the three satellite images that were available during the initial and early cotton development stages coincided in that particular year with dates immediately after rainfall events so that kc interpolated during that period was greater than kc viact on most days an example of kc interpolated representative of this circumstance is in fig 10 a the opposite occurred for the maize fields in the 2014 cropping season satellite overpasses during the initial and early cotton development stages coincided with dates several days after rainfall events when the soil surface was already dry so that the kc interpolated during that period was lesser than kc viact on most days however this deviation is not visible in fig 9a because the underestimation consequence of the interpolation effect was compensated for by an overestimation of etc during the mid season and late season stages when the maize crops suffered water deficit but the last satellite overpasses occurred before the deficit period an example of kc interpolated representative of the two counteracting circumstances in the maize crops is in fig 10b similarly to fig 9a fig 9b compares seasonal etc eeflux with etc synthetic the smoothing effect of kc synthetic slightly reduced the discrepancy between the two approaches this was evident for the cotton crops although the maize data points that in fig 9a were close to the 1 1 line in fig 9b were below that line the rmse of seasonal etc eeflux vs seasonal etc synthetic was 74 mm and 83 mm for cotton and maize respectively this reflects the incapacity of the kc synthetic method to account for the reduction in etc as a consequence of the eventual crop water deficit 4 discussion the standard deviation bars in fig 2a and c depict an important field to field crop growth variation other authors have observed it as well as its implications for crop water use using a time series of spot and landsat ndvi images simonneaux et al 2008 and er raki et al 2010 classified winter wheat into classes that differed greatly within an irrigation scheme in central morocco seasonal evapotranspiration for those wheat classes varied between 200 and 450 mm a range of the same order as that obtained in our study using similar methodology for instance in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems etc synthetic varied between 437 and 902 mm and between 512 and 795 for cotton and maize fields respectively tasumi et al 2005 and tasumi and allen 2007 also reported growth variation in a variety of irrigated crops in idaho using landsat ndvi images these authors did not use ndvi derived kc but obtained kc directly by using an energy balance approach field to field etc variation was not discussed in these studies although the results showed that early planted crops consumed more water than late growing ones tasumi and allen 2007 but in a narrower range than that observed in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems these findings and similar ones by other authors e g santos et al 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 french et al 2018 segovia cardozo et al 2019 stress the importance of exploring factors that influence irrigation decisions gibson et al 2018 and of going deeper into methodologies to accurately determine spatially distributed water use in irrigation schemes a crucial issue when determining etc by using methods based on remote sensing is soil evaporation under partial ground cover tasumi et al 2005 observed that the variation in the kc curves was considerably greater than that for the ndvi which they attributed to the effect of wetting events on kc particularly during the initial and developmental growth stages methods based on vi are adequate for deriving kcb but not for the soil evaporation component of kc therefore some complementary algorithm is necessary to overcome this limitation one alternative is to run a water balance pôças et al 2015 as we did to compute etc viopt for the entire subsystems and etc viact for selected fields however this requires additional soil information and knowing the irrigation dates of each field which are rarely available on a scheme scale the synthetic crop coefficient mateos et al 2013 adopted in this study overcame this shortcoming by computing crop coefficients that took into account field specific kcb while adjusting kc to actual rain wetting events and typical irrigation frequency the kc synthetic curve depicted in fig 2b and d sounds like a realistic temporal evolution first better adjusted to local conditions than the kc standard curve and second capturing the field to field variation that the kc standard cannot do the similarity of seasonal etc viopt and etc synthetic in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems table 4 and the good correlation between seasonal etc viact and etc synthetic for cotton crops fig 3 support the use of the kc synthetic methodology even if only partially this methodology approximates the single and dual crop coefficients that are so discrepant when ground cover is partial lópez urrea et al 2009 additionally the potential for better adjusting kc standard to local conditions using a remote sensing approach tasumi et al 2005 segovia cardozo et al 2019 was evident in srrd it was notable how the synthetic approach missed the effect of deficit irrigation of maize fig 3 this observation prompted the comparison with an energy balance approach eeflux was a helpful and friendly platform allowing non experts to apply metric the comparison of kc eeflux with kc viact in fig 4a indicated that the former was greater than the latter in the range of smaller values ayyad et al 2019 obtained similar results when comparing eeflux with other satellite based models in irrigated areas of egypt one of the causes of this discrepancy could be the difference between metric and eeflux firstly eeflux uses gridded weather data to estimate reference evapotranspiration while metric and the vi based approach use data from weather stations secondly some authors have observed that the automated eeflux calibration algorithm could require some adjustment to reproduce manually calibrated metric products for certain environments foolad et al 2018 nevertheless the rmse of 0 22 found in our comparison of kc eeflux with kc synthetic was of the same order as the results of other authors who compared metric with other models for instance french et al 2015 found that metric etc estimates agreed with etc obtained from consecutive measurements of soil water content in cotton to about 2 mm d 1 paço at al 2014 stated that etc of an olive orchard hedgerow computed using the fao56 method agreed rather well with metric etc estimations the deviation of the crop coefficients obtained with metric and with the fao56 model developed by these authors mean bias of 18 was similar or even greater than the deviation observed in our comparison zhang et al 2015 found a good correlation between metric etc estimates of sugarcane with those of etc computed with the fao56 method using a vi derived kcb rmse 0 17 0 19 mm d 1 although the former was lesser than the latter in the range of lower etc however kc obtained from metric agreed quite well with kc derived from vi in the two sugarcane fields monitored by these authors nevertheless other authors who carried out inter comparison of models observed greater discrepancies for instance al zayed et al 2016 obtained a rmse of 2 mm d 1 when comparing metric etc with etc derived from a water balance in the gezira irrigation scheme sudan with the former globally greater than the latter similarly french et al 2018 compared metric etc with estimates of etc computed with the fao56 method using vi derived kcb obtaining that the former was about 1 and 2 mm d 1 greater than the latter for alfalfa and cotton respectively implying a significant deviation when computing seasonal etc however the main source of error in the estimation of seasonal etc may derive from interpolation between spaced dates due to infrequent satellite overpass he et al 2017 compared metric etc estimates over an almond orchard in california with measurements taken with a micrometeorological tower satellite revisiting time was 16 days but most images during december to march were not usable due to cloud cover the conditions of the orchard were the ones that minimize the interpolation error adult and uniform orchard no rainfall micro irrigation however the mean relative difference of monthly aggregations from april to september was 10 within the range estimated in fig 8a for 15 day revisiting time french et al 2015 tested the impact of overpass frequency on cotton seasonal et accuracy and showed a significant advantage in an 8 day overpass frequency compared with a 16 day observation interval similar results by zhang et al 2015 led these authors to conclude that the vi approach may be more practical for estimating sugarcane crop water use where ground based eto measurements are available through on site weather stations our results support this conclusion except under the following circumstances when satellite revisiting time is less than one week if deficit irrigation is a common practice or where ground based eto measurements are not available through automated weather stations or in a network covering all the scheme s conditions the first condition was not met in srrd but the other two were the distance from srrd fields to the nearest weather station may be up to 5 km and the perception of farmers and agriculturalists is that significant weather variations are evident across the scheme on specific days thus as concluded by zhang et al 2015 for a different environment spatially distributed reference evapotranspiration in this case provided by eeflux seems to be a better choice in srrd than reference evapotranspiration obtained at the weather stations in summary a combination of the two approaches evaluated in this study could be the best option as suggested by paço et al 2014 meanwhile it is clear that scheme performance assessment based on etc estimations interpolating satellite derived kc is subject to errors that advise against such applications 5 conclusions in the assessment of irrigation schemes water balance related performance indicators could be notably improved if the crop evapotranspiration estimated is field specific and based on remote sensing techniques the robustness of the vi based approach is the confidence of the daily interpolation of the vi derived kcb its disadvantages are the need of a complementary procedure to account for soil wetting events and its inability to detect crop water stress therefore if deficit irrigation is a common practice as observed in some crops in srrd the vi approach will overestimate crop evapotranspiration so that remote sensing methods based on the energy balance may be more appropriate however when satellite overpass frequency is greater than one week and water deficit is mild or inexistent the interpolation of crop coefficients obtained with the energy balance approach leads to errors of etc estimations that are greater than the errors resulting from estimating etc using vi derived basal crop coefficients in combination with an algorithm to consider soil evaporation the synthetic crop coefficient was an appropriate approach to deriving field specific vi based crop coefficients when the dates of field irrigation events are unknown as commonly happens in large irrigation schemes although other vi based approaches may be as appropriate as the synthetic crop coefficient future research should therefore investigate methods to combine both approaches to take advantage of the robustness of each of them avoiding their weaknesses declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10378,in the assessment of irrigation schemes the accuracy of performance indicators related to the water balance could be improved by estimating crop evapotranspiration etc using remote sensing techniques the two main remote sensing approaches to estimating etc are the surface energy balance and the fao56 based approach that uses the ability of vegetation indices vi to trace the crop coefficient both approaches were evaluated comparatively at the río dulce irrigation scheme in argentina where the predominant crops are cotton alfalfa and maize using products from the landsat 7 and 8 sensors provided by the eeflux application the first analysis used field specific vi derived basal crop coefficients obtained for 1743 fields using series of 9 29 satellite images along the 2014 15 irrigation campaign the second analysis used 30 fields grown with cotton and maize where the actual irrigation schedules in the 2014 15 irrigation campaign were known a root zone soil water balance was computed in these fields using the fao56 dual approach with field specific vi derived basal crop coefficients the etc obtained from the water balance was compared with the etc estimated using a single crop coefficient approach that uses field specific vi and takes into account soil evaporation herein called synthetic approach and with the etc obtained with the metric surface energy balance model as facilitated by the eeflux application the third analysis was a simulation analysis of errors in the estimation of the etc due to the interpolation to daily values of single crop coefficients and basal crop coefficients determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day the vi derived basal crop coefficient curves obtained for the 1743 fields of the first analysis were below the locally adopted standard not field specific basal crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration in the 8005 ha covered by this analysis was about 20 higher when applying standard non field specific curves than when applying vi derived curves this difference pointed to the importance of using field specific estimations of etc in the analysis carried out on the 30 selected fields the etc estimated using the vi based approach agreed well with the etc obtained from the water balance except under water deficit conditions the crop coefficients obtained for these fields using the metric model correlated with those obtained by applying the vi based method although the former tended to be higher than the latter in the lower value range the analysis of interpolation errors showed that when satellite overpass frequency is greater than one week and water deficit is mild or inexistent the interpolation of crop coefficients for instance of those derived from an energy balance gives errors of etc estimations that are greater than those resulting from the vi based approach under water deficit conditions the vi based approach systematically overestimates

imperative in a world with an increasing population and food demand where water scarcity is constraining agricultural production more and more and emerging sectors compete for the available water resources several efforts have been made in the last decades to formulate a framework and guidelines for irrigation scheme performance assessment relevant examples of these efforts are the performance assessment program of the international water management institute molden et al 1998 the guidelines for benchmarking in the irrigation and drainage sector of the international programme for technology and research in irrigation and drainage malano and burton 2001 and the task force on benchmarking of irrigation and drainage projects of the international commission on irrigation and drainage malano et al 2004 a prominent set of performance indicators the outcome of these efforts refers to the water balance these indicators have been widely applied to the internal assessment e g morábito et al 1998 lozano and mateos 2008 and benchmarking e g rodríguez díaz et al 2008 borgia et al 2013 zema et al 2018 of irrigation schemes the accuracy of performance indicators related to the water balance could be improved by estimating evapotranspiration et using remote sensing techniques bos et al 2005 some of the latter s early applications in the evaluation of irrigation scheme performance were carried out in south america menenti et al 1989 roerink et al 1997 bastiaanssen et al 2001 with the advent of the google earth engine a computing platform based primarily on satellite imagery that allows users to run planetary scale geospatial analysis on google s infrastructure this type of application is increasingly within the reach of researchers developers and water managers two main approaches to estimating crop evapotranspiration etc assisted by remote sensing techniques have become common in agricultural water use studies gonzalez dugo et al 2009 taghvaeian and neale 2011 the first approach partitions the available energy by using the radiometric surface temperature derived from thermal band imagery to estimate the sensible heat flux and compute latent heat as a residual to the surface energy balance e g kustas and norman 1996 bastiaanssen et al 1998 allen et al 2007a the second approach is based on the ability of multispectral vegetation indices vi derived from surface reflectance data to trace the crop s growth and estimate the crop coefficient bausch and neale 1989 pôças et al 2020 this approach is unable to detect the reduction in etc due to stomata closure but it generates spatially distributed crop coefficients that multiplied by a reference evapotranspiration estimated daily from local weather station data provide estimates of field specific potential stomatal conductance not limited by water deficit evapotranspiration gonzalez dugo et al 2009 various forms of the remote sensing surface energy balance approach have been applied to upscale the estimations of et to project scale for example droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 combined the hydrological model swap with et estimated with the sebal surface energy balance algorithm for land bastiaanssen et al 1998 model to evaluate the performance of an irrigation district in turkey similarly taghvaeian et al 2018 calculated a water balance with et also estimated with sebal to obtain irrigation performance indicators for an irrigation district in southern california allen et al 2007a mapped et across irrigation districts in idaho california and new mexico using metric mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration allen et al 2007b and santos et al 2008 used the same model for similar purposes in southern spain the reset remote sensing of evapotranspiration elhaddad and garcia 2011 model has been used to map et across an irrigation district in california elhaddad and garcia 2014 and to feed a water balance for obtaining irrigation performance assessment indicators in an irrigation district in spain chalghaf et al 2015 however the vi based crop coefficient approach has been used less on a large scale examples are in gonzalez dugo et al 2013 and segovia cardozo et al 2019 but more for irrigation advisory services d urso et al 2010 melton et al 2012 calera et al 2017 in both approaches remote measurements are taken at time intervals which depend on the sensor overpass frequency to estimate etc for dates between measurements daily interpolation is needed and the error due to this interpolation may depend on the remote sensing approach used to estimate etc satellite overpass frequency varies from satellite to satellite in addition a compromise between temporal and spatial resolution is needed to meet the goals of agricultural applications high spatial resolution 100 m is required in most cases for these applications the number of sensors on board of satellites that meet the condition of high spatial resolution is limited this limitation is even greater if the energy balance approach is to be used i e if measurements of radiometric surface temperature are needed a time resolution of less than one week is rare two to four weeks is common although the use of constellations of satellites may help in some situations to increase the time resolution these constraints condition the accuracy of the two main remote sensing approaches to estimating etc making the selection of the method a challenge the objective of this study was a comparative evaluation of the two remote sensing approaches for the estimation of etc in the performance assessment of irrigation schemes the two methods evaluated were the fao56 method allen et al 1998 with crop coefficients derived from a vegetation index following mateos et al 2013 and the metric model allen et al 2007a as executed by the earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application allen et al 2015 the evaluation used the río dulce irrigation scheme in the province of santiago del estero argentina as a study case first the study compared estimations of etc for individual crops and for the entire cultivated area of 8005 ha using standard not field specific crop coefficients with estimations using field specific vi based crop coefficients second in a set of 30 fields where the irrigation schedule was known the study compared the field specific vi based approach with metric finally the study included an evaluation of errors in the estimation of the crop s evapotranspiration due to the interpolation to daily values of single crop coefficients and basal crop coefficients determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day the evaluation of interpolation errors was related to the comparative evaluation of the two remote sensing approaches for etc estimation as both approaches were based on measurements made at discontinuous satellite overpass dates so interpolation at intermediate dates was necessary 2 material and methods 2 1 remote sensing based evapotranspiration models 2 1 1 the fao56 method to obtain kc and vi derived kc the method proposed by the fao to estimate etc consists of multiplying a reference evapotranspiration by a crop coefficient doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration eto is calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 from meteorological variables measured at ground weather stations the crop coefficient kc is the quotient between the etc of the crop concerned and eto therefore 1 e t c k c e t o kc may be a single coefficient or be split into two components dual approach direct evaporation from the soil surface and plant transpiration allen et al 1998 2 k c k cb k s k e where kcb is the basal crop coefficient addressing plant transpiration under unstressed conditions ks quantifies the reduction in crop transpiration due to soil water deficit and ke is the soil evaporation coefficient the standard procedure allen et al 1998 for developing the kc and kcb curves requires three characteristic value those during the initial stage kc ini kcb ini the mid season stage kc mid kcb mid and at the end of the late season stage kc end kcb end the curves are constructed by connecting straight line segments through each of the four growth stages initial crop development mid season and late season horizontal lines are drawn through kc ini in the initial stage and through kc mid in the mid season stage straight lines are drawn from kc ini to kc mid in the course of the crop development stage and from kc mid to kc end in the course of the late season stage herein the kc and kcb curves developed like this will be called kc standard and kcb standard respectively since both kcb and multispectral vis obtained by remote sensing techniques represent crop development choudhury et al 1994 kcb can be derived from vi bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 the relation between some vis and the ground cover fraction fc is approximately linear in the range from bare soil to near full ground cover huete et al 1985 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 thus 3 f c vi v i min v i max v i min where vimin and vimax are the values of vi for fc 0 and fc 1 respectively on the other hand researches have obtained different linear relationships between vis and kcb pôças et al 2020 mateos et al 2013 validated the following normalized form of these linear relationships to obtain the generic expression 4 k cb vi min k cb max k cb max f c kcbmax vi v i min v i max v i min according to this equation the linear increase of kcb with vi is from the value of vi vimin corresponding to bare soil fc 0 to the value of vi vimax corresponding to pure vegetation fc 1 kcb max is the maximum value of kcb generally equal to kcb mid kcb mid corresponds to fc fc max pereira et al 2020a b if for some reason the crop in the region of interest is different from the standard crop then a local value of kcb max can be used in eq 10 in this case associated to its specific fc fc kcbmax since fc 1 is not always achieved allen and pereira 2009 eq 4 ensures that the computed kcb does not exceeds kcb max achieved at fc fc kcbmax and also ensures coherence with the fao 56 method to determine actual kcb although allen et al 1998 recommended a minimum value of kcb close to 0 15 for simplicity eq 4 assumes kcb 0 for fc 0 setting kcb to zero acknowledges the fact that evaporation of bare soil will reduce to zero or nearly zero over extended drying periods allen et al 2005 anyway choosing a minimum kcb closer to 0 15 would have required adapting eq 4 but the effect on the comparisons presented in this paper would have been negligible ks equals one for unstressed crops thus the potential crop coefficient of a specific crop may be obtained from eq 2 making ks 1 for water stressed crops ks may be computed as allen et al 1998 5a k s taw d r 1 p taw if dr 1 p taw 5b k s 1 if dr 1 p taw where dr is the root zone water depletion mm twa is the root zone total available water mm and p is the fraction of the taw below which transpiration is reduced the depth of the root zone zr m may be calculated as 6 z r z r min z r max z r min k cb k cb max where zr max m and zr min m are the maximum effective root depth and the effective root depth during the initial stage of crop growth therefore taw is 7 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp z r where θfc and θwp are the water content at field capacity and wilting point respectively in m3 m 3 dr i in eq 5a may be computed with a daily water balance in the soil root zone as 8 d r i d r i 1 e t c i p i i i r o i d p i where dr i is the root zone water depletion at the end of day i mm dr i 1 mm is the root zone water depletion at the end of the previous day i 1 and etc i pi ii roi and dpi are crop evapotranspiration precipitation irrigation rainfall runoff from the soil surface and water loss out of the root zone by deep percolation respectively on day i and expressed in mm pi was measured etc i was computed with eqs 1 5 roi was computed with the curve number method nrcs 2004 dpi was estimated as the soil water in excess of field capacity and ii was simulated according to a given irrigation strategy or measured depending on the application sections 2 4 and 2 5 the soil evaporation coefficient ke is calculated taking into consideration topsoil wetting events due to irrigation or rainfall and the availability of energy at the soil surface allen et al 1998 9 k e min k c max f ew k r k c max k cb where kr is an evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on the cumulative depth of water depleted from the topsoil kc max is the maximum value of kc following rain or irrigation with kcb kcb max and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed 1 fc and wetted following rain or irrigation kr 1 as the soil surface dries kr is reduced linearly with cumulative evaporation to become zero when no water is left for evaporation in the upper soil layer allen et al 1998 therefore the application of the dual crop coefficient requires computing a water balance at the upper soil layer and a soil root zone water balance if crop water stress is to be considered computing any of the two water balances implies knowing the dates and depths of irrigation and rainfall events on every field which is rarely viable when dealing with large irrigation areas in this case the single crop coefficient approach is more practical since it assumes typical not field specific wetting conditions however satellites provide vis across large irrigation areas at high spatial resolution thus one may want to profit from field specific vis to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of the estimation of etc the most straightforward alternative would be applying eq 1 with kc estimated using one relationships between vi and kc for instance this was the method chosen by segovia cardozo et al 2019 to estimate etc in spanish irrigation schemes based on the linear vi kc relationship proposed by calera et al 2005 another alternative would be eq 2 with kcb obtained from one of the published vi kcb linear relationships calera et al 2017 and running a water balance to obtain ke and ks this second option chosen for instance by pôças et al 2015 requires knowing or assuming the irrigation schedules of the fields in the area of study a third option somehow intermediate between the two previous ones uses field specific vis to obtain field specific kcb vi eq 4 and then uses approximate soil wetting information rainfall data measures at local weather stations and typical irrigation frequencies to approximate kc to field specific conditions one way to make such an approximation is in mateos et al 2013 where the approximate kc was called the synthetic crop coefficient kc synthetic so as not to be confused with the fao 56 single crop coefficient 10a k c synthetic k c bare soil 1 k c bare soil k cb vi if k cb vi 1 10b k c synthetic 1 k c max 1 k cb max 1 k cb vi 1 if k cb vi 1 where kc bare soil is ke computed with eq 9 applied to bare soil kcb 0 and averaged on the time interval corresponding to each satellite overpass for which vi and thus kcb vi was available if kcb vi 1 on a given date then kc synthetic will depend only on the kcb vi for that date and on the crop characteristic parameters kc max and kcb max otherwise kc synthetic will depend on kcb vi on the date of concern but also on kc bare soil kc synthetic will increase with respect to kcb vi as kc bare soil is lower the reader may find more details about the rationale behind eq 10 in mateos et al 2013 note that crop evapotranspiration estimated using kc synthetic etc synthetic is field specific but does not take into account eventual reduction of transpiration due to stomatal closure provoked by water deficit 2 1 2 earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application the earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux application allen et al 2015 uses landsat imagery archives on the google earth engine platform to calculate the daily evapotranspiration on the 30 30 m scale automatically calibrated for each landsat image eeflux produces and provides maps of actual etc estimations surface temperature normalized difference vegetation index ndvi reference evapotranspiration and albedo for any landsat 5 7 or 8 scene reference evapotranspiration is computed from gridded hourly and daily weather data stored on earth engine using the asce standardized penman monteith method asce ewri 2005 etr and the fao 56 method eto allen et al 1998 eeflux can be freely accessed in https eeflux level1 appspot com the estimation of actual etc in eeflux is based on the metric model allen et al 2007a irmak et al 2012 metric is a satellite based image processing model for calculating actual evapotranspiration based upon the energy balance at the land surface the latent heat flux λet is calculated from the surface energy balance for the moment captured in satellite image acquisition as 11 λet r n g h where g is the soil heat flux h is the sensible heat flux and rn is the net radiation all units in wm 2 net radiation is computed from solar radiation estimation by taking into consideration the atmospheric transmissivity surface reflectance and longwave emission balance using satellite shortwave and thermal observation data soil heat flux is estimated as a ratio of net radiation using surface conditions such as vegetation and temperature observed by satellite sensible heat flux h w m 2 is expressed as 12 h ρ a c p δ t r a where ρa kg m 3 is the air density cp j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure δt k is the near surface vertical temperature difference and ra s m 1 is the aerodynamic resistance corresponding to δt metric assumes that δt can be approximated by a linear relationship of the radiometric surface temperature tr k bastiaanssen et al 1998 13 δ t a b t r where a and b are empirical parameters determined by means of a calibration based on the selection of hot and cold pixels within the satellite scene bastiaanssen et al 1998 the δt values for these two pixels are estimated by rearranging eq 12 for the selected hot and cold pixels and by using eq 11 to derive the respective values of h following the procedure proposed by allen et al 2007a the hot pixel should be bare dry soil so λet 0 and h rn g and the cold pixel should be a well watered crop at full cover where λet is assumed to be 5 above that of the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr computed using the standardized asce penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 the resulting evapotranspiration at the moment of the satellite image is used to calculate a fraction of reference evapotranspiration that enables the conversion of the instantaneous value into daily values of actual et the latent heat flux is then computed for each pixel at the instant of satellite overpass and is readily converted to instantaneous et etinst 14 e t inst 3600 λet λ a fraction etrf is computed for the time of the satellite overpass 15 e t r f e t inst e t r finally eeflux calculates daily etc etc eeflux for each pixel by multiplying etrf by the daily etr computed from gridded weather data assuming consistency between etrf at overpass time and etrf for the 24 h period 16 e t c eeflux e t r f e t r the corresponding kc kc eeflux is calculated as the ratio between etc eeflux and eto provided by the eeflux platform note that etc eeflux is field specific and does take into account eventual reduction of transpiration due to stomatal closure provoked by water deficit 2 2 study area the evaluation of methods for estimating etc for the performance assessment of irrigation scheme was carried out in the río dulce irrigation scheme srrd acronym in spanish located in the province of santiago del estero argentina at latitude 27 47 s and longitude 64 16 w the area irrigated in srrd is around 80 000 ha extending over the river alluvial plain the

application efficiency and distribution uniformity of around 70 angella et al 2011 srrd is divided into five administrative areas this study covered two of these subsystems apaz iv canal san martín and el alto apaz iv includes 15 000 ha with irrigation rights out of a total area of 70 000 ha equipped for irrigation while el alto covers 4000 ha of which only 2100 ha have irrigation rights fig 1

the respective managers of the apaz iv and el alto subsystems for the 2014 15 irrigation season meteorological data to compute daily eto with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and daily rainfall were obtained from the weather station of the national weather service smn for el alto and from the inta weather station for apaz iv fig 1 soil information was taken from the soil maps of the apaz iv area produced by angueira and zamora 2007 the soils in the study area of alluvial origin are relatively homogeneous two similar soil classes named el simbol and la maría according to the inta classification echevehere 1976 occupy most of the area 75 of the total area and about 90 of the cultivated area the main characteristics of the respective typical soil profiles are in table 1 the soils deeper than 1 5 m do not present restriction to crop root growth texture is silty loam soil water holding capacity in the typical soil profiles of the el simbol and la maría soil classes is 179 mm m 1 and 176 mm m 1 respectively soil water contents at field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp were derived from the soil water retention curves provided in angueira and zamora 2007 for the typical soil profiles using the method by rawles and brakensiek 1982 the result was essentially the same for both soil profiles thus given the relatively low resolution of the soil maps and the relative homogeneity of the soils the values of θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 were used for the whole apaz iv subsystem regarding el alto subsystem although it falls just outside the area covered by the available soil maps based on the experience of inta researchers we assumed that most cultivated soils in this subsystem belonged to either el simbol or la maría class therefore in the soil water balances applied to fields in the el alto subsystem we used the same θfc and θwp values obtained for the apaz iv subsystem a set of 16 ndvi images from landsat 7 path row 229 80 230 79 and 230 80 and 14 ndvi images from landsat 8 path row 229 80 and 230 79 was downloaded from eeflux table 2 the images selected were all cloud free path rows 230 79 and 230 80 covered the entire srrd 14 images in total while path row 229 80 16 images covered only part of srrd the images were re projected to the coordinate reference system posgar 98 argentina 4 european petroleum survey group epsg 22174 geographical analysis was performed with the qgis 3 10 qgis development team 2019 application a free and open source software that supports viewing editing and analysis of geospatial data the images from the same date were merged and clipped to the area of interest with qgis then the zonal statistics tool of qgis was used to extract the mean ndvi value for each image and crop field date 2 4 analyses applied to cultivated fields in srrd the first analysis concerned all cultivated fields in el alto and apaz iv 161 and 1582 respectively etc standard etc obtained from the fao56 standard procedure using kc standard i e without using remote sensing data etc synthetic etc obtained using vi derived kc synthetic and etc viopt etc obtained using kcb vi and computing ks and ke running the water balance simulating optimal irrigation schedule that is triggering irrigation when the soil water content reaches the allowable depletion were calculated for these fields soil water contents at field capacity and wilting point were θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 the crop parameters taken to apply the fao56 method are in table 3 as well as the number of fields and area for each crop the growing calendars were set based on the information from farmers and subsystem managers kc values were taken from fao56 and adjusted for the frequency of wetting and climatic conditions following the recommendations of fao56 allen et al 1998 and based on the local knowledge of the first author values of fc max or fc kcbmax were not readily available in the literature thus we set the conservative values of 0 8 for all crops within the range compiled in the reviews by pereira et al 2020a b ndvimin was specifically obtained from the landsat images selecting fields with bare soil and ndvimax was set to 0 9 for all crops based on gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 and carpintero et al 2020 the second analysis used 30 fields 23 of cotton and 7 of maize for which the actual irrigation schedule and growing itinerary from planting to harvesting were available in these fields etc viact etc obtained using kcb vi and computing ks and ke running the water balance using actual irrigation depths was compared with etc synthetic and etc eeflux the selected fields were located in the apaz iv subsystem fig 1 with their size ranging between 8 and 60 ha their soils belonged to the la maría soil class thus the characteristic water contents used in the water balance were θfc 0 270 and θwp 0 092 m3 m 3 cotton planting dates were between november 1 and december 10 2014 while all selected maize fields were planted on january 1 2015 the number of irrigations varied between 1 and 4 in the cotton fields and was 2 in the maize fields for these fields in addition to the images of ndvi two other eeflux products were downloaded eto and etc eeflux six landsat 7 path row 230 79 and 230 80 and five landsat 8 path row 230 79 table 2 a buffer along the crop field borders was eliminated to prevent external pixel contamination 2 5 simulation analysis of interpolation errors the third analysis was a simulation analysis to evaluate the errors in the estimation of etc due to the interpolation to daily values of 1 kcb used to obtain kc synthetic and 2 kc both determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day although the context of the interpolation analysis was the application of satellite imagery to estimate etc by the vi and energy balance based methods the analysis did not need to apply those methods or use satellite imagery it only needed assumptions about the frequency of satellite overpasses and supposedly known truth values of kcb and kc at the satellite overpass dates the first step for the interpolation analysis was depicting the curve representing the daily kcb of an ideal cotton crop grown in the environment of santiago del estero from november 1 to april 15 under non limiting conditions this particular kcb curve was taken as being the truth truth as opposed to interpolated for the interpolation analysis and named kcb truth second the values of kcb truth corresponding to dates at intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 days were selected this selection resulted in 9 series of values of truth coefficients supposedly corresponding to their respective satellite overpass frequencies the number of assumed satellite overpasses during the period of analysis october 1 to may 1 varied from 212 to 5 corresponding to assumed satellite revisit time of 1 day and 40 days respectively third the values of kcb truth in each series were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimations of kcb named kcb interpolated fourth kc synthetic was calculated from eq 10 replacing kcb vi by kcb interpolated the value of kc bare soil also necessary to apply eq 10 was ke eq 9 applied to bare soil considering rainfall events and averaged on the time interval centred on each of the assumed satellite overpasses in order to account for the effect of weather variability the simulation period was 30 years july 1 1988 to june 30 2018 using weather data from the inta weather station fig 1 other parameters needed in eqs 9 and 10 were taken from table 3 finally kc synthetic was multiplied by daily eto to obtain daily etc synthetic for the analysis of errors in the interpolation of kc the assumed truth daily kc curve of the ideal cotton crop was generated applying the dual crop coefficient approach eq 2 using kcb truth since the dual approach requires knowing the soil wetting dates rainfall was obtained from the inta weather station and the irrigation dates for the ideal cotton crop were simulated using the soil water balance the simulation period and weather data were the same as for the analysis of interpolation of kcb used to obtain kc synthetic i e july 1 1988 to june 30 2018 inta weather station therefore while the analysis used a unique kcb truth curve the kc truth curve varied from year to year moreover two surface irrigation strategies were simulated consisting of refilling the soil to field capacity when the crop depleted the readily available water estimated as 65 of the root zone soil water holding capacity or 80 of the root zone soil water holding capacity for the full and deficit irrigation strategies respectively then the values of kc truth corresponding to dates at intervals of 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 days were selected and the truth coefficients of each series were linearly interpolated to obtain daily estimations of crop coefficient named kc interpolated finally kc interpolated was multiplied by daily eto to obtain daily etc interpolated the interpolation errors were evaluated by means of the root mean square error rmse of daily etc and the relative error re of seasonal etc the former was obtained from the square of the difference between the daily values of etc obtained using kc truth and obtained with the corresponding daily values of kc synthetic or kc interpolated re was computed as the relative difference between seasonal etc computed using kc truth and computed with kc synthetic or kc interpolated the connection of the interpolation analysis with the comparison of methods of estimating etc carried out in the study case is as follows the vi based approach used satellite data to obtain kcb on the days of satellite overpass if it was assumed that kcb can be derived from vis accurately then the kcb truth curve could be reproduced with complete accuracy using daily vis if the temporal frequency of kcb determination kcb vi was less than daily then daily kcb vi values would have to be obtained by interpolation thus making interpolation errors on the other hand the energy balance approach determined kc as the quotient between etc and eto determined on the days of satellite overpass kc eeflux in our study if it was assumed that this kc can be obtained with complete accuracy then the interpolated kc eeflux curve would reproduce kc truth if satellite overpass was daily otherwise daily kc eeflux values would have to be obtained by interpolation thus making interpolation errors that would depend on the satellite overpass frequency the hypothesis behind the interpolation analysis is as follows since the evolution of vis along the crop growing cycle follows a rather determined trend kcb can be interpolated confidently between dates of image acquisition however the vi based approach needs a complementary procedure to account for soil wetting events to obtain kc synthetic in the approach adopted in this study and is unable to detect crop water stress in contrast the energy balance approach gives the crop coefficient directly considering effects of water deficit as well but the interpolation to daily crop coefficients may be unreliable because both numerator and denominator in the quotient etc eto used to determine kc are highly affected by day to day weather variability therefore the objective of the interpolation analysis was to assess the errors of each method as a function of the temporal frequency of the satellite images this analysis was intended to specifically address the errors due to interpolation therefore it did not take into account the inaccuracy of the methods used to determining kcb vi kc synthetic and kc eeflux 3 results 3 1 comparison of methods of estimating etc fig 2 a shows the fao56 standard kcb kcb standard curve for cotton consisting of 4 straight lines the curve was constructed before determining vi taking the three kcb characteristic values and the duration of the growth stages from table 3 during the crop development and mid season stages kcb vi was less than kcb standard in both the apaz iv and el alto subsystems this can be seen in the mean and standard deviation of the kcb vi corresponding to the cotton fields in both el alto and apaz iv at the dates of satellite overpass fig 2a similar observations are in fig 2c for the alfalfa fields kcb standard refers to a pristine crop thus the deviation of kcb vi from kcb standard reflects the cropping performance gap and points to the convenience of the field specific approach for scheme water consumption assessment actually average cotton yield in srrd is about 3 tn ha 1 while attainable yield yield of the best performing crops is 5 tn ha 1 angella et al 2016 during the late season stage the mean kcb vi of cotton was slightly greater than the kcb standard the declining slope of the late season kcb standard implies the recommended practice of forcing defoliation to accelerate boll opening the milder slope of kcb vi reflects the indeterminate nature of cotton that often regrows during and after the harvesting period while weeds may proliferate below the cotton canopy distorting the kcb vi estimate this discussion on kcb can be transferred in the same terms to kc with the addition that in kc soil wetting also intervenes during the cotton development mid season stages kc synthetic was less than kc standard in both the apaz iv and el alto subsystems fig 2b during the initial and early cotton development stages kc synthetic on the satellite overpass dates triangles and squares in fig 2b deviated from kc standard showing that the former takes into account the occurrence of rainfall and dry periods in the case of alfalfa fig 2d the locally assumed kc standard that is based on the cutting frequency in the different seasons was greater than kc synthetic especially in winter and autumn note that the field to field variability of kc synthetic could be evaluated not only on the dates of the satellite overpass indicated in fig 2bd by standard deviation bars on the days of the satellite overpass but also on the interpolated dates as shown in fig 2bd with the area shaded by daily standard deviation bars for the sake of brevity we restricted the description of standard vs vi based kcb and kc to cotton and alfalfa the two main crops in srrd however similar analyses would apply to other crops fig 2b reinforces the recommendation of using the vi based field specific approach in srrd as segovia cardozo et al 2019 also remarked for their study area and the adequacy of the synthetic crop coefficient approach to approximate the effect on kc of rainfall events when field irrigation data are not available alternatively one could use the dual crop coefficient with kcb vi and compute the soil evaporation coefficient allen et al 1998 for an arbitrary irrigation schedule the results of applying one or other method on a system scale are in table 4 seasonal etc in apaz iv was greater than in el alto mainly due to the cropping pattern alfalfa occupies 58 of the area in apaz iv and 12 in el alto subsystem etc was much greater about 20 when using kc standard the difference in system etc estimated with kc synthetic and applying the dual crop coefficient with an optimal irrigation schedule etc viopt was only 2 table 4 the same comparison is in fig 3 for the 30 selected fields with known irrigation schedules in the sample of cotton fields etc synthetic correlated very well with etc estimated from vi and the actual irrigation schedule etc viact fig 3 however in the maize fields etc synthetic was greater than etc viact note that the water balance computed to estimate etc viact takes into account etc reduction due to water deficit while the computation of etc synthetic ignores it fig 3 suggests that water deficit was more pronounced in the maize fields than in the cotton fields for economic reasons in srrd it is common practice to apply one irrigation only the pre irrigation to the maize crops and rely on rainfall for the rest of the growing season while cotton crops typically receive one or two irrigations in addition to the pre irrigation therefore considering the crop water deficit could be important when estimating et over systems such as srrd however the vi based approach is incapable of detecting the reduction in et due to stomatal closure unless it is coupled to a water balance fed with field specific irrigation data in theory the energy balance approach to estimating etc may overcome this limitation this was examined for the selected fields with known irrigation schedules fig 4 a represents kc on the days of satellite overpass provided by eeflux kc eeflux against kc viact overall kc eeflux was greater than kc viact particularly at low kc part of this deviation could be due to small differences between the typical values of θfc and θwp used in the water balance and the actual values of each selected field however this could not be assessed part of the scatter root mean square error rmse 0 23 could be due to differences in the reference evapotranspiration used by eeflux and that obtained from the weather stations recall that eeflux uses gridded weather data stored in earth engine and the asce standardized penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 while the eto from the weather stations is computed using measured data and fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 nevertheless the correlation between reference evapotranspiration derived from the two sources was unbiased and relatively good with rmse 0 9 mm fig 5 however the field irrigation schedules across the srrd system are unknown therefore field daily etc is estimated more adequately using kc synthetic which is represented vs kc eeflux in fig 4b for the selected fields this figure highlights deviations as a consequence of applying the kc synthetic method the symbols circled with a continuous line correspond to satellite overpass dates soon after pre irrigation and before crop emergence kc eeflux detected the wet soil that resulted in high evapotranspiration the upper and lower circle mark data points corresponding to 1 and 4 days after pre irrigation respectively while the middle circle indicates data points corresponding to 3 days after pre irrigation conversely the smoothing feature of kc synthetic resulted in kc synthetic less than that actually expected for that soil surface wetness the opposite circumstance occurred for the five data points circled with a discontinuous line on that satellite overpass date the plants were small or had not emerged the previous soil wetting event had occurred 6 days before thus the soil surface was already dry and a posterior rainfall event occurred 2 days later in this case the smoothing feature of kc synthetic resulted in higher values than those actually expected for the soil surface wetness on the day of the satellite overpass the difficulties of applying the energy balance for instance using metric have been overcome by platforms like eeflux however the number of satellites providing thermal data remains a limitation in our analysis of srrd over a 12 month period the number of useful landsat images varied across the scheme from 9 to 29 with frequency varying from biweekly to monthly 3 2 interpolation results the question is with this frequency of images which would be more appropriate to interpolate kc directly for instance output of the energy balance approach or interpolate kcb for instance output of the vi approach and use an algorithm to derive kc for instance the synthetic method fig 6 depicts daily kcb and kc for the ideal cotton crop that represents the truth in the interpolation analysis that follows kcb truth and kc truth respectively the irrigation strategy in fig 6 was full irrigation kcb interpolated and kc interpolated resulted from the linear interpolation of their respective truth values on the assumed days of satellite overpass marked by diamonds at the top of each fig 6 and kc synthetic resulted from applying the synthetic methodology using kcb interpolated as an input kcb interpolated and kc interpolated would coincide with the respective truth coefficients if the satellite overpass were to be daily fig 6a presents the five crop coefficient curves assuming an overpass interval of 15 days the main observations were that kcb interpolated represented kcb truth very well kc interpolated fluctuated greatly capturing some of the variations of kc truth but missing others and kc synthetic smoothed the fluctuations of kc truth similarly fig 6b presents the same five crop coefficient curves although assuming an overpass interval of 35 days kcb interpolated still represented kcb truth quite well kc interpolated deviated highly from kc truth during most days of the initial and crop development stages and kc synthetic smoothed the fluctuations of kc truth to a curve that was even flatter than that generated for the overpass interval of 15 days this was just an example resulting from the specific rainfall pattern and irrigation schedule of a specific year fig 7 shows the rmse of the estimation of daily etc with the water balance run for the 30 years of weather data under the full irrigation strategy using either kc interpolated or kc synthetic for short overpass intervals the rmse result of using kc synthetic was greater than that employing kc interpolated the curves crossed at an overpass interval of about 4 days reaching a practically constant difference of about 0 3 mm day 1 for overpass intervals longer than 10 days although the difference between both rmse was relatively small it was noticeable that the standard deviation of rmse was greater using kc interpolated than using kc synthetic re of seasonal etc synthetic was close to zero and showed little year to year variability when the water balance was run to prevent water deficit fig 8 a however under the deficit irrigation strategy seasonal etc synthetic was systematically greater bias of about 5 than the seasonal etc obtained from kc truth fig 8b contrarily the re of seasonal etc obtained from kc interpolated did not differ from zero and was similar under full irrigation and deficit irrigation however year to year variability was notably large this is important because one of the advantages of the energy balance approach is its capacity to detect etc reduction due to crop water stress fig 9 a compares seasonal etc eeflux with etc viact computed for the 2014 15 irrigation season on the 30 selected fields the satellite overpass interval for these computations varied from 24 to 66 days it can be observed that cotton seasonal etc eeflux was greater overall than the corresponding etc viact fig 9a the rmse of seasonal etc eeflux vs seasonal etc viact was 75 mm and 27 mm for cotton and maize respectively the three satellite images that were available during the initial and early cotton development stages coincided in that particular year with dates immediately after rainfall events so that kc interpolated during that period was greater than kc viact on most days an example of kc interpolated representative of this circumstance is in fig 10 a the opposite occurred for the maize fields in the 2014 cropping season satellite overpasses during the initial and early cotton development stages coincided with dates several days after rainfall events when the soil surface was already dry so that the kc interpolated during that period was lesser than kc viact on most days however this deviation is not visible in fig 9a because the underestimation consequence of the interpolation effect was compensated for by an overestimation of etc during the mid season and late season stages when the maize crops suffered water deficit but the last satellite overpasses occurred before the deficit period an example of kc interpolated representative of the two counteracting circumstances in the maize crops is in fig 10b similarly to fig 9a fig 9b compares seasonal etc eeflux with etc synthetic the smoothing effect of kc synthetic slightly reduced the discrepancy between the two approaches this was evident for the cotton crops although the maize data points that in fig 9a were close to the 1 1 line in fig 9b were below that line the rmse of seasonal etc eeflux vs seasonal etc synthetic was 74 mm and 83 mm for cotton and maize respectively this reflects the incapacity of the kc synthetic method to account for the reduction in etc as a consequence of the eventual crop water deficit 4 discussion the standard deviation bars in fig 2a and c depict an important field to field crop growth variation other authors have observed it as well as its implications for crop water use using a time series of spot and landsat ndvi images simonneaux et al 2008 and er raki et al 2010 classified winter wheat into classes that differed greatly within an irrigation scheme in central morocco seasonal evapotranspiration for those wheat classes varied between 200 and 450 mm a range of the same order as that obtained in our study using similar methodology for instance in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems etc synthetic varied between 437 and 902 mm and between 512 and 795 for cotton and maize fields respectively tasumi et al 2005 and tasumi and allen 2007 also reported growth variation in a variety of irrigated crops in idaho using landsat ndvi images these authors did not use ndvi derived kc but obtained kc directly by using an energy balance approach field to field etc variation was not discussed in these studies although the results showed that early planted crops consumed more water than late growing ones tasumi and allen 2007 but in a narrower range than that observed in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems these findings and similar ones by other authors e g santos et al 2008 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 french et al 2018 segovia cardozo et al 2019 stress the importance of exploring factors that influence irrigation decisions gibson et al 2018 and of going deeper into methodologies to accurately determine spatially distributed water use in irrigation schemes a crucial issue when determining etc by using methods based on remote sensing is soil evaporation under partial ground cover tasumi et al 2005 observed that the variation in the kc curves was considerably greater than that for the ndvi which they attributed to the effect of wetting events on kc particularly during the initial and developmental growth stages methods based on vi are adequate for deriving kcb but not for the soil evaporation component of kc therefore some complementary algorithm is necessary to overcome this limitation one alternative is to run a water balance pôças et al 2015 as we did to compute etc viopt for the entire subsystems and etc viact for selected fields however this requires additional soil information and knowing the irrigation dates of each field which are rarely available on a scheme scale the synthetic crop coefficient mateos et al 2013 adopted in this study overcame this shortcoming by computing crop coefficients that took into account field specific kcb while adjusting kc to actual rain wetting events and typical irrigation frequency the kc synthetic curve depicted in fig 2b and d sounds like a realistic temporal evolution first better adjusted to local conditions than the kc standard curve and second capturing the field to field variation that the kc standard cannot do the similarity of seasonal etc viopt and etc synthetic in the apaz iv and el alto subsystems table 4 and the good correlation between seasonal etc viact and etc synthetic for cotton crops fig 3 support the use of the kc synthetic methodology even if only partially this methodology approximates the single and dual crop coefficients that are so discrepant when ground cover is partial lópez urrea et al 2009 additionally the potential for better adjusting kc standard to local conditions using a remote sensing approach tasumi et al 2005 segovia cardozo et al 2019 was evident in srrd it was notable how the synthetic approach missed the effect of deficit irrigation of maize fig 3 this observation prompted the comparison with an energy balance approach eeflux was a helpful and friendly platform allowing non experts to apply metric the comparison of kc eeflux with kc viact in fig 4a indicated that the former was greater than the latter in the range of smaller values ayyad et al 2019 obtained similar results when comparing eeflux with other satellite based models in irrigated areas of egypt one of the causes of this discrepancy could be the difference between metric and eeflux firstly eeflux uses gridded weather data to estimate reference evapotranspiration while metric and the vi based approach use data from weather stations secondly some authors have observed that the automated eeflux calibration algorithm could require some adjustment to reproduce manually calibrated metric products for certain environments foolad et al 2018 nevertheless the rmse of 0 22 found in our comparison of kc eeflux with kc synthetic was of the same order as the results of other authors who compared metric with other models for instance french et al 2015 found that metric etc estimates agreed with etc obtained from consecutive measurements of soil water content in cotton to about 2 mm d 1 paço at al 2014 stated that etc of an olive orchard hedgerow computed using the fao56 method agreed rather well with metric etc estimations the deviation of the crop coefficients obtained with metric and with the fao56 model developed by these authors mean bias of 18 was similar or even greater than the deviation observed in our comparison zhang et al 2015 found a good correlation between metric etc estimates of sugarcane with those of etc computed with the fao56 method using a vi derived kcb rmse 0 17 0 19 mm d 1 although the former was lesser than the latter in the range of lower etc however kc obtained from metric agreed quite well with kc derived from vi in the two sugarcane fields monitored by these authors nevertheless other authors who carried out inter comparison of models observed greater discrepancies for instance al zayed et al 2016 obtained a rmse of 2 mm d 1 when comparing metric etc with etc derived from a water balance in the gezira irrigation scheme sudan with the former globally greater than the latter similarly french et al 2018 compared metric etc with estimates of etc computed with the fao56 method using vi derived kcb obtaining that the former was about 1 and 2 mm d 1 greater than the latter for alfalfa and cotton respectively implying a significant deviation when computing seasonal etc however the main source of error in the estimation of seasonal etc may derive from interpolation between spaced dates due to infrequent satellite overpass he et al 2017 compared metric etc estimates over an almond orchard in california with measurements taken with a micrometeorological tower satellite revisiting time was 16 days but most images during december to march were not usable due to cloud cover the conditions of the orchard were the ones that minimize the interpolation error adult and uniform orchard no rainfall micro irrigation however the mean relative difference of monthly aggregations from april to september was 10 within the range estimated in fig 8a for 15 day revisiting time french et al 2015 tested the impact of overpass frequency on cotton seasonal et accuracy and showed a significant advantage in an 8 day overpass frequency compared with a 16 day observation interval similar results by zhang et al 2015 led these authors to conclude that the vi approach may be more practical for estimating sugarcane crop water use where ground based eto measurements are available through on site weather stations our results support this conclusion except under the following circumstances when satellite revisiting time is less than one week if deficit irrigation is a common practice or where ground based eto measurements are not available through automated weather stations or in a network covering all the scheme s conditions the first condition was not met in srrd but the other two were the distance from srrd fields to the nearest weather station may be up to 5 km and the perception of farmers and agriculturalists is that significant weather variations are evident across the scheme on specific days thus as concluded by zhang et al 2015 for a different environment spatially distributed reference evapotranspiration in this case provided by eeflux seems to be a better choice in srrd than reference evapotranspiration obtained at the weather stations in summary a combination of the two approaches evaluated in this study could be the best option as suggested by paço et al 2014 meanwhile it is clear that scheme performance assessment based on etc estimations interpolating satellite derived kc is subject to errors that advise against such applications 5 conclusions in the assessment of irrigation schemes water balance related performance indicators could be notably improved if the crop evapotranspiration estimated is field specific and based on remote sensing techniques the robustness of the vi based approach is the confidence of the daily interpolation of the vi derived kcb its disadvantages are the need of a complementary procedure to account for soil wetting events and its inability to detect crop water stress therefore if deficit irrigation is a common practice as observed in some crops in srrd the vi approach will overestimate crop evapotranspiration so that remote sensing methods based on the energy balance may be more appropriate however when satellite overpass frequency is greater than one week and water deficit is mild or inexistent the interpolation of crop coefficients obtained with the energy balance approach leads to errors of etc estimations that are greater than the errors resulting from estimating etc using vi derived basal crop coefficients in combination with an algorithm to consider soil evaporation the synthetic crop coefficient was an appropriate approach to deriving field specific vi based crop coefficients when the dates of field irrigation events are unknown as commonly happens in large irrigation schemes although other vi based approaches may be as appropriate as the synthetic crop coefficient future research should therefore investigate methods to combine both approaches to take advantage of the robustness of each of them avoiding their weaknesses declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

10379,groundwater and inorganic fertilizers are regularly applied to agricultural soils but their 226ra content is potentially hazardous to human health and the environment due to irrigation and fertilization processes 226ra can accumulate in topsoils and might also leach to subsoils groundwater and surface water however there are few studies on the accumulation of radium in the agricultural soils due to irrigation with groundwater in this work we analysed the radium content in 60 groundwater samples collected from a coastal area of phu yen province vietnam where groundwater is regularly used for irrigation practices long term accumulation of 226ra in agricultural topsoils due to irrigation with groundwater was modelled for rice maize potato and tomato topsoils the fate of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm was studied by using the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model we found that the total inputs of 226ra were 0 83 2 45 0 24 and 0 57 bq m 2 d 1 for rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the total removals were 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m 2 d 1 found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively a simple formula was developed to calculate the accumulation rate of 226ra in the topsoil using this model we predict that the activity concentration of 226ra will increase in rice maize and tomato soil but will remain almost unchanged in potato soils the accumulation rates 226ra were 224 791 and 115 bq m 2 y 1 after 25 years of agricultural practices the total activity values of 226ra that accumulate in rice maize and tomato soils can reach 5147 17278 and 2711 bq m 2 respectively we found the good agreements in the results based on two models the irrigation practices with groundwater samples contribute 96 7 79 5 and 79 8 of 226ra to the accumulation rates of 226ra in rice maize and tomato soils respectively keywords 226ra radioisotope norm agricultural soil chemical fate model 1 introduction naturally occurring radioactive materials norm are part of the earth the major radionuclides in norm are from primordial radionuclides which are long lived radionuclides such as 238u 235u 232th and 40k and any of their decay products such as 226ra and 222rn ojovan et al 2019 other radionuclides in norm can be from nuclear reactors e g 235u and 238u and from cosmogenic radionuclides e g 7be 14c and 3h in the beginning primordial radionuclides e g 238u 235u and 232th series have formed in soils and rocks from soil rock systems they move to other parts of the environment such as groundwater surface water air and plants in which they strongly affect the human health by their decays among primordial radionuclides four radium radionuclides 226ra 228ra 223ra and 225ra of the uranium and thorium decay series are of great concern in environmental assessments they are the most dangerous natural radionuclides because they decay to radon and a number of other daughter radionuclides moreover radium is

jia et al 2007 although radium radionuclides commonly occur in both soil and water environments 228ra 223ra and 225ra have not been focused on by many researchers due to their low abundances in comparison with that of 226ra iaea 2014 jia and jia 2012 226ra has a long half life of 1602 years and together with its decay products is responsible for a major fraction of the internal dose received

the soil soil depth and some human activities iaea 2010 the current worldwide average value of 226ra activity concentration in topsoils is 30 bq kg 1 the highest value 1000 bq kg 1 was found in sweden unscear 2008 minell 1983 in vietnam huy et al 2012 found the activity concentrations of 226ra are from 15 02 121 58 bq kg 1 with the average value of 42 77 bq kg 1 in 64 agricultural soils huynh et al 2018 found the activity concentrations of 226ra are from 25 to 193 bq kg 1 with the average value of 60 bq kg 1 in highland soils with natural forests in ninh thuan province another study found the activity concentrations of 226ra from 15 to 47 bq kg 1 with the average value of 24 bq kg 1 in ho chi minh city where no plants are cultivated vu et al 2019 in a specific soil the activity concentration of 226ra is varied between soil components particularly the activity concentration of 226ra in organic matter is higher than it in clay matter because the sorption of radium on organic matter is about 10 times higher than on clay simon and ibrahim 1990 226ra is strongly absorbed by metal hydroxides and humic substances bordelet et al 2013 sajih et al 2014 in agricultural soils the migration of radium caused by plant uptake and convective transport by flowing water strongly depends on the absorption desorption process associated with the surface reactivity of the solid phase in contact with the soil solution which is described by means of the distribution coefficient kd l kg 1 kd values for specific radionuclides are commonly obtained from field and laboratory studies vandenhove and van hees 2007 the kd values were classified on the basic properties of four main soil groups sand loam clay and organic defined according to the sand and clay mineral percentages referred to as the mineral matter and the organic matter content in the soil iaea trs 472 presented kd values for selected radionuclides in soils grouped according to the texture organic matter criteria iaea 2010 according to that average values of kd are 1 9 103 3 8 104 1 3 103 and 2 5 103 l kg 1 for sandy loam clay organic soil groups respectively inorganic fertilizers which are made from phosphate ores can contain high levels of 238u and its decay products 226ra is one of the 238u decay products that most of studies on the environmental radioactivity focus on 228ra from the 232th decay series may also be present but at lower activity concentrations alam et al 1997 ioannides et al 1997 uosif et al 2014 el bahi et al 2017 truong et al 2018a and nguyen et al 2018 determined activity concentrations of natural radionuclides 40k 238u 232th and 226ra in many types of chemical fertilizer in vietnam the activity concentrations of 226ra were significant in many fertilizer samples they were found in a wide range of 0 150 5 bq kg 1 the highest concentration was reported in phosphate fertilizers with a significant amount of 226ra in fertilizers agricultural practices in the study area can cause an accumulation of 226ra in the topsoils water demand for irrigated crops can be from different sources such as surface water available in rivers lakes and springs and groundwater vörösmarty et al 2005 in these water sources natural radionuclides contaminate with various levels akyil et al 2009 alkhomashi et al 2016 özmen et al 2004 the activity levels of natural radionuclides were found at the hazardous levels in many groundwater samples in the world janine et al 2014 abdallah et al 2013 isam salih et al 2002 in groundwater 226ra was found in the range of 1190 6550 m bq l 1 in yemen and 500 6800 m bq l 1 in brazil abdallah et al 2013 janine et al 2014 in vietnam le et al 2015 found that the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater in ho chi minh city were from 80 to 540 m bq l 1 as a result of the contamination of 226ra in irrigation water sources especially groundwater the irrigation practices can cause an accumulation of 226ra in the agricultural soils however there was no study that concerned about this topic long term accumulation of heavy metals due to agricultural practices was investigated in different soils in many regions around the world zhang et al 2003 kwon et al 2014 chen et al 2013 yang et al 2018 research on radionuclides has largely focused on uranium and artificial radionuclides from nuclear fallout e g 137cs 90sr and 239pu bigalke et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019a b schnug and haneklaus 2015 schipper et al 2011 corcho alvarado et al 2016 there was no such research focused on radium radionuclides e g 226ra 228ra 223ra and 225ra moreover the work findings and the decision makers of these studies are difficult to use for other studies elsewhere given the differences in historic metal inputs physicochemical properties of the soil pedological conditions of the soils agricultural practices and climate changes santos et al 2013 shi et al 2018 for convenience several models have been developed for assessment of the transfer of metals from the topsoil to subsoil and other environments these chemical fate models are extensive economic and efficient tools to predict the fate of metals in addition to field and laboratory data liu et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 mallmann et al 2014 santos et al 2013 qian et al 2018 some models were successfully validated to simulate behaviours of radionuclides in various environments jacques et al 2008 torres et al 2017 2018 nguyen et al 2019a b merk 2012 modelling behaviours of radionuclides is a possible way to assess the long term changes of radionuclides in the topsoils and to determine the contributions of natural and artificial factors to the inputs removals of radionuclides to the total rates of radionuclides in the topsoils in this work we used the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc soil model combined with the equivalence approach and the hydrus 1d model to simulate the behaviours of 226ra in the topsoils and to predict the long term changes of 226ra activity concentrations in different agricultural soils under distinctly different long term land use mackay and stiver 1991 mackay 2001 simunek et al 2008 our findings are of potential use for decision makers not only in the study area but also elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 method overview the summary of the method is shown in fig 1 in this study we aim to estimate the long term change of 226ra activity concentration in the agricultural soil four agricultural topsoils with different agricultural practices including rice oryza sativa maize zea mays potato solanum tuberosum and tomato solanum lycopersicum were investigated the accumulation rate of 226ra in the topsoil was contributed to by two terms the input of 226ra due to processes of fertilization and irrigation the removal of 226ra due to processes of radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake some models were validated to simulate the fate of 226ra in the topsoil and the removal of 226ra was based on the model assessments finally we found a mathematic formula to predict the long term change of 226ra activity in the topsoil the formula included many factors e g activity concentrations inputs and removals which were determined by experimental measurements and model assessments 2 2 site description the study was taken place at lowland paddy fields of tuy an district which are located in phu yen province a south central coast of vietnam fig 2 the climate of the area locates in the tropical zone with a high rate of rainfall and high humidity the topography of the province consists of 70 of high region in the west and 30 of the fertile plain in the east the study area locates nearby the east sea the landscape could be divided into two regions based on their topographic 1 a swamp region located in the east of an my district and near the east sea and 2 a hilly region located in the west of an my district da rang river is the largest river flowing across phu yen province while song hinh lake is a large artificial lake is located in the southwest of the province these rivers supply water for agricultural irrigation and other human activities besides that groundwater is a water source for drinking and agricultural irrigation in the study area the main soil of the area is the sandy soil it has renovated for many years to be adaptable for different crops one of the methods is the application of organic fertilizers it causes the high content of organic matter in the topsoil four fields with different agricultural practices were investigated the cultivation characteristics are presented in detail in table 1 there is a single crop grown in each field and no crop rotation applied to maintain the high yield of crops many inorganic fertilizers e g n urea p 0 46 0 k kcl dap 18 46 0 and a blended fertilizer made up of ingredients containing nitrogen phosphate and potash 16 16 8 were applied to the agricultural sites but often contain a significant concentration of 226ra nguyen et al 2018 truong et al 2018a in the study area the main water source that is used for irrigation systems is groundwater the high levels of 226ra were found in groundwater in many regions of the world janine et al 2014 abdallah et al 2013 isam salih et al 2002 and in vietnam le et al 2015 however such data is not available in this study area one of the factors contributing to the input of 226ra in the agricultural soils is the fine dust pollution but it was not considered in the study as 226ra was not be detected in our routine investigations around the study area 2 3 collection of data table 1 summaries the collected data necessary for this study the samples of plants soils fertilizers and groundwater were collected in four fields rice maize potato and tomato from march to april 2019 2 3 1 soils at each field about four sub soil samples were taken at the top layers of soils 0 20 cm the soil samples were taken using a steel tube with 70 cm of length and 110 mm of diameter the sub samples taken at each field were mixed to create whole samples for analysis totally 10 soil samples were collected in each field the properties of the selected soils which are necessary for simulation are presented in table 1 activity concentration of 226ra in the soil samples was measured by the gamma spectrometry with a high purity germanium hpge detector manufactured by canberra industries inc the detailed procedure of 226ra analysis for soil samples was described in huynh et al 2019 solid liquid partition coefficient kd and organic carbon water partition coefficient koc of 226ra which expresses the distribution of 226ra between different phases of soil are available in some literatures us epa 1999 iaea 2010 according to the literatures the kd value of 2 5 103 l kg 1 and koc of 1 2 103 l kg 1 was used for simulation 2 3 2 fertilizers the activity concentrations of 226ra in some inorganic fertilizers n p k dap and npk 16 16 8 which are applied to the investigated fields were measured by an alpha spectrometer ortec equipped with passivated implanted planar silicon pips detectors the procedure of 226ra analysis method for fertilizers was discussed in the previous study nguyen et al 2018 totally 4 samples of npk 3 samples of dap 1 sample of n 3 samples of p and 1 sample of k fertilizers were collected in the study area 2 3 3 plants five samples including all parts of the plants were collected from each field at the harvest time in total five plant samples were collected in each field at the laboratory the samples of plants were dried at 105 c to constant weight then ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 8 h the ashed samples were then placed in the plastic cylinder beakers and sealed off for at least 30 days at room temperature before proceeding to the measurement the samples were measured by the gamma spectrometer with the p type hpge detector gc3520 manufactured by canberra inc the procedure for 226ra analysis in plant samples was discussed in huynh et al 2019 2 3 4 irrigation water a total of 60 groundwater samples were collected from 60 wells in the study area the sampling points were shown in fig 2 in the map the red icons present the locations of bored wells while the yellow icons present the locations of drilled wells the samples that are usually used to irrigate for each field are presented in table 1 groundwater was taken from the wells at about 30 cm below the water surface 226ra activity concentration in the groundwater was measured by an alpha spectrometer used pips detectors manufactured by ortec industries inc the analytical procedure was discussed in the previous publications le et al 2010 2011 nguyen et al 2018 2 4 model descriptions to predict the long term change of 226ra activity concentration in the maize soil many models were used however some input parameters must be validated and calibrated jarvis and larsbo 2012 nguyen et al 2019a 2019b moreover the prediction based on the results of at least two models and on the match of their results is recommended efsa 2004 in this study we used two models cemc soil model and hydrus 1d model to simulate the fate of 226ra in the topsoil the results based on two models were compared with the results derived from the experiment according to the comparison we found the best model that can be further applied to such studies the cemc soil model gives a simple assessment of the relative potential for degradation reaction and leaching of a chemical applied to a surface soil cemc 2004 this model was based on the fugacity approach which was introduced and detailed described in mackay and stiver 1991 and mackay 2001 fig 3 briefly describes the behaviours of a chemical in a surface soil layer based on the cemc soil model for 226ra simulation the specific physicochemical parameter such as water solubility vapour pressure organic carbon water partition coefficient koc mineral matter water partition coefficient kmw and radioactive half life were used the partition coefficients of 226ra are available in some literatures iaea 2010 us epa 1999 because radium does not vaporise at soil temperatures its vapour pressure is based on the equivalence approach application of this approach for cemc models was described in detail in some previous studies diamond et al 1990 mackay and diamond 1989 mackay et al 2014 in which the fugacity capacity of chemical in water zw is aquivalence value and it equal to 1 the z values of other phases are obtained by multiplying zw with the corresponding dimensionless partition coefficient and equals the partition coefficient since zw is 1 the aquivalence approach was used for the cemc models to simulate the fates of metals such as cu ni and hg tong et al 2014 woodfine et al 2000 diamond et al 2000 liu et al 2017 for radionuclides the combination of the fugacity approach and the aquivalence approach was applied to describe the fates of 137cs in the topsoil in our previous studies nguyen et al 2019a 2019b 226ra and 210pb in the aquatic ecosystems torres et al 2017 2018 results of the model gives the removals of 226ra due to volatilization dl leaching dl and degradation dr from the topsoil these rates are used further for estimation of long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fig 1 the hydrus 1d program is well known as a finite element model for predicting the one dimensional movement of heat water and multiple solutes in variably saturated media simunek et al 2008 it is a famous model for simulating the fate and transport of chemicals in agroecosystems as for the cemc soil model the important physicochemical parameters of 226ra in soil are used for the model input however koc and kmw partition coefficients were replaced by the solid liquid partition coefficient kd the hydrus 1d model did not calculate the volatilization rate and radioactive decay rate of 226ra the decay rate was calculated by the radioactive half life of 226ra the removals due to radioactive decay and leaching are used further for estimation of long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fig 1 hydrus 1d is one of the chemical fate models that are used effectively to simulate water flow in agricultural soils with different crops and irrigation systems kandelous et al 2012 ramos et al 2012 siyal et al 2012 in this study the removal of 226ra due to uptake of plants was not included in the simulations using hydrus 1d free drainage conditions were imposed at the bottom of the topsoil 2 5 predict long term change of 226ra in the topsoil in order to predict 226ra accumulation in the topsoil based on theoretical estimation an exponential equation was proposed as eq 1 1 c a b l v l l l d l u c 0 1 e l v l l l d l u t where c bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil at the time of t days c0 bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of 226ra which is available in the topsoil at the beginning a bq d 1 is the daily input of 226ra due to water irrigation b bq d 1 is the daily input of 226ra due to fertilization the input of 226ra due to fine dust pollution was negligible because 226ra cannot be detected in our routine investigations in the study area lv ll ld and lu are the partitions of 226ra lost by processes of volatilization leaching radioactive decay and plant uptake respectively other minor factors such as soil erosion excavation drainage and earthworms that contribute to the total removal of 226ra in the topsoil were excluded from the models because they were negligible 2 6 model validation for model validation three seasons of maize were taken place at the experimental field from january 2019 to december 2019 to investigate the difference in activity concentration of 226ra in the considered maize soil an average 226ra input rate of 10 bq d 1 was applied to the area 100 100 cm activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm was measured at the end of every season one year accumulation of 226ra in the experimental field was compared with the results based on the models 3 results and discussion 3 1 226ra concentration table 2 summarizes the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoil samples which were collected in four fields in the study area these values are lower than the global average value reported by the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation unscear unscear 2008 in this report the activity concentrations of 226ra in topsoils ranged from 17 to 60 bq kg 1 with the average value of 30 bq kg 1 unscear 2008 the average values of 226ra concentrations are within the range found in previous surveys of many topsoils in vietnam vu et al 2019 huynh et al 2018 truong et al 2018b huy et al 2012 according to these literatures our average values of 226ra concentrations are within their ranges results of 226ra concentrations in plants table 2 were based on the experimental method discussed in section 2 2 3 the variability was contributed by 1 the statistical variability of the method relevance to measurement time counts and accuracy of the spectroscopy and 2 the standard deviation of the values according to icrp 2012 annual effective dose due to ingestion of these food crops in 3 msv y 1 was based on the activity concentration of 226ra table 2 and the dcfra 226 in sv bq 1 the doses due to ingestion of rice grain maize grain potato tuber and tomato fruit were found much lower than the global average value of 0 3 msv y 1 which was due to ingestion of food and drinking water released by unscear unscear 2008 226ra concentrations in fertilizers were measured by the method discussed in section 2 2 3 high concentrations of 226ra activity were found in some phosphate fertilizers they were 150 5 19 4 85 4 10 8 68 7 9 2 bq kg 1 in p npk 16 16 8 and dap respectively 226ra was not detected in n and k fertilizers table s1 presents the activity concentrations of 226ra in 60 groundwater samples collected in the study area fig 4 summaries the ranges of concentrations in four groundwater groups that are applied for the study area the mean values of 16 2 68 4 9 3 1 2 and 23 2 m bq l 1 were found in rice maize potato and tomato fields respectively the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater samples are within the ranges found in groundwater in some countries reported by unscear unscear 2000 but significantly lower than the average values found in some regions with high natural radiation such as karnataka state india shivakumara et al 2014 finland vesterbacka et al 2006 iran elham et al 2014 paraná state brazil janine et al 2014 são paulo state brazil fábio and fernando 2006 yemen assalamia alhomira and dempt abdallah et al 2013 and sweden isam salih et al 2002 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has recommended that the activity concentration of 226ra in drinking water must not exceed 185 m bq l 1 us epa 2000 according to that all groundwater samples have 226ra levels lower than the limitation value recommended by the us epa 3 2 inputs of 226ra in soils table 3 shows the inputs of 226ra estimated for rice maize potato and tomato soils the application of inorganic fertilizers which contain various levels of 226ra caused a significant increase of 226ra in the soils as a result of fertilization practices discussed in table 1 the inputs of 0 027 0 081 0 049 and 0 114 bq m2 d 1 were estimated for rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively there is a positive correlation predicted between the content of phosphate p in applied fertilizers and the inputs of 226ra in the soils it is due to the high activity levels of 226ra in phosphate fertilizers this correlation was demonstrated by many previous studies uosif et al 2014 barisic et al 1992 hegedus et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 schnug and haneklaus 2015 since the differences in 226ra content in fertilizers and in the agricultural practices the inputs of 226ra are different between four soils and between previous works and this study schipper et al 2011 had observed the accumulation rate of uranium in the new zealand pasture soils due to the application of superphosphate fertilizer the accumulation rate of uranium in the topsoils had observed in the experimental fields where different rates of p fertilizer had been applied annually to sheep grazed pasture from 1983 to 2006 they found that an annual application of fertilizer at 50 kg p ha 1 was estimated to result in an annual rate of 226ra accumulation of 0 5 bq kg 1 y 1 0 356 bq m 2 d 1 pearson et al 2019 found activity concentrations for 226ra of up to 1 6 kbq kg 1 in phosphate containing fertilizers used in new zealand with the annual application rate of fertilizers of 50 kg ha 1 y 1 the accumulation rate in agricultural soils can reach 80 kbq ha 1 y 1 0 022 bq m 2 d 1 an investigation carried out in agricultural soils in germany showed that about 14 000 tons of u were applied by phosphate containing fertilizers from 1951 to 2013 this equals a cumulative load of 1 kg ha 1 u to agricultural soils they estimated that the accumulation rate of about 0 052 bq m 2 d 1 226ra in the soils schnug and haneklaus 2015 in some agricultural soils in switzerland inputs of u through mineral p fertilizers were mostly between 10 and 120 g ha 1 y 1 it was equivalent to an accumulation rate of about 226ra between 0 034 and 0 406 bq m 2 d 1 bigalke et al 2017 the input values of 226ra due to fertilization table 3 are within the range found in pearson et al 2019 schnug and haneklaus 2015 and bigalke et al 2017 but lower than the value found in schipper et al 2011 the inputs of 226ra due to irrigation were 0 8 2 37 0 19 0 45 bq m2 d 1 in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the highest rate was predicted in the maize soil as a result of the highest activity of 226ra found in irrigation water that was applied to field b although many factors are responsible for the increase of 226ra in the soils irrigation is the most important factor it contributes 96 74 96 69 79 50 and 79 79 to the total inputs of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the results predict that irrigation water is the major source of 226ra in agricultural soils in this study however this has not been focused on by previous research pearson et al 2019 bigalke et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 our results agree with results of li et al 2018 on the accumulation characteristics of elements e g p k ca mg fe cu and zn due to fertilization and irrigation practices 3 3 removals of 226ra in topsoils the fertilization and the irrigation add an amount of 226ra to the soils as discussed in the previous section most of previous studies estimated the accumulations of elements based on the bulk densities of the soil samples and assuming that the added elements remained in the topsoil nguyen et al 2018 bigalke et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 hegedus et al 2017 however the added 226ra may enter the deeper strata during the leaching to the deeper parts of the soil by the groundwater akyil et al 2008 moreover plants may change the 226ra level in the root zone through root uptake iaea 2010 asaduzzaman et al 2014 iaea 1990 the removals of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato soils due to various processes can be seen in table 4 the radioactive decay rates were based on the physical half life t1 2 1602 years of 226ra the plant uptake rates were based on the activity concentrations of 226ra in plants and their cultivation yields the leaching rates and the volatilization rates were estimated by the models as discussed in the previous section based on the cemc soil model the total removals of 226ra are 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m2 d 1 for in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively they are 0 173 0 247 0 304 and 0 142 bq m2 d 1 based on the hydrus 1d model fig 5 shows that leaching and plant uptake are two main processes that make a potential decrease of 226ra activity concentration in the topsoil radioactive decay and volatilization rates contribute insignificantly to the total removals of 226ra in the topsoils the leaching rates based on the cemc soil model contribute 63 23 47 99 48 17 and 91 59 to total removals found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively some researches indicated that irrigation was the most important factor that potentially influenced on leaching water and on the mitigation of the toxic elements in the topsoil layer of the agroecosystem chen et al 2013 li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the fractions of 226ra leached from the topsoils at 5 years are estimated from 2 56 10 2 rice to 3 76 10 2 maize these values are above the range of 5 10 5 5 10 3 found in uncultivated soils in ontario nathwani and phillips 1978 the comparison shows that agricultural practices potentially increase the leaching rate of 226ra in the topsoil iaea 2014 there is a little difference found between the leaching rates which are obtained by the cemc soil model and hydrus 1d fig 6 indeed it is normally found in some literatures that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 in general the leaching rates predicted by the cemc soil model are slightly lower than the corresponding rates predicted by the hydrus 1d model the uptake rates contribute 32 29 49 18 46 12 and 2 62 to total removals found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively 3 4 long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fertilizers and groundwater applications due to rice maize potato and tomato cultivations increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in the considered soils on the other hand radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake are processes that reduce the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoils therefore the question is whether they increase or decrease the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoils and how much the accumulation rates in the case of increase are for this purpose the long term change of 226ra in the topsoil was predicted by eq 1 the results are shown in fig 7 long term agricultural practices irrigation and fertilization cause an accumulation of 226ra in rice maize and tomato topsoils while they mitigate the activity concentration of 226ra in potato topsoil the accumulation rates in which mitigation factors are considered are 224 791 and 115 bq m 2 y 1 in rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively therefore the mitigation factors including radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake reduce amount of 48 5 89 6 65 3 and 89 8 bq m 2 y 1 on the total accumulation rates of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively due to high 226ra intake rate of potato markose et al 1993 the activity of 226ra is almost unchanged in the potato topsoil we estimated that 25 years of agricultural practices can increase 5147 17277 and 2711 bq m 2 of 226ra in rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively in contrast they decrease 197 bq m 2 of 226ra in the potato topsoils taylor 2007 had studied on the annual 226ra accumulation rates in four types of agricultural soils in new zealand the rates were reported as ranging between 0 2 0 6 bq kg 1 y 1 52 156 bq m 2 y 1 this result was assessed by comparing samples collected and archived in 1992 with soil samples collected and archived 36 43 years previously taylor 2007 another study carried out on the topsoil samples 0 7 5 cm depth in the period from 1952 to 1958 found no significant difference in concentrations of uranium mcdowell 2012 for the maize field we predicted the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm increased 1198 2390 and 3580 bq m 2 after one two and three seasons respectively the same results were predicted by the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model fig 8 for the experimental field these values were 1092 4 2 bq kg 1 1950 7 5 bq kg 1 and 3250 12 5 bq kg 1 the comparison in fig 8 shows that the modelled values fit the experimental values well however the experimental values are lower than the modelled values because some physical chemical processes are not taken into account by the models the results based on the models have some limitations there is assumed that no rotation of crops and the same agricultural practices are undertaken year after year in the fields however the method can be extended to the fields with crop rotation or different agricultural practices the highest long term accumulation of 226ra predicted for the maize soil is explained in a limited way because the historical accumulation rates of 226ra in the investigated soils are not available in the topsoil the total radiation dose is contributed not only by 226ra but also by many different radionuclides unscear 2000 therefore there is no recommended level for the 226ra activity in the topsoil in some literatures the world s average value 30 bq kg 1 was assumed as the limitation of 226ra activity in the topsoil who 2011 pearson et al 2019 vu et al 2019 belyaeva et al 2019 huynh et al 2019 following that the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil which exceeds the value of 30 bq kg 1 can be considered of concern for public health in this study we estimate that the activity concentration of 226ra reaches this value at 5 8 0 56 and 10 years of agricultural practices on rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively fig 7 another important result is the annual input levels of 226ra necessary to maintain the constant activity concentrations of 226ra in the agricultural topsoils we found that these values were 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m 2 d 1 equivalent to 0 203 0 331 0 382 and 0 176 bq kg 1 y 1 in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively pearson et al 2019 studied the contamination status of 226ra agricultural soils in new zealand they found that the annual loading necessary to remain the recent activity concentration of 226ra in agricultural soils in the study area was approximately 0 58 bq kg 1 y 1 this value is higher than our values finally under the recent agricultural practices we found that the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater which are higher than 13 64 44 2 10 14 8 86 m bq l 1 can increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively the results show that groundwater sources with high 226ra concentrations cause the high accumulation rate of 226ra in the soils the study proposes two ways to obtain a lower load of 226ra in the topsoil 1 using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low 226ra concentrations and 2 applying surface water or accumulated rainwater other water sources such as surface water e g lakes and rivers and rainwater with low concentration of 226ra are recommended for the irrigation system in the study area besides that 226ra testing in groundwater is important before setting irrigation plans due to the high accumulation rate of 226ra predicted for the maize soil crop rotation is proposed to apply for this soil to reduce the long term 226ra accumulation 4 conclusion groundwater contains radioactive elements that are potentially hazardous to humans and the environment many studies found that 226ra contaminates in groundwater with high levels but the effects of 226ra in groundwater to agroecosystem were negligible in this study we predict that the present status of irrigation and fertilization can increases levels of 226ra in some agricultural soils in vietnam moreover the irrigation practices with groundwater contribute a major fraction to the input of 226ra in the topsoil based on model prediction many factors that control the removal of 226ra in the topsoil has been discussed most of them were assessed by models a slight difference was found between the leaching rates based on the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model however the difference caused insignificant effects on the accumulation rates and long term variations of 226ra in the topsoils based on model assessments we predict that long term agricultural practices can increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in some topsoils e g rice maize and tomato soils and cause a potential risk due to 226ra accumulation the inputs however can be controlled by the 226ra input activity which is injected by fertilizers and irrigation water based on the model assessments we propose some potential management techniques to mitigate the 226ra buildup such as using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low 226ra concentrations using surface water instead of groundwater planting

10379,groundwater and inorganic fertilizers are regularly applied to agricultural soils but their 226ra content is potentially hazardous to human health and the environment due to irrigation and fertilization processes 226ra can accumulate in topsoils and might also leach to subsoils groundwater and surface water however there are few studies on the accumulation of radium in the agricultural soils due to irrigation with groundwater in this work we analysed the radium content in 60 groundwater samples collected from a coastal area of phu yen province vietnam where groundwater is regularly used for irrigation practices long term accumulation of 226ra in agricultural topsoils due to irrigation with groundwater was modelled for rice maize potato and tomato topsoils the fate of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm was studied by using the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model we found that the total inputs of 226ra were 0 83 2 45 0 24 and 0 57 bq m 2 d 1 for rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the total removals were 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m 2 d 1 found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively a simple formula was developed to calculate the accumulation rate of 226ra in the topsoil using this model we predict that the activity concentration of 226ra will increase in rice maize and tomato soil but will remain almost unchanged in potato soils the accumulation rates 226ra were 224 791 and 115 bq m 2 y 1 after 25 years of agricultural practices the total activity values of 226ra that accumulate in rice maize and tomato soils can reach 5147 17278 and 2711 bq m 2 respectively we found the good agreements in the results based on two models the irrigation practices with groundwater samples contribute 96 7 79 5 and 79 8 of 226ra to the accumulation rates of 226ra in rice maize and tomato soils respectively keywords 226ra radioisotope norm agricultural soil chemical fate model 1 introduction naturally occurring radioactive materials norm are part of the earth the major radionuclides in norm are from primordial radionuclides which are long lived radionuclides such as 238u 235u 232th and 40k and any of their decay products such as 226ra and 222rn ojovan et al 2019 other radionuclides in norm can be from nuclear reactors e g 235u and 238u and from cosmogenic radionuclides e g 7be 14c and 3h in the beginning primordial radionuclides e g 238u 235u and 232th series have formed in soils and rocks from soil rock systems they move to other parts of the environment such as groundwater surface water air and plants in which they strongly affect the human health by their decays among primordial radionuclides four radium radionuclides 226ra 228ra 223ra and 225ra of the uranium and thorium decay series are of great concern in environmental assessments they are the most dangerous natural radionuclides because they decay to radon and a number of other daughter radionuclides moreover radium is easily incorporated into the bones of mammals due to its chemical and biological similarity to those of other alkaline earth metals ca sr and ba and may cause a potential radiation dose to the public jia et al 2007 although radium radionuclides commonly occur in both soil and water environments 228ra 223ra and 225ra have not been focused on by many researchers due to their low abundances in comparison with that of 226ra iaea 2014 jia and jia 2012 226ra has a long half life of 1602 years and together with its decay products is responsible for a major fraction of the internal dose received by humans from norm icrp 2012 unscear 2008 in soils the activity concentrations of 226ra are in a wide range and strongly affected by many factors such as the soil type chemical physical properties of the soil soil depth and some human activities iaea 2010 the current worldwide average value of 226ra activity concentration in topsoils is 30 bq kg 1 the highest value 1000 bq kg 1 was found in sweden unscear 2008 minell 1983 in vietnam huy et al 2012 found the activity concentrations of 226ra are from 15 02 121 58 bq kg 1 with the average value of 42 77 bq kg 1 in 64 agricultural soils huynh et al 2018 found the activity concentrations of 226ra are from 25 to 193 bq kg 1 with the average value of 60 bq kg 1 in highland soils with natural forests in ninh thuan province another study found the activity concentrations of 226ra from 15 to 47 bq kg 1 with the average value of 24 bq kg 1 in ho chi minh city where no plants are cultivated vu et al 2019 in a specific soil the activity concentration of 226ra is varied between soil components particularly the activity concentration of 226ra in organic matter is higher than it in clay matter because the sorption of radium on organic matter is about 10 times higher than on clay simon and ibrahim 1990 226ra is strongly absorbed by metal hydroxides and humic substances bordelet et al 2013 sajih et al 2014 in agricultural soils the migration of radium caused by plant uptake and convective transport by flowing water strongly depends on the absorption desorption process associated with the surface reactivity of the solid phase in contact with the soil solution which is described by means of the distribution coefficient kd l kg 1 kd values for specific radionuclides are commonly obtained from field and laboratory studies vandenhove and van hees 2007 the kd values were classified on the basic properties of four main soil groups sand loam clay and organic defined according to the sand and clay mineral percentages referred to as the mineral matter and the organic matter content in the soil iaea trs 472 presented kd values for selected radionuclides in soils grouped according to the texture organic matter criteria iaea 2010 according to that average values of kd are 1 9 103 3 8 104 1 3 103 and 2 5 103 l kg 1 for sandy loam clay organic soil groups respectively inorganic fertilizers which are made from phosphate ores can contain high levels of 238u and its decay products 226ra is one of the 238u decay products that most of studies on the environmental radioactivity focus on 228ra from the 232th decay series may also be present but at lower activity concentrations alam et al 1997 ioannides et al 1997 uosif et al 2014 el bahi et al 2017 truong et al 2018a and nguyen et al 2018 determined activity concentrations of natural radionuclides 40k 238u 232th and 226ra in many types of chemical fertilizer in vietnam the activity concentrations of 226ra were significant in many fertilizer samples they were found in a wide range of 0 150 5 bq kg 1 the highest concentration was reported in phosphate fertilizers with a significant amount of 226ra in fertilizers agricultural practices in the study area can cause an accumulation of 226ra in the topsoils water demand for irrigated crops can be from different sources such as surface water available in rivers lakes and springs and groundwater vörösmarty et al 2005 in these water sources natural radionuclides contaminate with various levels akyil et al 2009 alkhomashi et al 2016 özmen et al 2004 the activity levels of natural radionuclides were found at the hazardous levels in many groundwater samples in the world janine et al 2014 abdallah et al 2013 isam salih et al 2002 in groundwater 226ra was found in the range of 1190 6550 m bq l 1 in yemen and 500 6800 m bq l 1 in brazil abdallah et al 2013 janine et al 2014 in vietnam le et al 2015 found that the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater in ho chi minh city were from 80 to 540 m bq l 1 as a result of the contamination of 226ra in irrigation water sources especially groundwater the irrigation practices can cause an accumulation of 226ra in the agricultural soils however there was no study that concerned about this topic long term accumulation of heavy metals due to agricultural practices was investigated in different soils in many regions around the world zhang et al 2003 kwon et al 2014 chen et al 2013 yang et al 2018 research on radionuclides has largely focused on uranium and artificial radionuclides from nuclear fallout e g 137cs 90sr and 239pu bigalke et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019a b schnug and haneklaus 2015 schipper et al 2011 corcho alvarado et al 2016 there was no such research focused on radium radionuclides e g 226ra 228ra 223ra and 225ra moreover the work findings and the decision makers of these studies are difficult to use for other studies elsewhere given the differences in historic metal inputs physicochemical properties of the soil pedological conditions of the soils agricultural practices and climate changes santos et al 2013 shi et al 2018 for convenience several models have been developed for assessment of the transfer of metals from the topsoil to subsoil and other environments these chemical fate models are extensive economic and efficient tools to predict the fate of metals in addition to field and laboratory data liu et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 mallmann et al 2014 santos et al 2013 qian et al 2018 some models were successfully validated to simulate behaviours of radionuclides in various environments jacques et al 2008 torres et al 2017 2018 nguyen et al 2019a b merk 2012 modelling behaviours of radionuclides is a possible way to assess the long term changes of radionuclides in the topsoils and to determine the contributions of natural and artificial factors to the inputs removals of radionuclides to the total rates of radionuclides in the topsoils in this work we used the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc soil model combined with the equivalence approach and the hydrus 1d model to simulate the behaviours of 226ra in the topsoils and to predict the long term changes of 226ra activity concentrations in different agricultural soils under distinctly different long term land use mackay and stiver 1991 mackay 2001 simunek et al 2008 our findings are of potential use for decision makers not only in the study area but also elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 method overview the summary of the method is shown in fig 1 in this study we aim to estimate the long term change of 226ra activity concentration in the agricultural soil four agricultural topsoils with different agricultural practices including rice oryza sativa maize zea mays potato solanum tuberosum and tomato solanum lycopersicum were investigated the accumulation rate of 226ra in the topsoil was contributed to by two terms the input of 226ra due to processes of fertilization and irrigation the removal of 226ra due to processes of radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake some models were validated to simulate the fate of 226ra in the topsoil and the removal of 226ra was based on the model assessments finally we found a mathematic formula to predict the long term change of 226ra activity in the topsoil the formula included many factors e g activity concentrations inputs and removals which were determined by experimental measurements and model assessments 2 2 site description the study was taken place at lowland paddy fields of tuy an district which are located in phu yen province a south central coast of vietnam fig 2 the climate of the area locates in the tropical zone with a high rate of rainfall and high humidity the topography of the province consists of 70 of high region in the west and 30 of the fertile plain in the east the study area locates nearby the east sea the landscape could be divided into two regions based on their topographic 1 a swamp region located in the east of an my district and near the east sea and 2 a hilly region located in the west of an my district da rang river is the largest river flowing across phu yen province while song hinh lake is a large artificial lake is located in the southwest of the province these rivers supply water for agricultural irrigation and other human activities besides that groundwater is a water source for drinking and agricultural irrigation in the study area the main soil of the area is the sandy soil it has renovated for many years to be adaptable for different crops one of the methods is the application of organic fertilizers it causes the high content of organic matter in the topsoil four fields with different agricultural practices were investigated the cultivation characteristics are presented in detail in table 1 there is a single crop grown in each field and no crop rotation applied to maintain the high yield of crops many inorganic fertilizers e g n urea p 0 46 0 k kcl dap 18 46 0 and a blended fertilizer made up of ingredients containing nitrogen phosphate and potash 16 16 8 were applied to the agricultural sites but often contain a significant concentration of 226ra nguyen et al 2018 truong et al 2018a in the study area the main water source that is used for irrigation systems is groundwater the high levels of 226ra were found in groundwater in many regions of the world janine et al 2014 abdallah et al 2013 isam salih et al 2002 and in vietnam le et al 2015 however such data is not available in this study area one of the factors contributing to the input of 226ra in the agricultural soils is the fine dust pollution but it was not considered in the study as 226ra was not be detected in our routine investigations around the study area 2 3 collection of data table 1 summaries the collected data necessary for this study the samples of plants soils fertilizers and groundwater were collected in four fields rice maize potato and tomato from march to april 2019 2 3 1 soils at each field about four sub soil samples were taken at the top layers of soils 0 20 cm the soil samples were taken using a steel tube with 70 cm of length and 110 mm of diameter the sub samples taken at each field were mixed to create whole samples for analysis totally 10 soil samples were collected in each field the properties of the selected soils which are necessary for simulation are presented in table 1 activity concentration of 226ra in the soil samples was measured by the gamma spectrometry with a high purity germanium hpge detector manufactured by canberra industries inc the detailed procedure of 226ra analysis for soil samples was described in huynh et al 2019 solid liquid partition coefficient kd and organic carbon water partition coefficient koc of 226ra which expresses the distribution of 226ra between different phases of soil are available in some literatures us epa 1999 iaea 2010 according to the literatures the kd value of 2 5 103 l kg 1 and koc of 1 2 103 l kg 1 was used for simulation 2 3 2 fertilizers the activity concentrations of 226ra in some inorganic fertilizers n p k dap and npk 16 16 8 which are applied to the investigated fields were measured by an alpha spectrometer ortec equipped with passivated implanted planar silicon pips detectors the procedure of 226ra analysis method for fertilizers was discussed in the previous study nguyen et al 2018 totally 4 samples of npk 3 samples of dap 1 sample of n 3 samples of p and 1 sample of k fertilizers were collected in the study area 2 3 3 plants five samples including all parts of the plants were collected from each field at the harvest time in total five plant samples were collected in each field at the laboratory the samples of plants were dried at 105 c to constant weight then ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 8 h the ashed samples were then placed in the plastic cylinder beakers and sealed off for at least 30 days at room temperature before proceeding to the measurement the samples were measured by the gamma spectrometer with the p type hpge detector gc3520 manufactured by canberra inc the procedure for 226ra analysis in plant samples was discussed in huynh et al 2019 2 3 4 irrigation water a total of 60 groundwater samples were collected from 60 wells in the study area the sampling points were shown in fig 2 in the map the red icons present the locations of bored wells while the yellow icons present the locations of drilled wells the samples that are usually used to irrigate for each field are presented in table 1 groundwater was taken from the wells at about 30 cm below the water surface 226ra activity concentration in the groundwater was measured by an alpha spectrometer used pips detectors manufactured by ortec industries inc the analytical procedure was discussed in the previous publications le et al 2010 2011 nguyen et al 2018 2 4 model descriptions to predict the long term change of 226ra activity concentration in the maize soil many models were used however some input parameters must be validated and calibrated jarvis and larsbo 2012 nguyen et al 2019a 2019b moreover the prediction based on the results of at least two models and on the match of their results is recommended efsa 2004 in this study we used two models cemc soil model and hydrus 1d model to simulate the fate of 226ra in the topsoil the results based on two models were compared with the results derived from the experiment according to the comparison we found the best model that can be further applied to such studies the cemc soil model gives a simple assessment of the relative potential for degradation reaction and leaching of a chemical applied to a surface soil cemc 2004 this model was based on the fugacity approach which was introduced and detailed described in mackay and stiver 1991 and mackay 2001 fig 3 briefly describes the behaviours of a chemical in a surface soil layer based on the cemc soil model for 226ra simulation the specific physicochemical parameter such as water solubility vapour pressure organic carbon water partition coefficient koc mineral matter water partition coefficient kmw and radioactive half life were used the partition coefficients of 226ra are available in some literatures iaea 2010 us epa 1999 because radium does not vaporise at soil temperatures its vapour pressure is based on the equivalence approach application of this approach for cemc models was described in detail in some previous studies diamond et al 1990 mackay and diamond 1989 mackay et al 2014 in which the fugacity capacity of chemical in water zw is aquivalence value and it equal to 1 the z values of other phases are obtained by multiplying zw with the corresponding dimensionless partition coefficient and equals the partition coefficient since zw is 1 the aquivalence approach was used for the cemc models to simulate the fates of metals such as cu ni and hg tong et al 2014 woodfine et al 2000 diamond et al 2000 liu et al 2017 for radionuclides the combination of the fugacity approach and the aquivalence approach was applied to describe the fates of 137cs in the topsoil in our previous studies nguyen et al 2019a 2019b 226ra and 210pb in the aquatic ecosystems torres et al 2017 2018 results of the model gives the removals of 226ra due to volatilization dl leaching dl and degradation dr from the topsoil these rates are used further for estimation of long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fig 1 the hydrus 1d program is well known as a finite element model for predicting the one dimensional movement of heat water and multiple solutes in variably saturated media simunek et al 2008 it is a famous model for simulating the fate and transport of chemicals in agroecosystems as for the cemc soil model the important physicochemical parameters of 226ra in soil are used for the model input however koc and kmw partition coefficients were replaced by the solid liquid partition coefficient kd the hydrus 1d model did not calculate the volatilization rate and radioactive decay rate of 226ra the decay rate was calculated by the radioactive half life of 226ra the removals due to radioactive decay and leaching are used further for estimation of long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fig 1 hydrus 1d is one of the chemical fate models that are used effectively to simulate water flow in agricultural soils with different crops and irrigation systems kandelous et al 2012 ramos et al 2012 siyal et al 2012 in this study the removal of 226ra due to uptake of plants was not included in the simulations using hydrus 1d free drainage conditions were imposed at the bottom of the topsoil 2 5 predict long term change of 226ra in the topsoil in order to predict 226ra accumulation in the topsoil based on theoretical estimation an exponential equation was proposed as eq 1 1 c a b l v l l l d l u c 0 1 e l v l l l d l u t where c bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil at the time of t days c0 bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of 226ra which is available in the topsoil at the beginning a bq d 1 is the daily input of 226ra due to water irrigation b bq d 1 is the daily input of 226ra due to fertilization the input of 226ra due to fine dust pollution was negligible because 226ra cannot be detected in our routine investigations in the study area lv ll ld and lu are the partitions of 226ra lost by processes of volatilization leaching radioactive decay and plant uptake respectively other minor factors such as soil erosion excavation drainage and earthworms that contribute to the total removal of 226ra in the topsoil were excluded from the models because they were negligible 2 6 model validation for model validation three seasons of maize were taken place at the experimental field from january 2019 to december 2019 to investigate the difference in activity concentration of 226ra in the considered maize soil an average 226ra input rate of 10 bq d 1 was applied to the area 100 100 cm activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm was measured at the end of every season one year accumulation of 226ra in the experimental field was compared with the results based on the models 3 results and discussion 3 1 226ra concentration table 2 summarizes the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoil samples which were collected in four fields in the study area these values are lower than the global average value reported by the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation unscear unscear 2008 in this report the activity concentrations of 226ra in topsoils ranged from 17 to 60 bq kg 1 with the average value of 30 bq kg 1 unscear 2008 the average values of 226ra concentrations are within the range found in previous surveys of many topsoils in vietnam vu et al 2019 huynh et al 2018 truong et al 2018b huy et al 2012 according to these literatures our average values of 226ra concentrations are within their ranges results of 226ra concentrations in plants table 2 were based on the experimental method discussed in section 2 2 3 the variability was contributed by 1 the statistical variability of the method relevance to measurement time counts and accuracy of the spectroscopy and 2 the standard deviation of the values according to icrp 2012 annual effective dose due to ingestion of these food crops in 3 msv y 1 was based on the activity concentration of 226ra table 2 and the dcfra 226 in sv bq 1 the doses due to ingestion of rice grain maize grain potato tuber and tomato fruit were found much lower than the global average value of 0 3 msv y 1 which was due to ingestion of food and drinking water released by unscear unscear 2008 226ra concentrations in fertilizers were measured by the method discussed in section 2 2 3 high concentrations of 226ra activity were found in some phosphate fertilizers they were 150 5 19 4 85 4 10 8 68 7 9 2 bq kg 1 in p npk 16 16 8 and dap respectively 226ra was not detected in n and k fertilizers table s1 presents the activity concentrations of 226ra in 60 groundwater samples collected in the study area fig 4 summaries the ranges of concentrations in four groundwater groups that are applied for the study area the mean values of 16 2 68 4 9 3 1 2 and 23 2 m bq l 1 were found in rice maize potato and tomato fields respectively the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater samples are within the ranges found in groundwater in some countries reported by unscear unscear 2000 but significantly lower than the average values found in some regions with high natural radiation such as karnataka state india shivakumara et al 2014 finland vesterbacka et al 2006 iran elham et al 2014 paraná state brazil janine et al 2014 são paulo state brazil fábio and fernando 2006 yemen assalamia alhomira and dempt abdallah et al 2013 and sweden isam salih et al 2002 the united states environmental protection agency us epa has recommended that the activity concentration of 226ra in drinking water must not exceed 185 m bq l 1 us epa 2000 according to that all groundwater samples have 226ra levels lower than the limitation value recommended by the us epa 3 2 inputs of 226ra in soils table 3 shows the inputs of 226ra estimated for rice maize potato and tomato soils the application of inorganic fertilizers which contain various levels of 226ra caused a significant increase of 226ra in the soils as a result of fertilization practices discussed in table 1 the inputs of 0 027 0 081 0 049 and 0 114 bq m2 d 1 were estimated for rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively there is a positive correlation predicted between the content of phosphate p in applied fertilizers and the inputs of 226ra in the soils it is due to the high activity levels of 226ra in phosphate fertilizers this correlation was demonstrated by many previous studies uosif et al 2014 barisic et al 1992 hegedus et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 schnug and haneklaus 2015 since the differences in 226ra content in fertilizers and in the agricultural practices the inputs of 226ra are different between four soils and between previous works and this study schipper et al 2011 had observed the accumulation rate of uranium in the new zealand pasture soils due to the application of superphosphate fertilizer the accumulation rate of uranium in the topsoils had observed in the experimental fields where different rates of p fertilizer had been applied annually to sheep grazed pasture from 1983 to 2006 they found that an annual application of fertilizer at 50 kg p ha 1 was estimated to result in an annual rate of 226ra accumulation of 0 5 bq kg 1 y 1 0 356 bq m 2 d 1 pearson et al 2019 found activity concentrations for 226ra of up to 1 6 kbq kg 1 in phosphate containing fertilizers used in new zealand with the annual application rate of fertilizers of 50 kg ha 1 y 1 the accumulation rate in agricultural soils can reach 80 kbq ha 1 y 1 0 022 bq m 2 d 1 an investigation carried out in agricultural soils in germany showed that about 14 000 tons of u were applied by phosphate containing fertilizers from 1951 to 2013 this equals a cumulative load of 1 kg ha 1 u to agricultural soils they estimated that the accumulation rate of about 0 052 bq m 2 d 1 226ra in the soils schnug and haneklaus 2015 in some agricultural soils in switzerland inputs of u through mineral p fertilizers were mostly between 10 and 120 g ha 1 y 1 it was equivalent to an accumulation rate of about 226ra between 0 034 and 0 406 bq m 2 d 1 bigalke et al 2017 the input values of 226ra due to fertilization table 3 are within the range found in pearson et al 2019 schnug and haneklaus 2015 and bigalke et al 2017 but lower than the value found in schipper et al 2011 the inputs of 226ra due to irrigation were 0 8 2 37 0 19 0 45 bq m2 d 1 in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the highest rate was predicted in the maize soil as a result of the highest activity of 226ra found in irrigation water that was applied to field b although many factors are responsible for the increase of 226ra in the soils irrigation is the most important factor it contributes 96 74 96 69 79 50 and 79 79 to the total inputs of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively the results predict that irrigation water is the major source of 226ra in agricultural soils in this study however this has not been focused on by previous research pearson et al 2019 bigalke et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 our results agree with results of li et al 2018 on the accumulation characteristics of elements e g p k ca mg fe cu and zn due to fertilization and irrigation practices 3 3 removals of 226ra in topsoils the fertilization and the irrigation add an amount of 226ra to the soils as discussed in the previous section most of previous studies estimated the accumulations of elements based on the bulk densities of the soil samples and assuming that the added elements remained in the topsoil nguyen et al 2018 bigalke et al 2017 schipper et al 2011 hegedus et al 2017 however the added 226ra may enter the deeper strata during the leaching to the deeper parts of the soil by the groundwater akyil et al 2008 moreover plants may change the 226ra level in the root zone through root uptake iaea 2010 asaduzzaman et al 2014 iaea 1990 the removals of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato soils due to various processes can be seen in table 4 the radioactive decay rates were based on the physical half life t1 2 1602 years of 226ra the plant uptake rates were based on the activity concentrations of 226ra in plants and their cultivation yields the leaching rates and the volatilization rates were estimated by the models as discussed in the previous section based on the cemc soil model the total removals of 226ra are 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m2 d 1 for in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively they are 0 173 0 247 0 304 and 0 142 bq m2 d 1 based on the hydrus 1d model fig 5 shows that leaching and plant uptake are two main processes that make a potential decrease of 226ra activity concentration in the topsoil radioactive decay and volatilization rates contribute insignificantly to the total removals of 226ra in the topsoils the leaching rates based on the cemc soil model contribute 63 23 47 99 48 17 and 91 59 to total removals found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively some researches indicated that irrigation was the most important factor that potentially influenced on leaching water and on the mitigation of the toxic elements in the topsoil layer of the agroecosystem chen et al 2013 li et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the fractions of 226ra leached from the topsoils at 5 years are estimated from 2 56 10 2 rice to 3 76 10 2 maize these values are above the range of 5 10 5 5 10 3 found in uncultivated soils in ontario nathwani and phillips 1978 the comparison shows that agricultural practices potentially increase the leaching rate of 226ra in the topsoil iaea 2014 there is a little difference found between the leaching rates which are obtained by the cemc soil model and hydrus 1d fig 6 indeed it is normally found in some literatures that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 in general the leaching rates predicted by the cemc soil model are slightly lower than the corresponding rates predicted by the hydrus 1d model the uptake rates contribute 32 29 49 18 46 12 and 2 62 to total removals found in rice maize potato and tomato soils respectively 3 4 long term change of 226ra in the topsoil fertilizers and groundwater applications due to rice maize potato and tomato cultivations increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in the considered soils on the other hand radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake are processes that reduce the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoils therefore the question is whether they increase or decrease the activity concentrations of 226ra in the topsoils and how much the accumulation rates in the case of increase are for this purpose the long term change of 226ra in the topsoil was predicted by eq 1 the results are shown in fig 7 long term agricultural practices irrigation and fertilization cause an accumulation of 226ra in rice maize and tomato topsoils while they mitigate the activity concentration of 226ra in potato topsoil the accumulation rates in which mitigation factors are considered are 224 791 and 115 bq m 2 y 1 in rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively therefore the mitigation factors including radioactive decay volatilization leaching and plant uptake reduce amount of 48 5 89 6 65 3 and 89 8 bq m 2 y 1 on the total accumulation rates of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively due to high 226ra intake rate of potato markose et al 1993 the activity of 226ra is almost unchanged in the potato topsoil we estimated that 25 years of agricultural practices can increase 5147 17277 and 2711 bq m 2 of 226ra in rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively in contrast they decrease 197 bq m 2 of 226ra in the potato topsoils taylor 2007 had studied on the annual 226ra accumulation rates in four types of agricultural soils in new zealand the rates were reported as ranging between 0 2 0 6 bq kg 1 y 1 52 156 bq m 2 y 1 this result was assessed by comparing samples collected and archived in 1992 with soil samples collected and archived 36 43 years previously taylor 2007 another study carried out on the topsoil samples 0 7 5 cm depth in the period from 1952 to 1958 found no significant difference in concentrations of uranium mcdowell 2012 for the maize field we predicted the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil 0 20 cm increased 1198 2390 and 3580 bq m 2 after one two and three seasons respectively the same results were predicted by the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model fig 8 for the experimental field these values were 1092 4 2 bq kg 1 1950 7 5 bq kg 1 and 3250 12 5 bq kg 1 the comparison in fig 8 shows that the modelled values fit the experimental values well however the experimental values are lower than the modelled values because some physical chemical processes are not taken into account by the models the results based on the models have some limitations there is assumed that no rotation of crops and the same agricultural practices are undertaken year after year in the fields however the method can be extended to the fields with crop rotation or different agricultural practices the highest long term accumulation of 226ra predicted for the maize soil is explained in a limited way because the historical accumulation rates of 226ra in the investigated soils are not available in the topsoil the total radiation dose is contributed not only by 226ra but also by many different radionuclides unscear 2000 therefore there is no recommended level for the 226ra activity in the topsoil in some literatures the world s average value 30 bq kg 1 was assumed as the limitation of 226ra activity in the topsoil who 2011 pearson et al 2019 vu et al 2019 belyaeva et al 2019 huynh et al 2019 following that the activity concentration of 226ra in the topsoil which exceeds the value of 30 bq kg 1 can be considered of concern for public health in this study we estimate that the activity concentration of 226ra reaches this value at 5 8 0 56 and 10 years of agricultural practices on rice maize and tomato topsoils respectively fig 7 another important result is the annual input levels of 226ra necessary to maintain the constant activity concentrations of 226ra in the agricultural topsoils we found that these values were 0 145 0 236 0 272 and 0 125 bq m 2 d 1 equivalent to 0 203 0 331 0 382 and 0 176 bq kg 1 y 1 in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively pearson et al 2019 studied the contamination status of 226ra agricultural soils in new zealand they found that the annual loading necessary to remain the recent activity concentration of 226ra in agricultural soils in the study area was approximately 0 58 bq kg 1 y 1 this value is higher than our values finally under the recent agricultural practices we found that the activity concentrations of 226ra in groundwater which are higher than 13 64 44 2 10 14 8 86 m bq l 1 can increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in rice maize potato and tomato topsoils respectively the results show that groundwater sources with high 226ra concentrations cause the high accumulation rate of 226ra in the soils the study proposes two ways to obtain a lower load of 226ra in the topsoil 1 using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low 226ra concentrations and 2 applying surface water or accumulated rainwater other water sources such as surface water e g lakes and rivers and rainwater with low concentration of 226ra are recommended for the irrigation system in the study area besides that 226ra testing in groundwater is important before setting irrigation plans due to the high accumulation rate of 226ra predicted for the maize soil crop rotation is proposed to apply for this soil to reduce the long term 226ra accumulation 4 conclusion groundwater contains radioactive elements that are potentially hazardous to humans and the environment many studies found that 226ra contaminates in groundwater with high levels but the effects of 226ra in groundwater to agroecosystem were negligible in this study we predict that the present status of irrigation and fertilization can increases levels of 226ra in some agricultural soils in vietnam moreover the irrigation practices with groundwater contribute a major fraction to the input of 226ra in the topsoil based on model prediction many factors that control the removal of 226ra in the topsoil has been discussed most of them were assessed by models a slight difference was found between the leaching rates based on the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model however the difference caused insignificant effects on the accumulation rates and long term variations of 226ra in the topsoils based on model assessments we predict that long term agricultural practices can increase the activity concentrations of 226ra in some topsoils e g rice maize and tomato soils and cause a potential risk due to 226ra accumulation the inputs however can be controlled by the 226ra input activity which is injected by fertilizers and irrigation water based on the model assessments we propose some potential management techniques to mitigate the 226ra buildup such as using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low 226ra concentrations using surface water instead of groundwater planting
