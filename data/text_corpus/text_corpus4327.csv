21635,currently the division of encounter situations and collision avoidance decisions both depend on the individual subjective judgment of officers under conditions of extraordinary complexity and randomness ambiguities and contradictions are present among the existing quantifications of azimuth division from the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs radar collision avoidance diagrams and expert questionnaire results at present there is no unified and practical division model for the variety of azimuth divisions encountered by ships with the development of intelligent ship technology the realization of maritime autonomous surface ships is possible however more obscure problems must be accurately defined moreover the requirements for an accurate division of the ship encounter situation in maritime accident analysis are becoming more intense additional requirements have been imposed on the division of azimuth and ship encounters have been quantified into multiple features for machine learning in this study automatic identification system data near zhoushan port were used to reproduce the relative motion process of ships and extract the meeting position of the ship and the corresponding actual avoidance behavior by combining the requirements for the light range in colregs and support vector classification to supervise and learn the actual meeting data a map of the ship encounter azimuth division was constructed the map can serve as an accurate numerical basis for the division of marine encounter situations maritime accident responsibility division and intelligent ship collision avoidance decisions keywords encounter azimuth map ais data svc classification 1 introduction maritime and agency 2019 navigational casualties represent the majority 54 4 of maritime casualty events followed by collisions 26 2 fig 1 ship collisions have always accounted for a large proportion of marine accidents thus research on intelligent ship collision avoidance is vital from a total of 4104 accident events analyzed during the investigations 65 8 were attributed to the human action category fig 2 among the categories shown in fig 2 human action which includes artificial inaccurate judgment of the situation fuzzy judgments inconsistent judgment basis and uncoordinated actions caused more than half of the accidents the resulting evasive actions taken were unreasonable eventually leading to accidents because of the widespread application of automatic identification system ais equipment it has become much easier to collect ship information that could not be obtained by other means in the past including the common practices of the crew of the ship psychological preferences and actual crew implementation under the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs the introduction of big data mining methods has provided new approaches and new thinking for the division of the ship encounter azimuth map currently there are two quantification sources for the ship encounter azimuth map 1 the radar collision avoidance steering diagram is mainly used to provide guidance to the ship s pilot when a target ship is detected solely by the radar and the officer cannot see the target ship jones 1971 1974 liu et al 2004 portion angle division 30 90 150 210 292 5 330 fig 3 the radar collision avoidance steering diagram was proposed by the british nautical society in 1970 among them 292 5 is 22 5 ahead of the horizontal and the remaining angle values are the six equal limit of 360 2 the colregs define the azimuth of the target ship 5 112 5 247 5 355 fig 4 the conclusion based solely on the collision avoidance rule can only distinguish the three encounter modes of head on crossing and overtaking but cannot further divide the azimuth of the collision avoidance action combining figs 3 and 4 to form fig 5 where the question marks in fig 5 mean that this research confirms that the dividing boundary to be studied is 000 030 210 292 5 and whether this represents the dividing line of the opposite operation of the collision avoidance behavior at sea the yellow arrows denote the direction of the ship s steering for the division of the collision avoidance encounter azimuth map many researchers have constructed corresponding models based mainly on colregs and made corresponding improvements such as adjustments based on the light arc range and the actual light cutoff as well as statistics from expert questionnaires when there is doubt regarding an overtaking situation it is assumed that the overtaking situation exists when there is doubt regarding a head on situation it is assumed that the head on situation exists however the models are different from each other and do not have uniform values this study reviewed 12 approaches to azimuth map division zheng and wu 2000 determined the azimuth model from a statistical analysis of 236 questionnaires as did su et al 2012 their azimuth maps were divided by angles of 5 67 5 112 5 210 247 5 355 fig 6 a tsou and hsueh 2010 and wang et al 2017 used an encounter azimuth map with angles of 5 67 5 112 5 247 5 355 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 b wen et al 2016 constructed an encounter azimuth map model with angles of 5 117 5 242 5 355 as the boundaries fig 6 c wu et al 2016 utilized an encounter azimuth map with angles of 15 45 135 225 315 345 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 d kim 2015 used an encounter azimuth map with angles of 22 5 90 112 5 150 210 247 5 270 337 5 fig 6 e qi et al 2011 lv and yin 2019 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and kim and jeong 2016 utilized encounter azimuth maps with angles of 5 112 5 247 5 355 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 f in the design by li 2003 when the visibility was good the encounter azimuth map was divided by the angles 67 5 112 5 210 355 fig 6 g when the visibility was poor the encounter azimuth map was divided by angles of 67 5 150 210 292 5 fig 6 h zhu 2004 used an encounter azimuth map with angles of 6 60 112 5 180 247 5 292 5 354 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 i hong and bian 2007 used an encounter azimuth map with angles of 5 45 67 5 112 5 180 247 5 292 5 315 355 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 j in the study of perera et al 2010a b meeting azimuth was divided by angles of 5 85 95 175 185 211 265 275 329 355 fig 6 k wei et al 2015 tsou et al 2010 li and ma 2016 and coenen et al 1989 used encounter azimuth maps with angles of 5 67 5 112 5 210 5 247 5 355 as the dividing boundaries fig 6 l in most of the studies related to collision avoidance the results are used directly for azimuth division maps there is no in depth discussion on the specific value of the azimuth division boundaries or the calculation and verification using relevant algorithms or models this has led to the existence of various types of orientation maps in studies in the marine field with no unified standard therefore it is necessary to study the ship encounter azimuth divisions to address the difficulty in unifying multiple quantitative standards this study proposes the use of ais big data as the basic data source to objectively extract the officers subjective information and avoid the disadvantages of purely subjective or objective judgment by utilizing machine learning to classify the ship encounter azimuth maps the conclusions are obtained by analyzing the ais data and ensuring the credibility and versatility of the extracted information there are two primary types of classification algorithms linear and nonlinear linear classification algorithms include logistic regression silva et al 2013 and linear discriminant analysis liao and chin 2007 whereas nonlinear classification algorithms include k nearest neighbors calvo zaragoza et al 2015 naive bayes zhang et al 2009 and decision trees friedl and brodley 1997 linear discriminant analysis is used for binary classification on the premise that the training data conforms to a gaussian distribution however it is used mostly for dimensionality reduction problems and may cause overfitting logistic regression is also commonly used to solve linear binary classification problems because of its simplicity and efficiency however it requires high data quality and cannot be used to solve nonlinear problems the k nearest neighbors algorithm is an instance based classification method that has high accuracy is not sensitive to outliers and has no data input assumption however it has high computational and spatial complexity and cannot provide the intrinsic meaning of the data so it cannot be applied to situations with strong practicability naive bayes can handle multi classification problems and it is still effective for the case of small sample data but its use requires strong conditional independence assumptions of premises that is premises attributes do not affect each other however this premise often does not exist so the accuracy of classification decreases the computational complexity of the decision tree is not high the output is easy to understand and it is not sensitive to a lack of intermediate values it can handle irrelevant feature data but it may cause problems of overfitting based on the data characteristics of the extracted data the support vector machine svm method was selected to classify the data by using ais big data through computer screening to find the corresponding meeting data and action label the actual encounter situation and the decision making situation of the crew were extracted and then the svm model was built the schematic diagram of the ship encounter azimuth map division process is illustrated in fig 7 the characteristics of svm support both small sample data and large cases thereby reducing the risk of overfitting in this study the characteristics of the ship encounter model are described and quantified to facilitate computer understanding and provide theoretical support for future research on ship intelligent collision avoidance and as a theoretical basis for accident analysis 2 extracting ship collision avoidance behavior from ais data to construct the ship collision avoidance behavior identification process the results of ship avoidance actions must be screened and identified first the ais data of the ship is converted into relative motion and the ship heading is reduced to a relative 000 the relative position of the ship with which the situation is encountered the corresponding steering action distance to closest point of approach dcpa and other relative information are extracted using colregs to match the ship encounter situation the data of the classified labels are stored in their respective meeting mode classes and then second step detection is performed the characteristics of the meeting ships that are classified into a class are back calculated to regenerate the meeting situation these steps are repeated for each meeting class after preprocessing the ais data the relative speed azimuth and distance of any two ships can be calculated shi et al 2009 zheng 2000 from the ais data if the dcpa is less than 2 nm the meeting information of the two power driven vessels on the sea is calculated and the situation is determined according to the avoidance obligation and collision avoidance behavior of the ship recent encounter points are recorded according to the classification of ship avoidance responsibility ship encounter situations can be classified into two categories 1 it is the responsibility of the target ship to avoid the own ship the own ship is assumed to be stand on in this case two situations may arise i crossing situation wherein the target ship is located at the own ship s azimuth range of 247 5 355 ii overtaking situation wherein the target ship is located at the own ship s azimuth range of 112 5 247 5 2 it is the responsibility of both the target ship and the own ship to avoid collision the approaching ship is assumed to be located at the head on 355 5 of the ship s side the ship azimuth and distance calculation proceeds as follows the rhumb line anti inference method is applied for calculating the orientation of two ships given two point coordinates l 1 b 1 and l 2 b 2 the solution equation is as follows 1 δ b b 2 b 1 δ l l 2 l 1 2 s b a 1 e 2 0 b 1 e 2 sin 2 b 3 2 δ b whereδb is the latitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system δl is the longitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system a is the major radius of the ellipsoid e is the eccentricity and s b is the arc from the evaluated point to the equator 3 q ln tan π 4 b 2 1 e sin b 1 e sin b e 2 δ x a d l δ y a q 2 q 1 c arc tan 2 δ x δ y 4 s s b 2 s b 1 cos a 1 δ b 0 r 1 δ l δ b 0 5 r 1 a cos b 1 1 e 2 sin 2 b 1 where q is the isometric latitude r1 is the latitude radius at latitude b 1 δx is the horizontal coordinate difference in the mercator coordinate system a 1 is the starting point azimuth δy is the vertical coordinate difference in the mercator coordinate system c is the angle of the straight line between the two ship points and s is the length of the straight line between two ship points the relative motion of the ship with regard to the dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa can be calculated as follows 6 v x o v o sin ϕ o v y o v o cos ϕ o 7 v x t v t sin ϕ t v y t v t cos ϕ t 8 v x r v x t v x o v y r v y t v y o 9 v r v x r 2 v y r 2 10 ϕ r arctan v x r v y r α 11 α 0 v x r 0 v y r 0 180 v x r 0 v y r 0 180 v x r 0 v y r 0 360 v x r 0 v y r 0 12 d c p a s sin ϕ r c π 13 t c p a s cos ϕ r c π v r where v xo and v yo are the components of the own ship s speed vector on the x and y axes respectively v xt and v yt are the components of the target ship s speed vector on the x and y axes respectively vr is the relative speed ψ r is the relative course α is the angle compensation coefficient dcpa is the distance to the closest point of approach and tcpa is the time to the closest point of approach with the popularity of ais equipment and the maturity of shore based equipment and space borne equipment ais data has become a popular data source for big data analysis and machine learning the explosive growth of ais data has solved the problem of data sources and valuable collision avoidance experience be gained the actual collision avoidance successful cases can be extracted from the massive ais dataset this study utilized the zhoushan port 2018 ais trajectory data fig 8 including 37 011 ship ais trajectory data information a total of 45 091 068 coordinate points were used which required a data storage capacity of 2 73 gb the focus of this research is the ship s encounter azimuth rather than encounter distance the encounter distance parameter was influenced by many factors such as day or night radar detection ais recognition and visibility etc thus we cannot provide accurate screening distance limits in colreg there is only a description of the specific value of the distance at night but in the case of good visibility during the day it will definitely exceed this distance the distance parameter is just one of the conditions for meeting data filtering a small increase in the distance value will not affect the result of the angle division in order to extract all the meeting data setting the mast light distance range of 6 nm adds 2 nm 8 nm and the sidelights and stern lights distance range of 3nm adds 1 nm 4 nm the extraction process of the meeting data is divided into two stages i determine whether the encounter situation is formed ii determine whether the other vessel is finally past and clear and then extract the corresponding collision avoidance behavior 2 1 head on situation data extraction regarding the head on situation rule 14 of colregs states b such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she would see the mast head lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and or both sidelights c when a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist furthermore the annex i article 9 horizontal sectors positioning and technical details of lights and shapes states in the forward direction sidelights shall decrease to reach practical cut off between 1 3 outside the prescribed sectors according to the range of the arc of light the range of confrontation is 357 3 when confrontation is suspected confrontation should be assumed that is when hesitating between encounters and crossings it should be assumed as confrontation on the basis of 3 2 the values 355 and 5 as the azimuth boundaries with dcpa 2 nm tcpa 0 according to the rules a head on situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead therefore setting 170 c 190 is used to extract the head on situation and we need to determine the existence of the head on situation it is also necessary to determine whether to pass and clear in the head on situation it is determined that the two ships have passed the other ship beam by more than 10 therefore the judgment standard of the port to port is 180 a o 260 and 180 a t 260 and the judgment standard of the starboard to starboard is 100 a o 180 and 100 a t 180 where c is the difference of the cog course over ground a o is the azimuth of the own ship to the target ship and a t is the azimuth of the target ship to the own ship the ship ais data is used to determine the head on situation and the statistics of the scattered points fig 9 shows the extraction diagram of the head on situation and fig 10 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 60 sets of head on situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship head on situation are shown in figs 11 and 12 and in table 1 in fig 12 the purple scattered points represent the head on situation between two ships facing each other each of the two ships steered the course to the left and the two ships passed by safely starboard to starboard or steered the course to the right and the two ships passed by safely port to port 2 2 overtaking situation data extraction regarding the overtaking situation rule 13 of colregs states at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights from annex i article 9 horizontal sectors positioning and technical details of lights and shapes for sternlights and masthead lights and at 22 5 abaft the beam for sidelights it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut off at not more than 5 outside the prescribed sectors according to the range of the light arc the ship encounter azimuth range for overtaking is from 112 5 to 247 5 and the light is cut off at a maximum of 5 beyond the light arc the azimuth range is from 107 5 to 252 5 in addition adding the speed restrictions for the speed vector component of the overtaking ship in the moving direction along the preceding ship s course must be beyond the speed of the overtaken ship s o s t cos δc for determining the past and clear in the overtaking situation the judgment standard of the overtaking from the own ship starboard side is 0 a o 80 and 180 a t 260 the judgment standard of the overtaking from the own ship port side is 280 a o 360 and 100 a t 180 fig 13 shows the extraction diagram of the overtaking situation and fig 14 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 4650 sets of overtaking situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship overtaking situation are shown in figs 15 and 16 and in table 2 in fig 16 the blue scattered points represent the overtaking ship passing safely by the starboard side of the overtaken ship the red scattered points represent the overtaking ship passing safely by the port side of the overtaken ship 2 3 crossing situation data extraction for determining the past and clear in the crossing situation the judgment standard of the passing by the own stern is 100 a o 180 and 10 a t 90 the judgment standard of the passing by the own ship bow is 270 a o 350 and 180 a t 260 fig 17 shows the data extraction diagram of the crossing situation and fig 18 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 6490 sets of crossing situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship crossing situation are shown in figs 19 and 20 a and 20 b and in table 3 in fig 20 a the own ship is the give way ship the gray scattered points represent the own ship passing the stand on ship by bow and the purple scattered points represent the own ship passing the stand on ship by stern in fig 20 b the own ship is the stand on ship the blue scattered points represent the own ship passed by stern and the orange scattered points represent the own ship passed by bow 3 svc based encounter azimuth map classification support vector classification svc cortes and vapnik 1995 is an effective classification algorithm based on statistical learning theory which is based mainly on the following three considerations 1 structural risk minimization the structure risk of a learning machine is controlled by minimizing the vapnik chervonenkis dimension of a function set so that it has a strong generalization ability cherkassky and ma 2004 2 maximization of the classification interval the optimal hyperplane is found by maximizing the classification interval to control the vapnik chervonenkis dimension which is determined by statistical learning theory 3 kernel function mapping according to mercer s theorem in functional analysis a nonlinear problem in a low dimensional space is transformed into a linear problem in a high dimensional space by a kernel function in addition svc can guarantee high classification accuracy under the premise of limited sample size because of its excellent learning performance svc has achieved good results in solving classification problems it has been successfully applied to many fields such as pattern recognition burges 1998 christmann 2004 text classification joachims 2001 and image processing hosseini and ghassemian 2011 seifi majdar and ghassemian 2017 the ship ais collision avoidance behavior data possess five characteristics 1 a large gap exists in the quantity of the data proportion between the classes significantly more number of ships pass by one side than the other 2 several extreme values exist far away from the boundary line 3 the actual data are highly ambiguous and a mutual confusion rate exists between the data 4 a classification algorithm is required in the case of small samples 5 a linear division centered on one s own ship is required the characteristics of svc fig 21 have the highest agreement with the problem to be solved in this study they address the characteristics of the extracted data and solve the shortcomings of the data source therefore this study used an svc model for ship encounter azimuth classification fig 22 shows an architectural diagram of svc in which x n is the input variable and k is the kernel function the independent variable x n is mapped to the high dimensional feature space by the kernel function for linear regression which yields the output feature y the goal of svc is to construct an objective function based on the principle of minimizing structural risks finding a segmentation hyperplane that meets the classification requirements and distributing the points in the training set as far away from the hyperplane as possible the expression of the optimal hyperplane is as follows 14 ω t x b 0 where ω is the weight vector of the hyperplane with ω rn and b is the bias of the hyperplane with b r after the kernel function mapping ϕ xi is used to replace xi in the original low dimensional space and an appropriate kernel function k xi x is used to represent the inner product operation in the high dimensional space the mathematical form of the objective function of the problem is 15 min φ ω 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i 16 s t y i ω ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 3 n where ω xi is the inner product of vector ω and vector xi ω ϕ xi is the distance from the i th sample to the hyperplane ξ i is the slack variable and c is the penalty factor lagrange multipliers α and β are introduced to establish the lagrange function according to the objective function and constraints 17 l 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i i 1 n α i y i ω ϕ x i b ξ i 1 i 1 n β i ξ i where α i α 1 α 2 α n is the lagrange multiplier and ω is the normal vector of the optimal hyperplane by taking the partial derivatives of l b l ω and l ξ and setting them equal to 0 we obtain 18 i 1 n y i α i 0 c α i 0 i 1 2 n ω i 1 n α i y i ϕ x i substituting equation 4 into equation 3 to obtain its dual problem we obtain an extreme value problem of the quadratic function 19 max w α i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n α i α j y i y j k x i x j equation 6 satisfies the constraint conditions in equation 5 from equation 5 it can be seen that the sample with α i 0 has no effect on the classification problem and only the sample with α i 0 has an effect on ω thus determining the classification result the final classification function is 20 d x i 1 n y i α i k x x i b sample x is categorized depending on whether d x is positive or negative this study constructed an svc model and classified and analyzed the crossing overtaking and head on ship encounter situation data extracted as described in section 2 the classification results are shown in figs 23 25 after analysis of the data the ship s overtaking situation can be obtained from fig 23 and the left and right overtaking azimuth division boundary is 202 7354 from fig 24 the direction the ship is facing can be obtained from port to port and starboard to starboard the division boundary is 2 0826 from fig 25 we can see that the ship meets this situation the azimuth division boundaries are 43 4788 and 305 7811 finally all the svc results are combined with colregs and the arc range of the ship lights yielding the ship encounter azimuth map shown in fig 26 2 0826 5 43 4788 107 5 202 7354 252 5 305 7811 355 4 classification of encounter azimuth and encounter patterns for ship collision avoidance excessive azimuth accuracy in the field of navigation has no practical significance the classification result of svc is accurate to four decimal places which is beyond the accuracy of actual navigation applications therefore to facilitate the practical application and the use by the ship s officer all angles are rounded to whole degrees i e 2 5 44 107 203 257 306 355 fig 27 the numerical table corresponding to each area of the ship s azimuth map is obtained as presented in table 4 there are 13 types of ship encounter patterns based on the azimuth class from table 4 as shown in fig 28 and table 5 5 conclusions through the extraction and mining of ais data and classification by svc the common practice of maritime collision avoidance is achieved it solves the drawbacks of previous intelligent collision avoidance studies that can only achieve numerical optimization and cannot be combined with subjectivity it also integrates previous studies of ship encounter azimuth mapping based on ais big data extracts ship encounter data and plots scattered data the point distribution map based on the five characteristics of collision avoidance at sea uses svc to classify the obtained data and obtains a unified ship encounter azimuth map which can be used for future research on intelligent ship collision avoidance division of maritime encounter situations and maritime collisions

officers subjective information and avoid the disadvantages of purely subjective or objective judgment by utilizing machine learning to classify the ship encounter azimuth maps the conclusions are obtained by analyzing the ais data and ensuring the credibility and versatility of the extracted information there are two primary types of classification algorithms linear and nonlinear linear classification algorithms include logistic regression silva et al 2013 and linear discriminant analysis liao and chin 2007 whereas nonlinear classification algorithms include k nearest neighbors calvo zaragoza et al 2015 naive bayes zhang et al 2009 and decision trees friedl and brodley 1997 linear discriminant analysis is used for binary classification on the premise that the training data conforms to a gaussian distribution however it is used mostly for dimensionality reduction problems and may cause overfitting logistic regression is also commonly used to solve linear binary classification problems because of its simplicity and efficiency however it requires high data quality and cannot be used to solve nonlinear problems the k nearest neighbors algorithm is an instance based classification method that has high accuracy is not sensitive to outliers and has no data input assumption however it has high computational and spatial complexity and cannot provide the intrinsic meaning of the data so it cannot be applied to situations with strong practicability naive bayes can handle multi classification problems and it is still effective for the case of small sample data but its use requires strong conditional independence assumptions of premises that is premises attributes do not affect each other however this premise often does not exist so the accuracy of classification decreases the computational complexity of the decision tree is not high the output is easy to understand and it is not sensitive to a lack of intermediate values it can handle irrelevant feature data but it may cause problems of overfitting based on the data characteristics of the extracted data the support vector machine svm method was selected to classify the data by using ais big data through computer screening to find the corresponding meeting data and action label the actual encounter situation and the decision making situation of the crew were extracted and then the svm model was built the schematic diagram of the ship encounter azimuth map division process is illustrated in fig 7 the characteristics of svm support both small sample data and large cases thereby reducing the risk of overfitting in this study the characteristics of the ship encounter model are described and quantified to facilitate computer understanding and provide theoretical support for future research on ship intelligent collision avoidance and as a theoretical basis for accident analysis 2 extracting ship collision avoidance behavior from ais data to construct the ship collision avoidance behavior identification process the results of ship avoidance actions must be screened and identified first the ais data of the ship is converted into relative motion and the ship heading is reduced to a relative 000 the relative position of the ship with which the situation is encountered the corresponding steering action distance to closest point of approach dcpa and other relative information are extracted using colregs to match the ship encounter situation the data of the classified labels are stored in their respective meeting mode classes and then second step detection is performed the characteristics of the meeting ships that are classified into a class are back calculated to regenerate the meeting situation these steps are repeated for each meeting class after preprocessing the ais data the relative speed azimuth and distance of any two ships can be calculated shi et al 2009 zheng 2000 from the ais data if the dcpa is less than 2 nm the meeting information of the two power driven vessels on the sea is calculated and the situation is determined according to the avoidance obligation and collision avoidance behavior of the ship recent encounter points are recorded according to the classification of ship avoidance responsibility ship encounter situations can be classified into two categories 1 it is the responsibility of the target ship to avoid the own ship the own ship is assumed to be stand on in this case two situations may arise i crossing situation wherein the target ship is located at the own ship s azimuth range of 247 5 355 ii overtaking situation wherein the target ship is located at the own ship s azimuth range of 112 5 247 5 2 it is the responsibility of both the target ship and the own ship to avoid collision the approaching ship is assumed to be located at the head on 355 5 of the ship s side the ship azimuth and distance calculation proceeds as follows the rhumb line anti inference method is applied for calculating the orientation of two ships given two point coordinates l 1 b 1 and l 2 b 2 the solution equation is as follows 1 δ b b 2 b 1 δ l l 2 l 1 2 s b a 1 e 2 0 b 1 e 2 sin 2 b 3 2 δ b whereδb is the latitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system δl is the longitude difference in the geodetic coordinate system a is the major radius of the ellipsoid e is the eccentricity and s b is the arc from the evaluated point to the equator 3 q ln tan π 4 b 2 1 e sin b 1 e sin b e 2 δ x a d l δ y a q 2 q 1 c arc tan 2 δ x δ y 4 s s b 2 s b 1 cos a 1 δ b 0 r 1 δ l δ b 0 5 r 1 a cos b 1 1 e 2

is the vertical coordinate difference in the mercator coordinate system c is the angle of the straight line between the two ship points and s is the length of the straight line between two ship points the relative motion of the ship with regard to the dcpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa can be calculated as follows 6 v x o v o sin ϕ o v y o v o cos ϕ o 7 v x t v t sin ϕ t v y t v t cos

13 t c p a s cos ϕ r c π v r where v xo and v yo are the components of the own ship s speed vector on the x and y axes respectively v xt and v yt are the components of the target ship s speed vector on the x and y axes respectively vr is the relative speed ψ r is the relative course α is the angle compensation coefficient dcpa is the distance to the closest point of approach and tcpa is the time to the closest point of approach with the popularity of ais equipment and the maturity of shore based equipment and space borne equipment ais data has become a popular data source for big data analysis and machine learning the explosive growth of ais data has solved the problem of data sources and valuable collision avoidance experience be gained the actual collision avoidance successful cases can be extracted from the massive ais dataset this study utilized the zhoushan port 2018 ais trajectory data fig 8 including 37 011 ship ais trajectory data information a total of 45 091 068 coordinate points were used which required a data storage capacity of 2 73 gb the focus of this research is the ship s encounter azimuth rather than encounter distance the encounter distance parameter was influenced by many factors such as day or night radar detection ais recognition and visibility etc thus we cannot provide accurate screening distance limits in colreg there is only a description of the specific value of the distance at night but in the case of good visibility during the day it will definitely exceed this distance the distance parameter is just one of the conditions for meeting data filtering a small increase in the distance value will not affect the result of the angle division in order to extract all the meeting data setting the mast light distance range of 6 nm adds 2 nm 8 nm and the sidelights and stern lights distance range of 3nm adds 1 nm 4 nm the extraction process of the meeting data is divided into two stages i determine whether the encounter situation is formed ii determine whether the other vessel is finally past and clear and then extract the corresponding collision avoidance behavior 2 1 head on situation data extraction regarding the head on situation rule 14 of colregs states b such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she would see the mast head lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line and or both sidelights c when a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist furthermore the annex i article 9 horizontal sectors positioning and technical details of lights and shapes states in the forward direction sidelights shall decrease to reach practical cut off between 1 3 outside the prescribed sectors according to the range of the arc of light the range of confrontation is 357 3 when confrontation is suspected confrontation should be assumed that is when hesitating between encounters and crossings it should be assumed as confrontation on the basis of 3 2 the values 355 and 5 as the azimuth boundaries with dcpa 2 nm tcpa 0 according to the rules a head on situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead therefore setting 170 c 190 is used to extract the head on situation and we need to determine the existence of the head on situation it is also necessary to determine whether to pass and clear in the head on situation it is determined that the two ships have passed the other ship beam by more than 10 therefore the judgment standard of the port to port is 180 a o 260 and 180 a t 260 and the judgment standard of the starboard to starboard is 100 a o 180 and 100 a t 180 where c is the difference of the cog course over ground a o is the azimuth of the own ship to the target ship and a t is the azimuth of the target ship to the own ship the ship ais data is used to determine the head on situation and the statistics of the scattered points fig 9 shows the extraction diagram of the head on situation and fig 10 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 60 sets of head on situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship head on situation are shown in figs 11 and 12 and in table 1 in fig 12 the purple scattered points represent the head on situation between two ships facing each other each of the two ships steered the course to the left and the two ships passed by safely starboard to starboard or steered the course to the right and the two ships passed by safely port to port 2 2 overtaking situation data extraction regarding the overtaking situation rule 13 of colregs states at night she would be able to see only the sternlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights from annex i article 9 horizontal sectors positioning and technical details of lights and shapes for sternlights and masthead lights and at 22 5 abaft the beam for sidelights it shall decrease steadily to reach practical cut off at not more than 5 outside the prescribed sectors according to the range of the light arc the ship encounter azimuth range for overtaking is from 112 5 to 247 5 and the light is cut off at a maximum of 5 beyond the light arc the azimuth range is from 107 5 to 252 5 in addition adding the speed restrictions for the speed vector component of the overtaking ship in the moving direction along the preceding ship s course must be beyond the speed of the overtaken ship s o s t cos δc for determining the past and clear in the overtaking situation the judgment standard of the overtaking from the own ship starboard side is 0 a o 80 and 180 a t 260 the judgment standard of the overtaking from the own ship port side is 280 a o 360 and 100 a t 180 fig 13 shows the extraction diagram of the overtaking situation and fig 14 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 4650 sets of overtaking situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship overtaking situation are shown in figs 15 and 16 and in table 2 in fig 16 the blue scattered points represent the overtaking ship passing safely by the starboard side of the overtaken ship the red scattered points represent the overtaking ship passing safely by the port side of the overtaken ship 2 3 crossing situation data extraction for determining the past and clear in the crossing situation the judgment standard of the passing by the own stern is 100 a o 180 and 10 a t 90 the judgment standard of the passing by the own ship bow is 270 a o 350 and 180 a t 260 fig 17 shows the data extraction diagram of the crossing situation and fig 18 shows the extraction flowchart after extraction 6490 sets of crossing situation data were obtained the extracted data of the ship crossing situation are shown in figs 19 and 20 a and 20 b and in table 3 in fig 20 a the own ship is the give way ship the gray scattered points represent the own ship passing the stand on ship by bow and the purple scattered points represent the own ship passing the stand on ship by stern in fig 20 b the own ship is the stand on ship the blue scattered points represent the own ship passed by stern and the orange scattered points represent the own ship passed by bow 3 svc based encounter azimuth map classification support vector classification svc cortes and vapnik 1995 is an effective classification algorithm based on statistical learning theory which is based mainly on the following three considerations 1 structural risk minimization the structure risk of a learning machine is controlled by minimizing the vapnik chervonenkis dimension of a function set so that it has a strong generalization ability cherkassky and ma 2004 2 maximization of the classification interval the optimal hyperplane is found by maximizing the classification interval to control the vapnik chervonenkis dimension which is determined by statistical learning theory 3 kernel function mapping according to mercer s theorem in functional analysis a nonlinear problem in a low dimensional space is transformed into a linear problem in a high dimensional space by a kernel function in addition svc can guarantee high classification accuracy under the premise of limited sample size because of its excellent learning performance svc has achieved good results in solving classification problems it has been successfully applied to many fields such as pattern recognition burges 1998 christmann 2004 text classification joachims 2001 and image processing hosseini and ghassemian 2011 seifi majdar and ghassemian 2017 the ship ais collision avoidance behavior data possess five characteristics 1 a large gap exists in the quantity of the data proportion between the classes significantly more number of ships pass by one side than the other 2 several extreme values exist far away from the boundary line 3 the actual data are highly ambiguous and a mutual confusion rate exists between the data 4 a classification algorithm is required in the case of small samples 5 a linear division centered on one s own ship is required the characteristics of svc fig 21 have the highest agreement with the problem to be solved in this study they address the characteristics of the extracted data and solve the shortcomings of the data source therefore this study used an svc model for ship encounter azimuth classification fig 22 shows an architectural diagram of svc in which x n is the input variable and k is the kernel function the independent variable x n is mapped to the high dimensional feature space by the kernel function for linear regression which yields the output feature y the goal of svc is to construct an objective function based on the principle of minimizing structural risks finding a segmentation hyperplane that meets the classification requirements and distributing the points in the training set as far away from the hyperplane as possible the expression of the optimal hyperplane is as follows 14 ω t x b 0 where ω is the weight vector of the hyperplane with ω rn and b is the bias of the hyperplane with b r after the kernel function mapping ϕ xi is used to replace xi in the original low dimensional space and an appropriate kernel function k xi x is used to represent the inner product operation in the high dimensional space the mathematical form of the objective function of the problem is 15 min φ ω 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i 16 s t y i ω ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 3 n where ω xi is the inner product of vector ω and vector xi ω ϕ xi is the distance from the i th sample to the hyperplane ξ i is the slack variable and c is the penalty factor lagrange multipliers α and β are introduced to establish the lagrange function according to the objective function and constraints 17 l 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 n ξ i i 1 n α i y i ω ϕ x i b ξ i 1 i 1 n β i ξ i where α i α 1 α 2 α n is the lagrange multiplier and ω is the normal vector of the optimal hyperplane by taking the partial derivatives of l b l ω and l ξ and setting them equal to 0 we obtain 18 i 1 n y i α i 0 c α i 0 i 1 2 n ω i 1 n α i y i ϕ x i substituting equation 4 into equation 3 to obtain its dual problem we obtain an extreme value problem of the quadratic function 19 max w α i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n α i α j y i y j k x i x j equation 6 satisfies the constraint conditions in equation 5 from equation 5 it can be seen that the sample with α i 0 has no effect on the classification problem and only the sample with α i 0 has an effect on ω thus determining the classification result the final classification function is 20 d x i 1 n y i α i k x x i b sample x is categorized depending on whether d x is positive or negative this study constructed an svc model and classified and analyzed the crossing overtaking and head on ship encounter situation data extracted as described in section 2 the classification results are shown in figs 23 25 after analysis of the data the ship s overtaking situation can be obtained from fig 23 and the left and right overtaking azimuth division boundary is 202 7354 from fig 24 the direction the ship is facing can be obtained from port to port and starboard to starboard the division boundary is 2 0826 from fig 25 we can see that the ship meets this situation the azimuth division boundaries are 43 4788 and 305 7811 finally all the svc results are combined with colregs and the arc range of the ship lights yielding the ship encounter azimuth map shown in fig 26 2 0826 5 43 4788 107 5 202 7354 252 5 305 7811 355 4 classification of encounter azimuth and encounter patterns for ship collision avoidance excessive azimuth accuracy in the field of navigation has no practical significance the classification result of svc is accurate to four decimal places which is beyond the accuracy of actual navigation applications therefore to facilitate the practical application and the use by the ship s officer all angles are rounded to whole degrees i e 2 5 44 107 203 257 306 355 fig 27 the numerical table corresponding to each area of the ship s azimuth map is obtained as presented in table 4 there are 13 types of ship encounter patterns based on the azimuth class from table 4 as shown in fig 28 and table 5 5 conclusions through the extraction and mining of ais data and classification by svc the common practice of maritime collision avoidance is achieved it solves the drawbacks of previous intelligent collision avoidance studies that can only achieve numerical optimization and cannot be combined with subjectivity it also integrates previous studies of ship encounter azimuth mapping based on ais big data extracts ship encounter data and plots scattered data the point distribution map based on the five characteristics of collision avoidance at sea uses svc to classify the obtained data and obtains a unified ship encounter azimuth map which can be used for future research on intelligent ship collision avoidance division of maritime encounter situations and maritime collisions

21636,in this study a numerical model is built to simulate the coupled process of fluid flow and thermal physical performance in a cryogenic liquid oxygen storage tank both the external heat leak and liquid vapor phase change are taken into consideration the convection thermal boundary is used to simulate the heat inputs the sinusoidal sloshing excitation is applied on the tank wall and realized by user defined functions moreover the mesh motion treatment is adopted and coupled with the volume of fluid model to predict the movement of the liquid vapor interface the pressure data during fluid sloshing is selected to validate the proposed numerical model which shows the present model has great accuracy in predicting fluid sloshing with the relative error being less than 5 0 the grid independence study is conducted as well calculated by the present numerical model the phase distribution is investigated with the dynamic monitors being set variations of the interface profiles are obviously displayed under different sloshing amplitudes it shows the initial sloshing amplitude has obvious influences on the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface during the whole sloshing process the vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid while for the effect of the phase change on variation of the free interface it becomes greatly prominent with the increase of the sloshing amplitude moreover with the consideration of interface phase change both the sloshing moment and liquid pressure decrease with time which is largely different from the parameter variations calculated without considering of the interface phase change with some valuable conclusions obtained the present study is significant to the in depth investigation on the non isothermal sloshing dynamic process in ocean engineering keywords dynamic variation interface shape liquid oxygen tank sloshing excitation 1 introduction liquid sloshing could result in negative effects on most applications for fuel storage in energy engineering ocean engineering and aerospace engineering fluid sloshing in fuel tanks usually leads to inevitable effects such as additional sloshing force vibration control failures and etc as cryogens are stored in low temperature small heat leaks could lead to serious fluid thermal stratification in addition liquid sloshing would cause undesired thermodynamic effects including the rapid pressure decline due to the enhancement of heat and mass transfer occurring at the liquid vapor interface as the thermal performance coupled with the sloshing dynamic process is greatly complex efficient prediction and controlling the motion of cryogenic propellants is vitally important to realize the safe operation of launch mission it is necessary to better understand the dynamic variation of the interface in non isothermal sloshing storage tanks related to the pure sloshing hydrodynamic phenomenon researchers have conducted extensive investigations it was reported the american nasa was the first to investigate the fluid sloshing dynamic behaviors in aerospace missions abramson 1966 starting in the later 1950s nasa conducted a lot of theoretical analysis and experimental investigations both the lateral sloshing force and moment were studied to measure the shape of interface ultrasonic technology barshan and baskent 2000 was used to test the distance between the liquid vapor interface and the ultrasonic source the shape of the liquid vapor interface was obtained by combing all the collected test data himeno et al 2005 2007 conducted sub scale experiments during the ballistic flight of the vehicle under the lateral acceleration of 0 8 g the motion of the free surface was recorded by a high speed camera rackl et al 2018 analyzed liquid sloshing with free floating robot dynamics and simulated the process as rigid body motion under the low gravity condition the relevant influence to the free floating robot dynamics was shown for slow motions moreover akyildiz 2012 numerically investigated liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank with a numerical algorithm based on the volume of fluid method the free surface elevation and variations of pressures were greatly presented to study fluid damping in a rectangular tank nayak and biswal 2015 investigated the natural frequency and damping with three configurations of vertical baffles it showed that the surface piercing wall mounted baffle has the best effect on sloshing damping similarly the effectiveness of baffles in suppressing pressure was also experimentally investigated by xue et al 2017 they found that altering natural frequency might be an effective method to reduce the impact pressure to study the influence of the induced excitations from wind or earthquake on liquefied natural gas storage tanks sanapala et al 2016 numerically investigated the sloshing dynamics in cryogenic storage tanks under a resonant harmonic excitation meanwhile the methodologies sanapala et al 2018 to control the sloshing forces and interface oscillations in a partially filled rectangular container were explored by adding a baffle on the tank wall researchers in florida institute of technology faure et al 2010 zhou et al 2012 have used a variety of internally developed and commercially numerical tools to simulate the sloshing dynamics to predict fluid sloshing storey 2016 conducted the ground based test in a spherical tank to characterize the damping effect sloshing mode frequencies and sloshing forces by using water and liquid nitrogen chu et al 2018 adopted a large eddy simulation model to research fluid sloshing in a water tank with multiple vertical baffles the results show that the natural frequency of the tank with multiple baffles has a direct relationship to the water depth the multiple baffles have great suppression effects on the hydrodynamic force when compared to the single baffle zhang et al 2019 investigated the anti sloshing effects of the floating foam by conducting analytical and experimental research xue et al 2019 used openfoam software to numerically investigate effects of the storage vessel shapes on sloshing dynamics under horizontal excitations it shows that the spherical tank has great suppressions on the impact pressure due to its curved surface when compared to the cylindrical tank recently the thermodynamic imbalance caused by liquid sloshing becomes the research hotspot due to the widely use of cryogenic fuels moran et al 1994 conducted sloshing experiments in a spherical liquid hydrogen tank to study influences of frequency and amplitude and thermal characteristics the tank pressure drop was observed in their experiments to study the interfacial mixing of the high temperature liquid and the bulk liquid arndt et al 2012 experimentally researched the coupled sloshing performance in a liquid nitrogen tank with three different pressurization modes without using water or cryogens das and hopfinger 2009 selected fc 72 and hfe7000 to study the thermal physical process under the axial sloshing excitation ludwig et al 2013 conducted detailed experiments with liquid nitrogen in a cylindrical tank the empirical correlation was proposed by fitting the nusselt number and reynolds number to reflect the relationship between the tank pressure drop and the sloshing characteristics konopka et al 2016 conducted experimental and numerical investigations on non isothermal sloshing in a liquid nitrogen tank they found that the damping factors were higher than the values calculated by semi empirical correlations focused on the sloshing pressure drop montsarrat 2017 built a two dimensional model to predict the sloshing thermodynamics in a liquid nitrogen tank as the turbulence in boundary layer was not considered in detail there were some prediction errors between the theoretical model and experiments grotle and æsøy 2017 established one numerical model to study the thermodynamic response in a sloshing liquefied natural gas tank with the openfoam software some fluid sloshing experiments were also conducted in a rectangular container with shallow liquid depths grotle et al 2017 with the interfacial area estimated in different sloshing regimes it showed that the interfacial area and the condensation mass flow rate were in phase especially for the most severe sloshing case thereafter grotle and æsøy 2018 developed a phenomenological model to predict the rapid tank pressure loss experienced onboard liquefied natural gas vessels as mentioned above researchers have conducted extensive investigations on fluid sloshing hydrodynamics while few are involved in the dynamic response of free interface in non isothermal sloshing tanks in this paper a numerical model is built to investigate the sloshing dynamic variation in a liquid oxygen tank with external heat leaks considered the sloshing excitation is realized by user defined functions meanwhile the interface fluctuation is accurately captured by the volume of fluid method coupled with the mesh motion treatment the influences of the sloshing amplitude on the phase distribution the elevation fluctuation of the liquid vapor interface the vapor pressure and vapor mass and the effect of the phase change on the variation of the interface area sloshing moment and liquid pressure are numerically investigated some valuable conclusions are achieved finally the present study is significant to the in depth understanding of the non isothermal sloshing 2 physical model a liquid oxygen tank is selected to be the research object as fig 1 shows it consists of a cylinder and top and bottom dished heads the diameter of the tank is 3 5 m and the heights of the cylinder and the top bottom dished head are 2 0 m and 1 5 m focused on the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface subjected to external sloshing excitation some actual configurations of the liquid oxygen tank are simplified the initial liquid height is 2 5 m with a level of 50 by volume as the coordinate center is located below the interface the initial liquid vapor interfacehas a y coordinate of 1 0 m as fig 1 shows the initial liquid temperature is set as 90 0 k to reduce obvious temperature jump a linear temperature profile of 90 0 k t 100 0 k is adopted in the vapor region at 1 0 m y 3 5 m the initial tank pressure is set to be 130 kpa and the external environment pressure and temperature are 1 0atm and 300 k respectively subjected to the ambient parts of heat leaks are penetrating into the liquid oxygen tank here the

as the tank wall has a small thickness its thermal insistence is ignored thus the value of t w is adopted with the temperature of liquid oxygen with the external air temperature of 300 k the fluid thermal properties could be solved once the convection heat transfer coefficient and external air temperature are determined the convection thermal boundary is adopted as fig 1 shows a sinusoidal

is a constant with the value of 0 09 the standard k ε turbulence model has been proven to be effective in prediction of fluid sloshing in our previous research readers could refer to the previous investigations liu et al 2019 for details 3 2 mesh motion model in the present study the mesh motion method which can be used to model flows where the shape of the domain is changing with time due to motion on the domain boundaries is used to predict fluid sloshing both the fluid sloshing and pistons moving could be simulated by the mesh motion model the mesh motion model is activated and coupled with the vof model in the whole calculation region the governing equations are solved with respect to dynamic meshes the integral form of the conservation equation for a general scaler φ on an arbitrary control volume v whose boundary is moving can be written as 19 d d t v ρ φ d v v ρ φ u u g d a v γ φ d a v s φ d v where ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity vector u g is the mesh velocity of the moving mesh γ is the diffusion coefficient s φ is the source term of φ here v is used to represent the boundary of the control volume v 20 d d t v ρ φ d v ρ φ v n 1 ρ φ v n δ t by

next time level respectively the n 1 th time level volume v n 1 is computed by the following equation 22 v n 1 v n d v d t δ t where d v d t is the volume time derivative of the control volume in order to satisfy the mesh conservation law the volume time derivative of the control volume is computed from 23 d v d t v u g d a j n f u g j a j where n f is the number of faces on the control volume and a j is the j face area vector the dot product u g j a j on each control volume face is calculated from 24 u g j a j δ v j δ t where δ v j is the volume swept out by the control volume face j over the time step δ t as the above introductions have been introduced in some references the readers are suggested to refer to the user s guide of ansys fluent 2011 for details 3 3 numerical implementation the icem software is used for the model construction and grid generation for the present study the tank cylinder the top and the bottom dished head are all generated with the structured grids the commercial software ansys fluent 19 0 is used to predict the unsteady sloshing process with double precision solver the sharp interface model is adopted to predict the interface fluctuation second order upwind scheme is adopted to discretize the convective terms first order scheme is used to discretize the turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso pressure velocity coupling scheme is adopted to calculate the pressure field the presto scheme is acceptable to the volume fraction equation explicit first order scheme is used for time discretization and the time step size is on the order of 0 001s the convergence criteria are judged by monitoring the residuals when the residuals fall below 10 3 10 3 and 10 6 for continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation respectively it is supposed to meet the convergence criteria 4 experimental validation the experimental data conducted by grotle and æsøy 2018 is selected to validate the present numerical model grotle and æsøy 2018 conducted fluid sloshing test in a transparent glass tank the test tank consists of a straight cylindrical section and two semi elliptic heads the diameter of the tank is 0 35 m and the length of the cylinder is 0 89 m as the test tank is arranged on a movable platform it could move across the rotate center driven by an electro motor and a crank mechanism compared to the tank radius the crank arm is long so the angle of the platform has an expression of θ asin 2πft the p8ap type pressure sensor is located in the middle of the tank water is selected to be the test fluid and the mean water depth in the tank is 50 in their experiments the tank pressure was specially measured in different sloshing frequencies thus comparisons are made between the measured pressure and the calculated pressure here three sloshing cases are used to validate the calculation model the tank pressure decline times of three cases are about 60s 20s and 6s calculated with the standard k ε model the result comparisons between the experiments and simulations are shown in fig 2 it is easy to see most of the simulated values are close to the experimental results although there are some differences between simulations and experimental results the relative errors between the experimental results and simulation values are in the range of 1 0 5 0 moreover the interface shape of cases no 2 and no 3 are also compared and shown in fig 3 it is easy to see the numerical model has greatly reflected the fluid sloshing hence the present numerical model is acceptable here four calculation grids are selected to test the mesh resolution with numbers of 29212 52380 82264 and 118260 with a sinusoidal excitation applied on the tank the grid independence study is conducted here the tank pressure during fluid sloshing is monitored the result comparison is shown in fig 4 it is easy to see that when the grid number increases to 52380 the calculated tank pressure almost keeps constant with small differences on the principle of reducing the computational resources and improving the calculation precision the mesh with 82264 cells is selected 5 results and discussion based on the numerical model above the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface is investigated under different sloshing amplitudes the phase distribution variations of the interface shape changes of the vapor pressure and mass and parameter comparisons between two cases are studied as well 5 1 liquid and vapor phase distribution under the influence of external excitation the counter acting force forms on the tank wall driven by external sloshing force liquid within the tank moves forth and back hence the interfacial shape changes correspondingly to clearly reflect the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface the phase distributions under different sloshing amplitudes are shown in fig 5 here the red and blue colors refer to the vapor and liquid as fig 5 shows liquid moves towards left side in 0 5s and the interface has a rightward tilt with the wave peak forming on left side and the wave trough on right side 1 0s later with spread of the sloshing wave both the wave peak and trough move towards the tank core parts of disturbances and interface fluctuations occur at two sides since 9 5s while it lasts for 19 5s four waves form in the interface shown as fig 5a while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 25 m shapes of the interface are almost the same as that of a 0 20 m as fig 5b shows there are obvious interface fluctuations from 9 5s when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 30 m the free interface has obvious fluctuations since 1 5s and the fluctuation elevations become increasingly large by comparing fig 5c e it is easy to see there are similar interface shapes in the same time for these three sloshing amplitudes the main difference is that the large initial sloshing amplitude condition usually has strong sloshing intensity and high elevation fluctuation as fig 5e shows influenced by the severe shaking liquid fluctuates and entrains with parts of vapor especially in 4 5s 14 5s and 19 5s serious interfacial fluctuations enhance the heat exchange between the high temperature vapor and the subcooled liquid which promotes the reduction of the tank pressure 5 2 variations of interface shape by setting dynamic monitor in motion mesh profiles of the free interface at different times are obviously reflected here the void fraction of 0 5 is selected to reflect the interface profile moreover the dynamic monitors are different from the fixed test points once the sloshing excitation is activated test points are varying with time with all test points combined the interface profile is formed in this section the interface profiles for sloshing amplitudes of 0 20 m 0 30 m and 0 40 m are selected and analyzed the variations of the interface profiles are shown in figs 6 8 subjected to external sloshing excitation liquid moves forth and back and this phenomenon has been clearly reflected in first 1 0s shown as fig 6a when the sloshing excitation is applied to the tank wall the opposite direction force is formed and driven liquid moving towards x direction the s type profile is forming in 0 1 0 4s it is in 0 5s that the liquid moves to left side with the largest elevation of 1 1008 m at x 1 688 m and the smallest elevation of 0 9155 m at x 1 6106 m afterwards the free surface fluctuates with the decrease of left side and the increase of right side this process lasts to 0 9s with the interface shape of z type it is about in 0 9s that the lowest elevation is achieved at x 1 7190 m with the value of 0 9193 m and the highest elevation is 1 1327 m at x 1 7190 m based on above descriptions it is easy to see the first interface fluctuation varies from s type profiles to z type profiles in 0 0 0 9s thereafter liquid fluctuates with left side moving upward and right side downward when it is in 1 0s the extreme elevations are 1 6416 m at x 1 1398 m and 0 9190 m at x 1 6106 m shown as the profile of 1 0s in fig 6a with fluctuations of the free interface different extreme points form as fig 6b shows three wave peak points and three trough points appear in the free surface during 1 1 2 0s with the spread of sloshing waves liquid flows from wave trough to peak or from wave peak to trough during this period fluid in left side reaches the wave peak again in 1 4s it takes about 0 5s to finish the movement from wave trough to wave peak meanwhile fluid in right side has an opposite fluctuating trend with the decrease of the elevation the free surface has a type of w profile afterwards liquid in left side moves down while it flows up in right side once the lowest elevation for the test point on left side is achieved in 1 9s the elevation increases again for the present profile the related three positive extreme points are 1 1310 m at x 1 75 m 1 0609 m at x 0 8827 m and 0 9652 m at x 1 2699 m while the negative extreme points are 1 0350 m at x 1 2544 m 0 9428 m at x 0 8518 m and 0 9143 m at x 1 7190 m respectively combing fig 6a and b it is easy to see more disturbances form in 1 1 2 0s this is because in first 1 0s the free surface still has a regular shape as the excitation applied for a short term 1 0s later fluid in left side moves from the highest elevation to the lowest elevation the wave peak spreads forwards in 0 5 0 9s as shown in fig 6a with the spread of sinusoidal wave wave peaks and troughs form gradually moreover it seems that elevations of the center monitor are always lower than the initial height of the free surface this is mainly because the liquid mass is distributed unevenly with liquid moving back and forth after 4 0s sloshing shapes of the free surface are shown in fig 6c as fig 6c shows with time continuing less liquid is distributed on two sides of the tank the center point of the free surface moves along the initial flat line moreover it seems that more serious disturbances occur at the free surface while the x coordinate is in the range of 0 5 1 0 m liquid moves up it is about in 4 9s the largest positive peak point is achieved with the value of 1 1456 m at x 1 75 m while the negative trough point is obtained at 5 0s with the value of 0 8821 m at x 1 7035 m the profiles of the free surface in 9 1 10 0s 14 1 15 0s and 19 1 20 0s are shown in fig 6d f after a long period of fluid sloshing the interface shape tends to be stable the interface profiles are almost symmetrically distributed however there are still many fluctuations and disturbances forming as time elapses in general elevations of fluid fluctuation tend to decrease and be relatively stable as described above it is easy to see variations of the interface profiles during sloshing are greatly reflected for case a 0 20 m there are monotonous interface profiles in the initial period with time continuing the sloshing excitation spreads forwards in the form of wave meanwhile the fluctuation amplitude tends to decrease with small extreme points while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 30 m the interface profiles are shown in fig 7 by comparing with fig 6 it is easy to see there are many similarities between two cases as fig 7a shows fluid moves towards left side and the sloping profile forms in 0 4s liquid reaches the highest point of left side since then it starts to move down it is about in 0 9s liquid arrives to the lowest point of left side correspondingly liquid in right side of the tank has an opposite movement trend this variation is similar to that of a 0 20 m with the s type profile forming in 0 1 0 4s and z type profile appearing in 0 5 0 9s with the spread of wave the largest peak point and trough point are achieved in 1 0s and 0 4s elevations of the related extreme points are 1 2065m at x 1 6106 m and 0 8579 m at x 1 7190 m shown as the profile of 1 0s in fig 7a after 1 0s sloshing more extreme points are formed subjected to sloshing wave liquid flows from wave trough to peak or from wave peak to trough as fig 7b shows three wave peak points and trough points appear in the free surface during 1 1 2 0s the free surface has the w or m type during this period fluid reaches the wave peak in left side in 1 4s about 0 5s later it finishes the movement from wave trough to wave peak while the fluid in right side has an opposite fluctuation trend with the amplitude of 0 30 m there are also three positive extreme points and three negative extreme points in the profile of 1 9s the positive extreme points are 1 2071m at x 1 75 m 1 0993 m at x 0 8208 m and 0 9503 m at x 1 2235 m while the negative extreme points are 1 0441 m at x 1 1615 m 0 9145 m at x 0 8363 m and 0 8856 m at x 1 7035 m respectively compared with fig 6b it is easy to see with the sloshing amplitude of 0 30 m there are larger positive extreme points and smaller negative extreme points during 1 1 2 0s fig 7c shows interface profiles in 4 1 5 0s during this period the free surface has large disturbances overall liquid moves from left to right with fluctuations in 4 9s the largest positive peak point is achieved with the value of 1 1984m at the right side while the negative trough point is obtained at 5 0s with the value of 0 8390 m at x 1 5332 m while for the interface profiles in 9 1 10 0s 14 1 15 0s and 19 1 20 0s large fluctuations occur as shown in fig 7d f compared to the profiles distribution in a 0 20 m large fluctuation amplitudes and disturbances appear in the present condition anyhow after long term sloshing variations of the interface shape tend to be stable and the whole types of interface profile are almost distributed symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the liquid oxygen tank fig 8 shows the interface profiles under the sloshing amplitude of 0 40 m as fig 8a and b show the free interface almost experiences similar variations in the first 2 0s as that of sloshing amplitudes of 0 20 m and 0 30 m the main differences are that there are larger fluctuation elevations for the sloshing amplitude of 0 40 m by combining fig 8a and b the fluctuation elevations are in the range of 0 815 1 301 m which is larger than the variation range of case a 0 20 m and a 0 30 m meanwhile under severe sloshing excitation more liquid is distributed on two sides of the tank there is a lower position for the middle interface point with the average value of 0 9567 m as shown in fig 8b fig 8c shows variations of the interface profiles in 4 1 5 0s during this period large disturbances form and occur different from figures above the vapor is entrained by the liquid by combing the interface profile and phase distribution in 4 5s it is easy to see a gas void is formed in x 0 5 m this phenomenon is mainly caused by the liquid entrainment which is also obviously shown in 4 1 4 4s as marked by the red rectangular while for the profile in 5 0s liquid has a high elevation and the entrainment is forming as the falling down of fluid moreover caused by liquid entrainment serious fluid fluctuations and disturbances occur at the interface along with large elevations when it lasts for 10 0s the interface profile is shown in fig 8d the largest elevation appears in 9 6s with the value of 1 2354 m at x 0 2013m afterwards the peak point moves forwards right direction fig 8e shows the interface profiles during 14 1 15 0s in this period fluid sloshing is drastic and liquid entrainment becomes frequent correspondingly as fig 8e shows the interface profile with a separate circle appears at different times this phenomenon is obviously reflected by the interface profiles of 14 5s 14 6s and 15 0s in fig 8e while the vapor void is pressing out by the liquid there is no separate circle anyhow this phenomenon reflects the violent disturbance caused by external excitation for the present period the largest elevation is achieved in 15 0s with the value of 1 2731 m fig 8f shows variations of the free interface in 19 1 20 0s it is easy to see the free interface has strong dynamic responses subjected to the sloshing excitation with the spread of fluid wave parts of kinetic energy are accumulated on the center of the tank which drives the fluid s fluctuation forms the wave peak and promotes the liquid entrainment along with the formation and disappearance of gas voids the free interface has experienced severe and extensive fluctuations and disturbances as mentioned above it is easy to see the sloshing amplitude has caused obvious influences on the interface shape and phase distribution when the sloshing amplitude is less than a certain value there are almost the same phase distributions and interface profiles when the sloshing amplitude increases to a certain value obvious disturbances and fluctuations appear with large fluctuation elevations meanwhile for cases with large sloshing amplitude liquid entrainment occurs with the development and annihilation of the gas void 5 3 sloshing thermal performance subjected to external heat leaks thermal performance in the liquid oxygen tank is studied here variations of the vapor pressure and vapor mass are briefly introduced one pressure test point is set in the vapor region with the coordinate of 0 2 0 variations of the vapor pressure in different sloshing amplitudes are monitored and shown in fig 9 as the initial tank pressure is 130 kpa and the initial liquid temperature is 90 0 k liquid oxygen has a subcooled degree of 2 641 k and vapor is superheated once the external sinusoidal excitation is activated liquid moves forth and back so the liquid vapor connection area becomes large the intensive heat and mass transfer occurs between the liquid and vapor especially when the vapor is entrained by the liquid thus the vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid as fig 9 shows the vapor pressure decreases almost linearly when the sloshing amplitude ranges from 0 2 m to 0 3 m the related pressure values of the vapor test point reduce from 128 654 kpa to 124 869 kpa 124 584 kpa and 124 213 kpa respectively the corresponding pressure decrease rates are 189 25 pa s 203 5 pa s and 222 05 pa s with the sloshing amplitude increasing from 0 20 m to 0 30 m when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m some pressure fluctuations appear the vapor pressure still decreases linearly in the first 15s for the amplitude of 0 35 m then a rapid pressure decline appears along with fluctuations as for the case a 0 40 m the pressure disturbance appears in 10 0s about 5 0s earlier than that of the case a 0 35 m the vapor pressure fluctuations are mainly caused by intensive liquid fluctuations when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m liquid travels from left to right and serious mixings and disturbances occur which greatly promotes the heat and mass transfer between the liquid and vapor hence there is a rapid vapor pressure decrease for cases of a 0 35 m and a 0 40 m the final pressures are 122 946 kpa and 121 951 kpa therefore large initial sloshing amplitude would lead to large vapor pressure decrease during the whole sloshing process the high temperature vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid as fig 10 shows the mass of vapor decreases with time as fluid sloshing promotes the heat and mass exchange between the liquid and vapor more vapor condensation occurs in the case of larger sloshing amplitudes for case a 0 20 m the vapor mass decreases from 40 4034 kg to 39 8924 kg when the amplitude increases from 0 25 m to 0 40 m the final values of four cases are 39 7921 kg 39 6752 kg 39 4144 kg and 39 1676 kg respectively hence the vapor condensation amount increases with the initial sloshing amplitude 5 4 effect of the interface phase change 5 4 1 comparison on the interface area once the external excitation is imposed on the tank wall fluid within the tank makes reciprocating motion which leads to the increase of the contact area between the vapor and liquid to effectively predict the fluid fluctuation the test point is set to monitor the average area of the free interface the initial flat area of the interface is adopted with the expression of a 0 π d l while the external excitation is activated the interface has a curve surface its perimeter treats as p so the interfacial area has an expression of a p l here l means the unit length fig 11 shows comparisons of interface area calculated with and without considering the interfacial phase change as fig 11 shows it is easy to see that the free interface is always fluctuating from fig 11a it seems the interface areas of two conditions are almost the same that is to say the effect of the phase change is slight on the interface area while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 25 m and 0 30 m some clear differences appear as figs 11b and c show the effect of the phase change becomes obvious since 11 2s meanwhile some slight differences also form during 6 0 7 5s when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m and 0 40 m the phase change causes obvious effects on the interface fluctuation from fig 11d and e the difference of the interface area of two conditions generates since 3 7s as for amplitude of 0 40 m the difference of the interface area of two conditions becomes more obvious from 14 1s shown as fig 11e based on fig 11 it is verified again that the interface fluctuation becomes increasingly obvious with the increase of the sloshing amplitude here the value of the area ratio is selected to compare the effect of the phase change on the interface fluctuation table 1 lists the extreme value of the interface area ratio between two conditions from table 1 it is easy to see the area ratio of the extreme point increases with the sloshing amplitudes when the sloshing amplitude increases from 0 20 m to 0 40 m the area ratio increases from 1 01325 to 1 32347 for conditions calculated with the phase change considered moreover the difference between two cases also increases with sloshing amplitude when the sloshing amplitude is set to be 0 20 m the difference of two cases is only 0 00005 while it increases to 0 03489 for amplitude of 0 40 m as for the occurring time of the extreme point it s not regular this also explains the unstable and random nature of fluid sloshing except for the extreme value of the interface area ratio the maximum difference of the interface area ratio between two conditions is also monitored and shown in table 2 based on table 2 it is obvious to see the maximum difference of area ratio also increase with the sloshing amplitude with the amplitude increase from 0 20 m to 0 40 m the difference increases from 0 000146 to 0 059320 by comparing tables 1 and 2 it is easy to see the extreme point and the maximum difference points are formed in different times this phenomenon proves the randomness of fluid sloshing again 5 4 2 comparison on the sloshing moment and fluid pressure except for the fluctuation of the free interface the sloshing moment and fluid pressure are also compared between conditions with and without considering the interface phase change fig 12 shows comparison on the sloshing moment of two cases it is easy to see both have fluctuation profiles when the interface phase change is considered in the prediction model the sloshing moment suffered by the storage tank decreases with time while the interface phase change is not considered in the calculation model the sloshing moment fluctuates along a constant line this is mainly because while the phase change is not taken into account the liquid mass keeps constant hence the liquid within the tank makes reciprocating motion which is almost a rigid body motion as for the condition with considering the interface phase change the mass transfer occurs between the liquid and vapor regions and it increases the damping effect between the liquid and the storage tank therefore the sloshing moment calculated in the case with considering the interface phase change has decrease profiles moreover based on fig 12 it is easy to see there are large fluctuation waves for the large initial sloshing amplitude fig 13 shows comparison of the liquid pressure between two cases the liquid pressure monitor is set below the interface with the coordinate of 0 0 5 it is easy to see there are obvious differences between two cases while the interface phase change is considered the thermal energy transfers from the vapor to liquid driven by temperature difference under the promoting effects of phase change and fluid sloshing the vapor pressure decreases with time due to the loss of thermal energy correspondingly the liquid pressure experiences a reduction profile when the external sloshing excitation is applied to the tank as shown in fig 13a the liquid pressure fluctuates from 147 1 kpa to 143 2 kpa while for the case without considering the interface phase change the liquid pressure experiences stable pressure fluctuations along the pressure line of 146 5 kpa as fig 13b shows the fluctuation range of the liquid pressure monitor is 147 3 145 5 kpa this is mainly because there is only sensible heat exchange between the liquid and vapor region although parts of thermal energy transfer from the vapor to liquid the vapor obtains some penetrations as well overall speaking the vapor is in thermal balance or may obtain a little more thermal energy from outside based on fig 13b it seems that the pressure has slight increase during fluid sloshing based on figs 11 13 it is obvious to see that the interface phase change has caused obvious effects on the interface fluctuation variations of the fluid pressure and the sloshing moment hence the thermal physical process during fluid sloshing should be given more attention 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical model is built to predict the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface in a liquid oxygen tank both the heat invasion and external sinusoidal excitation are considered the experimental validation is made against the sloshing experiment data the relative calculation errors between the calculated values and experiment data are less than 5 0 meanwhile the mesh sensitivity verification is conducted based on the developed numerical model the influence of the sloshing amplitude is studied on the sloshing dynamic process variations of vapor pressure and vapor mass are studied and compared in different sloshing amplitudes it showed the sloshing amplitude has great effects on the interface shape and the phase distribution the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface is greatly reflected by monitoring the interfacial variation when the sloshing amplitude is less than 0 30 m there are similar phase distributions and fluctuating interface profiles when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 40 m large disturbances and mixings occur at the interface along with high elevations moreover with large sloshing amplitude gas voids form and fade away caused by liquid entrainment during whole sloshing process the vapor is condensed by the subcooled liquid with the decrease of the tank pressure there is a larger pressure decrease for the larger initial sloshing amplitude while for the variation of the free interface the effect of the interface phase change becomes increasingly obvious with the increase of the sloshing amplitude both the extreme point and the maximum difference point increase with the sloshing amplitude but two different points form in different times as for the condition without considering the interface phase change both the liquid pressure and the sloshing moment have relative stable fluctuation profiles while the interface phase change is considered in the numerical model the liquid pressure and the sloshing moment decrease with time moreover the fluctuation intensity increases with the initial

21636,in this study a numerical model is built to simulate the coupled process of fluid flow and thermal physical performance in a cryogenic liquid oxygen storage tank both the external heat leak and liquid vapor phase change are taken into consideration the convection thermal boundary is used to simulate the heat inputs the sinusoidal sloshing excitation is applied on the tank wall and realized by user defined functions moreover the mesh motion treatment is adopted and coupled with the volume of fluid model to predict the movement of the liquid vapor interface the pressure data during fluid sloshing is selected to validate the proposed numerical model which shows the present model has great accuracy in predicting fluid sloshing with the relative error being less than 5 0 the grid independence study is conducted as well calculated by the present numerical model the phase distribution is investigated with the dynamic monitors being set variations of the interface profiles are obviously displayed under different sloshing amplitudes it shows the initial sloshing amplitude has obvious influences on the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface during the whole sloshing process the vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid while for the effect of the phase change on variation of the free interface it becomes greatly prominent with the increase of the sloshing amplitude moreover with the consideration of interface phase change both the sloshing moment and liquid pressure decrease with time which is largely different from the parameter variations calculated without considering of the interface phase change with some valuable conclusions obtained the present study is significant to the in depth investigation on the non isothermal sloshing dynamic process in ocean engineering keywords dynamic variation interface shape liquid oxygen tank sloshing excitation 1 introduction liquid sloshing could result in negative effects on most applications for fuel storage in energy engineering ocean engineering and aerospace engineering fluid sloshing in fuel tanks usually leads to inevitable effects such as additional sloshing force vibration control failures and etc as cryogens are stored in low temperature small heat leaks could lead to serious fluid thermal stratification in addition liquid sloshing would cause undesired thermodynamic effects including the rapid pressure decline due to the enhancement of heat and mass transfer occurring at the liquid vapor interface as the thermal performance coupled with the sloshing dynamic process is greatly complex efficient prediction and controlling the motion of cryogenic propellants is vitally important to realize the safe operation of launch mission it is necessary to better understand the dynamic variation of the interface in non isothermal sloshing storage tanks related to the pure sloshing hydrodynamic phenomenon researchers have conducted extensive investigations it was reported the american nasa was the first to investigate the fluid sloshing dynamic behaviors in aerospace missions abramson 1966 starting in the later 1950s nasa conducted a lot of theoretical analysis and experimental investigations both the lateral sloshing force and moment were studied to measure the shape of interface ultrasonic technology barshan and baskent 2000 was used to test the distance between the liquid vapor interface and the ultrasonic source the shape of the liquid vapor interface was obtained by combing all the collected test data himeno et al 2005 2007 conducted sub scale experiments during the ballistic flight of the vehicle under the lateral acceleration of 0 8 g the motion of the free surface was recorded by a high speed camera rackl et al 2018 analyzed liquid sloshing with free floating robot dynamics and simulated the process as rigid body motion under the low gravity condition the relevant influence to the free floating robot dynamics was shown for slow motions moreover akyildiz 2012 numerically investigated liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank with a numerical algorithm based on the volume of fluid method the free surface elevation and variations of pressures were greatly presented to study fluid damping in a rectangular tank nayak and biswal 2015 investigated the natural frequency and damping with three configurations of vertical baffles it showed that the surface piercing wall mounted baffle has the best effect on sloshing damping similarly the effectiveness of baffles in suppressing pressure was also experimentally investigated by xue et al 2017 they found that altering natural frequency might be an effective method to reduce the impact pressure to study the influence of the induced excitations from wind or earthquake on liquefied natural gas storage tanks sanapala et al 2016 numerically investigated the sloshing dynamics in cryogenic storage tanks under a resonant harmonic excitation meanwhile the methodologies sanapala et al 2018 to control the sloshing forces and interface oscillations in a partially filled rectangular container were explored by adding a baffle on the tank wall researchers in florida institute of technology faure et al 2010 zhou et al 2012 have used a variety of internally developed and commercially numerical tools to simulate the sloshing dynamics to predict fluid sloshing storey 2016 conducted the ground based test in a spherical tank to characterize the damping effect sloshing mode frequencies and sloshing forces by using water and liquid nitrogen chu et al 2018 adopted a large eddy simulation model to research fluid sloshing in a water tank with multiple vertical baffles the results show that the natural frequency of the tank with multiple baffles has a direct relationship to the water depth the multiple baffles have great suppression effects on the hydrodynamic force when compared to the single baffle zhang et al 2019 investigated the anti sloshing effects of the floating foam by conducting analytical and experimental research xue et al 2019 used openfoam software to numerically investigate effects of the storage vessel shapes on sloshing dynamics under horizontal excitations it shows that the spherical tank has great suppressions on the impact pressure due to its curved surface when compared to the cylindrical tank recently the thermodynamic imbalance caused by liquid sloshing becomes the research hotspot due to the widely use of cryogenic fuels moran et al 1994 conducted sloshing experiments in a spherical liquid hydrogen tank to study influences of frequency and amplitude and thermal characteristics the tank pressure drop was observed in their experiments to study the interfacial mixing of the high temperature liquid and the bulk liquid arndt et al 2012 experimentally researched the coupled sloshing performance in a liquid nitrogen tank with three different pressurization modes without using water or cryogens das and hopfinger 2009 selected fc 72 and hfe7000 to study the thermal physical process under the axial sloshing excitation ludwig et al 2013 conducted detailed experiments with liquid nitrogen in a cylindrical tank the empirical correlation was proposed by fitting the nusselt number and reynolds number to reflect the relationship between the tank pressure drop and the sloshing characteristics konopka et al 2016 conducted experimental and numerical investigations on non isothermal sloshing in a liquid nitrogen tank they found that the damping factors were higher than the values calculated by semi empirical correlations focused on the sloshing pressure drop montsarrat 2017 built a two dimensional model to predict the sloshing thermodynamics in a liquid nitrogen tank as the turbulence in boundary layer was not considered in detail there were some prediction errors between the theoretical model and experiments grotle and æsøy 2017 established one numerical model to study the thermodynamic response in a sloshing liquefied natural gas tank with the openfoam software some fluid sloshing experiments were also conducted in a rectangular container with shallow liquid depths grotle et al 2017 with the interfacial area estimated in different sloshing regimes it showed that the interfacial area and the condensation mass flow rate were in phase especially for the most severe sloshing case thereafter grotle and æsøy 2018 developed a phenomenological model to predict the rapid tank pressure loss experienced onboard liquefied natural gas vessels as mentioned above researchers have conducted extensive investigations on fluid sloshing hydrodynamics while few are involved in the dynamic response of free interface in non isothermal sloshing tanks in this paper a numerical model is built to investigate the sloshing dynamic variation in a liquid oxygen tank with external heat leaks considered the sloshing excitation is realized by user defined functions meanwhile the interface fluctuation is accurately captured by the volume of fluid method coupled with the mesh motion treatment the influences of the sloshing amplitude on the phase distribution the elevation fluctuation of the liquid vapor interface the vapor pressure and vapor mass and the effect of the phase change on the variation of the interface area sloshing moment and liquid pressure are numerically investigated some valuable conclusions are achieved finally the present study is significant to the in depth understanding of the non isothermal sloshing 2 physical model a liquid oxygen tank is selected to be the research object as fig 1 shows it consists of a cylinder and top and bottom dished heads the diameter of the tank is 3 5 m and the heights of the cylinder and the top bottom dished head are 2 0 m and 1 5 m focused on the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface subjected to external sloshing excitation some actual configurations of the liquid oxygen tank are simplified the initial liquid height is 2 5 m with a level of 50 by volume as the coordinate center is located below the interface the initial liquid vapor interfacehas a y coordinate of 1 0 m as fig 1 shows the initial liquid temperature is set as 90 0 k to reduce obvious temperature jump a linear temperature profile of 90 0 k t 100 0 k is adopted in the vapor region at 1 0 m y 3 5 m the initial tank pressure is set to be 130 kpa and the external environment pressure and temperature are 1 0atm and 300 k respectively subjected to the ambient parts of heat leaks are penetrating into the liquid oxygen tank here the

as the tank wall has a small thickness its thermal insistence is ignored thus the value of t w is adopted with the temperature of liquid oxygen with the external air temperature of 300 k the fluid thermal properties could be solved once the convection heat transfer coefficient and external air temperature are determined the convection thermal boundary is adopted as fig 1 shows a sinusoidal sloshing excitation is applied on the tank wall for a cylindrical tank the related natural frequencies are given as follows first harmonic cylindrical tank 0 51 hz second harmonic cylindrical tank 0

is a constant with the value of 0 09 the standard k ε turbulence model has been proven to be effective in prediction of fluid sloshing in our previous research readers could refer to the previous investigations liu et al 2019 for details 3 2 mesh motion model in the present study the mesh motion method which can be used to model flows where the shape of the domain is changing with time due to motion on the domain boundaries is used to predict fluid sloshing both the fluid sloshing and pistons moving could be simulated by the mesh motion model the mesh motion model is activated and coupled with the vof model in the whole calculation region the governing equations are solved with respect to dynamic meshes the integral form of the conservation equation for a general scaler φ on an arbitrary control volume v whose boundary is moving can be written as 19 d d t v ρ φ d v v ρ φ u u g d a v γ φ d a v s φ d v where ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity vector u g is the mesh

the time step δ t as the above introductions have been introduced in some references the readers are suggested to refer to the user s guide of ansys fluent 2011 for details 3 3 numerical implementation the icem software is used for the model construction and grid generation for the present study the tank cylinder the top and the bottom dished head are all generated with the structured grids the commercial software ansys fluent 19 0 is used to predict the unsteady sloshing process with double precision solver the sharp interface model is adopted to predict the interface fluctuation second order upwind scheme is adopted to discretize the convective terms first order scheme is used to discretize the turbulent kinetic energy and the rate of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso pressure velocity coupling scheme is adopted to calculate the pressure field the presto scheme is acceptable to the volume fraction

fall below 10 3 10 3 and 10 6 for continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation respectively it is supposed to meet the convergence criteria 4 experimental validation the experimental data conducted by grotle and æsøy 2018 is selected to validate the present numerical model grotle and æsøy 2018 conducted fluid sloshing test in a transparent glass tank the test tank consists of a straight cylindrical section and two semi elliptic heads the diameter of the tank is 0 35 m and the length of the cylinder is 0 89 m as the test tank is arranged on a movable platform it could move across the rotate center driven by an electro motor and a crank mechanism compared to the tank radius the crank arm is long so the angle of the platform has an expression of θ asin 2πft the p8ap type pressure sensor is located in the middle of the tank water is selected to be the test fluid and the mean water depth in the tank is 50 in their experiments the tank pressure was specially measured in different sloshing frequencies thus comparisons are made between the measured pressure and the calculated pressure here three sloshing cases are used to validate the calculation model the tank pressure decline times of three cases are about 60s 20s and 6s calculated with the standard k ε model the result comparisons between the experiments and simulations are shown in fig 2 it is easy to see most of the simulated values are close to the experimental results although there are some differences between simulations and experimental results the relative errors between the experimental results and simulation values are in the range of 1 0 5 0 moreover the interface shape of cases no 2 and no 3 are also compared and shown in fig 3 it is easy to see the numerical model has greatly reflected the fluid sloshing hence the present numerical model is acceptable here four calculation grids are selected to test the mesh resolution with numbers of 29212 52380 82264 and 118260 with a sinusoidal excitation applied on the tank the grid independence study is conducted here the tank pressure during fluid sloshing is monitored the result comparison is shown in fig 4 it is easy to see that when the grid number increases to 52380 the calculated tank pressure almost keeps constant with small differences on the principle of reducing the computational resources and improving the calculation precision the mesh with 82264 cells is selected 5 results and discussion based on the numerical model above the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface is investigated under different sloshing amplitudes the phase distribution variations of the interface shape changes of the vapor pressure and mass and parameter comparisons between two cases are studied as well 5 1 liquid and vapor phase distribution under the influence of external excitation the counter acting force forms on the tank wall driven by external sloshing force liquid within the tank moves forth and back hence the interfacial shape changes correspondingly to clearly reflect the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface the phase distributions under different sloshing amplitudes are shown in fig 5 here the red and blue colors refer to the vapor and liquid as fig 5 shows liquid moves towards left side in 0 5s and the interface has a rightward tilt with the wave peak forming on left side and the wave trough on right side 1 0s later with spread of the sloshing wave both the wave peak and trough move towards the tank core parts of disturbances and interface fluctuations occur at two sides since 9 5s while it lasts for 19 5s four waves form in the interface shown as fig 5a while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 25 m shapes of the interface are almost the same as that of a 0 20 m as fig 5b shows there are obvious interface fluctuations from 9 5s when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 30 m the free interface has obvious fluctuations since 1 5s and the fluctuation elevations become increasingly large by comparing fig 5c e it is easy to see there are similar interface shapes in the same time for these three sloshing amplitudes the main difference is that the large initial sloshing amplitude condition usually has strong sloshing intensity and high elevation fluctuation as fig 5e shows influenced by the severe shaking liquid fluctuates and entrains with parts of vapor especially in 4 5s 14 5s and 19 5s serious interfacial fluctuations enhance the heat exchange between the high temperature vapor and the subcooled liquid which promotes the reduction of the tank pressure 5 2 variations of interface shape by setting dynamic monitor in motion mesh profiles of the free interface at different times are obviously reflected here the void fraction of 0 5 is selected to reflect the interface profile moreover the dynamic monitors are different from the fixed test points once the sloshing excitation is activated test points are varying with time with all test points combined the interface profile is formed in this section the interface profiles for sloshing amplitudes of 0 20 m 0 30 m and 0 40 m are selected and analyzed the variations of the interface profiles are shown in figs 6 8 subjected to external sloshing excitation liquid moves forth and back and this phenomenon has been clearly reflected in first 1 0s shown as fig 6a when the sloshing excitation is applied to the tank wall the opposite direction force is formed and driven liquid moving towards x direction the s type profile is forming in 0 1 0 4s it is in 0 5s that the liquid moves to left side with the largest elevation of 1 1008 m at x 1 688 m and the smallest elevation of 0 9155 m at x 1 6106 m afterwards the free surface fluctuates with the decrease of left side and the increase of right side this process lasts to 0 9s with the interface shape of z type it is about in 0 9s that the lowest elevation is achieved at x 1 7190 m with the value of 0 9193 m and the highest elevation is 1 1327 m at x 1 7190 m based on above descriptions it is easy to see the first interface fluctuation varies from s type profiles to z type profiles in 0 0 0 9s thereafter liquid fluctuates with left side moving upward and right side downward when it is in 1 0s the extreme elevations are 1 6416 m at x 1 1398 m and 0 9190 m at x 1 6106 m shown as the profile of 1 0s in fig 6a with fluctuations of the free interface different extreme points form as fig 6b shows three wave peak points and three trough points appear in the free surface during 1 1 2 0s with the spread of sloshing waves liquid flows from wave trough to peak or from wave peak to trough during this period fluid in left side reaches the wave peak again in 1 4s it takes about 0 5s to finish the movement from wave trough to wave peak meanwhile fluid in right side has an opposite fluctuating trend with the decrease of the elevation the free surface has a type of w profile afterwards liquid in left side moves down while it flows up in right side once the lowest elevation for the test point on left side is achieved in 1 9s the elevation increases again for the present profile the related three positive extreme points are 1 1310 m at x 1 75 m 1 0609 m at x 0 8827 m and 0 9652 m at x 1 2699 m while the negative extreme points are 1 0350 m at x 1 2544 m 0 9428 m at x 0 8518 m and 0 9143 m at x 1 7190 m respectively combing fig 6a and b it is easy to see more disturbances form in 1 1 2 0s this is because in first 1 0s the free surface still has a regular shape as the excitation applied for a short term 1 0s later fluid in left side moves from the highest elevation to the lowest elevation the wave peak spreads forwards in 0 5 0 9s as shown in fig 6a with the spread of sinusoidal wave wave peaks and troughs form gradually moreover it seems that elevations of the center monitor are always lower than the initial height of the free surface this is mainly because the liquid mass is distributed unevenly with liquid moving back and forth after 4 0s sloshing shapes of the free surface are shown in fig 6c as fig 6c shows with time continuing less liquid is distributed on two sides of the tank the center point of the free surface moves along the initial flat line moreover it seems that more serious disturbances occur at the free surface while the x coordinate is in the range of 0 5 1 0 m liquid moves up it is about in 4 9s the largest positive peak point is achieved with the value of 1 1456 m at x 1 75 m while the negative trough point is obtained at 5 0s with the value of 0 8821 m at x 1 7035 m the profiles of the free surface in 9 1 10 0s 14 1 15 0s and 19 1 20 0s are shown in fig 6d f after a long period of fluid sloshing the interface shape tends to be stable the interface profiles are almost symmetrically distributed however there are still many fluctuations and disturbances forming as time elapses in general elevations of fluid fluctuation tend to decrease and be relatively stable as described above it is easy to see variations of the interface profiles during sloshing are greatly reflected for case a 0 20 m there are monotonous interface profiles in the initial period with time continuing the sloshing excitation spreads forwards in the form of wave meanwhile the fluctuation amplitude tends to decrease with small extreme points while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 30 m the interface profiles are shown in fig 7 by comparing with fig 6 it is easy to see there are many similarities between two cases as fig 7a shows fluid moves towards left side and the sloping profile forms in 0 4s liquid reaches the highest point of left side since then it starts to move down it is about in 0 9s liquid arrives to the lowest point of left side correspondingly liquid in right side of the tank has an opposite movement trend this variation is similar to that of a 0 20 m with the s type profile forming in 0 1 0 4s and z type profile appearing in 0 5 0 9s with the spread of wave the largest peak point and trough point are achieved in 1 0s and 0 4s elevations of the related extreme points are 1 2065m at x 1 6106 m and 0 8579 m at x 1 7190 m shown as the profile of 1 0s in fig 7a after 1 0s sloshing more extreme points are formed subjected to sloshing wave liquid flows from wave trough to peak or from wave peak to trough as fig 7b shows three wave peak points and trough points appear in the free surface during 1 1 2 0s the free surface has the w or m type during this period fluid reaches the wave peak in left side in 1 4s about 0 5s later it finishes the movement from wave trough to wave peak while the fluid in right side has an opposite fluctuation trend with the amplitude of 0 30 m there are also three positive extreme points and three negative extreme points in the profile of 1 9s the positive extreme points are 1 2071m at x 1 75 m 1 0993 m at x 0 8208 m and 0 9503 m at x 1 2235 m while the negative extreme points are 1 0441 m at x 1 1615 m 0 9145 m at x 0 8363 m and 0 8856 m at x 1 7035 m respectively compared with fig 6b it is easy to see with the sloshing amplitude of 0 30 m there are larger positive extreme points and smaller negative extreme points during 1 1 2 0s fig 7c shows interface profiles in 4 1 5 0s during this period the free surface has large disturbances overall liquid moves from left to right with fluctuations in 4 9s the largest positive peak point is achieved with the value of 1 1984m at the right side while the negative trough point is obtained at 5 0s with the value of 0 8390 m at x 1 5332 m while for the interface profiles in 9 1 10 0s 14 1 15 0s and 19 1 20 0s large fluctuations occur as shown in fig 7d f compared to the profiles distribution in a 0 20 m large fluctuation amplitudes and disturbances appear in the present condition anyhow after long term sloshing variations of the interface shape tend to be stable and the whole types of interface profile are almost distributed symmetrically along the symmetry axis of the liquid oxygen tank fig 8 shows the interface profiles under the sloshing amplitude of 0 40 m as fig 8a and b show the free interface almost experiences similar variations in the first 2 0s as that of sloshing amplitudes of 0 20 m and 0 30 m the main differences are that there are larger fluctuation elevations for the sloshing amplitude of 0 40 m by combining fig 8a and b the fluctuation elevations are in the range of 0 815 1 301 m which is larger than the variation range of case a 0 20 m and a 0 30 m meanwhile under severe sloshing excitation more liquid is distributed on two sides of the tank there is a lower position for the middle interface point with the average value of 0 9567 m as shown in fig 8b fig 8c shows variations of the interface profiles in 4 1 5 0s during this period large disturbances form and occur different from figures above the vapor is entrained by the liquid by combing the interface profile and phase distribution in 4 5s it is easy to see a gas void is formed in x 0 5 m this phenomenon is mainly caused by the liquid entrainment which is also obviously shown in 4 1 4 4s as marked by the red rectangular while for the profile in 5 0s liquid has a high elevation and the entrainment is forming as the falling down of fluid moreover caused by liquid entrainment serious fluid fluctuations and disturbances occur at the interface along with large elevations when it lasts for 10 0s the interface profile is shown in fig 8d the largest elevation appears in 9 6s with the value of 1 2354 m at x 0 2013m afterwards the peak point moves forwards right direction fig 8e shows the interface profiles during 14 1 15 0s in this period fluid sloshing is drastic and liquid entrainment becomes frequent correspondingly as fig 8e shows the interface profile with a separate circle appears at different times this phenomenon is obviously reflected by the interface profiles of 14 5s 14 6s and 15 0s in fig 8e while the vapor void is pressing out by the liquid there is no separate circle anyhow this phenomenon reflects the violent disturbance caused by external excitation for the present period the largest elevation is achieved in 15 0s with the value of 1 2731 m fig 8f shows variations of the free interface in 19 1 20 0s it is easy to see the free interface has strong dynamic responses subjected to the sloshing excitation with the spread of fluid wave parts of kinetic energy are accumulated on the center of the tank which drives the fluid s fluctuation forms the wave peak and promotes the liquid entrainment along with the formation and disappearance of gas voids the free interface has experienced severe and extensive fluctuations and disturbances as mentioned above it is easy to see the sloshing amplitude has caused obvious influences on the interface shape and phase distribution when the sloshing amplitude is less than a certain value there are almost the same phase distributions and interface profiles when the sloshing amplitude increases to a certain value obvious disturbances and fluctuations appear with large fluctuation elevations meanwhile for cases with large sloshing amplitude liquid entrainment occurs with the development and annihilation of the gas void 5 3 sloshing thermal performance subjected to external heat leaks thermal performance in the liquid oxygen tank is studied here variations of the vapor pressure and vapor mass are briefly introduced one pressure test point is set in the vapor region with the coordinate of 0 2 0 variations of the vapor pressure in different sloshing amplitudes are monitored and shown in fig 9 as the initial tank pressure is 130 kpa and the initial liquid temperature is 90 0 k liquid oxygen has a subcooled degree of 2 641 k and vapor is superheated once the external sinusoidal excitation is activated liquid moves forth and back so the liquid vapor connection area becomes large the intensive heat and mass transfer occurs between the liquid and vapor especially when the vapor is entrained by the liquid thus the vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid as fig 9 shows the vapor pressure decreases almost linearly when the sloshing amplitude ranges from 0 2 m to 0 3 m the related pressure values of the vapor test point reduce from 128 654 kpa to 124 869 kpa 124 584 kpa and 124 213 kpa respectively the corresponding pressure decrease rates are 189 25 pa s 203 5 pa s and 222 05 pa s with the sloshing amplitude increasing from 0 20 m to 0 30 m when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m some pressure fluctuations appear the vapor pressure still decreases linearly in the first 15s for the amplitude of 0 35 m then a rapid pressure decline appears along with fluctuations as for the case a 0 40 m the pressure disturbance appears in 10 0s about 5 0s earlier than that of the case a 0 35 m the vapor pressure fluctuations are mainly caused by intensive liquid fluctuations when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m liquid travels from left to right and serious mixings and disturbances occur which greatly promotes the heat and mass transfer between the liquid and vapor hence there is a rapid vapor pressure decrease for cases of a 0 35 m and a 0 40 m the final pressures are 122 946 kpa and 121 951 kpa therefore large initial sloshing amplitude would lead to large vapor pressure decrease during the whole sloshing process the high temperature vapor is cooled by the subcooled liquid as fig 10 shows the mass of vapor decreases with time as fluid sloshing promotes the heat and mass exchange between the liquid and vapor more vapor condensation occurs in the case of larger sloshing amplitudes for case a 0 20 m the vapor mass decreases from 40 4034 kg to 39 8924 kg when the amplitude increases from 0 25 m to 0 40 m the final values of four cases are 39 7921 kg 39 6752 kg 39 4144 kg and 39 1676 kg respectively hence the vapor condensation amount increases with the initial sloshing amplitude 5 4 effect of the interface phase change 5 4 1 comparison on the interface area once the external excitation is imposed on the tank wall fluid within the tank makes reciprocating motion which leads to the increase of the contact area between the vapor and liquid to effectively predict the fluid fluctuation the test point is set to monitor the average area of the free interface the initial flat area of the interface is adopted with the expression of a 0 π d l while the external excitation is activated the interface has a curve surface its perimeter treats as p so the interfacial area has an expression of a p l here l means the unit length fig 11 shows comparisons of interface area calculated with and without considering the interfacial phase change as fig 11 shows it is easy to see that the free interface is always fluctuating from fig 11a it seems the interface areas of two conditions are almost the same that is to say the effect of the phase change is slight on the interface area while the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 25 m and 0 30 m some clear differences appear as figs 11b and c show the effect of the phase change becomes obvious since 11 2s meanwhile some slight differences also form during 6 0 7 5s when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 35 m and 0 40 m the phase change causes obvious effects on the interface fluctuation from fig 11d and e the difference of the interface area of two conditions generates since 3 7s as for amplitude of 0 40 m the difference of the interface area of two conditions becomes more obvious from 14 1s shown as fig 11e based on fig 11 it is verified again that the interface fluctuation becomes increasingly obvious with the increase of the sloshing amplitude here the value of the area ratio is selected to compare the effect of the phase change on the interface fluctuation table 1 lists the extreme value of the interface area ratio between two conditions from table 1 it is easy to see the area ratio of the extreme point increases with the sloshing amplitudes when the sloshing amplitude increases from 0 20 m to 0 40 m the area ratio increases from 1 01325 to 1 32347 for conditions calculated with the phase change considered moreover the difference between two cases also increases with sloshing amplitude when the sloshing amplitude is set to be 0 20 m the difference of two cases is only 0 00005 while it increases to 0 03489 for amplitude of 0 40 m as for the occurring time of the extreme point it s not regular this also explains the unstable and random nature of fluid sloshing except for the extreme value of the interface area ratio the maximum difference of the interface area ratio between two conditions is also monitored and shown in table 2 based on table 2 it is obvious to see the maximum difference of area ratio also increase with the sloshing amplitude with the amplitude increase from 0 20 m to 0 40 m the difference increases from 0 000146 to 0 059320 by comparing tables 1 and 2 it is easy to see the extreme point and the maximum difference points are formed in different times this phenomenon proves the randomness of fluid sloshing again 5 4 2 comparison on the sloshing moment and fluid pressure except for the fluctuation of the free interface the sloshing moment and fluid pressure are also compared between conditions with and without considering the interface phase change fig 12 shows comparison on the sloshing moment of two cases it is easy to see both have fluctuation profiles when the interface phase change is considered in the prediction model the sloshing moment suffered by the storage tank decreases with time while the interface phase change is not considered in the calculation model the sloshing moment fluctuates along a constant line this is mainly because while the phase change is not taken into account the liquid mass keeps constant hence the liquid within the tank makes reciprocating motion which is almost a rigid body motion as for the condition with considering the interface phase change the mass transfer occurs between the liquid and vapor regions and it increases the damping effect between the liquid and the storage tank therefore the sloshing moment calculated in the case with considering the interface phase change has decrease profiles moreover based on fig 12 it is easy to see there are large fluctuation waves for the large initial sloshing amplitude fig 13 shows comparison of the liquid pressure between two cases the liquid pressure monitor is set below the interface with the coordinate of 0 0 5 it is easy to see there are obvious differences between two cases while the interface phase change is considered the thermal energy transfers from the vapor to liquid driven by temperature difference under the promoting effects of phase change and fluid sloshing the vapor pressure decreases with time due to the loss of thermal energy correspondingly the liquid pressure experiences a reduction profile when the external sloshing excitation is applied to the tank as shown in fig 13a the liquid pressure fluctuates from 147 1 kpa to 143 2 kpa while for the case without considering the interface phase change the liquid pressure experiences stable pressure fluctuations along the pressure line of 146 5 kpa as fig 13b shows the fluctuation range of the liquid pressure monitor is 147 3 145 5 kpa this is mainly because there is only sensible heat exchange between the liquid and vapor region although parts of thermal energy transfer from the vapor to liquid the vapor obtains some penetrations as well overall speaking the vapor is in thermal balance or may obtain a little more thermal energy from outside based on fig 13b it seems that the pressure has slight increase during fluid sloshing based on figs 11 13 it is obvious to see that the interface phase change has caused obvious effects on the interface fluctuation variations of the fluid pressure and the sloshing moment hence the thermal physical process during fluid sloshing should be given more attention 6 conclusions in this paper a numerical model is built to predict the dynamic variation of the liquid vapor interface in a liquid oxygen tank both the heat invasion and external sinusoidal excitation are considered the experimental validation is made against the sloshing experiment data the relative calculation errors between the calculated values and experiment data are less than 5 0 meanwhile the mesh sensitivity verification is conducted based on the developed numerical model the influence of the sloshing amplitude is studied on the sloshing dynamic process variations of vapor pressure and vapor mass are studied and compared in different sloshing amplitudes it showed the sloshing amplitude has great effects on the interface shape and the phase distribution the dynamic response of the liquid vapor interface is greatly reflected by monitoring the interfacial variation when the sloshing amplitude is less than 0 30 m there are similar phase distributions and fluctuating interface profiles when the sloshing amplitude increases to 0 40 m large disturbances and mixings occur at the interface along with high elevations moreover with large sloshing amplitude gas voids form and fade away caused by liquid entrainment during whole sloshing process the vapor is condensed by the subcooled liquid with the decrease of the tank pressure there is a larger pressure decrease for the larger initial sloshing amplitude while for the variation of the free interface the effect of the interface phase change becomes increasingly obvious with the increase of the sloshing amplitude both the extreme point and the maximum difference point increase with the sloshing amplitude but two different points form in different times as for the condition without considering the interface phase change both the liquid pressure and the sloshing moment have relative stable fluctuation profiles while the interface phase change is considered in the numerical model the liquid pressure and the sloshing moment decrease with time moreover the fluctuation intensity increases with the initial

21637,to ensure the dimensional accuracy of fillet welded structures of a cantilever beam triangle reinforcement plate stiffeners trps are employed to prevent welding distortion however this increases the weight of a structure in this study an efficient finite element fe computation was used to solve the afore mentioned engineering problem the inherent deformations of typical welded joints in a mock up welded structure were estimated through thermal elastic plastic fe tep fe analysis subsequently welding distortion of the mock up welded structure was computed via elastic fe analysis wherein the inherent deformation was applied as a mechanical load specifically the inherent deformation of a bevel fillet welded joint was initially estimated and its precision was verified the computed z direction welding displacement of a flange plate in the mock up welded structure was in good agreement with the measured values hence it was evident that trps mitigated the welding deflection of the flange plate a series of elastic fe computations showed that the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate in an actual welded structure does not increase however the total weight of the actual welded structure apparently decreases when the position and number of trps are optimized keywords welding distortion prevention inherent deformation elastic fe analysis triangle reinforcement plate stiffener lightweight fabrication 1 introduction recently jack up drilling rigs have been progressively applied to extract offshore crude oil and natural gas owing to their flexible characteristics in service the cantilever beam is the most important part of the jack up drilling rig and is used to support the drilling derricks and other equipment wang et al 2017a fabrication precision in particular out of plane welding distortion of a cantilever beam is an essential factor due to its sliding performance in service its weight also plays a significant role on the load capability of the leg and design strength to ensure the dimensional accuracy and prevent welding distortion of an actual fillet welded structure as shown in fig 1 triangle reinforcement plate stiffeners trps are usually used to enhance structure rigidity during the fabrication of the main component of the cantilever beam as shown in fig 2 welding distortions are usually determined by welding heat input material properties and plate thickness furthermore constraints due to stiffeners prevent out of plane welding distortion with increasing of the weight of the actual welded structure and the fabrication procedure zhou and wang 2019 however stiffeners may not be fully removed after welding thus the fabrication cost and structural weight increases therefore the weight of the fillet welded structure under examination should be considered not only during the production process but also during the design stage if welding distortion can be predicted with acceptable accuracy before the fabrication stage then lightweight welded structures with the required fabrication precision can be developed hence it is necessary to eventually examine the influence of trps on the structural stiffness and fabrication precision and thereby optimize the number of trps that lead to lightweight fabrication without fabrication precision loss with the rapid development of computer and numerical analysis technology finite element method fem has become a powerful and effective tool to simulate welding distortion of a welded structure generally two methods are used to predict welding distortion in engineering applications the first method involves thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis wherein the welding process is considered to exhibit transient non linear behavior for simple welded joints because of its high requirement of computer resources the other method involves elastic finite element fe analysis with plastic strain inherent strain as the input load brown brown and song 1992 employed both two and three dimensional 2d and 3d finite element models of a circular cylinder and ring stiffened structure to investigate the effect of welding parameters such as weld gap clearance and fixture on fabrication accuracy of the examined large structure michaleris and debiccari 1997 presented a numerical analysis technique that combined 2d welding simulation with 3d structural analyses their technique is effective when computer resources are limited camilleri et al 2005 examined the applicability of finite element analysis for out of plane welding distortion prediction transient thermal analysis was performed on a 2d cross section of a welded joint furthermore transverse angular deformation and longitudinal contraction forces were predicted these results were then applied to a non linear elastic finite element model to predict the final overall deformations of the butt welded plates following numerous experimental observations and computations welding inherent strain was proposed and employed for predicting welding residual stress ueda et al 1989 ueda et al ueda and yuan 1989 also concluded that welding inherent strain was the source of welding deformation and welding residual stress in welded joints subsequently wang et al wang and lu 2000 predicted welding deformation using elastic finite element fe analysis based on welding inherent strains which were assumed to be distributed in the weld vicinity based on experimental data and numerical analysis they indicated that the longitudinal and transverse inherent strains were the most important factors that affected welding deformation furthermore luo et al 2006 proposed a numerical method to predict residual deformation based on welding inherent strain the advantage of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing the computed welding deformation to the experimental data subsequently a two step computational approach combined with tep fe analysis and elastic fe analysis was widely employed to examine welding distortion of a ship structure murakawa et al 2010 welding inherent deformation was estimated in detail in advance via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis it was then applied as a mechanical load during elastic fe analysis to predict welding distortion wang et al 2013 2015 systematically examined the generation mechanism with inherent deformation theory and elastic fe analysis by concentrating on the out of plane welding distortion of thin plate welded structures they also indicated that strengthening via line heating can be employed to mitigate out of plane distortions such as bending and buckling ma et al 2016 later proposed a combined computational approach which involves thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis eigenvalue analysis and elastic finite element fe analysis to predict out of plane welding distortion of stiffened welded structures additionally flame heating was employed and considered numerically for mitigating out of plane welding distortion wang et al 2017a examined the welding distortion of the cantilever beam in jack up drilling rig via elastic finite element fe analysis based on inherent deformation theory based on the accurately computed results several welding distortion mitigation techniques such as inverse distortion welding sequence influence tack welding and mechanical fixture were implemented lee et al 2018 developed an efficient approach to predict welding angular distortion of large welded structures by using scalar input variables in which the explicit form of the force matrix was derived to transform the input variables according to the mesh size the proposed method demonstrated good prediction results for various cases by efficiently predicting welding angular distortions hence the aforementioned studies suggest that the welding distortion problems of large welded structures are typically investigated using an advanced computational approach however there is a paucity of studies that consider the light weight of an actual fillet welded structure of a cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig this is an essential engineering problem for offshore structures hence in this study lightweight fabrication of a fillet welded structure was examined along with simultaneous prevention of welding distortion by considering the geometrical profiles of typical welded joints and corresponding welding conditions the welding inherent deformations of various types of welded joints in mock up welded structure were evaluated by using the integration method of inherent strains which were obtained via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis after validating the accuracy of welding inherent deformation elastic fe computation of the mock up welded structure was performed wherein the welding inherent deformation was used as the mechanical load subsequently the influence of trps on welding deflection of the flange plate in the mock up welded structure was numerically examined the results exhibited good agreement between computed results and measurements furthermore lightweight fabrication of the examined mock up welded structure was investigated by considering the position and number of trps additionally the prevention of welding deflection along with lightweight fabrication of an actual fillet welded structure was also discussed 2 computational method for welding distortion prediction to investigate lightweight fabrication of an actual fillet welded structure of cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of its dimensions during welding hence an efficient computational method for predicting welding distortion is required thus a method that can perform elastic fe analysis and predict inherent deformations was proposed given that a welded joint in a plate structure has an inherent amount of local deformation due to welding welding distortion can be computed via elastic fe analysis with a shell element fe model of the examined welded structure in this analysis welding inherent deformations were applied as mechanical load to the welding lines between the plates that were welded together 2 1 tep fe method to evaluate welding inherent deformation transient non linear tep fe analysis is typically employed for computing welding transient temperature plastic strain and welding displacement of typical welded joint hence two physical processes based on thermal behavior and mechanical responses were considered radaj 1992 specifically an uncoupled thermal mechanical analysis was considered because a thermal process exhibits a decisive effect on mechanical response ma et al 2016 therefore the computational procedure included two steps the first step was thermal analysis wherein the temperature history at each node in the finite element model was calculated by solving the transient non linear heat transfer equation based on the welding conditions and thermal boundary conditions the temperature dependent thermal properties such as thermal conductivity specific heat and density were considered in this process additionally double ellipsoid heat source model and goldak heat source model were widely used to simulate the heat source of the welding arc goldak and akhlaghi 2005 subsequently the next step involved performing mechanical analysis by applying transient temperature field as a thermal load this was performed to compute residual stress plastic strain and welding displacement of welded similarly temperature dependent mechanical properties such as yield stress and young s modulus were used for mechanical analysis additionally boundary condition to fix the rigid body motion of the welded joint was considered and applied 2 2 inherent deformation theory during the welding process the total strain can be divided into elastic strain thermal strain plastic strain creep strain and strain due to phase transformation as shown in eq 1 additionally inherent strain can be considered as the sum of all the strains except for elastic strain which is considered as the elementary cause of welding distortion typically creep strain and strain due to phase transformation are often ignored because of their low magnitudes and thermal strain disappears as the welding temperature cools down to room temperature ueda et al 2013 therefore welding plastic strain is approximately considered as the dominant component of the inherent strain in engineering applications 1 ε t o t a l ε e l a s t i c ε t h e r m a l ε p h a s e ε p l a s t i c ε c r e e p due to the distributed characteristic of the welding inherent strain welding inherent deformation was proposed there are four components of welding inherent deformation namely longitudinal shrinkage δ x transverse shrinkage δ y longitudinal bending θ x and transverse bending θ y which are defined in eqs 2 and 3 and evaluated via integrating the inherent strain the magnitude of the welding inherent deformation can be considered as constant when the end effect is ignored wang et al 2015 with respect to a large welded structure the effect of weld length and width of inherent deformation can be neglected vega et al 2007 therefore elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load can be employed for predicting welding distortion without losing significant accuracy 2 δ x 1 h ε x d y d z δ y 1 h ε y d y d z 3 θ x 12 h 3 z h 2 ε x d y d z θ y 12 h 3 z h 2 ε y d y d z where h denotes the thickness of the welded joint x y and z denote the welding direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively specifically longitudinal inherent shrinkage is converted to longitudinal shrinkage force and tendon force due to the strong self constraint in the welding line direction the relationship between tendon force and longitudinal inherent shrinkage can be described by the following formula wang et al 2017b 4 f t e n d o n e ε x d a e h 1 h ε x d a e h δ x 3 mock up fillet welded structure and measurements to ensure the dimensional accuracy of an actual fillet welded structure of cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig a mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 was fabricated in advance and the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate was measured fig 3 shows a detailed geometrical profile of each component in the examined mock up welded structure as follows a web plate 900 mm 900 mm 32 mm with weight of 202 2 kg a flange plate 870 mm 900 mm 76 mm with weight of 454 2 kg two bevel v plates 585 mm 900 mm 32 mm with a total weight of 252 8 kg and 6 trps 238 mm 450 mm 32 mm with a total weight of 91 4 kg during the actual fabrication the flange plate was fixed by four clamps in advance sequentially web plate and flange plate were welded first and marked as t1 in fig 3 trps were then welded to flange plate and web plate and marked as t2 and t3 respectively subsequently bevel v plates were welded to flange plate and web plate and marked as b1 and b2 respectively additionally as shown trps were not removed after complete welding of bevel v plates and thus the weight of the structure was evidently increased fig 4 provides an actual view of the welding procedure used for the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure an eq63 grade material was used for the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure the chemical composition of the material is listed in table 1 and the temperature dependent thermal and mechanical properties of eq63 are shown in fig 5 flux cored arc welding fcaw was practiced with gfr 110k3 as the filling metal furthermore shielded metal arc welding smaw was also applied wherein nsswl 805n was used as the filling metal welding conditions are summarized in table 2 each welded joint was preheated to 150 c by using the insulation cotton and the interlayer temperature was maintained at 150 c during multi pass welding subsequently the temperature was decreased after the welding procedure was completed and the interlayer temperature was simultaneously measured via an infrared radiation thermometer the welding was restarted when the temperature and interlayer temperature were approximately 150 c during the welding experiment during the fabrication of the examined mock up fillet welded structure the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate was measured the measured points on the flange plate were examined they were distributed 900 mm along the horizontal direction and 870 mm along the vertical direction their positions are indicated in fig 6 furthermore fig 6 shows that there are 30 marked points for 5 a e measured groups with a measurement matrix as shown in fig 7 the welding displacements of the 30 measured points in the z direction were recorded the measurements are summarized in table 3 as per the fabrication procedure specifically t1 t2 and t3 denote t welded joints in the mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 between web and flange plates trps and flange plate and trps and web plate respectively furthermore b1 and b2 denote bevel welded joints in mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 between bevel and flange plate and bevel and web plate respectively furthermore out of plane welding displacements of the measured points a0 a5 b0 b5 c0 c5 d0 d5 e0 e5 after each welding procedure as indicated in fig 6 are sequentially obtained and summarized in table 3 4 establishment of an inherent deformation database before the elastic fe analysis of the mock up fillet welded structure an inherent deformation database of typical welded joints for the examined welded structure should be established as mentioned above welding inherent deformation is obtained by integrating inherent strain which can be obtained via transient non linear tep fe computation specifically welding inherent stains are mainly determined via material properties plate thickness welding process and types of welded joints the welding transient temperature of each typical fillet welded joint was computed in advance given that the inherent strain is determined by the highest welding temperature and self constraint supported by the surrounding base materials typical welded joints in the examined mock up fillet welded structure are classified and their brick solid elements with 8 nodes in the fe model are demonstrated in fig 8 which will be used for later tep fe computation with an in house program wang et al 2015 all typical welded joints are assembled with fillet welding and different colors are used to represent the welding passes as shown in fig 8 to improve the computational efficiency the length of the fe model for each typical welded joint was assumed as 300 mm for avoiding the end effect the total number of elements and nodes for each typical welded joint are also indicated in fig 8 furthermore fig 8 shows the boundary conditions for mechanical analysis the boundary conditions prevent rigid body motion 4 1 thermal analysis of typical welded joints during the thermal analysis of typical fillet welded joints the initial temperature was generally assumed as ambient temperature to represent the welding heat input of the moving arc during welding the volumetric heat source model with uniform density distribution was employed while welding arc energy was determined via welding current voltage speed and welding heat efficiency based on the experiment the initial temperature was set to 150 c for first welding pass via the preheating process subsequently the computation of the welding temperature for other welding passes was restarted when the cooling temperature of the previous welding process reached 150 c during thermal elastic plastic fe analysis specifically the computed temperature also decreases when considering the thermal convection and radiation after the completion of the welding procedure furthermore transient temperature was recorded and determined to restart a new welding procedure when the computed temperature during cooling approximately reached 150 c when shielded metal arc welding smaw was numerically considered the heat efficiency was assumed as 0 6 and the heat efficiency for flux cored arc welding fcaw during thermal analysis was assumed as 0 7 dupont and marder 1995 furthermore heat loss due to the physical characteristic of heat convection and radiation was also considered thermal analysis was used to evaluate the temperature field at each welding step and it was applied as thermal loading for subsequent mechanical analysis therefore the computed results of thermal analysis were validated by checking the predicted welding pool for each typical welded joint t1 t2 t3 and b1 b2 as shown in fig 9 transient temperature distributions of last welding pass in each typical welded joint are demonstrated and maximal temperature region as well as predicted welded zone are also shown hence the predicted welding pool was in good agreement with the designed welding groove 4 2 distribution of plastic strain given that the computed temperature fields above were used as thermal loading the mechanical response including residual stress and plastic strain can be examined via mechanical analysis during the welding process hence temperature dependent material properties and mechanical analysis constraints were considered given that the out of plane welding distortion of a flange plate is mainly due to transverse bending moment the magnitude and distribution of welding induced transverse plastic strains in each typical fillet welded joint were investigated as shown in fig 10 plotting contours of residual transverse plastic strain on middle cross section are shown and their magnitudes are also obtained additionally residual transverse plastic strain is shown in the region close to the welding pass with an un uniform distribution the welding inherent deformation for each typical welded joint can be evaluated via the integration method as defined in eqs 2 and 3 by using the computed transverse plastic strains subsequently they were applied for elastic fe analysis for predicting welding distortion 4 3 inherent deformation database during the welding process welding plastic strain ε x p ε y p is the main component of the inherent strain when compared to other strains hence the inherent deformation of each typical welded joint can be estimated by integrating welding plastic strain ueda et al 2013 thus inherent deformation magnitudes of each typical fillet welded joint were obtained as summarized in table 4 they were mainly determined by welding process material properties types of welded joint and plate thickness they were not dependent on the welded joint size additionally the longitudinal inherent bending was usually ignored because of its much lower magnitude 4 4 inherent deformation validation of bevel fillet welded joint in this study welding inherent deformation of bevel fillet welded joint b1 or b2 was evaluated first it is necessary to validate its precision before it is applied for elastic fe analysis hence out of plane welding distortion predicted via elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation as input loading was compared to that predicted via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe computation the results exhibited good agreement thus the precision of the estimated inherent deformation of bevel fillet welded joint was confirmed in fig 8 e the b2 welded joint was considered as an example hence the out of plane welding distortion was predicted via elastic fe analysis wherein the evaluated inherent deformation was used as an input points on line1 and line2 as illustrated in fig 8 e are considered here line1 is the middle transverse line and line2 is the welding line as shown in fig 11 the distribution and magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions of points on line1 and line2 predicted via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis and elastic fe analysis exhibit good agreement therefore the aforementioned estimated inherent deformation of the bevel fillet welded joint is accurate and can be applied for predicting welding distortion of the examined mock up fillet welded structure 5 welding distortion prediction of mock up fillet welded structure the inherent deformations as summarized in table 4 are applied as mechanical load for the elastic fe analysis hence the welding distortion of the mock up fillet welded structure can be easily computed by considering the actual welding sequence the fe model with 4 nodes shell elements is created for elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as mechanical load as shown in fig 12 by using an identical geometrical profile of the examined mock up fillet welded structure the model contains 10 welded parts the total number of points and elements were 5140 and 5 045 respectively furthermore the boundary conditions to prevent rigid body motion of the fe model are also employed as shown in fig 12 in the model adjacent parts with different colors are welded together hence the interface element automatically creates a welding line the aforementioned inherent deformations as summarized in table 4 are used to perform elastic fe analysis for computing the welding distortion of the mock up fillet welded structure during the elastic fe analysis the constraint effect of trps were also considered 5 1 effect of trps on welding distortion the weight of the mock up fillet welded structure increases because trps cannot be removed after welding hence before optimizing the number and position of trps it is necessary to examine the effect of trps on the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate during the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure thus the effect of trps on the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate was numerically examined in advance as shown in fig 13 contour plots of out of plane welding distortion without and with trps are illustrated as evident from the figure the flange plate of the mock up fillet welded structure deforms without trps when compared with that with trps as shown in fig 14 a uniform distribution of out of plane welding distortion for points on welding line with a magnitude of 1 8 mm can be observed however a significantly less magnitude of approximately 0 5 mm of out of plane welding distortion was obtained with trps the underlying mechanism for this can be explained by the enhancement in structural rigidity due to the application of trps and thereby the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate is reduced significantly therefore it can be concluded that trps play a significant role in fixing the position of the weld parts and controlling the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate 5 2 welding deflection prediction and validation based on the actual assembling process contour plots of z direction welding displacement of the examined mock up fillet welded structure generated via elastic fe analysis is illustrated in fig 15 to further compare the out of plane welding distortion between elastic fe computation and experimental measurement z direction welding displacements of points on the welding line marked as c0 c5 in fig 15 are obtained and compared to the measured data as shown in fig 16 the computed z direction welding displacement exhibits good agreement with experimental results and the magnitude tolerance is in the acceptable range for engineering application thus welding distortion of the examined mock up fillet welded structure can be accurately predicted via elastic fe analysis by using the welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load 6 lightweight fabrication with optimization of trps the investigation of welding distortion of examined mock up fillet welded structure indicates that trps play a significant role in out of plane welding distortion mitigation with increasing weight in order to reduce the structural weight of examined mock up fillet welded structure four plans with different number of trps and positions were designed and examined detailed information on the position and number of trps in each designed plan was indicated in fig 17 boundary conditions to prevent rigid body motion in each plan is also illustrated in fig 17 by using the welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load z direction welding displacements of each designed plan were computed via elastic fe analysis hence the results are presented as contour plots in fig 18 furthermore points on the welding line marked as c0 c5 in fig 15 are considered again and the out of plane welding distortion of these points are compared as shown in fig 19 the distribution of z direction welding displacements with trps for plans c and d are almost identical however the distributions of z direction welding displacements with trps for plans c and b are evidently different thus four trps as per plan c were enough to control the welding distortion when compared to that as per plan b with two trps hence plan c with less trps when compared to plan d with five trps was an optimized option for examined mock up fillet welded structure thereby ensuring fabrication precision and lightweight fabrication as mentioned earlier trps can enhance the structural rigidity and mitigate out of plane welding distortion hence actual fillet welded structure is fabricated with trps as shown in fig 20 however an increase in the number of trps will also increase the weight and additional operation costs in a service period therefore a series of elastic fe analysis as mentioned above were performed to optimize the number and position of trps for both fabrication precision and lightweight fabrication in this optimization constraints due to trps were also considered shell elements fe model of actual fillet welded structure is employed as shown in fig 21 the model has 30 trps in the current fabrication procedure the length of the actual fillet welded structure is 4500 mm which is five times the length of the previous examined mock up fillet welded structure the effect of trps on out of plane welding distortion was numerically examined and the trps were symmetrically located based on the design of actual fillet welded structure as shown in fig 21 five cases of trps design with 2 6 10 12 and 16 trps are considered during the elastic fe analysis of the actual fillet welded structure in all the designs rigid body motion is prevented by using the appropriate boundary conditions contour plots of out of plane welding distortions of actual fillet welded structure with different trps designs are computed as shown in fig 21 as mentioned earlier elastic fe analysis was employed with welding inherent deformation as mechanical loading however a comparison of the magnitudes of welding distortion for different trps designs is not clearly evident hence to further compare the difference in out of plane welding distortion with different trps designs points on the welding line which is indicated in fig 21 with a black dashed line were selected fig 22 shows the comparison of out of plane welding distortion of points on the welding line distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion for design with 12 trps exhibited significant difference with the design with 10 trps and designs with much lower number of trps additionally distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion for the design with 12 trps was almost identical to the design with 16 trps this implies that the design with 12 trps is strong enough to ensure fabrication precision and is an optimal choice for lightweight fabrication furthermore total out of plane welding distortions of the examined points and weights of trps used in different trps designs are also compared as shown in fig 23 the results indicate that the total welding deflection approximately corresponds to a constant magnitude and the weight increases linearly with the increase in the number of trps hence the number of trps in an actual fillet welded structure can be reduced from 30 current design to 12 without loss in fabrication precision thus the structural weight of the actual fillet welded structure can be reduced by 274 14 kg with a decrease in the amount of welding procedures therefore the accuracy of the dimensions of the actual fillet welded structure can be ensured and lightweight fabrication of the structure can be achieved via trps optimization 7 conclusions in this study out of plane welding distortion of a mock up fillet welded structure was examined via experimental tests and computational analysis a comparison of the computed results and measurements indicated good agreement triangle reinforcement plate stiffener trps optimization for lightweight fabrication without loss of fabrication precision was demonstrated on mock up and actual fillet welded structures the following conclusions were obtained 1 typical welded joints were examined for inherent deformation evaluation first bevel fillet welded joint was examined and the precision of its inherent deformation was confirmed 2 elastic fe

21637,to ensure the dimensional accuracy of fillet welded structures of a cantilever beam triangle reinforcement plate stiffeners trps are employed to prevent welding distortion however this increases the weight of a structure in this study an efficient finite element fe computation was used to solve the afore mentioned engineering problem the inherent deformations of typical welded joints in a mock up welded structure were estimated through thermal elastic plastic fe tep fe analysis subsequently welding distortion of the mock up welded structure was computed via elastic fe analysis wherein the inherent deformation was applied as a mechanical load specifically the inherent deformation of a bevel fillet welded joint was initially estimated and its precision was verified the computed z direction welding displacement of a flange plate in the mock up welded structure was in good agreement with the measured values hence it was evident that trps mitigated the welding deflection of the flange plate a series of elastic fe computations showed that the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate in an actual welded structure does not increase however the total weight of the actual welded structure apparently decreases when the position and number of trps are optimized keywords welding distortion prevention inherent deformation elastic fe analysis triangle reinforcement plate stiffener lightweight fabrication 1 introduction recently jack up drilling rigs have been progressively applied to extract offshore crude oil and natural gas owing to their flexible characteristics in service the cantilever beam is the most important part of the jack up drilling rig and is used to support the drilling derricks and other equipment wang et al 2017a fabrication precision in particular out of plane welding distortion of a cantilever beam is an essential factor due to its sliding performance in service its weight also plays a significant role on the load capability of the leg and design strength to ensure the dimensional accuracy and prevent welding distortion of an actual fillet welded structure as shown in fig 1 triangle reinforcement plate stiffeners trps are usually used to enhance structure rigidity during the fabrication of the main component of the cantilever beam as shown in fig 2 welding distortions are usually determined by welding heat input material properties and plate thickness furthermore constraints due to stiffeners prevent out of plane welding distortion with increasing of the weight of the actual welded structure and the fabrication procedure zhou and wang 2019 however stiffeners may not be fully removed after welding thus the fabrication cost and structural weight increases therefore the weight of the fillet welded structure under examination should be considered not only during the production process but also during the design stage if welding distortion can be predicted with acceptable accuracy before the fabrication stage then lightweight welded structures with the required fabrication precision can be developed hence it is necessary to eventually examine the influence of trps on the structural stiffness and fabrication precision and thereby optimize the number of trps that lead to lightweight fabrication without fabrication precision loss with the rapid development of computer and numerical analysis technology finite element method fem has become a powerful and effective tool to simulate welding distortion of a welded structure generally two methods are used to predict welding distortion in engineering applications the first method involves thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis wherein the welding process is considered to exhibit transient non linear behavior for simple welded joints because of its high requirement of computer resources the other method involves elastic finite element fe analysis with plastic strain inherent strain as the input load brown brown and song 1992 employed both two and three dimensional 2d and 3d finite element models of a circular cylinder and ring stiffened structure to investigate the effect of welding parameters such as weld gap clearance and fixture on fabrication accuracy of the examined large structure michaleris and debiccari 1997 presented a numerical analysis technique that combined 2d welding simulation with 3d structural analyses their technique is effective when computer resources are limited camilleri et al 2005 examined the applicability of finite element analysis for out of plane welding distortion prediction transient thermal analysis was performed on a 2d cross section of a welded joint furthermore transverse angular deformation and longitudinal contraction forces were predicted these results were then applied to a non linear elastic finite element model to predict the final overall deformations of the butt welded plates following numerous experimental observations and computations welding inherent strain was proposed and employed for predicting welding residual stress ueda et al 1989 ueda et al ueda and yuan 1989 also concluded that welding inherent strain was the source of welding deformation and welding residual stress in welded joints subsequently wang et al wang and lu 2000 predicted welding deformation using elastic finite element fe analysis based on welding inherent strains which were assumed to be distributed in the weld vicinity based on experimental data and numerical analysis they indicated that the longitudinal and transverse inherent strains were the most important factors that affected welding deformation furthermore luo et al 2006 proposed a numerical method to predict residual deformation based on welding inherent strain the advantage of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing the computed welding deformation to the experimental data subsequently a two step computational approach combined with tep fe analysis and elastic fe analysis was widely employed to examine welding distortion of a ship structure murakawa et al 2010 welding inherent deformation was estimated in detail in advance via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis it was then applied as a mechanical load during elastic fe analysis to predict welding distortion wang et al 2013 2015 systematically examined the generation mechanism with inherent deformation theory and elastic fe analysis by concentrating on the out of plane welding distortion of thin plate welded structures they also indicated that strengthening via line heating can be employed to mitigate out of plane distortions such as bending and buckling ma et al 2016 later proposed a combined computational approach which involves thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis eigenvalue analysis and elastic finite element fe analysis to predict out of plane welding distortion of stiffened welded structures additionally flame heating was employed and considered numerically for mitigating out of plane welding distortion wang et al 2017a examined the welding distortion of the cantilever beam in jack up drilling rig via elastic finite element fe analysis based on inherent deformation theory based on the accurately computed results several welding distortion mitigation techniques such as inverse distortion welding sequence influence tack welding and mechanical fixture were implemented lee et al 2018 developed an efficient approach to predict welding angular distortion of large welded structures by using scalar input variables in which the explicit form of the force matrix was derived to transform the input variables according to the mesh size the proposed method demonstrated good prediction results for various cases by efficiently predicting welding angular distortions hence the aforementioned studies suggest that the welding distortion problems of large welded structures are typically investigated using an advanced computational approach however there is a paucity of studies that consider the light weight of an actual fillet welded structure of a cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig this is an essential engineering problem for offshore structures hence in this study lightweight fabrication of a fillet welded structure was examined along with simultaneous prevention of welding distortion by considering the geometrical profiles of typical welded joints and corresponding welding conditions the welding inherent deformations of various types of welded joints in mock up welded structure were evaluated by using the integration method of inherent strains which were obtained via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis after validating the accuracy of welding inherent deformation elastic fe computation of the mock up welded structure was performed wherein the welding inherent deformation was used as the mechanical load subsequently the influence of trps on welding deflection of the flange plate in the mock up welded structure was numerically examined the results exhibited good agreement between computed results and measurements furthermore lightweight fabrication of the examined mock up welded structure was investigated by considering the position and number of trps additionally the prevention of welding deflection along with lightweight fabrication of an actual fillet welded structure was also discussed 2 computational method for welding distortion prediction to investigate lightweight fabrication of an actual fillet welded structure of cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of its dimensions during welding hence an efficient computational method for predicting welding distortion is required thus a method that can perform elastic fe analysis and predict inherent deformations was proposed given that a welded joint in a plate structure has an inherent amount of local deformation due to welding welding distortion can be computed via elastic fe analysis with a shell element fe model of the examined welded structure in this analysis welding inherent deformations were applied as mechanical load to the welding lines between the plates that were welded together 2 1 tep fe method to evaluate welding inherent deformation transient non linear tep fe analysis is typically employed for computing welding transient temperature plastic strain and welding displacement of typical welded joint hence two physical processes based on thermal behavior and mechanical responses were considered radaj 1992 specifically an uncoupled thermal mechanical analysis was considered because a thermal process exhibits a decisive effect on mechanical response ma et al 2016 therefore the computational procedure included two steps the first step was thermal analysis wherein the temperature history at each node in the finite element model was calculated by solving the transient non linear heat transfer equation based on the welding conditions and thermal boundary conditions the temperature dependent thermal properties such as thermal conductivity specific heat and density were considered in this process additionally double ellipsoid heat source model and goldak heat source model were widely used to simulate the heat source of the welding arc goldak and akhlaghi 2005 subsequently the next step involved performing mechanical analysis by applying transient temperature field as a thermal load this was performed to compute residual stress plastic strain and welding displacement of welded similarly temperature dependent mechanical properties such as yield stress and young s modulus were used for mechanical analysis additionally boundary condition to fix the rigid body motion of the welded joint was considered and applied 2 2 inherent deformation theory during the welding process the total strain can be divided into elastic strain thermal strain plastic strain creep strain and strain due to phase transformation as shown in eq 1 additionally inherent strain can be considered as the sum of all the strains except for elastic strain which is considered as the elementary cause of welding distortion typically creep strain and strain due to phase transformation are often ignored because of their low magnitudes and thermal strain disappears as the welding temperature cools down to room temperature ueda et al 2013 therefore welding plastic strain is approximately considered as the dominant component of the inherent strain in engineering applications 1 ε t o t a l ε e l a s t i c ε t h e r m a l ε p h a s e ε p l a s t i c ε c r e e p due to the distributed characteristic of the welding inherent strain welding inherent deformation was proposed there are four components of welding inherent deformation namely longitudinal shrinkage δ x transverse shrinkage δ y longitudinal bending θ x and transverse bending θ y which are defined in eqs 2 and 3 and evaluated via integrating the inherent strain the magnitude of the welding inherent deformation can be considered as constant when the end effect is ignored wang et al 2015 with respect to a large welded structure the effect of weld length and width of inherent deformation can be neglected vega et al 2007 therefore elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load can be employed for predicting welding distortion without losing significant accuracy 2 δ x 1 h ε x d y d z δ y 1 h ε y d y d z 3 θ x 12 h 3 z h 2 ε x d y d z θ y 12 h 3 z h 2 ε y d y d z where h denotes the thickness of the welded joint x y and z denote the welding direction transverse direction and thickness direction respectively specifically longitudinal inherent shrinkage is converted to longitudinal shrinkage force and tendon force due to the strong self constraint in the welding line direction the relationship between tendon force and longitudinal inherent shrinkage can be described by the following formula wang et al 2017b 4 f t e n d o n e ε x d a e h 1 h ε x d a e h δ x 3 mock up fillet welded structure and measurements to ensure the dimensional accuracy of an actual fillet welded structure of cantilever beam in a jack up drilling rig a mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 was fabricated in advance and the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate was measured fig 3 shows a detailed geometrical profile of each component in the examined mock up welded structure as follows a web plate 900 mm 900 mm 32 mm with weight of 202 2 kg a flange plate 870 mm 900 mm 76 mm with weight of 454 2 kg two bevel v plates 585 mm 900 mm 32 mm with a total weight of 252 8 kg and 6 trps 238 mm 450 mm 32 mm with a total weight of 91 4 kg during the actual fabrication the flange plate was fixed by four clamps in advance sequentially web plate and flange plate were welded first and marked as t1 in fig 3 trps were then welded to flange plate and web plate and marked as t2 and t3 respectively subsequently bevel v plates were welded to flange plate and web plate and marked as b1 and b2 respectively additionally as shown trps were not removed after complete welding of bevel v plates and thus the weight of the structure was evidently increased fig 4 provides an actual view of the welding procedure used for the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure an eq63 grade material was used for the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure the chemical composition of the material is listed in table 1 and the temperature dependent thermal and mechanical properties of eq63 are shown in fig 5 flux cored arc welding fcaw was practiced with gfr 110k3 as the filling metal furthermore shielded metal arc welding smaw was also applied wherein nsswl 805n was used as the filling metal welding conditions are summarized in table 2 each welded joint was preheated to 150 c by using the insulation cotton and the interlayer temperature was maintained at 150 c during multi pass welding subsequently the temperature was decreased after the welding procedure was completed and the interlayer temperature was simultaneously measured via an infrared radiation thermometer the welding was restarted when the temperature and interlayer temperature were approximately 150 c during the welding experiment during the fabrication of the examined mock up fillet welded structure the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate was measured the measured points on the flange plate were examined they were distributed 900 mm along the horizontal direction and 870 mm along the vertical direction their positions are indicated in fig 6 furthermore fig 6 shows that there are 30 marked points for 5 a e measured groups with a measurement matrix as shown in fig 7 the welding displacements of the 30 measured points in the z direction were recorded the measurements are summarized in table 3 as per the fabrication procedure specifically t1 t2 and t3 denote t welded joints in the mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 between web and flange plates trps and flange plate and trps and web plate respectively furthermore b1 and b2 denote bevel welded joints in mock up fillet welded structure as shown in fig 3 between bevel and flange plate and bevel and web plate respectively furthermore out of plane welding displacements of the measured points a0 a5 b0 b5 c0 c5 d0 d5 e0 e5 after each welding procedure as indicated in fig 6 are sequentially obtained and summarized in table 3 4 establishment of an inherent deformation database before the elastic fe analysis of the mock up fillet welded structure an inherent deformation database of typical welded joints for the examined welded structure should be established as mentioned above welding inherent deformation is obtained by integrating inherent strain which can be obtained via transient non linear tep fe computation specifically welding inherent stains are mainly determined via material properties plate thickness welding process and types of welded joints the welding transient temperature of each typical fillet welded joint was computed in advance given that the inherent strain is determined by the highest welding temperature and self constraint supported by the surrounding base materials typical welded joints in the examined mock up fillet welded structure are classified and their brick solid elements with 8 nodes in the fe model are demonstrated in fig 8 which will be used for later tep fe computation with an in house program wang et al 2015 all typical welded joints are assembled with fillet welding and different colors are used to represent the welding passes as shown in fig 8 to improve the computational efficiency the length of the fe model for each typical welded joint was assumed as 300 mm for avoiding the end effect the total number of elements and nodes for each typical welded joint are also indicated in fig 8 furthermore fig 8 shows the boundary conditions for mechanical analysis the boundary conditions prevent rigid body motion 4 1 thermal analysis of typical welded joints during the thermal analysis of typical fillet welded joints the initial temperature was generally assumed as ambient temperature to represent the welding heat input of the moving arc during welding the volumetric heat source model with uniform density distribution was employed while welding arc energy was determined via welding current voltage speed and welding heat efficiency based on the experiment the initial temperature was set to 150 c for first welding pass via the preheating process subsequently the computation of the welding temperature for other welding passes was restarted when the cooling temperature of the previous welding process reached 150 c during thermal elastic plastic fe analysis specifically the computed temperature also decreases when considering the thermal convection and radiation after the completion of the welding procedure furthermore transient temperature was recorded and determined to restart a new welding procedure when the computed temperature during cooling approximately reached 150 c when shielded metal arc welding smaw was numerically considered the heat efficiency was assumed as 0 6 and the heat efficiency for flux cored arc welding fcaw during thermal analysis was assumed as 0 7 dupont and marder 1995 furthermore heat loss due to the physical characteristic of heat convection and radiation was also considered thermal analysis was used to evaluate the temperature field at each welding step and it was applied as thermal loading for subsequent mechanical analysis therefore the computed results of thermal analysis were validated by checking the predicted welding pool for each typical welded joint t1 t2 t3 and b1 b2 as shown in fig 9 transient temperature distributions of last welding pass in each typical welded joint are demonstrated and maximal temperature region as well as predicted welded zone are also shown hence the predicted welding pool was in good agreement with the designed welding groove 4 2 distribution of plastic strain given that the computed temperature fields above were used as thermal loading the mechanical response including residual stress and plastic strain can be examined via mechanical analysis during the welding process hence temperature dependent material properties and mechanical analysis constraints were considered given that the out of plane welding distortion of a flange plate is mainly due to transverse bending moment the magnitude and distribution of welding induced transverse plastic strains in each typical fillet welded joint were investigated as shown in fig 10 plotting contours of residual transverse plastic strain on middle cross section are shown and their magnitudes are also obtained additionally residual transverse plastic strain is shown in the region close to the welding pass with an un uniform distribution the welding inherent deformation for each typical welded joint can be evaluated via the integration method as defined in eqs 2 and 3 by using the computed transverse plastic strains subsequently they were applied for elastic fe analysis for predicting welding distortion 4 3 inherent deformation database during the welding process welding plastic strain ε x p ε y p is the main component of the inherent strain when compared to other strains hence the inherent deformation of each typical welded joint can be estimated by integrating welding plastic strain ueda et al 2013 thus inherent deformation magnitudes of each typical fillet welded joint were obtained as summarized in table 4 they were mainly determined by welding process material properties types of welded joint and plate thickness they were not dependent on the welded joint size additionally the longitudinal inherent bending was usually ignored because of its much lower magnitude 4 4 inherent deformation validation of bevel fillet welded joint in this study welding inherent deformation of bevel fillet welded joint b1 or b2 was evaluated first it is necessary to validate its precision before it is applied for elastic fe analysis hence out of plane welding distortion predicted via elastic fe computation with welding inherent deformation as input loading was compared to that predicted via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe computation the results exhibited good agreement thus the precision of the estimated inherent deformation of bevel fillet welded joint was confirmed in fig 8 e the b2 welded joint was considered as an example hence the out of plane welding distortion was predicted via elastic fe analysis wherein the evaluated inherent deformation was used as an input points on line1 and line2 as illustrated in fig 8 e are considered here line1 is the middle transverse line and line2 is the welding line as shown in fig 11 the distribution and magnitudes of out of plane welding distortions of points on line1 and line2 predicted via thermal elastic plastic finite element tep fe analysis and elastic fe analysis exhibit good agreement therefore the aforementioned estimated inherent deformation of the bevel fillet welded joint is accurate and can be applied for predicting welding distortion of the examined mock up fillet welded structure 5 welding distortion prediction of mock up fillet welded structure the inherent deformations as summarized in table 4 are applied as mechanical load for the elastic fe analysis hence the welding distortion of the mock up fillet welded structure can be easily computed by considering the actual welding sequence the fe model with 4 nodes shell elements is created for elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation as mechanical load as shown in fig 12 by using an identical geometrical profile of the examined mock up fillet welded structure the model contains 10 welded parts the total number of points and elements were 5140 and 5 045 respectively furthermore the boundary conditions to prevent rigid body motion of the fe model are also employed as shown in fig 12 in the model adjacent parts with different colors are welded together hence the interface element automatically creates a welding line the aforementioned inherent deformations as summarized in table 4 are used to perform elastic fe analysis for computing the welding distortion of the mock up fillet welded structure during the elastic fe analysis the constraint effect of trps were also considered 5 1 effect of trps on welding distortion the weight of the mock up fillet welded structure increases because trps cannot be removed after welding hence before optimizing the number and position of trps it is necessary to examine the effect of trps on the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate during the fabrication of the mock up fillet welded structure thus the effect of trps on the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate was numerically examined in advance as shown in fig 13 contour plots of out of plane welding distortion without and with trps are illustrated as evident from the figure the flange plate of the mock up fillet welded structure deforms without trps when compared with that with trps as shown in fig 14 a uniform distribution of out of plane welding distortion for points on welding line with a magnitude of 1 8 mm can be observed however a significantly less magnitude of approximately 0 5 mm of out of plane welding distortion was obtained with trps the underlying mechanism for this can be explained by the enhancement in structural rigidity due to the application of trps and thereby the out of plane welding distortion of the flange plate is reduced significantly therefore it can be concluded that trps play a significant role in fixing the position of the weld parts and controlling the z direction welding displacement of the flange plate 5 2 welding deflection prediction and validation based on the actual assembling process contour plots of z direction welding displacement of the examined mock up fillet welded structure generated via elastic fe analysis is illustrated in fig 15 to further compare the out of plane welding distortion between elastic fe computation and experimental measurement z direction welding displacements of points on the welding line marked as c0 c5 in fig 15 are obtained and compared to the measured data as shown in fig 16 the computed z direction welding displacement exhibits good agreement with experimental results and the magnitude tolerance is in the acceptable range for engineering application thus welding distortion of the examined mock up fillet welded structure can be accurately predicted via elastic fe analysis by using the welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load 6 lightweight fabrication with optimization of trps the investigation of welding distortion of examined mock up fillet welded structure indicates that trps play a significant role in out of plane welding distortion mitigation with increasing weight in order to reduce the structural weight of examined mock up fillet welded structure four plans with different number of trps and positions were designed and examined detailed information on the position and number of trps in each designed plan was indicated in fig 17 boundary conditions to prevent rigid body motion in each plan is also illustrated in fig 17 by using the welding inherent deformation as the mechanical load z direction welding displacements of each designed plan were computed via elastic fe analysis hence the results are presented as contour plots in fig 18 furthermore points on the welding line marked as c0 c5 in fig 15 are considered again and the out of plane welding distortion of these points are compared as shown in fig 19 the distribution of z direction welding displacements with trps for plans c and d are almost identical however the distributions of z direction welding displacements with trps for plans c and b are evidently different thus four trps as per plan c were enough to control the welding distortion when compared to that as per plan b with two trps hence plan c with less trps when compared to plan d with five trps was an optimized option for examined mock up fillet welded structure thereby ensuring fabrication precision and lightweight fabrication as mentioned earlier trps can enhance the structural rigidity and mitigate out of plane welding distortion hence actual fillet welded structure is fabricated with trps as shown in fig 20 however an increase in the number of trps will also increase the weight and additional operation costs in a service period therefore a series of elastic fe analysis as mentioned above were performed to optimize the number and position of trps for both fabrication precision and lightweight fabrication in this optimization constraints due to trps were also considered shell elements fe model of actual fillet welded structure is employed as shown in fig 21 the model has 30 trps in the current fabrication procedure the length of the actual fillet welded structure is 4500 mm which is five times the length of the previous examined mock up fillet welded structure the effect of trps on out of plane welding distortion was numerically examined and the trps were symmetrically located based on the design of actual fillet welded structure as shown in fig 21 five cases of trps design with 2 6 10 12 and 16 trps are considered during the elastic fe analysis of the actual fillet welded structure in all the designs rigid body motion is prevented by using the appropriate boundary conditions contour plots of out of plane welding distortions of actual fillet welded structure with different trps designs are computed as shown in fig 21 as mentioned earlier elastic fe analysis was employed with welding inherent deformation as mechanical loading however a comparison of the magnitudes of welding distortion for different trps designs is not clearly evident hence to further compare the difference in out of plane welding distortion with different trps designs points on the welding line which is indicated in fig 21 with a black dashed line were selected fig 22 shows the comparison of out of plane welding distortion of points on the welding line distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion for design with 12 trps exhibited significant difference with the design with 10 trps and designs with much lower number of trps additionally distribution and magnitude of out of plane welding distortion for the design with 12 trps was almost identical to the design with 16 trps this implies that the design with 12 trps is strong enough to ensure fabrication precision and is an optimal choice for lightweight fabrication furthermore total out of plane welding distortions of the examined points and weights of trps used in different trps designs are also compared as shown in fig 23 the results indicate that the total welding deflection approximately corresponds to a constant magnitude and the weight increases linearly with the increase in the number of trps hence the number of trps in an actual fillet welded structure can be reduced from 30 current design to 12 without loss in fabrication precision thus the structural weight of the actual fillet welded structure can be reduced by 274 14 kg with a decrease in the amount of welding procedures therefore the accuracy of the dimensions of the actual fillet welded structure can be ensured and lightweight fabrication of the structure can be achieved via trps optimization 7 conclusions in this study out of plane welding distortion of a mock up fillet welded structure was examined via experimental tests and computational analysis a comparison of the computed results and measurements indicated good agreement triangle reinforcement plate stiffener trps optimization for lightweight fabrication without loss of fabrication precision was demonstrated on mock up and actual fillet welded structures the following conclusions were obtained 1 typical welded joints were examined for inherent deformation evaluation first bevel fillet welded joint was examined and the precision of its inherent deformation was confirmed 2 elastic fe analysis with welding inherent deformation was performed for predicting welding distortion of a mock up fillet welded structure a comparison of computed welding deflections with measured results exhibited good agreement 3 the effect of trps on fabrication precision of mock up fillet welded structure was demonstrated and it was concluded that four trps were strong enough to ensure precision while considering lightweight fabrication 4 optimization of position and number of trps in an actual fillet welded structure was performed to ensure accuracy of the dimensions of the structure and also realize lightweight fabrication credit authorship contribution statement hongquan zhao software writing original draft qingya zhang validation visualization yexing niu investigation methodology

21638,coastal bridges are vulnerable to extreme surges and waves generated during hurricanes and tsunamis over the past few decades extensive research works were conducted to study the damage mechanisms of coastal bridges under the impact of extreme surges and waves however these research efforts mainly focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics involved in surge waves impinging bridges however there has been little research on mitigation measures to protect coastal bridges this study examines the installation of a submerged porous breakwater to protect coastal bridge decks from the impacts of solitary waves as an environmentally friendly wave reduction device submerged porous breakwater structures have been widely implemented in coastal regions due to their ease of installation and cost effectiveness to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads of a coastal bridge deck under the impact of a solitary wave a high resolution numerical wave tank is established based on an open source flow solver reef3d which numerically solves the governing equations of incompressible two phase flow on a staggered mesh arrangement and captures the interface between air and water using a high resolution level set method the hydrodynamic characteristics of coastal bridge decks with the installations of submerged porous breakwater are systematically investigated by considering the effects of six prominent factors i e wave height submersion depth water depth permeability spacing distance between breakwater and bridge and aspect ratios of breakwaters results show that the submerged porous breakwater is effective in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge decks under most of the situations therefore it is believed that the findings drawn from this paper can further enhance our understanding on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under extreme waves and should be instructive for future bridge designs keywords extreme wave solitary wave porous breakwater bridge deck submersion depth reef3d 1 introduction the past few decades saw a rapid socioeconomic development in the coastal regions and many coastal bridges were built however coastal bridges are vulnerable to extreme surges and waves generated during hurricanes and tsunamis meanwhile the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and tsunamis were reported to increase in recent years nrdc 2015 making extreme surges and wave more devastating to coastal bridges for instance hurricane katrina 2005 destroyed 44 bridges in the gulf coast region resulting in serious impacts on the transportation system padgett et al 2008 hurricane ike 2008 severely damaged 53 bridges in the houston galveston region of texas leading to enormous economic losses stearns and padgett 2012 and the 2011 japan tsunami destroyed more than 300 bridges resulting in great economic losses wong 2015 kawashima et al 2011 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the coastal bridges under the impact of extreme surges and waves have been of great concern to researchers over the past few decades many studies have been carried out with regards to the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under different types of ocean surface waves in 1960s el ghamry 1963 and french 1969 have experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic characteristics of a two dimensional plate under solitary wave after the tremendous devastations caused by hurricane katrina 2005 many researchers paid more attention to the hydrodynamic processes of the coastal bridges under extreme

applied to the highway bridge deck using a newly developed coupled modelling system the hydrodynamic processes of an immovable bridge deck crowley et al 2018 fang et al 2018 ti et al 2019 a movable bridge deck xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 and floating bridge deck cheng et al 2018 manisha et al 2019 viuff et al 2019 under extreme waves were also investigated in addition to studies on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges studies also focused on protection measures for the coastal bridges such as side roads wei and dalrymple 2016 floating breakwater qu et al 2020 and air vents xu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 qu et al 2017 installed in the bridge deck overall the above studies have enhanced our understanding of the damage mechanisms of the bridge decks under extreme waves however as there are few preventative measures to protect coastal bridges from wave induced damage it is urgent to look for the economical effective and environmental protective measures attributed to favorable properties such as having low cost being environmentally friendly and aesthetic use of the porous submerged breakwater was extensively proposed to protect coastal infrastructure from extreme waves meanwhile many investigations have been carried out on the submerged breakwater as early as 1995 kinematics and hydrodynamics of oscillatory flow in an idealized porous structure both emerged and submerged were studied experimentally by losada et al 1995 garcia et al 2004 studied the wave transmission through the rubble mound by measuring the water pressure right above the bottom of flume kontaxi memos et al 2005 and moschella et al 2005 investigated the kinematics in the interior of the porous structure wu and hsiao 2013 carried out the laboratory experiment in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume to measure the distribution of velocities and water elevations when the solitary wave propagation over porous rectangular breakwater in addition to the experiment work many numerical studies also were conducted for instance metallinos and memos 2012 avgeris et al 2005 and metallinos et al 2014 applied a compound boussinesq type model which incorporates extra terms accounting for the effect of structural porosity later metallinos et al 2016 2019 used an extension of the boussinesq type model of chondros and memos 2014 to study wave propagation over a submerged porous breakwater with steep slopes the boussinesq type model was also applied to investigate the complex flow fields and wave attenuation property of a box type porous breakwaters under solitary wave lynett et al 2000 besides numerical models based on two phase flow solver were also widely applied to investigate the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of various types of porous breakwaters under different ocean surface waves losada et al 1996 simulated the wave transformation of oblique incident regular waves over the trapezoidal porous submerged breakwaters lin and liu 1998 simulated the interactions

numerical stability an adaptive time stepping method is applied and the time step size is automatically adjusted according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion uniform cartesian grid is implemented in reef3d with the local directional ghost cell immersed boundary method ibm berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 to represent the complex solid boundaries in the computations a nonslip boundary condition is applied at walls which include the channel bottom and deck surfaces a symmetry boundary condition is imposed on the top boundary of the computational domain neumann conditions with zero gradients are used for pressure at the inlet outlet and walls in our numerical wave tank the whole computational domain consists of the relaxing zone the working zone and the numerical beach zone fig 1 the relaxation function proposed by jacobsen et al 2012 has been applied to moderate the velocity and the free surface using wave theory in the relaxation zone with 13 u r γ x u a 1 γ x u c 14 ϕ r γ

subscript c represents computed variables and x stands for the wave propagation direction with x s r being the start and x e r the end x coordinate of relaxation zone in the relaxing zone the computational values of velocity and free surface are increased to the analytical values prescribed by wave theory the wave relaxing zone releases waves into the working zone of the tank the structures to be studied are placed in the working zone of the tank to absorb the waves reflected form the outlet of the computation domain the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced to zero in a smooth manner bihs 2010 3 model calibration 3 1 propagation of solitary wave over porous breakwater to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge deck it is necessary to verify the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the complex flow field in the porous medium the predicted distributions of velocities and water elevations are compared with the corresponding experimental data the experiment work was carried out by wu and hsiao 2013 in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume which is 25 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 6 m high the computational layout is plotted in fig 2 the porous breakwater consisted of uniform glass spheres with constant diameter of 0 015 m resulting in a porosity value of 0 52 the breakwater was mounted on the bottom of the flume as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is 8 m long and 0 2 m high uniform computation mesh with a resolution of d x 0 004 m is used in the computation the breakwater is located at 4 m downward from the inlet of the computational domain the still water depth h is 0 106 m and the incident solitary wave height h is 0 0477 m two wave gauges are settled to measure the time series of water elevation at x 2 2 m and x 5 8 m the predicted time series of water elevations recorded at wave gages wg1 and wg2 are compared with experimental data in fig 3 it is observed that the predicted elevations are in good agreement with the experiment data for both of peak value and temporal variation which can be also observed in the snapshots of water elevation distribution near the breakwater as shown in figs 4 and 6 the experimental and computational vertical and horizontal velocity distributions along the water depth at t 1 45 and 1 65s are compared in fig 5 and 7 these figures show that the experimental and computational flow velocity distributions are in good agreement although there are some slight discrepancies at some locations for example at t 1 65s and x 0 04 0 16m the numerical model overestimates the magnitude of horizontal velocity at the rear side of the breakwater some of the discrepancy can be attributed to limitations of the numerical model which uses a homogeneous porous medium assumption without detailing each individual glass sphere overall the above comparisons clearly indicate that reef3d can accurately describe a solitary wave propagating over the porous breakwater 3 2 solitary wave impinging coastal bridge deck to ensure the computational model s capability of reliably predicting hydrodynamic loads it is necessary to present the validation of solitary waves imping a bridge deck based on an experiment carried out by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 fig 8 depicts a typical 1 35 scale coastal bridge deck model and the corresponding experimental layout the deck s span length is 14 92 cm two different submersion depths are considered in the experiment case a fully submerged case with the upper surface of the deck at 0 0172 m below the still water level case b partially submerged case with the girders toes at 0 0114 m higher than the still water level the entire computational domain is 8 m in length and 0 255 m in height in case a the still water depth h is 0 086m and wave height h is 0 0258 m in case b the still water depth h is 0 114 m and wave height h is 0 0342 m mesh spacings of 0 0015 dense 0 003 medium and 0 006 coarse m are used to verify the sufficiency of the mesh resolution in the computations the comparisons between predicted hydrodynamic loads and the experimental data for both case a and case b are plotted in fig 9 it is seen that predicted and experimental results for hydrodynamic loads are in a good agreement especially with respect to peak values and temporal variation there are some discrepancies between the predictions and measurements which could be attributed to the complexity of the flow waves and their interaction the snapshots of water body contour at different time instances for both case a and case b are shown in fig 10 it is seen that larger overtopping water can be observed as submersion depth increases overall the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge decks is well validated furthermore it is also found that the predictions obtained under different mesh resolution are close to each other hence the resolution of the dense mesh dx 0 0015 m is believed to be sufficient and a similar mesh resolution will be used for the calculations in section 4 4 results and discussions in the following sections the performance of submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads of a typical full scale coastal bridge deck presented in section 2 2 under solitary wave are investigated systematically by accounting for some prominent factors i e wave height h water depth h submersion depth s permeability n and aspect ratio of breakwaters l p fig 11 depicts the computational layout and the geometric dimensions of the full scale coastal bridge deck as shown in fig 11a the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is measured from girder bottom of bridge to the still water level as defined in qu et al 2017 2018 a positive s and a negative s mean some portion of the deck girder is submerged into the water and the bottom of the girder is elevated above the still water level a h f and a v f are defined as the width and height of breakwater respectively in the following computations the computational domain is 200 m in length and 12 m in height the porous breakwater is installed 73 03 m downward from the inlet of the computational domain in the following sections the predicted hydrodynamic loads are normalized using 17 f v f v a h ρ g h 18 f h f h a v ρ g h where a h and a v are used to represent the width and front height of the bridge deck respectively and a h 10 67 m and a v 1 77 m in addition a unit span length 1 m of the deck was used to evaluate the efficiency of floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic load of bridge deck r h and r v are defined as 19 r h f h m a x w i t h o u t b r

t h o u t b r e a k w a t e r where f h m a x and f v m a x represent maximum magnitudes of horizontal and vertical loads respectively 4 1 hydrodynamic phenomena the complex flow field of solitary wave impinging coastal bridge deck with the installation of submerged porous breakwater were numerically investigated in this section the still water depth h is set as 6 m and the input wave height h is set as 1 5 m producing a wave height ratio ε h h of value of 0 25 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio l p a v p a h p 0 5 the permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck is set as 3 a h the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is 0 snapshots of the velocity contours of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck with breakwater at different time instances are plotted in fig 12 it is observed that before the wave crest impinges the coastal bridge deck the solitary wave firstly interacts with the submerged porous breakwater fig 12a once the solitary wave approaches the breakwater site the flow separation and the generation of vortices occur at the front side of the breakwater the vortices are gradually generated at the left upper corner by absorbing energy from the main flow as shown in fig 12a meanwhile these vortices are stretched downstream when the crest of the solitary wave passes over the breakwater flow circulations are observed near the rear side of breakwater and a large clockwise vortex is gradually generated as shown in fig 12b c d and e as seen in fig 12d although the breakwater somewhat reduces the wave height it produces a high velocity region between the breakwater and the bridge deck finally the distorted wave crest impinges coastal bridge deck and the overtopping water over the top of the bridge deck is observed fig 12e in addition high velocity region is found between the bottom of the bridge deck girders and seabed after the solitary wave leaves the bridge site high velocity regions in the vicinity regions around the breakwater and bridge deck gradually disappear and the generated vortices are mostly dissipated fig 12f for comparison fig 13 plots the snapshots of the velocity contours of the solitary wave impacting the bridge deck without breakwater at different time instances it is seen that the incident solitary wave is to directly impact the bridge deck as shown in fig 13a b c and d obviously comparing with results depicted in fig 12 solitary wave impinges the bridge deck without the breakwater is a little bit earlier and the impact intensity of wave is somewhat greater as seen from the quantity of the overtopping water over the top of bridge deck fig 19e comparisons of the time series of hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck with and without breakwater under solitary waves are plotted in fig 14 it is seen that the submerged porous breakwater can effectively reduce the peak values of the horizontal load by 10 3 and vertical load by 3 as demonstrated in the discussions above it is proved that our numerical wave tank can effectively predict the complex hydrodynamic phenomena of solitary wave impacting the coastal bridge deck with submerged porous breakwater besides the installation of the submerged porous breakwater can reduce the horizontal and vertical loading loads of the bridge deck to some extent 4 2 effects of wave height in this section effects of wave height on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under solitary wave are investigated five different wave height ratios are selected i e ε h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth s 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 fig 15 plots the snapshots of velocity contour under different wave heights at the moment of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck it is found that the intensities of solitary wave impacting at the bridge deck and the shedding vortices from the top wall of the submerged porous breakwater increase with the incident wave height for relatively small wave height ratios ε 0 1 the installation of the submerged porous breakwater has limited influences on the velocity distribution around the bridge deck however a thin layer of water in high velocity is observed over the top wall of the breakwater fig 15a as the incident wave height further increases due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater it is observed that the magnitude of high velocity region below the bridge deck is greatly reduced as indicting in the intensified shedding vortices fig 15b c d and e fig 16 plots the variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck with the incident wave height it is seen that both horizontal and vertical loads almost increase linearly with the incident wave height as shown in fig 16a when the incident wave height is smaller ε 0 2 the horizontal load applied to the bridge deck can be only reduced a little by the submerged porous breakwater it is attributed to the reason that the high velocity distributed in the upper water region of the submerged porous breakwater when the incident wave height is small once the incident wave height further increases due to the blocking effects of the submerged porous breakwater the horizontal load applied to the bridge deck can be greatly reduced in addition since the existence of the submerged porous breakwater can only reduce the wave crest of solitary a little bit the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the vertical load applied to the bridge deck is not as good as that for the horizontal load the reducing rates of the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck by the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 17 it clearly shows that the variation of reducing rates of the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck exhibit strong nonlinear behavior reductions in horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights range from 6 9 to 23 1 and from 3 0 to 7 5 respectively 4 3 effects of submersion depth since the coastal bridge decks may have different clearance heights along the whole bridge and the storm surge increases as storms approach the coast similar as our previous researches qu et al 2017 effects of the submersion depth on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated five different submersion depths are selected s s av 1 2 0 1 2 1 and 3 2 in the computations the still water depth h is kept as 6 m the wave height ratio ε is 0 25 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 snapshots of the velocity contours under different submersion depths at different time instances are plotted in fig 18 it is observed that the chambers are gradually filled fully with water as submersion depth increases meanwhile the intensity of the wave tongue is enhanced with the submersion depth and the amount of the overtopping water increases after s 0 similar as the results demonstrated in section 4 2 due the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the intensity of solitary wave impacting at the bridge deck and the amount of the overtopping water on the top of the coastal bridge deck are greatly reduced in addition the velocity magnitudes of flow current around the bridge deck at the moment of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck is also greatly reduced by the submerged porous breakwater variations of the maximum horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck with and without the submerged porous breakwater under solitary wave with submersion depth are depicted in fig 19 it is seen that both horizontal and vertical loads approach their maximum values at s 1av fig 20 depicts the reducing rates of the submerged porous breakwater in hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck as shown in fig 20 the maximum reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads occur at s av 1 2 once s av 1 2 influences of the submersion depth on the reducing rate in horizontal load are very limited the reducing rate r h is nearly a constant the reducing rate r v gradually decreases with the submersion depth in a moderate mode nearly a constant horizontal and vertical loads reductions range from 8 2 to 22 1 and from 0 1 to 13 3 respectively 4 4 effects of water depth in this section effects of the water depth on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated and five different water depths are selected i e h 4 5 6 7 and 8 m the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability of breakwater n is set as 0 5 fig 21 plots the snapshots of velocity contours under different water depth at the moment of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck it is seen that when the water depth is small h 4 m the intensity of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck is strong and the amount of the overtopping water is also large fig 21a as the water depth increases the amount of the overtopping water is gradually decreased due to an extended solitary wavelength fig 21b c d and e it is also observed that the existence of the submerged porous breakwater can greatly decrease the intensity of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck especially when water depth is small h 4 m variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads with water depth are depicted in fig 22 the maximum horizontal loads of the bridge deck with and without breakwater both approach the maximum values at h 7 m fig 22a the maximum vertical load monotonically decreases with water depth for the bridge deck without the submerged porous breakwater on the contrary the maximum vertical load monotonically increases with water depth for the bridge deck with the submerged porous breakwater fig 22b the maximum reducing rates for horizontal and vertical loads both occur at h 4 m fig 23 overall reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck gradually decrease with water depth the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different water depth range from 1 6 to 75 5 and from 1 1 to 53 1 respectively 4 5 effects of spacing distance in this section effects of spacing distance d between breakwater and bridge on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated by selecting five different spacing distances i e d d a h 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 and the permeability of breakwater n is set as 0 5 as shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the influences of spacing distance between breakwater and bridge on velocity contours and reducing rates of hydrodynamic loads are very limited the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different spacing distance range from 10 29 to 17 21 and from 0 23 to 4 19 respectively 4 6 effects of permeability and aspect ratio of breakwater in this section five different permeabilities n i e n 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 are selected to investigate the effects of permeability on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 and the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h fig 26 plots the snapshots of velocity contours under different permeabilities at the moment of solitary wave impinging the coastal bridge deck it is shown that the influences of permeability on the velocity contours around the bridge deck are very limited which is also reflected in the variations of reducing rates of hydrodynamic loads with permeability fig 27 the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different permeability range from 0 04 to 10 3 and from 1 1 to 3 respectively effects of aspect ratios on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater are investigated by selecting five different aspect ratios l p a v p a h p i e l p 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability is set as 0 5 to investigate effects of the height of breakwater a v p the width of breakwater a h p is set as a constant value 7 4m apparently the impacting intensity of solitary wave at the bridge deck is greatly reduced with the height of breakwater due to the enhanced blocking effect of the breakwater fig 28 left side meanwhile the magnitude of the high velocity below the bridge deck girders is also greatly reduced as the height of the breakwater increases variations of reducing rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck with the height of breakwater of the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 29 left side both the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads monotonically increases with the height of the submerged porous breakwater the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different aspect ratios range from 1 7 to 60 1 and from 0 3 to 24 9 respectively otherwise the height of breakwater a v p is set as a constant value 3 7m to study effects of the width of breakwater a h p as shown in fig 28 right side the intensity of solitary wave impacting on the bridge deck is slightly reduced with the width of breakwater on account of the longer interaction time between wave and breakwater at the meantime the magnitude of the high velocity below the bridge deck girders is also slightly reduced as the width of the breakwater increases variations of reducing rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck with the width of breakwater of the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 29 right side the reducing rates in horizontal load monotonically increases with the width of the submerged porous breakwater but the influence of the width of breakwater on vertical load is very limited the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different width of breakwater range from 3 91 to 21 25 and from 2 55 to 3 37 respectively 5 conclusions in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank was established using the open source flow solver reef3d to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under solitary wave with respect to five prominent factors wave height water depth and submersion depth permeability and aspect ratio the major conclusions drawn from this research can be summarized as follows 1 reef3d is able to predict the complex flow phenomena of solitary waves impacting bridge deck with the installation of the submerged porous breakwater due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the intensity of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck can be greatly reduced 2 as the incident wave height increases due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the magnitude of high velocity region below the bridge deck is greatly reduced and more incident wave energy can be absorbed in the intensified shedding vortices from the top wall of the breakwater the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the vertical load applied to the bridge deck is not as good as that for the horizontal load the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights range from 6 9 to 23 1 and 3 0 to 7 5 respectively 3 maximum reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads occur at s 1 2 once s 1 2 influences of the submersion depth on the reducing rate in horizontal load are very limited the reducing rate r h is nearly a constant the reducing rate r v gradually decreases with the submersion depth in a moderate mode the reducing rates in horizontal loads range from 8 2 to 22 1 the reducing rates in vertical loads ranges from 0 1 to 13 3 4 the maximum reducing rates for horizontal and vertical loads both occur at h 4 m the reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck gradually decreases with water depth the reducing rates in horizontal load under different water depth range from 1 6 to 75 5 and the reducing rates under different water depth in vertical load range from 1 1 to 53 1 5 effects due to the permeability of the breakwater are negligible the maximum horizontal and vertical loads decrease almost linearly with permeability of breakwater overall the installation of the submerged porous breakwater can greatly reduce the hydrodynamic load applied to the coastal bridge deck under most of the situations especially for the horizontal load it is believed that the findings drawn from this paper can enhance our understanding on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under solitary wave and should be instructive for future design of the protection measures for the coastal bridge subjected to the extreme ocean waves credit authorship contribution statement w y sun

21638,coastal bridges are vulnerable to extreme surges and waves generated during hurricanes and tsunamis over the past few decades extensive research works were conducted to study the damage mechanisms of coastal bridges under the impact of extreme surges and waves however these research efforts mainly focused on the hydrodynamic characteristics involved in surge waves impinging bridges however there has been little research on mitigation measures to protect coastal bridges this study examines the installation of a submerged porous breakwater to protect coastal bridge decks from the impacts of solitary waves as an environmentally friendly wave reduction device submerged porous breakwater structures have been widely implemented in coastal regions due to their ease of installation and cost effectiveness to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads of a coastal bridge deck under the impact of a solitary wave a high resolution numerical wave tank is established based on an open source flow solver reef3d which numerically solves the governing equations of incompressible two phase flow on a staggered mesh arrangement and captures the interface between air and water using a high resolution level set method the hydrodynamic characteristics of coastal bridge decks with the installations of submerged porous breakwater are systematically investigated by considering the effects of six prominent factors i e wave height submersion depth water depth permeability spacing distance between breakwater and bridge and aspect ratios of breakwaters results show that the submerged porous breakwater is effective in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge decks under most of the situations therefore it is believed that the findings drawn from this paper can further enhance our understanding on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges under extreme waves and should be instructive for future bridge designs keywords extreme wave solitary wave porous breakwater bridge deck submersion depth reef3d 1 introduction the past few decades saw a rapid socioeconomic development in the coastal regions and many coastal bridges were built however coastal bridges are vulnerable to extreme surges and waves generated during hurricanes and tsunamis meanwhile the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and tsunamis were reported to increase in recent years nrdc 2015 making extreme surges and wave more devastating to coastal bridges for instance hurricane katrina 2005 destroyed 44 bridges in the gulf coast region resulting in serious impacts on the transportation system padgett et al 2008 hurricane ike 2008 severely damaged 53 bridges in the houston galveston region of texas leading to enormous economic losses stearns and padgett 2012 and the 2011 japan tsunami destroyed more than 300 bridges resulting in great economic losses wong 2015 kawashima et al 2011 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the coastal bridges under the impact of extreme surges and waves have been of great concern to researchers over the past few decades many studies have been carried out with regards to the damage

plate under solitary wave after the tremendous devastations caused by hurricane katrina 2005 many researchers paid more attention to the hydrodynamic processes of the coastal bridges under extreme waves and applied experimental and numerical approaches hydrodynamic loads on coastal bridges were studied using solitary waves xu et al 2018 wei and dalrymple 2016 stokes wave xiao et al 2009 huang and xiao 2009 jin and meng 2011 cnoidal wave seiffert et al 2015 tsunami waves qu et al 2019 the joint action of solitary wave and current qu et al 2018 was systematically analyzed and the effects of

bridge deck xu and cai 2015 cai et al 2017 and floating bridge deck cheng et al 2018 manisha et al 2019 viuff et al 2019 under extreme waves were also investigated in addition to studies on the damage mechanism of coastal bridges studies also focused on protection measures for the coastal bridges such as side roads wei and dalrymple 2016 floating breakwater qu et al 2020 and air vents xu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 qu et al 2017 installed in the bridge deck overall the above studies have enhanced our understanding of the damage mechanisms of the bridge decks under extreme waves however as there are few preventative measures to protect coastal bridges from wave induced damage it is urgent to look for the economical effective and environmental protective measures attributed to favorable properties such as having low cost being environmentally friendly and aesthetic use of the porous submerged breakwater was extensively proposed to protect coastal infrastructure from extreme waves meanwhile many investigations have been carried out on the submerged breakwater as early as 1995 kinematics and hydrodynamics of oscillatory flow in an idealized porous structure both emerged and submerged were studied experimentally by losada et al 1995 garcia et al 2004 studied the wave transmission through the rubble mound by measuring the water pressure right above the bottom of flume kontaxi memos et al 2005 and moschella et al 2005 investigated the kinematics in the interior of the porous structure wu and hsiao 2013 carried out the laboratory experiment in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume to measure the distribution of velocities and water elevations when the solitary wave propagation over porous rectangular breakwater in addition to the experiment work many numerical studies also were conducted for instance metallinos and memos 2012 avgeris et al 2005 and metallinos et al 2014 applied a compound boussinesq type model which incorporates extra terms accounting for the effect of structural porosity later metallinos et al 2016 2019 used an extension of the boussinesq type model of chondros and memos 2014 to study wave propagation over a submerged porous breakwater with steep slopes the boussinesq type model was also applied to investigate the complex flow fields and wave attenuation property of a box type porous breakwaters under solitary wave lynett et al 2000 besides numerical models based on two phase flow solver were also widely applied to investigate the complex hydrodynamic characteristics of various types of porous breakwaters under different ocean surface waves losada et al 1996 simulated the wave transformation of oblique incident regular waves over the trapezoidal porous submerged breakwaters lin and liu 1998 simulated the interactions between wave and porous structure with considering turbulence effects tsai et al 2006 numerically investigated the wave transformation over submerged trapezoidal porous breakwater installed on a porous bottom recently the performance of the compound porous breakwater under the joint actions of regular waves and onshore wind were also investigated hieu et al 2014 the effectiveness of partial vertical permeable barriers on mitigating the wave induced response of the large floating structure is investigated by singla et al 2018 a couple model is applied to investigate the function of a bottom mounted submerged porous breakwater on mitigating wave effects on tunnel manisha et al 2019 this paper proposes the installation of the rectangular box type submerged porous breakwater to protect coastal bridge decks from the impact of tsunami like waves to numerically investigate the performance of a submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge deck under solitary waves a high resolution numerical wave tank is established based on the open source flow solver reef3d bihs 2010 which solves the governing equations of the incompressible two phase flow on a staggered mesh arrangement and captures the interface between air and water using a high resolution level set method osher and sethian 1988 the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic load of coastal bridge deck are systematically investigated by considering effects of six prominent factors i e wave height water depth submersion depth

numerical stability an adaptive time stepping method is applied and the time step size is automatically adjusted according to courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion uniform cartesian grid is implemented in reef3d with the local directional ghost cell immersed boundary method ibm berthelsen and faltinsen 2008 to represent the complex solid boundaries in the computations a nonslip boundary condition is applied at walls which include the channel bottom and deck surfaces a symmetry boundary condition is imposed on the top boundary of the computational domain neumann conditions with zero gradients are used for pressure at the inlet outlet and walls in our numerical wave tank the whole computational domain consists of the relaxing zone the working zone and the numerical beach zone fig 1 the relaxation function proposed by jacobsen et al 2012 has been applied to moderate the velocity and the free surface using wave theory in the relaxation zone with 13 u r γ x u a 1 γ x u c 14 ϕ r γ

subscript c represents computed variables and x stands for the wave propagation direction with x s r being the start and x e r the end x coordinate of relaxation zone in the relaxing zone the computational values of velocity and free surface are increased to the analytical values prescribed by wave theory the wave relaxing zone releases waves into the working zone of the tank the structures to be studied are placed in the working zone of the tank to absorb the waves reflected form the outlet of the computation domain the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced to zero in a smooth manner bihs 2010 3 model calibration 3 1 propagation of solitary wave over porous breakwater to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads applied to the coastal bridge deck it is necessary to verify the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the complex flow field in the porous medium the predicted distributions of velocities and water elevations are compared with the corresponding experimental data the experiment work was carried out by wu and hsiao 2013 in a 2d glass walled and glass bottomed wave flume which is 25 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 6 m high the computational layout is plotted in fig 2 the porous breakwater consisted of uniform glass spheres with constant diameter of 0 015 m resulting in a porosity value of 0 52 the breakwater was mounted on the bottom of the flume as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is 8 m long and 0 2 m high uniform computation mesh with a resolution of d x 0 004 m is used in the computation the breakwater is located at 4 m downward from the inlet of the computational domain the still water depth h is 0 106 m and the incident solitary wave height h is 0 0477 m two wave gauges are settled to measure the time series of water elevation at x 2 2 m and x 5 8 m the predicted time series of water elevations recorded at wave gages wg1 and wg2 are compared with experimental data in fig 3 it is observed that the predicted elevations are in good agreement with the experiment data for both of peak value and temporal variation which can be also observed in the snapshots of water elevation distribution near the breakwater as shown in figs 4 and 6 the experimental and computational vertical and horizontal velocity distributions along the water depth at t 1 45 and 1 65s are compared in fig 5 and 7 these figures show that the experimental and computational flow velocity distributions are in good agreement although there are some slight discrepancies at some locations for example at t 1 65s and x 0 04 0 16m the numerical model overestimates the magnitude of horizontal velocity at the rear side of the breakwater some of the discrepancy can be attributed to limitations of the numerical model which uses a homogeneous porous medium assumption without detailing each individual glass sphere overall the above comparisons clearly indicate that reef3d can accurately describe a solitary wave propagating over the porous breakwater 3 2 solitary wave impinging coastal bridge deck to ensure the computational model s capability of reliably predicting hydrodynamic loads it is necessary to present the validation of solitary waves imping a bridge deck based on an experiment carried out by hayatdavoodi et al 2014 fig 8 depicts a typical 1 35 scale coastal bridge deck model and the corresponding experimental layout the deck s span length is 14 92 cm two different submersion depths are considered in the experiment case a fully submerged case with the upper surface of the deck at 0 0172 m below the still water level case b partially submerged case with the girders toes at 0 0114 m higher than the still water level the entire computational domain is 8 m in length and 0 255 m in height in case a the still water depth h is 0 086m and wave height h is 0 0258 m in case b the still water depth h is 0 114 m and wave height h is 0 0342 m mesh spacings of 0 0015 dense 0 003 medium and 0 006 coarse m are used to verify the sufficiency of the mesh resolution in the computations the comparisons between predicted hydrodynamic loads and the experimental data for both case a and case b are plotted in fig 9 it is seen that predicted and experimental results for hydrodynamic loads are in a good agreement especially with respect to peak values and temporal variation there are some discrepancies between the predictions and measurements which could be attributed to the complexity of the flow waves and their interaction the snapshots of water body contour at different time instances for both case a and case b are shown in fig 10 it is seen that larger overtopping water can be observed as submersion depth increases overall the computational capability of our numerical model in predicting the hydrodynamic load applied to the bridge decks is well validated furthermore it is also found that the predictions obtained under different mesh resolution are close to each other hence the resolution of the dense mesh dx 0 0015 m is believed to be sufficient and a similar mesh resolution will be used for the calculations in section 4 4 results and discussions in the following sections the performance of submerged porous breakwater on the hydrodynamic loads of a typical full scale coastal bridge deck presented in section 2 2 under solitary wave are investigated systematically by accounting for some prominent factors i e wave height h water depth h submersion depth s permeability n and aspect ratio of breakwaters l p fig 11 depicts the computational layout and the geometric dimensions of the full scale coastal bridge deck as shown in fig 11a the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is measured from girder bottom of bridge to the still water level as defined in qu et al 2017 2018 a positive s and a negative s mean some portion of the deck girder is submerged into the water and the bottom of the girder is elevated above the still water level a h f and a v f are defined as the width and height of breakwater respectively in the following computations the computational domain is 200 m in length and 12 m in height the porous breakwater is installed 73 03 m downward from the inlet of the computational domain in the following sections the predicted hydrodynamic loads are normalized using 17 f v f v a h ρ g h 18 f h f h a v ρ g h where a h and a v are used to represent the width and front height of the bridge deck respectively and a h 10 67 m and a v 1 77 m in addition a unit span length 1 m of the deck was used to evaluate the efficiency of floating breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic load of bridge deck r h and r v are defined as 19 r h f h m a x w i t h o u t b r

wave impinging coastal bridge deck with the installation of submerged porous breakwater were numerically investigated in this section the still water depth h is set as 6 m and the input wave height h is set as 1 5 m producing a wave height ratio ε h h of value of 0 25 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio l p a v p a h p 0 5 the permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck is set as 3 a h the submersion depth s of the bridge deck is 0 snapshots of the velocity contours of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck with breakwater at different time instances are plotted in fig 12 it is observed that before the wave crest impinges the coastal bridge deck the solitary wave firstly interacts with the submerged porous breakwater fig 12a once the solitary wave approaches the breakwater site the flow separation and the generation of vortices occur at the front side of the breakwater the vortices are gradually generated at the left upper corner by absorbing energy from the main flow as shown in fig 12a meanwhile these vortices are stretched downstream when the crest of the solitary wave passes over the breakwater flow circulations are observed near the rear side of breakwater and a large clockwise vortex is gradually generated as shown in fig 12b c d and e as seen in fig 12d although the breakwater somewhat reduces the wave height it produces a high velocity region between the breakwater and the bridge deck finally the distorted wave crest impinges coastal bridge deck and the overtopping water over the top of the bridge deck is observed fig 12e in addition high velocity region is found between the bottom of the bridge deck girders and seabed after the solitary wave leaves the bridge site high velocity regions in the vicinity regions around the breakwater and bridge deck gradually disappear and the generated vortices are mostly dissipated fig 12f for comparison fig 13 plots the snapshots of the velocity contours of the solitary wave impacting the bridge deck without breakwater at different time instances it is seen that the incident solitary wave is to directly impact the bridge deck as shown in fig 13a b c and d obviously comparing with results depicted in fig 12 solitary wave impinges the bridge deck without the breakwater is a little bit earlier and the impact intensity of wave is somewhat greater as seen from the quantity of the overtopping water over the top of bridge deck fig 19e comparisons of the time series of hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck with and without breakwater under solitary waves are plotted in fig 14 it is seen that the submerged porous breakwater can effectively reduce the peak values of the horizontal load by 10 3 and vertical load by 3 as demonstrated in the discussions above it is proved that our numerical wave tank can effectively predict the complex hydrodynamic phenomena of solitary wave impacting the coastal bridge deck with submerged porous breakwater besides the installation of the submerged porous breakwater can reduce the horizontal and vertical loading loads of the bridge deck to some extent 4 2 effects of wave height in this section effects of wave height on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under solitary wave are investigated five different wave height ratios are selected i e ε h h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth s 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 fig 15 plots the snapshots of velocity contour under different wave heights at the moment of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck it is found that the intensities of solitary wave impacting at the bridge deck and the shedding vortices from the top wall of the submerged porous breakwater increase with the incident wave height for relatively small wave height ratios ε 0 1 the installation of the submerged porous breakwater has limited influences on the velocity distribution around the bridge deck however a thin layer of water in high velocity is observed over the top wall of the breakwater fig 15a as the incident wave height further increases due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater it is observed that the magnitude of high velocity region below the bridge deck is greatly reduced as indicting in the intensified shedding vortices fig 15b c d and e fig 16 plots the variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck with the incident wave height it is seen that both horizontal and vertical loads almost increase linearly with the incident wave height as shown in fig 16a when the incident wave height is smaller ε 0 2 the horizontal load applied to the bridge deck can be only reduced a little by the submerged porous breakwater it is attributed to the reason that the high velocity distributed in the upper water region of the submerged porous breakwater when the incident wave height is small once the incident wave height further increases due to the blocking effects of the submerged porous breakwater the horizontal load applied to the bridge deck can be greatly reduced in addition since the existence of the submerged porous breakwater can only reduce the wave crest of solitary a little bit the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the vertical load applied to the bridge deck is not as good as that for the horizontal load the reducing rates of the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck by the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 17 it clearly shows that the variation of reducing rates of the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck exhibit strong nonlinear behavior reductions in horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights range from 6 9 to 23 1 and from 3 0 to 7 5 respectively 4 3 effects of submersion depth since the coastal bridge decks may have different clearance heights along the whole bridge and the storm surge increases as storms approach the coast similar as our previous researches qu et al 2017 effects of the submersion depth on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated five different submersion depths are selected s s av 1 2 0 1 2 1 and 3 2 in the computations the still water depth h is kept as 6 m the wave height ratio ε is 0 25 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability of breakwater n is 0 5 snapshots of the velocity contours under different submersion depths at different time instances are plotted in fig 18 it is observed that the chambers are gradually filled fully with water as submersion depth increases meanwhile the intensity of the wave tongue is enhanced with the submersion depth and the amount of the overtopping water increases after s 0 similar as the results demonstrated in section 4 2 due the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the intensity of solitary wave impacting at the bridge deck and the amount of the overtopping water on the top of the coastal bridge deck are greatly reduced in addition the velocity magnitudes of flow current around the bridge deck at the moment of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck is also greatly reduced by the submerged porous breakwater variations of the maximum horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck with and without the submerged porous breakwater under solitary wave with submersion depth are depicted in fig 19 it is seen that both horizontal and vertical loads approach their maximum values at s 1av fig 20 depicts the reducing rates of the submerged porous breakwater in hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck as shown in fig 20 the maximum reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads occur at s av 1 2 once s av 1 2 influences of the submersion depth on the reducing rate in horizontal load are very limited the reducing rate r h is nearly a constant the reducing rate r v gradually decreases with the submersion depth in a moderate mode nearly a constant horizontal and vertical loads reductions range from 8 2 to 22 1 and from 0 1 to 13 3 respectively 4 4 effects of water depth in this section effects of the water depth on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated and five different water depths are selected i e h 4 5 6 7 and 8 m the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability of breakwater n is set as 0 5 fig 21 plots the snapshots of velocity contours under different water depth at the moment of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck it is seen that when the water depth is small h 4 m the intensity of solitary wave impinging the bridge deck is strong and the amount of the overtopping water is also large fig 21a as the water depth increases the amount of the overtopping water is gradually decreased due to an extended solitary wavelength fig 21b c d and e it is also observed that the existence of the submerged porous breakwater can greatly decrease the intensity of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck especially when water depth is small h 4 m variations of maximum horizontal and vertical loads with water depth are depicted in fig 22 the maximum horizontal loads of the bridge deck with and without breakwater both approach the maximum values at h 7 m fig 22a the maximum vertical load monotonically decreases with water depth for the bridge deck without the submerged porous breakwater on the contrary the maximum vertical load monotonically increases with water depth for the bridge deck with the submerged porous breakwater fig 22b the maximum reducing rates for horizontal and vertical loads both occur at h 4 m fig 23 overall reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck gradually decrease with water depth the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different water depth range from 1 6 to 75 5 and from 1 1 to 53 1 respectively 4 5 effects of spacing distance in this section effects of spacing distance d between breakwater and bridge on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck are numerically investigated by selecting five different spacing distances i e d d a h 2 2 5 3 3 5 and 4 the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 and the permeability of breakwater n is set as 0 5 as shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the influences of spacing distance between breakwater and bridge on velocity contours and reducing rates of hydrodynamic loads are very limited the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different spacing distance range from 10 29 to 17 21 and from 0 23 to 4 19 respectively 4 6 effects of permeability and aspect ratio of breakwater in this section five different permeabilities n i e n 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 are selected to investigate the effects of permeability on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the porous breakwater is 7 4 m wide and 3 7 m high with an aspect ratio of breakwater l p 0 5 and the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h fig 26 plots the snapshots of velocity contours under different permeabilities at the moment of solitary wave impinging the coastal bridge deck it is shown that the influences of permeability on the velocity contours around the bridge deck are very limited which is also reflected in the variations of reducing rates of hydrodynamic loads with permeability fig 27 the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different permeability range from 0 04 to 10 3 and from 1 1 to 3 respectively effects of aspect ratios on the performance of the submerged porous breakwater are investigated by selecting five different aspect ratios l p a v p a h p i e l p 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 the incident wave height h is kept as 1 5 m the still water depth h is kept as 6 m submersion depth of bridge deck s is set as 0 the spacing distance between the breakwater and bridge deck d is set as 3 a h and the permeability is set as 0 5 to investigate effects of the height of breakwater a v p the width of breakwater a h p is set as a constant value 7 4m apparently the impacting intensity of solitary wave at the bridge deck is greatly reduced with the height of breakwater due to the enhanced blocking effect of the breakwater fig 28 left side meanwhile the magnitude of the high velocity below the bridge deck girders is also greatly reduced as the height of the breakwater increases variations of reducing rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck with the height of breakwater of the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 29 left side both the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads monotonically increases with the height of the submerged porous breakwater the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different aspect ratios range from 1 7 to 60 1 and from 0 3 to 24 9 respectively otherwise the height of breakwater a v p is set as a constant value 3 7m to study effects of the width of breakwater a h p as shown in fig 28 right side the intensity of solitary wave impacting on the bridge deck is slightly reduced with the width of breakwater on account of the longer interaction time between wave and breakwater at the meantime the magnitude of the high velocity below the bridge deck girders is also slightly reduced as the width of the breakwater increases variations of reducing rates in hydrodynamic loads of the bridge deck with the width of breakwater of the submerged porous breakwater are plotted in fig 29 right side the reducing rates in horizontal load monotonically increases with the width of the submerged porous breakwater but the influence of the width of breakwater on vertical load is very limited the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different width of breakwater range from 3 91 to 21 25 and from 2 55 to 3 37 respectively 5 conclusions in this paper a high resolution numerical wave tank was established using the open source flow solver reef3d to investigate the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the hydrodynamic loads applied to the bridge deck under solitary wave with respect to five prominent factors wave height water depth and submersion depth permeability and aspect ratio the major conclusions drawn from this research can be summarized as follows 1 reef3d is able to predict the complex flow phenomena of solitary waves impacting bridge deck with the installation of the submerged porous breakwater due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the intensity of solitary wave impacting the bridge deck can be greatly reduced 2 as the incident wave height increases due to the existence of the submerged porous breakwater the magnitude of high velocity region below the bridge deck is greatly reduced and more incident wave energy can be absorbed in the intensified shedding vortices from the top wall of the breakwater the performance of the submerged porous breakwater in reducing the vertical load applied to the bridge deck is not as good as that for the horizontal load the reducing rates in horizontal and vertical loads under different wave heights range from 6 9 to 23 1 and 3 0 to 7 5 respectively 3 maximum reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads occur at s 1 2 once s 1 2 influences of the submersion depth on the reducing rate in horizontal load are very limited the reducing rate r h is nearly a constant the reducing rate r v gradually decreases with the submersion depth in a moderate mode the reducing rates in horizontal loads range from 8 2 to 22 1 the reducing rates in vertical loads ranges from 0 1 to 13 3 4 the maximum reducing rates for horizontal and vertical loads both occur at h 4 m the reducing rates for both horizontal and vertical loads applied to the bridge deck gradually decreases with water depth the reducing rates in horizontal load under different water depth range from 1 6 to 75 5 and the reducing rates under different water depth in vertical load range from 1 1 to 53 1 5 effects due to the permeability of the breakwater are negligible the maximum horizontal and vertical loads decrease almost linearly with permeability of breakwater overall the installation of the submerged porous breakwater can greatly reduce the hydrodynamic load applied to the coastal bridge deck under most of the situations especially for the horizontal load

21639,in the present paper a new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a combined with les is utilized to simulate the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca0009 hydrofoil which considers the effect of non condensable gas on cavitation the predicted tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation agrees well with available experimental observations based on the numerical results the influence of different tip clearance sizes on tip leakage cavitating flow is discussed in detail it is shown that with the increase of tip clearance size the intensity of tip separation vortex tsv cavitation decreases while the intensity of tlv cavitation increases first and then decreases their fusion position moves downstream with the increase of tip clearance size moreover the numerical result implies that the size of tip clearance also has an impact on characteristics of sheet cavitation such as its length and shape finally the vorticity transport equation is utilized to investigate mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation as tip clearance size increases the effect of stretching term decreases while that of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases however it is found that the stretching term is dominant in all investigated cases regardless of tip clearance size keywords tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation non condensable gas clearance size les 1 introduction tip leakage flow is prevalent in axial turbomachines which is driven by the pressure difference between the blade pressure side ps and the suction side ss the vorticity shed from the blade tip rolls up into the so called tip leakage vortex tlv resulting in the blockage of flow passage efficiency loss and pressure fluctuations feng et al 2016 goto 1992 liu et al 2017 what s more in hydraulic machines if the intensity of tlv is large enough the low pressure prevailing in the vortex core may lead to vortex cavitation which may induce severe erosion of the blades and the casing as well as the undesirable noise gopalan et al 2001 liu et al 2018 the prevalence of this flow phenomenon and its detrimental effects have motivated numerous experimental and numerical researches li et al 2019a pendar and roohi 2018 wu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 a number of experiments have been conducted to understand the relationship between tip clearance size and tlv intensity the early researches on this subject were mainly concentrated on axial compressors inoue and kuroumaru 1984 inoue et al 1986 goto 1991 investigated three rotor tip clearance sizes in an axial compressor and concluded that an increase of clearance size led to a stronger tlv muthanna and devenport 2004 conducted extensive measurements downstream of a linear compressor cascade with tip gap they suggested that an increase in tip gap led to a stronger tlv while having little effect on the maximum streamwise mean velocity deficit and the turbulence level inside tlv there have also been many experiments focusing on tlv in hydraulic machines and hydrofoils miorini et al 2012 studied the inner structures of the tip flow and evolution of tlv in an axial waterjet pump in detail they observed that the instantaneous tlv structure was composed of unsteady vortex filaments which were embedded into a vortex sheet and then rolled up into tlv dreyer et al 2014 carried out detailed experiments on the effect of the clearance size on tlv generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil their measurements clearly revealed the existence of a specific tip clearance for which tlv intensity was maximum their work has provided not only valuable information regarding this flow but also extensive experimental database for validating computational techniques the occurrence of cavitation even further complexifies this problem li et al 2019b sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 farrell and billet 1994 investigated the cavitation in the tip leakage flow in an axial flow pump and indicated that the vortical flow was subject to cavitation their experiments showed a minimum of the cavitation inception index when the tip gap was set to an optimum value of 0 2 times the maximum tip thickness laborde et al 1997 conducted a combined study of tip clearance and tip vortex cavitation in an axial flow pump they indicated that the gap height had a strong effect on clearance cavitation inception boulon et al 1999 examined the effect of confinement on tip vortex cavitation tvc of an elliptical hydrofoil their experiments suggested that cavitation appeared earlier as tip clearance reduced from a relatively large value whereas no more tip vortex cavitation was observed for a very tiny tip clearance more recently the detailed measurements carried out by dreyer et al 2014 also paid attention to the relation between tip clearance size and tlv cavitation in addition to tlv cavitation there are some other cavitation patterns in the tip clearance flow field zhang et al 2015 studied cavitation patterns in the tip region of an axial flow pump in depth they observed that the cavitation patterns involved tlv cavitation tip separation vortex tsv cavitation shear layer cavitation and blowing cavitation they were merged into the unstable large scale tlv cloud cavitation growing and collapsing periodically near trailing edge these investigations significantly deepen understanding the behavior of tip leakage cavitating flow however how the tip clearance size influences tip leakage cavitating flow is still rarely reported the great progress in computational fluid dynamics cfd provides us a useful tool to study tip leakage cavitating flow there has been numerous numerical results with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models decaix et al 2015 feng et al 2016 szantyr et al 2011 however the rans models have the limitation for predicting unsteady cavitating flow such as the overestimation of the turbulent eddy viscosity and disability of capturing rotational motion therefore some investigations imposed modification on rans models guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 these modifications improve the prediction of time averaged turbulent flow field and capture the mean behavior of tlv well however they seem to be inadequate for the reproduction of some delicate vortex structures therefore many investigations turn to large eddy simulation les the selection of a suitable turbulence model is a crucial issue to have an accurate simulation les method is more suitable to capture flow details and study the internal flow principle the les turbulence model is investigated precisely in these references including non cavitating flow decaix et al 2015 pogorelov et al 2015 you et al 2006 and cavitating flow bai et al 2018 chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 2020b long et al 2019 wang et al 2018 pogorelov et al 2015 utilized les to capture the temporal generation and spatial development of intricate turbulent flow structures in the tip gap region decaix et al 2015 analyzed gross features of tlv based on rans results nevertheless they turned to les in the investigation of the flow topology in the tip gap region in general their work suggests that les performs better in reproducing some delicate vortex structures and characterizing the unsteadiness of tlv when it comes to cavitation another key in the numerical simulations of tip leakage cavitating flow is the cavitation model decaix et al 2018 used the cavitation model proposed by kunz et al 2000 to simulate the tip leakage cavitaing flow and the tlv cavity was severely underestimated bai et al 2018 adopted zwart gerber belamri zgb cavitation model and the degree of underestimation decreased but remained guo et al 2018 established a vortex cavitation model by calibrating the empirical condensation coefficient in zgb model which improved the prediction of tlv cavity at some degree recently with a carefully refined mesh cheng et al 2020b employed schnerr sauer ss cavitation model for the simulation of tlv cavitation the prediction of tlv cavity was significantly improved but still slightly underestimated it should be noted that these models mentioned above do not take the effect of non condensable gas into account however the non condensable gas was confirmed to have a significant impact on the cavitation inception local flow conditions and fluid properties by many studies battistoni et al 2015 reisman et al 1997 singhal et al 2002 meanwhile the concentration of non condensable gas may be quite high around a tip vortex or tlv asnaghi et al 2018 oweis et al 2005 therefore it may be inappropriate to ignore the influence of non condensable gas on tvc or tlv cavitation to solve this problem cheng et al 2020a first proposed a new euler lagrangian cavitation model in which the concentration of non condensable gas was taken into account this model has achieved satisfying numerical results in the investigation of tvc on an elliptical hydrofoil without confinement in virtue of the similarity between tvc and tlv cavitation the new cavitation model may be applicable to tlv cavitation as well inspired by the previous investigations in the present paper les combined with the new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a is employed for the prediction of tip leakage cavitaing flow generated by a naca0009 hydrofoil with three typical tip clearance sizes τ 0 1 1 0 and 2 0 we will check the applicability of the new cavitation model in the simulation of tip leakage cavitating flow at first and show its superiority over the conventional cavitation model then based on the numerical results with the new cavitation model the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation is discussed the relation between tip clearance size and sheet cavitation is also investigated finally the vorticity transport equation is utilized to study mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes 2 numerical method and simulation setup 2 1 governing equations and les approach in the present paper les is utilized to solve the turbulence field in the framework of homogeneous model the governing equations for les of multiphase flow can be obtained by filtering the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ m t x j ρ m u j 0 2 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m u i x j τ i j x j where the overbars denote filtered quantities u i is the velocity component i 1 2 3 p is the mixture pressure ρ m and μ m are the density and laminar viscosity of the mixture respectively defined as 3 ρ m α v ρ v 1 α v ρ l 4 μ m α v μ v 1 α v μ l where the subscripts v and l represent the vapor and liquid phase respectively and α v is the vapor volume fraction the last term in eq 2 called sub grid scale sgs stresses is unknown and requires modeling 5 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j which is commonly modeled based on the boussinesq hypothesis 6 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where τ kk is the isotropic part of the sgs stresses and is added to the filtered static pressure term s i j is the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale defined by 7 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i therefore the only unknown term in eq 6 is the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t different sgs models employ different methods to calculate μ t which is closed by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 in the

constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the volume of the computational cell and c w is the wale constant with the value of 0 325 the wale model returns the correct wall asymptotic y 3 behavior for wall bounded flows and returns a zero turbulent viscosity for laminar shear flows whose superiority has been demonstrated by many publications decaix et al 2015 ji et al 2013 long et al 2018 you et al 2007 2 2 physical cavitation model in the original ss cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 the interphase mass transfer is governed by the vapor transport equation as follows 11 t α v ρ v x j α v ρ v u v j r where r on the right hand side rhs is the net phase change rate which is defined as follows in the ss cavitation model 12 r r e r c ρ v ρ l ρ m d α v d t where r e and r c are connected to the growth and collapse of vapor bubbles respectively and are modeled based on the rayleigh plesset r p equation 13 r b d 2 r b d t 2 3 2 d r b d t 2 4 ν l r b d r b d t 2 σ ρ l r b p b p ρ l where r b is the bubble radius ν l is the liquid kinematic viscosity σ is the liquid surface tension coefficient p b is the pressure in the bubble p is the local pressure the terms on the left hand side lhs are the second order derivative term the first order derivative term the viscous term and the surface tension term respectively neglecting the second order term the viscous and surface tension force eq 13 is simplified to 14 3 2 d r b d t 2 p b p ρ l then the following equation can be easily obtained 15 d r b d t 2 3 p b p ρ l where p b the pressure in the bubble can be written as 16 p b p v p g 2 σ r b where p v is the saturation vapor pressure pg is the partial pressure of non condensable gas the last term on the rhs denotes the effect of surface tension which is rather small and can be ignored in the original ss model pb is assumed to be equal to p v in the absence of non condensable gas then one can obtain 17 d r b d t 2 3 p v p ρ l based on eqs 12 and 17 r can be derived by establishing the relationship between α v and r b which is defined as 18 α v n 4 3 π r b 3 1 n 4 3 π r b 3 where n is the bubble number density then schnerr and sauer derived the following equations 19 r e ρ v ρ l ρ m α v 1 α v 3 r b 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v 20 r c ρ v ρ l ρ m α v 1 α v 3 r b 2 3 p p v ρ l if p p v where r b is related to α v and n 21 r b α v 1 α v 3 4 π 1 n 1 3 in ss model n is the only parameter that must be determined and is set to 1013 by default it should be noted that n is actually the number density of vapor bubble due to the ignorance of non condensable gas the ss model has been widely utilized in many studies to predict cavitation in a variety of applications valdes et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 žnidarčič et al 2015 and the predictions on sheet cavitation are generally reasonable though the influence of non condensable gas is omitted however as mentioned above the ignorance of non condensable gas may be infeasible in some special flow such as vortex cavitating flow the strong rotational motion of vortex tends to roll up the non condensable gas into its core inducing a significant increase of its concentration in the center of vortex asnaghi et al 2018 oweis et al 2005 it suggests that the partial pressure of non condensable gas may be non negligible therefore in the new cavitation model the bubble pressure p b is not equal to p v but the sum of p v and partial pressure of non condensable gas pg the effect of surface tension is omitted as the original ss model now the problem is all about how to evaluate the value of p b the pressure in a mixture bubble of vapor and non condensable gas we can simplify the formation of a mixed bubble to the fusion of two bubbles of its constituents hereinafter referred to as gas bubble and vapor bubble respectively the initial equilibrium of a gas bubble which can be described by the following equation 22 p p g i 0 2 σ r g i 0 where p is the local pressure in the far field the subscript i is the gas bubble index and the number after that denotes different states for instance 0 represents the initial state σ is the surface tension coefficient between the liquid and the gas bubble which can be neglected then eq 22 can be simplified to 23 p g i 0 p similarly we can derive the equilibrium equation of the gas bubble when it approaches the tip clearance region 24 p g i 1 p where p is the local pressure according to the adiabatic equation of ideal gas bubble we can obtain 25 r g i 1 r g i 0 3 γ p g i 0 p g i 1 p p where γ is the specific heat ratio with the value of 1 4 it should be noted that there may be many gas bubbles in any single cell to simplify the following fusion process with the vapor bubbles these micro bubbles can be regarded as a single gas bubble whose pressure radius and volume can be written as 26 p g 2 p 27 r g 2 3 v g 2 4 π 1 3 28 v g 2 v g t o t a l 4 π 3 i 1 n r g i 1 3 similarly the micro vapor bubbles in any single cell can be treated as a single vapor bubble whose pressure is p v and the radius is defined as 29 r v 3 v v 4 π 1 3 where v v is the total volume of vapor bubbles in a cell if r g2 is larger than r v the vapor bubble will merge into the gas bubble while the radius of the latter remains unchanged we can derive the total pressure of the mixed bubble 30 p b p g 2 p v r v r g 2 3 γ conversely if r g2 is smaller than r v the fusion process can be regarded as that the gas bubble merges into the vapor bubble then the total pressure of the mixed bubble is given as 31 p b p v p g 2 r g 2 r v 3 γ note that the fusion process begins with a requirement for the size of the bubbles if the gas bubble and the vapor bubble are much smaller than the local cell volume the fusion process is hard to happen therefore in the present paper only when the total volume of the gas and vapor bubbles reaches 1 1000 of local cell volume the modification will be activated otherwise the original ss model will be utilized moreover the new cavitation model requires the knowledge about the migration of non condensable gas bubbles which is modeled with the discrete phase model dpm in the present paper in dpm the effect of pressure gradient term on the movement of gas bubbles is considered fig 1 shows the calculation process with the modified cavitation model including the working principle of dpm for each timestep up to 40 iterations is calculated to get the global flow field with euler method during which the movement of gas bubbles is simulated every 10 iterations to obtain local gas bubble distribution with lagrangian approach then local total pressure of the mixed bubble p b is calculated with eqs 22 31 and sent to the modified cavitation model to calculate the local mass transportation cheng et al 2020a the new algorithm is implemented in ansys fluent in the present paper 2 3 simulation setup according to the experiments by dreyer et al 2014 the coordinate definition computational domain and boundary conditions in the current simulation are shown in fig 2 the tip leakage cavitating flow is generated by a naca0009 hydrofoil with a chord length of c 100 mm the origin is located on the hydrofoil tip at the midpoint of the chord with x y and z aligned with the spanwise transverse and streamwise directions respectively the corresponding velocity components are referred to as u v and w to accord with the treatment in experiments the corner of the foil tip at the pressure side is rounded with a radius of 1 mm the length of the tunnel is 7 5c with a cross section of 1 5c 1 5c the inlet is at 2 0c upstream of the foil leading edge and the total pressure is fixed at 153 kpa to keep the time averaged static pressure p st is about 1 bar as in the experiment the outlet velocity w is set to 10 m s non slip wall condition is applied to the foil and the tunnel wall near the gap while other tunnel walls are set as free slip wall based on these setup the reynolds number and the cavitation number are defined as follows respectively 32 r e w c ν l 10 6 33 σ p s t p v 1 2 ρ l w 2 1 93 the hydrofoil incidence angle α is set to 10 three typical tip clearance sizes τ 0 1 0 7 and 2 0 corresponding to small medium and large clearance sizes are simulated where τ is the non dimensional clearance size and is defined as 34 τ g a p h where gap is the size of tip clearance h is the hydrofoil maximum thickness with value of 9 9 mm the sst k ω turbulence model is utilized to obtain a steady state result as the initial flow field then les combined with the modified ss cavitation model is employed to simulate the transient cavitating flow as a comparison les combined with the original ss cavitation model is also used to predict the tip leakage cavitating flow in the present investigation simplec is utilized as the pressure velocity coupling method all differential equations are discretized by finite volume method fvm and solved implicitly a bounded central differencing scheme is chosen for the convection term of the momentum equation which is recognized as an ideal choice for les with fairly low numerical diffusion for the unsteady simulation the time dependent computations are solved by a bounded second order implicit scheme a least squares cell based method is used to compute the gradients and derivatives in the equations the convergence criterion is the absolute residual type with a residual target of 10 4 which is set for all the resolved equations including continuity u v w and vapor volume fraction the time step size is set to 1 10 5s which is determined by considering the requirement of courant or cfl number for les cfl is defined as follows 35 cfl δ t u δ x where δt is the time step size u is the module of the velocity vector in a cell and δx is the size of this cell fig 3 shows the value of cfl near the tip clearance region with τ 0 7 as an example in which fig 3 a shows the value of cfl around tsv cavitation and fig 3 b shows that around tlv cavitation it indicates that the maximum of cfl is below 1 fulfilling the requirement of cfl for les in addition the time dependent computations are solved by a fully implicit scheme in the present paper which is ideally stable with respect to time step size therefore the current time step size setting can achieve a good balance between the computational accuracy and cost 3 mesh generation and refinement in the current paper a so called cartesian cut cell method bai et al 2018 hartmann et al 2011 ingram et al 2003 is utilized to generate the meshes for simulation the experiments by dreyer et al 2014 have revealed that tlv proceeds quite far to the downstream which has high requirement for mesh therefore to gain a balance between the computational cost and accuracy a region that covers its possible reach is marked for mesh refinement as shown in fig 4 the mesh in the boundary layer around the foil and near the gap wall is carefully refined to fulfill the requirement of les fig 5 shows distributions of dimensionless distance y at the foil surface with mesh 1 3 which is defined as follows 36 y y u τ ν where y is the height of the first layer mesh and u τ is the friction velocity note that mesh 1 3 are three sets of mesh with different resolution and their generation schemes will be introduced in the next paragraph to resolve the boundary layer appropriately it is required that y 1 for les however it is hard to strictly meet this requirement for tip leakage cavitating flow fig 5 indicates that the value of y for all the three sets of mesh is mostly between 0 1 meanwhile the maximum of y is below 5 which is the threshold from viscous sublayer to buffer layer that means the first layer mesh is inside the viscous sublayer therefore the mesh in the boundary layer basically fulfills the requirement of les to show the influence of mesh resolution on the numerical results three sets of mesh for τ 0 7 are generated named mesh 1 2 and 3 respectively whose node number are given in table 1 the difference between mesh 1 and 2 lies in the element size of the region marked for mesh refinement mentioned above based on the sst result obtained with mesh 2 the adaptive grid refinement is implemented and the new mesh is named as mesh 3 the effect of mesh refinement highly depends on the choice of refining criterion the rotation faction f r guo et al 2018 is reported to have a better effect on tlv identification when compared with other criteria cheng et al 2020b therefore f r with the range of 0 0 9 is utilized for the refinement in the current simulation fig 6 shows the mesh distribution of the three sets of mesh on the downstream cross section z c 1 with the same method meshes for τ 0 1 and 2 0 are also generated to save the computational cost the mesh study is conducted based on the numerical results with the original ss cavitation model the predicted tlv cavities for τ 0 7 with mesh 1 3 are displayed in fig 7 the instant tlv cavity with mesh 1 has a larger circumferential size but a remarkable shorter length compared with the experimental snapshot indicating mesh 1 is too coarse to obtain a reliable numerical result as a contrast the predicted tlv cavity by mesh 2 is much better when compared with the experimental observation but still underestimates the strength of tlv cavitation to obtain a better prediction on tlv cavity mesh 3 is generated with the adaptive grid technique based on mesh 2 as mentioned above and the node number of mesh 3 is almost twice that of mesh 2 however as shown in fig 7 there is no significant improvement on the prediction of tlv cavity with mesh 3 comparing with mesh 2 moreover the comparison between the predicted time averaged axial velocity with mesh 2 and the measured data on downstream cross section z c 1 0 in non cavitation condition in fig 8 indicates that the lower than freestream i e wake like axial velocity in tlv core for τ 0 1 and the higher than freestream i e jet like one for τ 0 7 and 2 0 are already captured quite well with mesh 2 our results suggest that further increase in the mesh resolution is not so advisable 4 results and discussions 4 1 applicability of the new cavitation model as mentioned above the new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a involves the influence of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation so the knowledge about the initial gas content and its distribution in the water is very important in the new model some measurements chen et al 2019 song et al 2017 yakubov et al 2013 indicated that both the mass concentration and the radius of nuclei exhibited a wide range around 2 76 10 5 5 38 10 5 kg m3 for the former and 0 110 μm for the latter respectively in the present simulation for simplicity we assume the initial mass concentration of non condensable gas is c g0 5 10 5 kg m3 and all the gas bubbles share the same radius with the value of 20 μm in order to balance the computational cost and the simulation accuracy of gas bubble migration around tlv the gas bubbles are injected uniformly from a circular cross section with the radius of 0 2c located 0 7c upstream of the foil axis near the endwall as shown in fig 9 the initial velocity of non condensable gas bubbles w g0 remains the same as the main flow i e w g0 10 m s fig 10 a displays the profile of non condensable gas in the tip clearance flow field under non cavitation condition and three typical cross sections are utilized to show the concentration in more detail as shown in fig 10 b it shows that the gas bubbles are apt to be rolled up into tlv especially in the downstream region where tlv is fully developed the concentration of non condensable gas in tlv core may be more than ten times the initial value on the downstream cross sections z c 0 6 and 1 2 in fig 10 b the non condensable gas with such a high concentration in tlv core should leave a significant influence on the inception of local cavitation fig 11 and fig 12 compare the instant and time averaged tlv cavities reproduced with the original ss model and the modified one for three tip clearance sizes a significant improvement on the prediction of tlv cavity can be observed with the new cavitation model when compared with the original ss model especially for middle clearance τ 0 7 and large clearance τ 2 0 for small clearance τ 0 1 the tlv dissipates quickly due to the influence of the wall hence it hard for tlv to capture gas bubbles therefore for small tip clearance size the influence of non condensable gas is not so important and the predicted short lasting tlv cavity even with the original cavitation model can have a good agreement with the experimental observation however for middle clearance τ 0 7 and large clearance τ 2 0 the influence of non condensable gas is non negligible as shown in figs 11 and 12 the instant tlv cavity with the original ss model only reaches the downstream position of z c 1 23 for τ 0 7 while with the new cavitation model the position extends as far as z c 2 37 almost twice the former which shows a much better agreement with the experimental observation for large clearance τ 2 0 the low strength of tlv makes the reproduction of the extremely fine tlv cavity difficult however with the consideration of non condensable gas the problem has been well solved which also implies the importance of non condensable gas in the investigation of such vortex cavitating flow in general the new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation proposed by cheng et al 2020a has good applicability in the tip leakage cavitating flow and can significantly improve the prediction of tlv cavity in a wide range of tip clearance sizes 4 2 effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation to investigate the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation fig 13 shows cavitation patterns and corresponding vortex structures at a typical instant for small medium and large clearance sizes the vortexes are displayed by the iso surface of q criterion colored with axial vorticity which is defined as follows 37 ω z v x u y as shown in fig 13 three distinct vortex structures in the tip leakage cavitating flow can be clearly observed including tlv tsv and induced vortexes ivs regardless of clearance size tsv is formed due to flow separation on the foil tip at the pressure side and moves towards the suction side due to the tip leakage flow and rollup of tlv therefore tsv has the same rotation direction as tlv ivs are induced from the endwall by tlv and its rotation direction is opposite to that of tlv which will accelerate the dissipation of tlv since cavitation is closely related to vortex structures the research about vortex structures under different tip clearance sizes should be helpful to understand the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation for small clearance τ 0 1 as shown in fig 14 due to the greater pressure difference between the pressure and suction side the velocity of the leakage flow under small clearance is rather faster than that for τ 0 7 and 2 0 as shown in fig 15 moreover the gap is quite narrow and there is no enough space for tsv to roll up by itself therefore for small clearance tsv fuses with tlv almost from its birth correspondingly tlv and tsv cavities fuse together almost from the leading edge further downstream the extreme proximity of tlv to endwall leads to complex ivs which has a strong dissipation effect on tlv that s why tlv under such a tiny clearance can just sustain till half the chord and further leads to a short tlv cavity for medium clearance τ 0 7 tlv and tsv both come into being from the leading edge separated by the foil tip there is a relatively short period during which tlv and tsv develop independently then tsv is rolled into tlv due to the influence of tip leakage flow and the entrainment of tlv the corresponding cavitation pattern also presents such a process afterwards the mixed vortex develops downstream and induces complicated ivs the interaction between tlv and ivs is believed to be responsible for the wandering of tlv cavity for large clearance τ 2 0 tlv and tsv are both very weak and the independent development stage lasts longer till the trailing edge correspondingly tsv cavitation is so weak that it is hardly visible and tlv cavity is rather slender the fusion position of the two cavities moves downstream till the trailing edge the low strength of the mixed vortex and its distance from the endwall lead to low intensity of ivs which even cannot be displayed by the iso surface of q 106 s 2 therefore the tlv cavity for large clearance is more stable than that for small and middle clearances in general as tip clearance size increases the intensity of tsv decreases while the intensity of tlv increases first and then decreases the duration of their independent development prolongs and their fusion position moves downstream correspondingly the strength of tsv and tlv cavitation and their fusion position with tip clearance size also witness such a variation trend in addition the intensity of ivs reduces with increasing tip clearance size as ivs have an adverse effect on the stability of tlv further the effect also exists for the stability of tlv cavitation therefore the tlv cavitation becomes more and more stable with increasing tip clearance size 4 3 effect of tip clearance size on sheet cavitation as the tip clearance size varies there is also a great change in the evolution of sheet cavitation fig 16 shows the time averaged sheet cavities from a top view note that since our focus is the sheet cavitation in this sub section the tlv cavities are truncated at the foil trailing edge it can be observed that the coverage of sheet cavity expands as the tip clearance size decreases to assess it quantitatively the dimensionless span averaged length of sheet cavity l is defined as follows 38 l v s h e e t s c h where v s h e e t is the time averaged volume of sheet cavity s is the span and its values are 1 49c 1 43c 1 3c for small middle and large clearance sizes respectively the variation of l with the clearance size is given in table 2 as tip clearance enlarges the area of cross section becomes larger which will decrease the velocity of fluids passing the hydrofoil and result in relatively weaker sheet cavitation since the sheet cavitation almost covers the whole span it should have a great impact on the hydraulic characteristic of hydrofoil for example the lift coefficient which is defined as follows 39 c l f l 1 2 ρ w 2 c s where f l is the lift force fig 17 shows the variation of lift coefficient in several relatively stable periods for different clearance sizes it can be found that the time averaged value of lift coefficient decreases as the clearance enlarges since the lift is generated by the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides the knowledge about the pressure distribution around hydrofoil may help to figure out the mechanism for how clearance size influences the hydrofoil performance to this end the variation of time averaged pressure coefficients along a polyline which is the intersection of hydrofoil surface and the plane x c 0 7 for different clearance sizes is displayed in fig 18 the pressure coefficient is defined as follows 40 c p p p 1 2 ρ w 2 it can be observed that there is no significant difference of pressure distribution on the pressure side for different tip clearance sizes however the pressure distribution on the suction side especially in the region 0 3 z c 0 3 is quite different for different tip clearance sizes the pressure distribution on the suction side is closely related to the length of sheet cavity in the region with sheet cavity such as 0 5 z c 0 for τ 0 1 the value of c p remains low while in the region without sheet cavity such as 0 z c 0 5 for τ 0 1 c p gradually increases and then reaches a stable higher value as tip clearance size increases the sheet cavity shortens resulting in the turning point of c p from a lower value to a higher one moving upstream for example the position of the turning point is around z c 0 0 2 0 3 for τ 0 1 0 7 and 2 0 respectively in addition with the increase of tip clearance size the higher value of c p in the non cavitation region increases while the tip clearance size has little influence on the lower value of c p in the cavitation region therefore the variations both in the turning point and the higher value of c p result in the less pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides for larger tip clearance therefore the lift coefficient decreases with the increase of tip clearance size moreover as shown in figs 13 and 16 the tip clearance size also leaves an impact on the shape of sheet cavitation near the foil tip to figure out the behind reason the distribution of pressure and velocity vectors at a typical instant on the cross section z c 0 35 with corresponding cavitation patterns are displayed in fig 19 b and a respectively it can be seen that for τ 2 0 under the rotating action of tlv the leakage flow forms a circumferential flow and hits the foil suction surface which results in the relatively high local pressure for τ 0 7 the circumferential flow is more intense due to the higher intensity of tlv which leads to the compressed high pressure region along the span therefore at the same streamwise location as tip clearance size decreases the gap between sheet and tlv cavity is narrowed that is the inclined angle of sheet cavity near the foil tip decreases when the tip clearance size is reduced to a certain extent for example τ 0 1 the low intensity of cavitating tlv and the intense leakage flow make the circumferential flow hard to form therefore there is no high pressure region between sheet and tlv cavitation leading to the connected sheet and tlv cavity and absence of the inclined angle of sheet cavity 4 4 effect of tip clearance size on vorticity transport since tlv cavitation has a close relation with tlv the occurrence of cavitation may leave an influence on the local vortex field which has been confirmed bai et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 ji et al 2014 this view is also verified in the present paper as shown in fig 20 compared with the axial vorticity distribution in non cavitation condition the low axial vorticity inside the cavity is noticeable when tlv cavitation develops indicating cavitation may induce vorticity transport bai et al 2018 studied the vortex dynamics by a series of streamwise cross sections under a specific tip clearance cheng et al 2019 compared the case in non cavitation condition with that in cavitation condition however there are few publications focused on the vorticity transport around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes therefore in the present paper we apply the vorticity transport equation to the cavitating cases with different tip clearance sizes as tlv cavitation develops along z direction the vorticity transport equation in z direction is adopted which can be written as 41 d ω z d t ω v z ω v z ρ m p ρ m 2 z ν m ν t 2 ω z the four terms on the rhs are the stretching dilatation baroclinic torque and viscous diffusion terms respectively having the following form 42 ω v z ω x w x ω y w y ω z w z 43 ω v z ω z u x v y w z 44 ρ m p ρ m 2 z ρ l ρ v ρ m 2 α v x p y α v y p x 45 ν m ν t 2 ω z ν m ν t 2 ω z x 2 2 ω z y 2 2 ω z z 2 the stretching term denotes the influence of vortex stretching compressing and tilting caused by velocity gradient the dilatation term reflects the fluid compressibility and the baroclinic torque term is generated due to the misalignment between pressure and density gradients the viscous diffusion term is as its name suggests caused by vorticity viscous diffusion which is much smaller compared with the other three terms thus omitted in the following discussion figs 21 23 display the distributions of the stretching dilatation and baroclinic torque terms near the tlv cavity respectively for small clearance τ 0 1 the stretching term is persistently dominant the dilatation and baroclinic torque terms play a role near the location z c 0 while in the downstream these two terms seem to be negligible for medium clearance τ 0 7 each of the three terms plays its own role in the whole process of tlv cavitation development for large clearance τ 2 0 the effect of stretching and dilatation terms is about the same proportion in the whole process while the baroclinic torque term can always be neglected on the whole the stretching term is dominant among the three terms regardless of tip clearance size as tip clearance increases the effect of stretching term decreases due to the less complicated ivs the effect of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases due to the same trend of tlv cavitation intensity 5 conclusions in the present paper the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca0009 hydrofoil is studied numerically by les combined with a new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation the predicted tlv cavitation agrees well with available experimental observations the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the concentrated distribution of non condensable gas around tlv core verifies the capability of tlv to roll the non condensable gas into its core and further confirms the important role non condensable gas plays in the vortex cavitation based on this particularity a new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation proposed by cheng et al 2020a is applied to the tip leakage cavitating flow compared with tlv cavities obtained with the original ss cavitation model the new model achieves a much better agreement with the referenced experiment in a wide range of tip clearance sizes the new cavitation model is capable to extend tlv cavity further downstream and capture the extremely fine tlv cavity quite well which is hard to reproduce for conventional cavitation models under some conditions 2 as tip clearance size increases the intensity of tsv cavitation decreases while that of tlv cavitation increases first and then decreases in addition with the increase of tip clearance size the duration of their independent development prolongs and their fusion position moves downstream the tlv cavitation becomes more and more stable with increasing tip clearance size due to the decreasing strength of ivs 3 as tip clearance size increases the sheet cavitation weakens and the time averaged lift coefficient decreases due to the smaller pressure difference between the foil pressure side and suction side the tip clearance size also has an effect on the shape of sheet cavity near the foil tip the local high pressure caused by the circumferential flow under the rotating action of cavitating tlv is the cause of the inclined angle of sheet cavity near the foil tip 4 the vorticity transport equation is utilized to investigate mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes as tip clearance size increases the effect of stretching term decreases while that of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases however the stretching term is dominant in all investigated cases regardless of tip clearance size

21639,in the present paper a new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a combined with les is utilized to simulate the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca0009 hydrofoil which considers the effect of non condensable gas on cavitation the predicted tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation agrees well with available experimental observations based on the numerical results the influence of different tip clearance sizes on tip leakage cavitating flow is discussed in detail it is shown that with the increase of tip clearance size the intensity of tip separation vortex tsv cavitation decreases while the intensity of tlv cavitation increases first and then decreases their fusion position moves downstream with the increase of tip clearance size moreover the numerical result implies that the size of tip clearance also has an impact on characteristics of sheet cavitation such as its length and shape finally the vorticity transport equation is utilized to investigate mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation as tip clearance size increases the effect of stretching term decreases while that of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases however it is found that the stretching term is dominant in all investigated cases regardless of tip clearance size keywords tip leakage vortex tlv cavitation non condensable gas clearance size les 1 introduction tip leakage flow is prevalent in axial turbomachines which is driven by the pressure difference between the blade pressure side ps and the suction side ss the vorticity shed from the blade tip rolls up into the so called tip leakage vortex tlv resulting in the blockage of flow passage efficiency loss and pressure fluctuations feng et al 2016 goto 1992 liu et al 2017 what s more in hydraulic machines if the intensity of tlv is large enough the low pressure prevailing in the vortex core may lead to vortex cavitation which may induce severe erosion of the blades and the casing as well as the undesirable noise gopalan et al 2001 liu et al 2018 the prevalence of this flow phenomenon and its detrimental effects have motivated numerous experimental and numerical researches li et al 2019a pendar and roohi 2018 wu et al 2016 xu et al 2018 a number of experiments have been conducted to understand the relationship between tip clearance size and tlv intensity the early researches on this subject were mainly concentrated on axial compressors inoue and kuroumaru 1984 inoue et al 1986 goto 1991 investigated three rotor tip clearance sizes in an axial compressor and concluded that an increase of clearance size led to a stronger tlv muthanna and devenport 2004 conducted extensive measurements downstream of a linear compressor cascade with tip gap they suggested that an increase in tip gap led to a stronger tlv while having little effect on the maximum streamwise mean velocity deficit and the turbulence level inside tlv there have also been many experiments focusing on tlv in hydraulic machines and hydrofoils miorini et al 2012 studied the inner structures of the tip flow and evolution of tlv in an axial waterjet pump in detail they observed that the instantaneous tlv structure was composed of unsteady vortex filaments which were embedded into a vortex sheet and then rolled up into tlv dreyer et al 2014 carried out detailed experiments on the effect of the clearance size on tlv generated by a straight naca0009 hydrofoil their measurements clearly revealed the existence of a specific tip clearance for which tlv intensity was maximum their work has provided not only valuable information regarding this flow but also extensive experimental database for validating computational techniques the occurrence of cavitation even further complexifies this problem li et al 2019b sun et al 2019 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 farrell and billet 1994 investigated the cavitation in the tip leakage flow in an axial flow pump and indicated that the vortical flow was subject to cavitation their experiments showed a minimum of the cavitation inception index when the tip gap was set to an optimum value of 0 2 times the maximum tip thickness laborde et al 1997 conducted a combined study of tip clearance and tip vortex cavitation in an axial flow pump they indicated that the gap height had a strong effect on clearance cavitation inception boulon et al 1999 examined the effect of confinement on tip vortex cavitation tvc of an elliptical hydrofoil their experiments suggested that cavitation appeared earlier as tip clearance reduced from a relatively large value whereas no more tip vortex cavitation was observed for a very tiny tip clearance more recently the detailed measurements carried out by dreyer et al 2014 also paid attention to the relation between tip clearance size and tlv cavitation in addition to tlv cavitation there are some other cavitation patterns in the tip clearance flow field zhang et al 2015 studied cavitation patterns in the tip region of an axial flow pump in depth they observed that the cavitation patterns involved tlv cavitation tip separation vortex tsv cavitation shear layer cavitation and blowing cavitation they were merged into the unstable large scale tlv cloud cavitation growing and collapsing periodically near trailing edge these investigations significantly deepen understanding the behavior of tip leakage cavitating flow however how the tip clearance size influences tip leakage cavitating flow is still rarely reported the great progress in computational fluid dynamics cfd provides us a useful tool to study tip leakage cavitating flow there has been numerous numerical results with reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models decaix et al 2015 feng et al 2016 szantyr et al 2011 however the rans models have the limitation for predicting unsteady cavitating flow such as the overestimation of the turbulent eddy viscosity and disability of capturing rotational motion therefore some investigations imposed modification on rans models guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 these modifications improve the prediction of time averaged turbulent flow field and capture the mean behavior of tlv well however they seem to be inadequate for the reproduction of some delicate vortex structures therefore many investigations turn to large eddy simulation les the selection of a suitable turbulence model is a crucial issue to have an accurate simulation les method is more suitable to capture flow details and study the internal flow principle the les turbulence model is investigated precisely in these references including non cavitating flow decaix et al 2015 pogorelov et al 2015 you et al 2006 and cavitating flow bai et al 2018 chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2019 2020b long et al 2019 wang et al 2018 pogorelov et al 2015 utilized les to capture the temporal generation and spatial development of intricate turbulent flow structures in the tip gap region decaix et al 2015 analyzed gross features of tlv based on rans results nevertheless they turned to les in the investigation of the flow topology in the tip gap region in general their work suggests that les performs better in reproducing some delicate vortex structures and characterizing the unsteadiness of tlv when it comes to cavitation another key in the numerical simulations of tip leakage cavitating flow is the cavitation model decaix et al 2018 used the cavitation model proposed by kunz et al 2000 to simulate the tip leakage cavitaing flow and the tlv cavity was severely underestimated bai et al 2018 adopted zwart gerber belamri zgb cavitation model and the degree of underestimation decreased but remained guo et al 2018 established a vortex cavitation model by calibrating the empirical condensation coefficient in zgb model which improved the prediction of tlv cavity at some degree recently with a carefully refined mesh cheng et al 2020b employed schnerr sauer ss cavitation model for the simulation of tlv cavitation the prediction of tlv cavity was significantly improved but still slightly underestimated it should be noted that these models mentioned above do not take the effect of non condensable gas into account however the non condensable gas was confirmed to have a significant impact on the cavitation inception local flow conditions and fluid properties by many studies battistoni et al 2015 reisman et al 1997 singhal et al 2002 meanwhile the concentration of non condensable gas may be quite high around a tip vortex or tlv asnaghi et al 2018 oweis et al 2005 therefore it may be inappropriate to ignore the influence of non condensable gas on tvc or tlv cavitation to solve this problem cheng et al 2020a first proposed a new euler lagrangian cavitation model in which the concentration of non condensable gas was taken into account this model has achieved satisfying numerical results in the investigation of tvc on an elliptical hydrofoil without confinement in virtue of the similarity between tvc and tlv cavitation the new cavitation model may be applicable to tlv cavitation as well inspired by the previous investigations in the present paper les combined with the new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a is employed for the prediction of tip leakage cavitaing flow generated by a naca0009 hydrofoil with three typical tip clearance sizes τ 0 1 1 0 and 2 0 we will check the applicability of the new cavitation model in the simulation of tip leakage cavitating flow at first and show its superiority over the conventional cavitation model then based on the numerical results with the new cavitation model the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation is discussed the relation between tip clearance size and sheet cavitation is also investigated finally the vorticity transport equation is utilized to study mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes 2 numerical method and simulation setup 2 1 governing equations and les approach in the present paper les is utilized to solve the turbulence field in the framework of homogeneous model the governing equations for les of multiphase flow can be obtained by filtering the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ m t x j ρ m u j 0 2 t ρ m u i x j ρ m u i u j p x i x j μ m u i x j τ i j x j where the overbars denote filtered quantities u i is the velocity component i 1 2 3 p is the mixture pressure ρ m and μ m are the density and laminar viscosity of the mixture respectively defined as 3 ρ m α v ρ v 1 α v ρ l 4 μ m α v μ v 1 α v μ l where the subscripts v and l represent the vapor and liquid phase respectively and α v is the vapor volume fraction the last term in eq 2 called sub grid scale sgs stresses is unknown and requires modeling 5 τ i j ρ m u i u j u i u j which is commonly modeled based on the boussinesq hypothesis 6 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where τ kk is the isotropic part of the sgs stresses and is added to the filtered static pressure term s i j is the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale defined by 7 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i therefore the only unknown term in eq 6 is the sgs turbulent viscosity μ t different sgs models employ different methods to calculate μ t which is closed by the wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model nicoud and ducros 1999 in the present paper 8 μ t ρ m l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 9 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 10 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j where κ is the von karman constant d is the distance to the closest wall v is the volume of the computational cell and c w is the wale constant with the value of 0 325 the wale model returns the correct wall asymptotic y 3 behavior for wall bounded flows and returns a zero turbulent viscosity for laminar shear flows whose superiority has been demonstrated by many publications decaix et al 2015 ji et al 2013 long et al 2018 you et al 2007 2 2 physical cavitation model in the original ss cavitation model schnerr and sauer 2001 the interphase mass transfer is governed by the vapor transport equation as follows 11 t α v ρ v x j α v ρ v u v j r where r on the right hand side rhs is the net phase change rate which is defined as follows in the ss cavitation model 12 r r e r c ρ v ρ l ρ m d α v d t where r e and r c are connected to the growth and collapse of vapor bubbles respectively and are modeled based on the rayleigh plesset r p equation 13 r b d 2 r b d t 2 3 2 d r b d t 2 4 ν l r b d r b d t 2 σ ρ l r b p b p ρ l where r b is the bubble radius ν l is the liquid kinematic viscosity σ is the liquid surface tension coefficient p b is the pressure in the bubble p is the local pressure the terms on the left hand side lhs are the second order derivative term the first order derivative term the viscous term and the surface tension term respectively neglecting the second order term the viscous and surface tension force eq 13 is simplified to 14 3 2 d r b d t 2 p b p ρ l then the following equation can be easily obtained 15 d r b d t 2 3 p b p ρ l where p b the pressure in the bubble can be written as 16 p b p v p g 2 σ r b where p v is the saturation vapor pressure pg is the partial pressure of non condensable gas the last term on the rhs denotes the effect of surface tension which is rather small and can be ignored in the original ss model pb is assumed to be equal to p v in the absence of non condensable gas then one can obtain 17 d r b d t 2 3 p v p ρ l based on eqs 12 and 17 r can be derived by establishing the relationship between α v and r b which is defined as 18 α v n 4 3 π r b 3 1 n 4 3 π r b 3 where n is the bubble number density then schnerr and sauer derived the following equations 19 r e ρ v ρ l ρ m α v 1 α v 3 r b 2 3 p v p ρ l if p p v 20 r c ρ v ρ l ρ m α v 1 α v 3 r b 2 3 p p v ρ l if p p v where r b is related to α v and n 21 r b α v 1 α v 3 4 π 1 n 1 3 in ss model n is the only parameter that must be determined and is set to 1013 by default it should be noted that n is actually the number density of vapor bubble due to the ignorance of non condensable gas the ss model has been widely utilized in many studies to predict cavitation in a variety of applications valdes et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 žnidarčič et al 2015 and the predictions on sheet cavitation are generally reasonable though the influence of non condensable gas is omitted however as mentioned above the ignorance of non condensable gas may be infeasible in some special flow such as vortex cavitating flow the strong rotational motion of vortex tends to roll up the non condensable gas into its core inducing a significant increase of its concentration in the center of vortex asnaghi et al 2018 oweis et al 2005 it suggests that the partial pressure of non condensable gas may be non negligible therefore in the new cavitation model the bubble pressure p b is not equal to p v but the sum of p v and partial pressure of non condensable gas pg the effect of surface tension is omitted as the original ss model now the problem is all about how to evaluate the value of p b the pressure in a mixture bubble of vapor and non condensable gas we can simplify the formation of a mixed bubble to the fusion of two bubbles of its constituents hereinafter referred to as gas bubble and vapor bubble respectively the initial equilibrium of a gas bubble which can be described by the following equation 22 p p g i 0 2 σ r g i 0 where p is the local pressure in the far field the subscript i is the gas bubble index and the number after that denotes different states for instance 0 represents the initial state σ is the surface tension coefficient between the liquid and the gas bubble which can be neglected then eq 22 can be simplified to 23 p g i 0 p similarly we can derive the equilibrium equation of the gas bubble when it approaches the tip clearance region 24 p g i 1 p where p is the local pressure according to the adiabatic equation of ideal gas bubble we can obtain 25 r g i 1 r g i 0 3 γ p g i 0 p g i 1 p p where γ is the specific heat ratio with the value of 1 4 it should be noted that there may be many gas bubbles in any single cell to simplify the following fusion process with the vapor bubbles these micro bubbles can be regarded as a single gas bubble whose pressure radius and volume can be written as 26 p g 2 p 27 r g 2 3 v g 2 4 π 1 3 28 v g 2 v g t o t a l 4 π 3 i 1 n r g i 1 3 similarly the micro vapor bubbles in any single cell can be treated as a single vapor bubble whose pressure is p v and the radius is defined as 29 r v 3 v v 4 π 1 3 where v v is the total volume of vapor bubbles in a cell if r g2 is larger than r v the vapor bubble will merge into the gas bubble while the radius of the latter remains unchanged we can derive the total pressure of the mixed bubble 30 p b p g 2 p v r v r g 2 3 γ conversely if r g2 is smaller than r v the fusion process can be regarded as that the gas bubble merges into the vapor bubble then the total pressure of the mixed bubble is given as 31 p b p v p g 2 r g 2 r v 3 γ note that the fusion process begins with a requirement for the size of the bubbles if the gas bubble and the vapor bubble are much smaller than the local cell volume the fusion process is hard to happen therefore in the present paper only when the total volume of the gas and vapor bubbles reaches 1 1000 of local cell volume the modification will be activated otherwise the original ss model will be utilized moreover the new cavitation model requires the knowledge about the migration of non condensable gas bubbles which is modeled with the discrete phase model dpm in the present paper in dpm the effect of pressure gradient term on the movement of gas bubbles is considered fig 1 shows the calculation process with the modified cavitation model including the working principle of dpm for each timestep up to 40 iterations is calculated to get the global flow field with euler method during which the movement of gas bubbles is simulated every 10 iterations to obtain local gas bubble distribution with lagrangian approach then local total pressure of the mixed bubble p b is calculated with eqs 22 31 and sent to the modified cavitation model to calculate the local mass transportation cheng et al 2020a the new algorithm is implemented in ansys fluent in the present paper 2 3 simulation setup according to the experiments by dreyer et al 2014 the coordinate definition computational domain and boundary conditions in the current simulation are shown in fig 2 the tip leakage cavitating flow is generated by a naca0009 hydrofoil with a chord length of c 100 mm the origin is located on the hydrofoil tip at the midpoint of the chord with x y and z aligned with the spanwise transverse and streamwise directions respectively the corresponding velocity components are referred to as u v and w to accord with the treatment in experiments the corner of the foil tip at the pressure side is rounded with a radius of 1 mm the length of the tunnel is 7 5c with a cross section of 1 5c 1 5c the inlet is at 2 0c upstream of the foil leading edge and the total pressure is fixed at 153 kpa to keep the time averaged static pressure p st is about 1 bar as in the experiment the outlet velocity w is set to 10 m s non slip wall condition is applied to the foil and the tunnel wall near the gap while other tunnel walls are set as free slip wall based on these setup the reynolds number and the cavitation number are defined as follows respectively 32 r e w c ν l 10 6 33 σ p s t p v 1 2 ρ l w 2 1 93 the hydrofoil incidence angle α is set to 10 three typical tip clearance sizes τ 0 1 0 7 and 2 0 corresponding to small medium and large clearance sizes are simulated where τ is the non dimensional clearance size and is defined as 34 τ g a p h where gap is the size of tip clearance h is the hydrofoil maximum thickness with value of 9 9 mm the sst k ω turbulence model is utilized to obtain a steady state result as the initial flow field then les combined with the modified ss cavitation model is employed to simulate the transient cavitating flow as a comparison les combined with the original ss cavitation model is also used to predict the tip leakage cavitating flow in the present investigation simplec is utilized as the pressure velocity coupling method all differential equations are discretized by finite volume method fvm and solved implicitly a bounded central differencing scheme is chosen for the convection term of the momentum equation which is recognized as an ideal choice for les with fairly low numerical diffusion for the unsteady simulation the time dependent computations are solved by a bounded second order implicit scheme a least squares cell based method is used to compute the gradients and derivatives in the equations the convergence criterion is the absolute residual type with a residual target of 10 4 which is set for all the resolved equations including continuity u v w and vapor volume fraction the time step size is set to 1 10 5s which is determined by considering the requirement of courant or cfl number for les cfl is defined as follows 35 cfl δ t u δ x where δt is the time step size u is the module of the velocity vector in a cell and δx is the size of this cell fig 3 shows the value of cfl near the tip clearance region with τ 0 7 as an example in which fig 3 a shows the value of cfl around tsv cavitation and fig 3 b shows that around tlv cavitation it indicates that the maximum of cfl is below 1 fulfilling the requirement of cfl for les in addition the time dependent computations are solved by a fully implicit scheme in the present paper which is ideally stable with respect to time step size therefore the current time step size setting can achieve a good balance between the computational accuracy and cost 3 mesh generation and refinement in the current paper a so called cartesian cut cell method bai et al 2018 hartmann et al 2011 ingram et al 2003 is utilized to generate the meshes for simulation the experiments by dreyer et al 2014 have revealed that tlv proceeds quite far to the downstream which has high requirement for mesh therefore to gain a balance between the computational cost and accuracy a region that covers its possible reach is marked for mesh refinement as shown in fig 4 the mesh in the boundary layer around the foil and near the gap wall is carefully refined to fulfill the requirement of les fig 5 shows distributions of dimensionless distance y at the foil surface with mesh 1 3 which is defined as follows 36 y y u τ ν where y is the height of the first layer mesh and u τ is the friction velocity note that mesh 1 3 are three sets of mesh with different resolution and their generation schemes will be introduced in the next paragraph to resolve the boundary layer appropriately it is required that y 1 for les however it is hard to strictly meet this requirement for tip leakage cavitating flow fig 5 indicates that the value of y for all the three sets of mesh is mostly between 0 1 meanwhile the maximum of y is below 5 which is the threshold from viscous sublayer to buffer layer that means the first layer mesh is inside the viscous sublayer therefore the mesh in the boundary layer basically fulfills the requirement of les to show the influence of mesh resolution on the numerical results three sets of mesh for τ 0 7 are generated named mesh 1 2 and 3 respectively whose node number are given in table 1 the difference between mesh 1 and 2 lies in the element size of the region marked for mesh refinement mentioned above based on the sst result obtained with mesh 2 the adaptive grid refinement is implemented and the new mesh is named as mesh 3 the effect of mesh refinement highly depends on the choice of refining criterion the rotation faction f r guo et al 2018 is reported to have a better effect on tlv identification when compared with other criteria cheng et al 2020b therefore f r with the range of 0 0 9 is utilized for the refinement in the current simulation fig 6 shows the mesh distribution of the three sets of mesh on the downstream cross section z c 1 with the same method meshes for τ 0 1 and 2 0 are also generated to save the computational cost the mesh study is conducted based on the numerical results with the original ss cavitation model the predicted tlv cavities for τ 0 7 with mesh 1 3 are displayed in fig 7 the instant tlv cavity with mesh 1 has a larger circumferential size but a remarkable shorter length compared with the experimental snapshot indicating mesh 1 is too coarse to obtain a reliable numerical result as a contrast the predicted tlv cavity by mesh 2 is much better when compared with the experimental observation but still underestimates the strength of tlv cavitation to obtain a better prediction on tlv cavity mesh 3 is generated with the adaptive grid technique based on mesh 2 as mentioned above and the node number of mesh 3 is almost twice that of mesh 2 however as shown in fig 7 there is no significant improvement on the prediction of tlv cavity with mesh 3 comparing with mesh 2 moreover the comparison between the predicted time averaged axial velocity with mesh 2 and the measured data on downstream cross section z c 1 0 in non cavitation condition in fig 8 indicates that the lower than freestream i e wake like axial velocity in tlv core for τ 0 1 and the higher than freestream i e jet like one for τ 0 7 and 2 0 are already captured quite well with mesh 2 our results suggest that further increase in the mesh resolution is not so advisable 4 results and discussions 4 1 applicability of the new cavitation model as mentioned above the new cavitation model proposed by cheng et al 2020a involves the influence of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation so the knowledge about the initial gas content and its distribution in the water is very important in the new model some measurements chen et al 2019 song et al 2017 yakubov et al 2013 indicated that both the mass concentration and the radius of nuclei exhibited a wide range around 2 76 10 5 5 38 10 5 kg m3 for the former and 0 110 μm for the latter respectively in the present simulation for simplicity we assume the initial mass concentration of non condensable gas is c g0 5 10 5 kg m3 and all the gas bubbles share the same radius with the value of 20 μm in order to balance the computational cost and the simulation accuracy of gas bubble migration around tlv the gas bubbles are injected uniformly from a circular cross section with the radius of 0 2c located 0 7c upstream of the foil axis near the endwall as shown in fig 9 the initial velocity of non condensable gas bubbles w g0 remains the same as the main flow i e w g0 10 m s fig 10 a displays the profile of non condensable gas in the tip clearance flow field under non cavitation condition and three typical cross sections are utilized to show the concentration in more detail as shown in fig 10 b it shows that the gas bubbles are apt to be rolled up into tlv especially in the downstream region where tlv is fully developed the concentration of non condensable gas in tlv core may be more than ten times the initial value on the downstream cross sections z c 0 6 and 1 2 in fig 10 b the non condensable gas with such a high concentration in tlv core should leave a significant influence on the inception of local cavitation fig 11 and fig 12 compare the instant and time averaged tlv cavities reproduced with the original ss model and the modified one for three tip clearance sizes a significant improvement on the prediction of tlv cavity can be observed with the new cavitation model when compared with the original ss model especially for middle clearance τ 0 7 and large clearance τ 2 0 for small clearance τ 0 1 the tlv dissipates quickly due to the influence of the wall hence it hard for tlv to capture gas bubbles therefore for small tip clearance size the influence of non condensable gas is not so important and the predicted short lasting tlv cavity even with the original cavitation model can have a good agreement with the experimental observation however for middle clearance τ 0 7 and large clearance τ 2 0 the influence of non condensable gas is non negligible as shown in figs 11 and 12 the instant tlv cavity with the original ss model only reaches the downstream position of z c 1 23 for τ 0 7 while with the new cavitation model the position extends as far as z c 2 37 almost twice the former which shows a much better agreement with the experimental observation for large clearance τ 2 0 the low strength of tlv makes the reproduction of the extremely fine tlv cavity difficult however with the consideration of non condensable gas the problem has been well solved which also implies the importance of non condensable gas in the investigation of such vortex cavitating flow in general the new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation proposed by cheng et al 2020a has good applicability in the tip leakage cavitating flow and can significantly improve the prediction of tlv cavity in a wide range of tip clearance sizes 4 2 effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation to investigate the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation fig 13 shows cavitation patterns and corresponding vortex structures at a typical instant for small medium and large clearance sizes the vortexes are displayed by the iso surface of q criterion colored with axial vorticity which is defined as follows 37 ω z v x u y as shown in fig 13 three distinct vortex structures in the tip leakage cavitating flow can be clearly observed including tlv tsv and induced vortexes ivs regardless of clearance size tsv is formed due to flow separation on the foil tip at the pressure side and moves towards the suction side due to the tip leakage flow and rollup of tlv therefore tsv has the same rotation direction as tlv ivs are induced from the endwall by tlv and its rotation direction is opposite to that of tlv which will accelerate the dissipation of tlv since cavitation is closely related to vortex structures the research about vortex structures under different tip clearance sizes should be helpful to understand the effect of tip clearance size on tlv and tsv cavitation for small clearance τ 0 1 as shown in fig 14 due to the greater pressure difference between the pressure and suction side the velocity of the leakage flow under small clearance is rather faster than that for τ 0 7 and 2 0 as shown in fig 15 moreover the gap is quite narrow and there is no enough space for tsv to roll up by itself therefore for small clearance tsv fuses with tlv almost from its birth correspondingly tlv and tsv cavities fuse together almost from the leading edge further downstream the extreme proximity of tlv to endwall leads to complex ivs which has a strong dissipation effect on tlv that s why tlv under such a tiny clearance can just sustain till half the chord and further leads to a short tlv cavity for medium clearance τ 0 7 tlv and tsv both come into being from the leading edge separated by the foil tip there is a relatively short period during which tlv and tsv develop independently then tsv is rolled into tlv due to the influence of tip leakage flow and the entrainment of tlv the corresponding cavitation pattern also presents such a process afterwards the mixed vortex develops downstream and induces complicated ivs the interaction between tlv and ivs is believed to be responsible for the wandering of tlv cavity for large clearance τ 2 0 tlv and tsv are both very weak and the independent development stage lasts longer till the trailing edge correspondingly tsv cavitation is so weak that it is hardly visible and tlv cavity is rather slender the fusion position of the two cavities moves downstream till the trailing edge the low strength of the mixed vortex and its distance from the endwall lead to low intensity of ivs which even cannot be displayed by the iso surface of q 106 s 2 therefore the tlv cavity for large clearance is more stable than that for small and middle clearances in general as tip clearance size increases the intensity of tsv decreases while the intensity of tlv increases first and then decreases the duration of their independent development prolongs and their fusion position moves downstream correspondingly the strength of tsv and tlv cavitation and their fusion position with tip clearance size also witness such a variation trend in addition the intensity of ivs reduces with increasing tip clearance size as ivs have an adverse effect on the stability of tlv further the effect also exists for the stability of tlv cavitation therefore the tlv cavitation becomes more and more stable with increasing tip clearance size 4 3 effect of tip clearance size on sheet cavitation as the tip clearance size varies there is also a great change in the evolution of sheet cavitation fig 16 shows the time averaged sheet cavities from a top view note that since our focus is the sheet cavitation in this sub section the tlv cavities are truncated at the foil trailing edge it can be observed that the coverage of sheet cavity expands as the tip clearance size decreases to assess it quantitatively the dimensionless span averaged length of sheet cavity l is defined as follows 38 l v s h e e t s c h where v s h e e t is the time averaged volume of sheet cavity s is the span and its values are 1 49c 1 43c 1 3c for small middle and large clearance sizes respectively the variation of l with the clearance size is given in table 2 as tip clearance enlarges the area of cross section becomes larger which will decrease the velocity of fluids passing the hydrofoil and result in relatively weaker sheet cavitation since the sheet cavitation almost covers the whole span it should have a great impact on the hydraulic characteristic of hydrofoil for example the lift coefficient which is defined as follows 39 c l f l 1 2 ρ w 2 c s where f l is the lift force fig 17 shows the variation of lift coefficient in several relatively stable periods for different clearance sizes it can be found that the time averaged value of lift coefficient decreases as the clearance enlarges since the lift is generated by the pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides the knowledge about the pressure distribution around hydrofoil may help to figure out the mechanism for how clearance size influences the hydrofoil performance to this end the variation of time averaged pressure coefficients along a polyline which is the intersection of hydrofoil surface and the plane x c 0 7 for different clearance sizes is displayed in fig 18 the pressure coefficient is defined as follows 40 c p p p 1 2 ρ w 2 it can be observed that there is no significant difference of pressure distribution on the pressure side for different tip clearance sizes however the pressure distribution on the suction side especially in the region 0 3 z c 0 3 is quite different for different tip clearance sizes the pressure distribution on the suction side is closely related to the length of sheet cavity in the region with sheet cavity such as 0 5 z c 0 for τ 0 1 the value of c p remains low while in the region without sheet cavity such as 0 z c 0 5 for τ 0 1 c p gradually increases and then reaches a stable higher value as tip clearance size increases the sheet cavity shortens resulting in the turning point of c p from a lower value to a higher one moving upstream for example the position of the turning point is around z c 0 0 2 0 3 for τ 0 1 0 7 and 2 0 respectively in addition with the increase of tip clearance size the higher value of c p in the non cavitation region increases while the tip clearance size has little influence on the lower value of c p in the cavitation region therefore the variations both in the turning point and the higher value of c p result in the less pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides for larger tip clearance therefore the lift coefficient decreases with the increase of tip clearance size moreover as shown in figs 13 and 16 the tip clearance size also leaves an impact on the shape of sheet cavitation near the foil tip to figure out the behind reason the distribution of pressure and velocity vectors at a typical instant on the cross section z c 0 35 with corresponding cavitation patterns are displayed in fig 19 b and a respectively it can be seen that for τ 2 0 under the rotating action of tlv the leakage flow forms a circumferential flow and hits the foil suction surface which results in the relatively high local pressure for τ 0 7 the circumferential flow is more intense due to the higher intensity of tlv which leads to the compressed high pressure region along the span therefore at the same streamwise location as tip clearance size decreases the gap between sheet and tlv cavity is narrowed that is the inclined angle of sheet cavity near the foil tip decreases when the tip clearance size is reduced to a certain extent for example τ 0 1 the low intensity of cavitating tlv and the intense leakage flow make the circumferential flow hard to form therefore there is no high pressure region between sheet and tlv cavitation leading to the connected sheet and tlv cavity and absence of the inclined angle of sheet cavity 4 4 effect of tip clearance size on vorticity transport since tlv cavitation has a close relation with tlv the occurrence of cavitation may leave an influence on the local vortex field which has been confirmed bai et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 ji et al 2014 this view is also verified in the present paper as shown in fig 20 compared with the axial vorticity distribution in non cavitation condition the low axial vorticity inside the cavity is noticeable when tlv cavitation develops indicating cavitation may induce vorticity transport bai et al 2018 studied the vortex dynamics by a series of streamwise cross sections under a specific tip clearance cheng et al 2019 compared the case in non cavitation condition with that in cavitation condition however there are few publications focused on the vorticity transport around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes therefore in the present paper we apply the vorticity transport equation to the cavitating cases with different tip clearance sizes as tlv cavitation develops along z direction the vorticity transport equation in z direction is adopted which can be written as 41 d ω z d t ω v z ω v z ρ m p ρ m 2 z ν m ν t 2 ω z the four terms on the rhs are the stretching dilatation baroclinic torque and viscous diffusion terms respectively having the following form 42 ω v z ω x w x ω y w y ω z w z 43 ω v z ω z u x v y w z 44 ρ m p ρ m 2 z ρ l ρ v ρ m 2 α v x p y α v y p x 45 ν m ν t 2 ω z ν m ν t 2 ω z x 2 2 ω z y 2 2 ω z z 2 the stretching term denotes the influence of vortex stretching compressing and tilting caused by velocity gradient the dilatation term reflects the fluid compressibility and the baroclinic torque term is generated due to the misalignment between pressure and density gradients the viscous diffusion term is as its name suggests caused by vorticity viscous diffusion which is much smaller compared with the other three terms thus omitted in the following discussion figs 21 23 display the distributions of the stretching dilatation and baroclinic torque terms near the tlv cavity respectively for small clearance τ 0 1 the stretching term is persistently dominant the dilatation and baroclinic torque terms play a role near the location z c 0 while in the downstream these two terms seem to be negligible for medium clearance τ 0 7 each of the three terms plays its own role in the whole process of tlv cavitation development for large clearance τ 2 0 the effect of stretching and dilatation terms is about the same proportion in the whole process while the baroclinic torque term can always be neglected on the whole the stretching term is dominant among the three terms regardless of tip clearance size as tip clearance increases the effect of stretching term decreases due to the less complicated ivs the effect of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases due to the same trend of tlv cavitation intensity 5 conclusions in the present paper the tip leakage cavitating flow around a naca0009 hydrofoil is studied numerically by les combined with a new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation the predicted tlv cavitation agrees well with available experimental observations the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the concentrated distribution of non condensable gas around tlv core verifies the capability of tlv to roll the non condensable gas into its core and further confirms the important role non condensable gas plays in the vortex cavitation based on this particularity a new euler lagrangian cavitation model involving the effect of non condensable gas on vortex cavitation proposed by cheng et al 2020a is applied to the tip leakage cavitating flow compared with tlv cavities obtained with the original ss cavitation model the new model achieves a much better agreement with the referenced experiment in a wide range of tip clearance sizes the new cavitation model is capable to extend tlv cavity further downstream and capture the extremely fine tlv cavity quite well which is hard to reproduce for conventional cavitation models under some conditions 2 as tip clearance size increases the intensity of tsv cavitation decreases while that of tlv cavitation increases first and then decreases in addition with the increase of tip clearance size the duration of their independent development prolongs and their fusion position moves downstream the tlv cavitation becomes more and more stable with increasing tip clearance size due to the decreasing strength of ivs 3 as tip clearance size increases the sheet cavitation weakens and the time averaged lift coefficient decreases due to the smaller pressure difference between the foil pressure side and suction side the tip clearance size also has an effect on the shape of sheet cavity near the foil tip the local high pressure caused by the circumferential flow under the rotating action of cavitating tlv is the cause of the inclined angle of sheet cavity near the foil tip 4 the vorticity transport equation is utilized to investigate mechanisms of vortex development around tlv cavitation under different tip clearance sizes as tip clearance size increases the effect of stretching term decreases while that of dilatation and baroclinic torque terms increases first and then decreases however the stretching term is dominant in all investigated cases regardless of tip clearance size
