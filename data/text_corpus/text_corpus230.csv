1150,increasingly stormwater management systems such as urban lakes and wetlands are being implemented in developing urban areas they are designed to serve multiple purposes urban stormwater management systems have environmental economic and social impacts the main aim of this study was to explore the community values and social and economic benefits of urban lakes in the western sydney region of new south wales australia the study involved two case study sites and community surveys using the tailored design method for this study a combination of three methods of data collection was used online onsite and letterbox drop off surveys the survey explored several aspects such as community wellbeing environment and property value benefits responses from the community show that there is an overall positive perception of the lake and associated parkland when asked over 70 of the respondents stated that there is a positive impact of the lake on the property prices additionally 50 of residents found that there was moderate to significant impact of the lake on both mental and physical wellbeing of people approximately 20 of respondents stated that they would not exercise if the local lake system did not exist also 60 of the respondents stated that the lake improved their quality of life furthermore a hedonic property price analysis was done to quantify the impact of the lake on the surrounding properties a positive correlation was found between the lake and property prices of surrounding homes the findings from this study provide evidence to policymakers and municipal councils to encourage investments to improve performance of existing lakes as well as develop new ones in the urban areas keywords ecohydrology community impacts wellbeing blue and green infrastructure 1 introduction water is an essential resource that needs to be sustained for future generations urban lakes are increasingly being utilised for the purpose of storing and treating stormwater urban lakes and wetlands can serve the purpose of improving the wellbeing of visitors and provide an area for recreation provided the area is maintained satisfactorily the inclusion of urban lakes in residential estates has also been known to improve the property values walsh 2009 wen et al 2014 if designed in an aesthetically pleasing manner the systems can promote participation of the visitors in recreational activities villanueva et al 2015 recreational activities include walking running picnicking and bird watching beal 2007 further if equipment for exercise and other activities are provided it would encourage physical activity apostolaki and jefferies 2009 it will also promote communication and interaction between the visitors thompson 2002 some studies have also shown the psychological benefits of interacting with nature berman et al 2008 keniger et al 2013 these systems are also home to many species of fauna and flora and hence promote other activities such as photography waltham et al 2014 community members will regard the system as an asset if designed and maintained satisfactorily mitsch and gosselink 2000 a few studies crase and gillespie 2008 d souza and nagendra 2011 debo 1977 walker et al 2013 have been conducted to understand the attitudes and opinions of individuals within communities towards their local urban lake the study conducted by walker et al 2013 aimed to link community well being and a series of urban lakes in queensland australia the authors found that the residents have tangible property value and intangible recreation enjoyment and a sense of community belonging benefits however they felt less responsible for the health of the lake a similar study was conducted by debo 1977 in which attitudinal surveys were completed by residents and other visitors to understand the perceived advantages and disadvantages of being situated near lakes georgia america it was concluded that the lakes do have a positive impact on the property prices according to the residents waltham et al 2014 also conducted surveys on community members who attended a meeting regarding their thoughts on the freshwater urban lake located in queensland australia it was found that respondents had a significant appreciation for the aesthetics of the lake however they also mentioned that the lake required better aquatic ecosystem and water quality management hedonic property price approach has been used more frequently to understand the impact of any system on property values hedonic pricing method takes into consideration the fact that properties are not homogenous aspects such as number of bedrooms bathroom property size neighbourhood and environmental attributes differ between the properties michael boyle bouchard 1996 this method utilises information such as past property data to understand the impact beal 2007 mahan et al 2000 the model utilises linear and nonlinear regression models to estimate the impact of different characteristics on the property prices studies conducted by mahan et al 2000 tapsuwan et al 2009 boyer and polasky 2004 frey et al 2013 and wen et al 2014 utilised this method to quantify the impact of the urban lakes wetlands on property prices other studies artell 2014 gibbs et al 2002 leggett and bockstael 2000 walsh 2009 have gone further and also estimated the impact of water quality of the lake wetland on the property prices no studies have been conducted regarding the community feedback on the lake wetland system especially in new south wales australia it is important that there is a clear picture of what the community want and need to be able to efficiently design future stormwater storage systems in urban residential areas the main aim of this study using woodcroft and wattle grove lake systems in western sydney new south wales australia was to understand the impacts of urban lakes on community well being and their view on property prices additionally the hedonic pricing approach seems to be an efficient method of estimating the impact of various aspects on property prices provided that the data collected and used are valid therefore the hedonic pricing approach can be used as a means of quantitatively supporting the survey results this analysis covers several aspects related to economic environmental and social impacts of urban lake systems while contributing to improving stormwater management the environmental aspects related to water quality of these urban lakes can be found in the study conducted by natarajan et al 2018 2 study area 2 1 wattle grove lake wattle grove lake is a constructed urban lake located within the residential suburb of wattle grove belonging to liverpool city council in new south wales australia the australian defence force used this area until 1992 and 1993 when the lake was constructed during development of residential housing the main purpose of the lake is to improve stormwater quality and to provide some flood storage the lake and associated parkland cover approximately 2 5ha and the catchment area is approximately 95ha with roughly 1022 residential properties wattle grove lake is shown in fig 1 additionally two fountains have been installed to improve the water quality of the lake and make the surrounding area more aesthetically pleasing the area surrounding the lake is landscaped in such a way that is appealing to the public for recreational purposes and is maintained appropriately the area is used prominently for exercising and walking exercise equipment has been set up to promote exercise and improve the wellbeing of the residents a playground is set up to encourage physical exercise in younger visitors the lake does not allow for primary contact by visitors as it is used as more of a treatment system for stormwater generally the water quality is poor with high turbidity and suspended solids nutrient concentrations are also higher than guideline values natarajan et al 2018 according to australia bureau of statistics 2016 there are 8952 people in the wattle grove area of the residents in the area 39 1 were over 40 years old 2 2 woodcroft lake woodcroft lake and wetland combine to form a stormwater management system located within the blacktown city council area about 5km northwest of blacktown new south wales australia in 1993 previously a clay quarry the lake and wetland was constructed in its place the lake occupies approximately 3 2ha the wetland is about 1 5ha and the park land around the wetland and lake is approximately 4 9ha stormwater drains into woodcroft wetland and lake from a 53 hectare catchment passing first through the wetland and then entering the lake woodcroft wetland and lake are shown in fig 2 to improve and promote physical wellbeing of the public exercise equipment and walkways have been included a community hall is also being constructed near the lake primary contact with the water or any recreational activities inside the lake and wetland are not allowed by the visitors as their main purposes are to treat and store stormwater generally the appearance of the water is pleasant however similar to wattle grove lake high nutrient concentrations compared to the anzecc guideline values have been recorded natarajan et al 2018 according to the australia bureau of statistics 2016 there are 6440 people in the woodcroft area around 43 9 of the residents were aged above 40 years 3 methodology to get a better understanding of the opinions of the visitors of the lake and residents of the surrounding area surveys were conducted a tailored design method refers to the customisation of a survey to ensure participation dillman 2014 a survey was designed to take into consideration aspects such as quality of the lake wetland maintenance of the parkland impact to the surrounding properties and other suggestions to improve the quality of the area ethics approval was provided by western sydney university s human research ethics committee approval number h11916 the surveys did not record any personal information the survey consisted of 30 questions that were multiple choice scale or short answers questions were broken down into three parts household lake system and property details the questions in the lake system section explored aspects related to water quality property prices and well being it took approximately 15min to complete the survey colourful images of the lake and associated parkland were used to design the survey to appeal to the community and to encourage them to complete the survey a combination of surveying methods was used to get the most feedback from the community members which included onsite surveys an online link using google forms link and letter drop off to properties in surrounding areas the onsite surveys were completed by willing participants who were visiting the lake only individuals over the age of 18 were approached the surveys that were done in person allowed for respondents to provide more detailed and open ended answers to the questions additionally the respondents provided some suggestions and other feedback that were not a part of the prepared survey facebook was utilised as a platform to advertise the survey community pages for each site were contacted and asked for approval prior to posting a google form link for the survey at both locations surveys were left in letterboxes with a prepaid return envelope in all the methods of data collection the questions were completely voluntary and participants could choose not to answer any particular question the summary of survey questions is shown in table 1 data collected from online survey were directly linked to google forms on the other hand at the end of the survey data collected from onsite and letter box drop off surveys were entered into google forms which compiled the responses and presented percentages and frequencies for each question no other statistical analysis was carried out hedonic property price approach was used to estimate the impact of urban lakes on property prices actual sale prices of property surrounding the two sites were collected by using online databases namely propertyvalue com au powered by corelogic and realestate com au reagroup 2017 a total of 471 properties were compiled the data was analysed using the hedonic method the impact of characteristics such as number of bedrooms bathrooms car parking lot size position and variables such as neighbourhood and the environment were also studied minitab was used to compile data and run the linear regression analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 respondent demographics a total of 93 surveys were completed in the two locations it was found that the respondents from the wattle grove suburb resided in that area from as little as 1 year up to 27 years in both locations 60 of households had children in woodcroft the duration of stay ranged from 2 weeks to 40 years selected questions and their responses are discussed in the sections below 4 2 respondents view on water quality and property prices it can be seen in fig 3 that 65 of respondents at wattle grove and 70 of respondents at woodcroft believed that their respective urban lakes did have some impact on their decision to live in the area this may be attributed to the facilities provided in the landscape and the design of the parkland which allows for recreational activities for visitors of all ages a view of the lake and an access to nature a study conducted by debo 1977 had a similar finding for man made lakes in which the respondents from a study site felt that the lake had a major impact in the decision to purchase a home in the area this aspect illustrates the importance of green space infrastructure on individuals preference to live in a particular area as shown in fig 4 about 72 to 83 of respondents from both areas agree that the lake has a positive impact on the property price this is perceived as a tangible benefit for residents this trend was also seen in the study conducted by walker et al 2013 as mentioned previously the view and ease of access to the lake may also impact the property price this is seen in the hedonic property price analysis which found the property prices to be higher near the lake than properties further away green infrastructure is seen as an asset as it may increase the opportunity to improve physical and mental wellbeing berman et al 2008 keniger et al 2013 richardson et al 2013 in the wattle grove area a small percentage of residents believed there was a negative impact their reasoning was due to lack of maintenance of the lake parkland area and occasional lower water quality on the other hand relatively higher percentage of respondents at woodcroft lake said no impact which may be attributed to the lesser greenness of the parkland 75 of wattle grove respondents stated that the water quality impacts on the property value as against 67 of woodcroft figure 5 the water quality in wattle grove lake is characterised by the presence of relatively high turbidity natarajan et al 2018 this could be the reason for higher percentages of wattle grove residents expressing the concern on the impacts of water quality on the property values additionally community members from wattle grove area were more aware of the water quality of the lake and therefore the impact was seen as more severe this was observed during the onsite surveys it was interesting to discover that the visitors had knowledge of the water quality parameters contrarily wcl appears to be a lot cleaner and aesthetically pleasing which is illustrated by the lower percentage impact seen in wcl residents and visitors feel that most of the responsibility of maintaining the lake and parkland goes to the local council however people are willing to take action by volunteering to clean the lake as mentioned in one of the short open ended style question this opinion is also seen in the study conducted by walker et al 2013 in which 57 of respondents felt the responsibility of maintaining the quality of the lake belonged to the local government policy makers and council members can utilise this data in determining the budget for maintaining and developing future blue green infrastructures as it is seen as an asset to community members 4 3 respondents view on well being it can be seen in fig 6 20 of respondents from wattle grove and 33 of respondents from woodcroft stated that they visited the lake once or twice a day woodcroft has an older population when compared with wattle grove 43 9 of the population are over 40 years of age at wc and 39 1 in wg older respondents were also observed during the onsite surveys this can be attributed to the higher percentage of visitation in woodcroft it can be seen that majority of respondents live over 500m away from their respective lakes fig 7 this implies that their local lake provides them with enough benefits for them to keep returning regardless of the distance from general comments it was found that respondents were happy to travel as they felt visiting their local lake was a part of their routine fig 8 shows 51 of wattle grove and 76 of woodcroft respondents stated that the lake had moderate to significant impact on their mental well being the water quality appears to be better in woodcroft than wattle grove which also accounts for the difference in percentage as green spaces are constructed for multiple purposes one being community betterment nutsford et al 2013 it is clearly seen that the lakes studied have provided mental well being benefits previous studies have shown the benefits of interacting with nature for improvements in mental well being berman et al 2008 thompson 2002 which appears to be reinforced in this study similar to the mental well being responses 79 of woodcroft respondents specified the lake had moderate to significant positive impact on physical well being fig 9 for wattle grove 52 of respondents stated that the lake had moderate to significant positive impact on physical well being which indicates that there is some benefit to living near the lake however the percentage is lower than woodcroft which could be attributed to the water quality of wattle grove lake blue infrastructure along with other factors such as greenery were found to have positive impact on physical activity according to douglas 2012 regarding quality of life 58 of wattle grove and 87 of woodcroft respondents believed their local lake improved their quality of life fig 10 higher percentage in woodcroft may be linked to improvements in the mental and physical wellbeing of respondents from that area than in wattle grove however this needs to be further investigated a study conducted by maas et al 2006 found that the amount of green space in an individuals residential suburb had a positive impact on perceived health 16 of respondents from wattle grove and 28 of respondents from woodcroft believed they would not exercise if their urban lake did not exist fig 11 this illustrates the importance of the local lake on community similar trends were found in a study conducted by astell burt et al 2013 in which individuals living in greener neighbourhoods were found to have a lower risk of stress and generally more active than less greener places however the benefits were only seen by people who visited the green space it was concluded in that study that public open spaces proved to improve physical and mental well being access to a public open space such as an urban lake promotes physical and mental wellbeing mitchell and popham 2008 additionally it helps to create a sense of community as it promotes interaction with other visitors walker et al 2013 results shown in this study figs 7 11 and past studies astell burt et al 2013 badland et al 2014 walker et al 2013 done on public well being provide evidence for developers and policymakers designing public areas to improve designs to further promote healthy living koohsari et al 2015 investment in blue green infrastructure within urban centres would benefit all stakeholders over both short and long terms these benefits include both tangible and intangible ones further research is required which can provide rigorous cost benefit analysis 4 4 hedonic property analysis to quantify the benefits of living closer to the lake a regression analysis was carried out besides the distance from the lake to the residential property several other parameters such as various facilities and characteristics of the property were included in the regression analysis a total of 334 and 135 property data were collected for wattle grove and woodcroft respectively a linear regression modelling for the combined data was completed the model is given below regression equation property price 154235139 76714 year sold 26763 bedrooms 59315 bathrooms 3203 car space 426 4 lot size m 2 17 33 lake drive m the output of the regression modelling shows that there is significant positive impact p 0 05 of the lake on property price the negative coefficient indicates that farther the property is from the lake the less value it has this is also supported by the community survey results in which over 70 of respondents believed that the lake system had positive impact on property price in terms of actual prices the property price increases by au 17 33 for each metre the property is closer to the lake this was also observed in a study conducted by tapsuwan et al 2009 in perth australia where the property price increased by au 42 40 for each metre the property is closer to the water body tables 2 and 3 show the model summary and coefficients of the regression as shown in table 2 most of the independent variables have a significance level of p 0 05 except car spaces it is expected that the car space should have positive effect on the property price however in the current case the car space has a negative impact which is not accurate this may be due to not considering other parameters such as distance to public transport and geographical location of the property nevertheless the regression coefficients as shown in table 3 appear to be reasonable this suggests that the above regression equation provides reasonably good fit to the data collected in this study 5 conclusions urban lakes have been constructed to serve multiple purposes that include flood retention land value improvement and community development the positive or negative impacts of the lake are dependent on many external factors over 50 of respondents from both sites believe some improvement in their physical and mental well being therefore it can be said that lakes in urban areas are great community assets however the percentages vary between the study locations due to the difference in lake water quality greenness of the surrounding parkland and the background of the residents in the area the community survey found that the urban lakes and their water quality seem to have significant impact on the price of nearby homes respondents from woodcroft lake did have more positive replies than wattle grove lake for almost all the questions in the survey which may be attributed to better water quality in woodcroft lake than wattle grove lake responses from community show that there is an overall positive perception of the lake and associated parkland when asked over 70 of the respondents stated that there is a positive impact of the lake on the property prices additionally 50 of residents found that there was moderate to significant impact of the lake on both mental and physical wellbeing of people approximately 8 16 of respondents stated that they would not exercise if the local lake did not exist also 60 of the respondents stated that the lake improved their quality of life moreover this is supported by the hedonic property price analysis which showed significant correlation between the proximity to the lake and the property price the findings from this study provide some valuable evidence to policymakers and municipal councils to encourage investments to improve performance of existing lakes as well as develop new ones in the urban areas however further research is required in this area to highlight the overall cost benefit analysis of urban lakes conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the authors would like to sincerely thank liverpool city council especially mr joel daniels for his help in attaining online survey feedback blacktown city council dr bobby cheema for his contribution while developing the questionnaire the community members for their help in completing surveys and sharing their views and the ethics committee additionally the authors would like to sincerely thank professor maria estela varua for her

members can utilise this data in determining the budget for maintaining and developing future blue green infrastructures as it is seen as an asset to community members 4 3 respondents view on well being it can be seen in fig 6 20 of respondents from wattle grove and 33 of respondents from woodcroft stated that they visited the lake once or twice a day woodcroft has an older population when compared with wattle grove 43 9 of the population are over 40 years of age at wc and 39 1 in wg older respondents were also observed during the onsite surveys this can be attributed to the higher percentage of visitation in woodcroft it can be seen that majority of respondents live over 500m away from their respective lakes fig 7 this implies that their local lake provides them with enough benefits for them to keep returning regardless of the distance from general comments it was found that respondents were happy to travel as they felt visiting their local lake was a part of their routine fig 8 shows 51 of wattle grove and 76 of woodcroft respondents stated that the lake had moderate to significant impact on their mental well being the water quality appears to be better in woodcroft than wattle grove which also accounts for the difference in percentage as green spaces are constructed for multiple purposes one being community betterment nutsford et al 2013 it is clearly seen that the lakes studied have provided mental well being benefits previous studies have shown the benefits of interacting with nature for improvements in mental well being berman et al 2008 thompson 2002 which appears to be reinforced in this study similar to the mental well being responses 79 of woodcroft respondents specified the lake had moderate to significant positive impact on physical well being fig 9 for wattle grove 52 of respondents stated that the lake had moderate to significant positive impact on physical well being which indicates that there is some benefit to living near the lake however the percentage is lower than woodcroft which could be attributed to the water quality of wattle grove lake blue infrastructure along with other factors such as greenery were found to have positive impact on physical activity according to douglas 2012 regarding quality of life 58 of wattle grove and 87 of woodcroft respondents believed their local lake improved their quality of life fig 10 higher percentage in woodcroft may be linked to improvements in the mental and physical wellbeing of respondents from that area than in wattle grove however this needs to be further investigated a study conducted by maas et al 2006 found that the amount of green space in an individuals residential suburb had a positive impact on perceived health 16 of respondents from wattle grove and 28 of respondents from woodcroft believed they would not exercise if their urban lake did not exist fig 11 this illustrates the importance of the local lake on community similar trends were found in a study conducted by astell burt et al 2013 in which individuals living in greener neighbourhoods were found to have a lower risk of stress and generally more active than less greener places however the benefits were only seen by people who visited the green space it was concluded in that study that public open spaces proved to improve physical and mental well being access to a public open space such as an urban lake promotes physical and mental wellbeing mitchell and popham 2008 additionally it helps to create a sense of community as it promotes interaction with other visitors walker et al 2013 results shown in this study figs 7 11 and past studies astell burt et al 2013 badland et al 2014 walker et al 2013 done on public well being provide evidence for developers and policymakers designing public areas to improve designs to further promote healthy living koohsari et al 2015 investment in blue green infrastructure within urban centres would benefit all stakeholders over both short and long terms these benefits include both tangible and intangible ones further research is required which can provide rigorous cost benefit analysis 4 4 hedonic property analysis to quantify the benefits of living closer to the lake a regression analysis was carried out besides the distance from the lake to the residential property several other parameters such as various facilities and characteristics of the property were included in the regression analysis a total of 334 and 135 property data were collected for wattle grove and woodcroft respectively a linear regression modelling for the combined data was completed the model is given below regression equation property price 154235139 76714 year sold 26763 bedrooms 59315 bathrooms 3203 car space 426 4 lot size m 2 17 33 lake drive m the output of the regression modelling shows that there is significant positive impact p 0 05 of the lake on property price the negative coefficient indicates that farther the property is from the lake the less value it has this is also supported by the community survey results in which over 70 of respondents believed that the lake system had positive impact on property price in terms of actual prices the property price increases by au 17 33 for each metre the property is closer to the lake this was also observed in a study conducted by tapsuwan et al 2009 in perth australia where the property price increased by au 42 40 for each metre the property is closer to the water body tables 2 and 3 show the model summary and coefficients of the regression as shown in table 2 most of the independent variables have a significance level of p 0 05 except car spaces it is expected that the car space should have positive effect on the property price however in the current case the car space has a negative impact which is not accurate this may be due to not considering other parameters such as distance to public transport and geographical location of the property nevertheless the regression coefficients as shown in table 3 appear to be reasonable this suggests that the above regression equation provides reasonably good fit to the data collected in this study 5 conclusions urban lakes have been constructed to serve multiple purposes that include flood retention land value improvement and community development the positive or negative impacts of the lake are dependent on many external factors over 50 of respondents from both sites believe some improvement in their physical and mental well being therefore it can be said that lakes in urban areas are great community assets however the percentages vary between the study locations due to the difference in lake water quality greenness of the surrounding parkland and the background of the residents in the area the community survey found that the urban lakes and their water quality seem to have significant impact on the price of nearby homes respondents from woodcroft lake did have more positive replies than wattle grove lake for almost all the questions in the survey which may be attributed to better water quality in woodcroft lake than wattle grove lake responses from community show that there is an overall positive perception of the lake and associated parkland when asked over 70 of the respondents stated that there is a positive impact of the lake on the property prices additionally 50 of residents found that there was moderate to significant impact of the lake on both mental and physical wellbeing of people approximately 8 16 of respondents stated that they would not exercise if the local lake did not exist also 60 of the respondents stated that the lake improved their quality of life moreover this is supported by the hedonic property price analysis which showed significant correlation between the proximity to the lake and the property price the findings from this study provide some valuable evidence to policymakers and municipal councils to encourage investments to improve performance of existing lakes as well as develop new ones in the urban areas however further research is required in this area to highlight the overall cost benefit analysis of urban lakes conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the authors would like to sincerely thank

primarily by leaching and surface runoff in percolate water n no3 prevails in surface runoff mainly organic and n nh4 forms can be found associated with eroded soil particles in early spring in many catchments peak values of nitrate are observed which is connected with soil surface thawing or snowmelt surface runoff the daily pattern of nitrate concentration in this period corresponds to the daily freezing and thawing of the surface soil ahmad 1996 douglas et al 1998 reible 1999 sharpley et al 1994 steinheimer et al 1998 for the purpose of water reservoirs protection it is essential to establish not only sources and loads but also the routes of primary nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen dabrowska et al 2016 according to the modern approach to water protection it is known that only data from high frequency monitoring can provide detailed information on nutrient loss by surface runoff dabrowska et al 2017b creating a network of such monitoring on large areas is impossible

as well as the influence of land use pattern on the directions and accumulation of the runoff second to create a simple and practical method based on the available spatial data for the mitigation of the negative influence of surface runoff on the quality of water stored in reservoirs the method is dedicated for use in reservoirs situated in small agricultural catchments where high resolution

analyses in arcgis with archydro module and functions in spatial analyst extension arcgis software created by environmental systems research institute is one of the most popular commercial mapping products however the analysis and establishment of surface runoff pathways can be performed with most available gis applications including freeware all the analyses and resulting maps were created on

dtm the model was corrected with fill sink function arcgis geoprocessing tool that removes erroneous sinks and peaks in an elevation surface raster as in most depression filling algorithms the calculations were based on the 1 d single flow direction jenson and domingue 1988 sink filling or peaks removing maintains the continuity of flow pathways but apart from vertical errors it may also remove real microtopographic features therefore it is important to control the created dtm in order to avoid excessive generalisation the disruption and impediment of overland flow by sinks pits and depressions hummocks and hedgerow banks were analysed pits and depressions did not exceed 1 of the studied catchment area real microtopographic features were taken into account as a factor shaping runoff flow pathways thomas et al 2017 wechsler 2007 flow direction raster and flow accumulation raster were generated using the deterministic eight node algorithm d8 jenson and domingue 1988 which allowed to determine the areal extent of the direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir on the basis of the conditioned dtm a slope map and a hillshade map of the surface was also created with the use

in the lowlands in the central western part of poland gps n 51 50 37ʺ e 17 56 09ʺ pl 92 426690 442510 the reservoir was constructed in 1970 by dividing the valley of the trzemna river with an earthen dam another smaller tributary is jedlec ditch fig 1 the trzemna river the left bank tributary of the prosna river has a total surface area of the catchment 119 2 km2 and mean catchment slope is 5 48 the source of the river is near czachory settlement at 126 50 m asl and its mouth is at 91 10 m asl at 5 6 km of the river course the total length 21 km there is an earthen dam of the gołuchów reservoir the catchment area to the dam cross section is 106 8 km2 and mean annual flow is 0 37 m3 s 1 at normal water level the reservoir has the capacity of 1 385 mln m3 the area of 51 5 ha and mean depth 2 7 m about 12 500 people live in the catchment dabrowska et al 2017a the reclamation process which started in 1994 consisted in building a sedimentation pond with reed bed on the river trzemna approximately 1 km above the reservoir installing spatial structures made of polypropylene in both tributaries at the entry into the reservoir as a frame for microorganisms purifying water and setting an aeration facility in the vicinity of the dam the gołuchów reservoir is located in an intensively cultivated catchment arable land constitutes 79 of the area forests 7 and grassland 4 in agricultural production cereal cultivation winter wheat winter triticale rye spring barley and potato growing prevail the cultivation of annual cereals and potatoes is detrimental to water quality as those crops require high level of fertilisation and do not cover the soil year round in the catchments farmers use mainly conventional tillage practices and often break the rules of agricultural best management practices by improper fertiliser and manure application or the lack of systematic use of soil conservation techniques livestock production is dominated by cattle pigs and poultry the calculations in the method of soil surface balance net nutrient balance suggest that in the studied area surpluses of nitrogen ca 40 kg per hectare per year and phosphorus ca 2 5 kg per hectare per year are observed large surpluses of nitrogen mainly come from mineral and organic fertilisers dabrowska 2008 the predominant soils are brown soils pseudo podsols and black soils on the eastern bank

inspectorate in poznań were elaborated and are presented in table 2 the waters of the trzemna river feeding the gołuchów reservoir have high concentrations of nutrients the concentration of the studied parameters is substantially changeable despite the implementation of water framework directive guidelines and the arrangement of wastewater management it has not been possible to lower the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the waters of the trzemna river above the gołuchów reservoir the registered increasing trend for tn and nitrate is unfavourable n p ratio ji 2007 calculated on the basis of mean concentration table 2 is 35 1 which means that the element limiting algae development is phosphorus the catchment is situated in the part of poland heavily cultivated lowland where poor water quality results from phosphates and nitrates content however nitrate concentration is exceptionally high in lowland surface waters studied by other authors mean annual tn concentrations reach 12 mg n l and mean annual tp concentrations are up to 1 8 mg p l jaskula et al 2016 kiedrzynska et al 2014 marcinkowski et al 2017 sojka et al 2016 in comparison to the aforementioned studies the concentrations of tn and nitrate in the waters of the trzemna river are relatively high and characterised by a large variability peak values of nitrate up to 170 00 mg no3 l 38 25 mg n l 99 of tn and as follows of total nitrogen up to 38 5 mg n l are usually noted at the end of february and at the beginning of march which is related to surface runoff from spring soil surface thawing or snowmelt in the waters of the river the nitrate form of nitrogen prevails then fig 2 tp concentrations take average values compared to other lowland watercourses fig 3 table 2 according to the data of the central statistical office poland the usage of mineral fertilisers in the catchment in the years 2000 2014 increased from 68 to 94 kg n ha 38 and from 20 to 36 kg p2o5 ha 80 in the same period the amount of organic fertilisers remained roughly the same a dynamic increase in the annual consumption of mineral nitrogen fertilisers high surplus of nitrogen in the abovementioned net nutrient balance and agricultural nitrate pollution were observed in the catchment of the trzemna river 2000 2014 and in 2012 it was classified as a nitrate vulnerable zone by the authorities dabrowska et al 2017a as regards phosphorus compounds a substantial improvement of water quality in the river was observed resulting from improved wastewater management dabrowska et al 2017a nevertheless it did not decrease the trend in tp concentrations in the trzemna river above the gołuchów reservoir table 2 the high content of nutrients in the waters of the main tributary and beneficial conditions for the development of phytoplankton in the shallow lowland reservoir lead to the presence of harmful algal blooms szczukocki et al 2015 4 results and discussion to establish and analyse surface runoff transport pathways a direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir was chosen the part from which the reservoir is fed by overland flow and small often temporal watercourses according to the dtm the direct catchment has a surface area of 980 ha the areal extent of the direct catchment established on the basis of the dtm from high resolution lidar differs from the one determined in the mhdp the map of hydrological division of poland which was created on the basis of dtm of much lower resolution and topographic maps the differences between direct catchment boundaries reach 500 m and result from taking into account microtopographic features such as rills field boundaries small ditches and dirt roads the usage of high resolution dtm for small areas makes it possible to consider microtopographic features and to precisely determine the boundaries of sub basins topographic water divides it has been recognised as a crucial element in the investigation of pollutants transfer from the catchment to surface water hancock et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 2017 and especially significant in lowland catchments where runoff transport pathways are often small grooves or furrows the slopes of the land in the direct catchment for most of the studied area do not exceed 2 5 near the banks of the reservoir the slope is greater than in other parts of the direct catchment slope with the highest inclination can be found on the eastern bank and in the southern part of the reservoir where they exceed 15 fig 6 although the catchment has a lowland nature the reservoir itself was situated in a gutter shaped part of the valley with greater slopes morphometry and land use pattern of the direct catchment is important as regards the release and transport of nutrients to lakes and reservoirs bajkiewicz grabowska 2010 izydorczyk et al 2013 arable lands and rural settlements encompass 67 of its area forests 26 waters 5 other lands constitute 2 on the basis of the methodology presented by bajkiewicz grabowska 2010 it may be found that for the direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir the decisive factors for high risk of transfer of nutrients to water body are the mean slope of the catchment exceeding 20 m km 1 ca 1 15 ca 2 land use in the catchment with the greatest proportion of agricultural areas and a minimal area of lands which do not drain to the reservoir i e pits sinks depressions from the whole area of the direct catchment surface runoff flows into the reservoir the analysis of the dtm hillshade map and land cover map figs 4 and 5 shows that along the western bank of the reservoir there are narrow agricultural fields whose strips are oriented and ploughed perpendicular to reservoir banks parallel to the slopes in the remaining part of the direct catchment many fields are oriented and ploughed according to slope direction it does not comply with the rules of best management practices bmps in agricultural watersheds as regards recommended anti erosion measures contour ploughing after the analysis of surface runoff transport pathways fig 7 the studied catchment was divided into 6 classes of different separate accumulation areas according to the elementary direct catchment of the reservoir fig 8 area ranges were 0 10 ha 10 25 ha 25 50 ha 50 100 ha 100 200 ha and 200 ha and were selected according to the size of the analysed site as the main surface runoff areas were assigned those of surface area over 1 km2 additionally unconcentrated runoff areas were delineated near the shore from which direct transfer without the accumulation of surface runoff to the reservoir occurs as well as riparian surface runoff areas over 1 ha fig 8 four main pollutant delivery points dp where concentrated surface runoff pathway reaches the reservoir and two delivery edges de where unconcentrated surface runoff pathway from arable land reaches the reservoir on a long part of the shoreline were identified fig 8 through delivery point dp1 surface runoff reaches the reservoir from the area over 200 ha 468 ha that is intensively cultivated the area is also included in the 1 km2 range the main surface runoff area delivery points dp3 and dp4 are on surface runoff pathways which concentrate surface runoff from areas exceeding 25 ha 31 ha and 29 ha respectively designated delivery point dp2 and connected surface runoff accumulation area prove that the forest on the eastern bank of the reservoir does not play the role of an efficient riparian buffer zone surface runoff accumulation area of over 100 ha 194 ha developed in it the area is also assigned as the main surface runoff area 1 km2 concentrated surface flow allows the water with nutrients and sediments to pass through the vegetation barrier and discharge directly into the reservoir the water from surface runoff flows from a wooded area is expected to be less threatening for water quality in the reservoir but its area is large spatial arrangement and the extent of pathways suggest that within this area forest roads influence the concentration of runoff and erosion some of the surface runoff pathways overlap with forest roads fig 8 generally forests play a significant part in the regulation of runoff and prevention of soil erosion however to make this fully possible it is crucial to properly place forest roads in relation to local relief dabek et al 2017 lalika et al 2017 for the analysed direct catchment also the areas with delivery edge 1 and 2 were delineated de1 1750 m area ending with de1 69 ha de2 2130 m area ending with de2 50 ha even though there is no surface runoff pathways concentration the water from arable land flows directly into the reservoir through furrows in substantially long parts of the shoreline for the designated areas a mitigation strategy was suggested table 3 it took into account the size of the analysed area land use and terrain slopes the analysis of specific features leads to assessing the risk of runoff generation and pollutant transfer to reservoir the main activities should focus on preventing surface runoff concentration in the catchment area breaking diversion of surface runoff pathways it will also be necessary to introduce agricultural bmps and to change land use renounce field cultivation in riparian area introduce erosion control measures due to high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in surface waters of the studied catchment the suggested solutions are efficient as regards both phosphorus and nitrogen removal where surface runoff transport pathways inevitably reach water bodies in riparian areas solutions from ecohydrology and ecological engineering should be used such as riparian buffers of minimal width 10 m highly effective buffer zones constructed wetlands sequentional sedimentation biofiltration systems moreover surface runoff water could be directed to pre reservoirs bednarek et al 2016 benndorf and putz 1987 izydorczyk et al 2015 mander et al 2017 perrow and davy 2002 szklarek et al 2018 5 conclusion a facilitated access to unified geospatial data gathered in publicly available databases causes a dynamic growth of research connected to the risk of runoff generation digital terrain models obtained from lidar prove to be especially useful high resolution of lidar dtms enables to capture surface microtopography precisely indicates catchment area and surface runoff flow directions the presented approach may be used in designing and maintaining reservoirs in assessing the efficiency of protection activities i e riparian buffer zones the method may be used on a local scale even for small water retention reservoirs as it is possible to delineate surface runoff transport pathways for specific fields in designated areas especially prone to generating runoff certain agricultural bmps and anti erosion measures should be introduced riparian buffer zones may be constructed near delivery points as well as wetlands or other nature based solutions supporting the sedimentation of suspended solids and water purification indicating main pollutant delivery points and edges enables cost effective targeted mitigation of

area land use activities water regime morphometry and size of the reservoir climate conditions kaczkowski et al 2017 taub 1984 zalewski 1999 as opposed to cold fast flowing oxygen rich and nutrient poor upland waters lowland water bodies are warmer slow flowing nutrient rich with lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen shallow waters are characterised with high net primary productivity high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus euphotic zone productive layer which extends to the bottom higher water temperatures and wind induced sediment resuspension internal nutrient loading increase the process of eutrophication lowland plains in comparison to mountainous and sub mountainous areas are usually more intensively cultivated with better developed urban and rural settlement and expanded transport network perrow and davy 2002 ratnayaka et al 2009 skwierawski 2012 in europe the implementation of water framework directive wfd and the obligation to achieve a good status of surface water bodies by the eu countries lead to the modernisation and construction of numerous new wastewater treatment plants wtps the discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated wastewater from point sources of pollution was significantly limited dabrowska et al 2017a robinson et al 2016 spanhoff et al 2007 surface runoff direct runoff of water from rainfall and snowmelt is a major component of the water cycle but also the source water pollution crucial in delivery of phosphorus and sediments and the significant source of nitrogen nitrogen may be lost from the soil by many ways primarily by leaching and surface runoff in percolate water n no3 prevails in surface runoff mainly organic and n nh4 forms can be found associated with eroded soil particles in early spring in many catchments peak values of nitrate are observed which is connected with soil surface thawing or snowmelt surface runoff the daily pattern of nitrate concentration in this period corresponds to the daily freezing and thawing of the surface soil ahmad 1996 douglas et al 1998 reible 1999 sharpley et al 1994 steinheimer et al 1998 for the purpose of water reservoirs protection it is essential to establish not only sources and loads but also the routes of primary nutrients phosphorus and nitrogen dabrowska et al 2016 according to the modern approach to water protection it is known that only data from high frequency monitoring can provide detailed information on nutrient loss by surface runoff dabrowska et al 2017b creating a network of such monitoring on large areas is impossible therefore designating areas in a watershed especially prone to generating runoff and water quality risk assessment is used more and more often in integrated water management agnew et al 2006 ockenden et al 2017 thomas et al 2017 walter et al 2000 surface runoff and corresponding soil erosion cause significant amounts of nutrients p and n and sediments to reach water bodies the threat of water pollution by surface runoff and soil loss is constantly increasing due to negative climatic changes especially rainfalls which have become heavier and more frequent research proves that during 1 2 intensive storm events 90 of annual load of phosphorus may be transferred to surface waters in a catchment dagnew et al 2017 jeppesen et al 2009 jeppesen et al 2011 kennish and paerl 2010 sharpley et al 1999 entered into force in may 2007 the inspire directive directive 2007 2 ec of the european parliament and of the council of 14 march 2007 establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the european community is a very important law supporting the creation of environmental policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment the inspire directive enables the creation of uniform databases improves and increases access to data resources strengthens the cooperation between institutions in europe and essentially targets spatial data that have an impact on the environment therefore environmental studies for spatial planning have been often supported by gis in recent years this allows improving decision making processes both on a local and regional scales kazak et al 2017 szewranski et al 2017 an easy access to spatial data provides an opportunity to develop universal methods for the integrated water resources management for the last few years elevation data from light detection and ranging lidar have become a basis for the creation of digital elevation models dems used in flood risk management they are mostly applied in hydrological and hydraulic modelling to assess the reach and depth of flood zone i e creating flood hazard maps and flood risk maps lidar is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges variable distances to the object terrain trees rocks buildings etc lidar sensors collect 3 dimensional point clouds of the scanned surface each point has its own coordinates x y z and in some cases additional attributes the light pulses integrated with other recorded data i e from global positioning system generate precise information about the earth objects topography and their surface characteristics eitel et al 2016 wulder et al 2012 numerous other methods of remote sensing serve to evaluate the structure and state of riparian vegetation as a significant factor influencing flood flow conditions kaluza et al 2012 the aim of the undertaken research was twofold first to determine surface runoff transport pathways from the direct catchment through shore zone to the waters as well as the influence of land use pattern on the directions and accumulation of the runoff second to create a simple and practical method based on the available spatial data for the mitigation of the negative influence of surface runoff on the quality of water stored in reservoirs the method is dedicated for use in reservoirs situated in small agricultural catchments where high resolution spatial data are easily available in poland and many european countries but most data essential to advanced non point source nps pollution modelling e g river flow data high frequency surface water quality and meteorological data groundwater quantity and quality data do not exist in such catchments establishing surface runoff transport pathways can become a basis for cost effective rural stormwater management and erosion control surface runoff pathways analysis and shaping breaking up or bypassing for indicated areas with concentrated overland flow targeted monitoring can be planned 2 materials and methods to establish the areal extent of the direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir a digital terrain model dtm bare earth dem was used it was created with lidar data from aerial laser scanning als of march 2011 in the form of a point cloud with the density of 4 points m2 the classification was performed in the las file format lidar aerial survey issued in 2008 by the american society for photogrammetry and remote sensing apsrs files in this format allow the storage of information about each point in space as regards its xyz coordinates classification and technical parameters of acquiring data by als the data were obtained from the it system of the national system for protection against extreme hazards isok at the pre processing stage the authors paid special attention to selecting optimal resolution and hydrological correction of the dtm thomas et al 2017 wechsler 2007 grid format dtm of spatial resolution 1 0 m generated from the point cloud was used for analyses in arcgis with archydro module and functions in spatial analyst extension arcgis software created by environmental systems research institute is one of the most popular commercial mapping products however the analysis and establishment of surface runoff pathways can be performed with most available gis applications including freeware all the analyses and resulting maps were created on the basis of spatial data in a coordinate system pl 92 epsg 2180 the creation of maps of flow direction and flow accumulation can be performed on the hydrologically conditioned hydrologically correct dtm the model was corrected with fill sink function arcgis geoprocessing tool that removes erroneous sinks and peaks in an elevation surface raster as in most depression filling algorithms the calculations were based on the 1 d single flow direction jenson and domingue 1988 sink filling or peaks removing maintains the continuity of flow pathways but apart from vertical errors it may also remove real microtopographic features therefore it is important to control the created dtm in order to avoid excessive generalisation the disruption and impediment of overland flow by sinks pits and depressions hummocks and hedgerow banks were analysed pits and depressions did not exceed 1 of the studied catchment area real microtopographic features were taken into account as a factor shaping runoff flow pathways thomas et al 2017 wechsler 2007 flow direction raster and flow accumulation raster were generated using the deterministic eight node algorithm d8 jenson and domingue 1988 which allowed to determine the areal extent of the direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir on the basis of the conditioned dtm a slope map and a hillshade map of the surface was also created with the use of data from corine land cover 2012 provided by the chief inspectorate of environmental protection poland the management pattern of the direct catchment was analysed multiannual data 1981 2010 obtained from the central database of climatological data provided by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute imgw pib and water quality data 2000 2014 from the provincial environment protection inspectorate in poznań were elaborated for the study site characteristics the catchment of the trzemna river to the cross section of the gołuchów reservoir is an ungauged catchment no river flow data are available statistical analysis of water quality data was conducted in xlstat add on for excel and the software package statistica v 12 5 the mann kendall test was applied to identify trends it is a nonparametric test commonly used in hydrological data analysis hydrological data usually do not fulfill the assumptions of parametric tests the mann kendall test can be applied to data with gaps when a gap in data string does not exceed one third of the total record hirsch et al 1982 3 study area the research was conducted for the gołuchów reservoir situated in the lowlands in the central western part of poland gps n 51 50 37ʺ e 17 56 09ʺ pl 92 426690 442510 the reservoir was constructed in 1970 by dividing the valley of the trzemna river with an earthen dam another smaller tributary is jedlec ditch fig 1 the trzemna river the left bank tributary of the prosna river has a total surface area of the catchment 119 2 km2 and mean catchment slope is 5 48 the source of the river is near czachory settlement at 126 50 m asl and its mouth is at 91 10 m asl at 5 6 km of the river course the total length 21 km there is an earthen dam of the gołuchów reservoir the catchment area to the dam cross section is 106 8 km2 and mean annual flow is 0 37 m3 s 1 at normal water level the reservoir has the capacity of 1 385 mln m3 the area of 51 5 ha and mean depth 2 7 m about 12 500 people live in the catchment dabrowska et al 2017a the reclamation process which started in 1994 consisted in building a sedimentation pond with reed bed on the river trzemna approximately 1 km above the reservoir installing spatial structures made of polypropylene in both tributaries at the entry into the reservoir as a frame for microorganisms purifying water and setting an aeration facility in the vicinity of the dam the gołuchów reservoir is located in an intensively cultivated catchment arable land constitutes 79 of the area forests 7 and grassland 4 in agricultural production cereal cultivation winter wheat winter triticale rye spring barley and potato growing prevail the cultivation of annual cereals and potatoes is detrimental to water quality as those crops require high level of fertilisation and do not cover the soil year round in the catchments farmers use mainly conventional tillage practices and often break the rules of agricultural best management practices by improper fertiliser and manure application or the lack of systematic use of soil conservation techniques livestock production is dominated by cattle pigs and poultry the calculations in the method of soil surface balance net nutrient balance suggest that in the studied area surpluses of nitrogen ca 40 kg per hectare per year and phosphorus ca 2 5 kg per hectare per year are observed large surpluses of nitrogen mainly come from mineral and organic fertilisers dabrowska 2008 the predominant soils are brown soils pseudo podsols and black soils on the eastern bank

poland with the lowest mean annual precipitation below 500 mm table 1 the highest monthly precipitation is noted here in the growing season in july 73 mm august 62 mm may 54 mm and june 55 mm and the lowest in winter in february 24 mm and january 25 mm since 2001 intensive works have been conducted in the catchment aiming to improve wastewater treatment within the scope of those works sewage

above the gołuchów reservoir was monitored in the site szkudła fig 1 in the years 2004 2005 2006 2008 2009 2010 and 2013 figs 2 and 3 the data provided by the provincial environment protection inspectorate in poznań were elaborated and are presented in table 2 the waters of the trzemna river feeding the gołuchów reservoir have high concentrations of nutrients the concentration of the studied parameters is substantially changeable despite the implementation of water framework directive guidelines and the arrangement of wastewater management it has not been possible to lower the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in the waters of the trzemna river above the gołuchów reservoir the registered increasing trend for tn and nitrate is unfavourable n p ratio ji 2007 calculated on the basis of mean concentration table 2 is 35 1 which means that the element limiting algae development is phosphorus the catchment is situated in the part of poland heavily cultivated lowland where poor water quality results from phosphates and nitrates content however nitrate concentration is exceptionally high in lowland surface waters studied by other authors mean annual tn concentrations reach 12 mg n l and mean annual tp concentrations are up to 1 8 mg p l jaskula et al 2016 kiedrzynska et al 2014 marcinkowski et al 2017 sojka et al 2016 in comparison to the aforementioned studies the concentrations of tn and nitrate in the waters of the trzemna river are relatively high and characterised by a large variability peak values of nitrate up to 170 00 mg no3 l 38 25 mg n l 99 of tn and as follows of total nitrogen up to 38 5 mg n l are usually noted at the end of february and at the beginning of march which is related to surface runoff from spring soil surface thawing or snowmelt in the waters of the river the nitrate form of nitrogen prevails then fig 2 tp concentrations take average values compared to other lowland watercourses fig 3 table 2 according to the data of the central statistical office poland the usage of mineral fertilisers in the catchment in the years 2000 2014 increased from 68 to 94 kg n ha 38 and from 20 to 36 kg p2o5 ha 80 in the same period the amount of organic fertilisers remained roughly the same a dynamic increase in the annual consumption of mineral nitrogen fertilisers high surplus of nitrogen in the abovementioned net nutrient balance and agricultural nitrate pollution were observed in the catchment of the trzemna river 2000 2014 and in 2012 it was classified as a nitrate vulnerable zone by the authorities dabrowska et al 2017a as regards phosphorus compounds a substantial improvement of water quality in the river was observed resulting from improved wastewater management dabrowska et al 2017a nevertheless it did not decrease the trend in tp concentrations in the trzemna river above the gołuchów reservoir table 2 the high content of nutrients in the waters of the main tributary and beneficial conditions for the development of phytoplankton in the shallow lowland reservoir lead to the presence of harmful algal blooms szczukocki et al 2015 4 results and discussion to establish and analyse surface runoff transport pathways a direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir was chosen the part from which the reservoir is fed by overland flow and small often temporal watercourses according to the dtm the direct catchment has a surface area of 980 ha the areal extent of the direct catchment established on the basis of the dtm from high resolution lidar differs from the one determined in the mhdp the map of hydrological division of poland which was created on the basis of dtm of much lower resolution and topographic maps the differences between direct catchment boundaries reach 500 m and result from taking into account microtopographic features such as rills field boundaries small ditches and dirt roads the usage of high resolution dtm for small areas makes it possible to consider microtopographic features and to precisely determine the boundaries of sub basins topographic water divides it has been recognised as a crucial element in the investigation of pollutants transfer from the catchment to surface water hancock et al 2015 thomas et al 2016 2017 and especially significant in lowland catchments where runoff transport pathways are often small grooves or furrows the slopes of the land in the direct catchment for most of the studied area do not exceed 2 5 near the banks of the reservoir the slope is greater than in other parts of the direct catchment slope with the highest inclination can be found on the eastern bank and in the southern part of the reservoir where they exceed 15 fig 6 although the catchment has a lowland nature the reservoir itself was situated in a gutter shaped part of the valley with greater slopes morphometry and land use pattern of the direct catchment is important as regards the release and transport of nutrients to lakes and reservoirs bajkiewicz grabowska 2010 izydorczyk et al 2013 arable lands and rural settlements encompass 67 of its area forests 26 waters 5 other lands constitute 2 on the basis of the methodology presented by bajkiewicz grabowska 2010 it may be found that for the direct catchment of the gołuchów reservoir the decisive factors for high risk of transfer of nutrients to water body are the mean slope of the catchment exceeding 20 m km 1 ca 1 15 ca 2 land use in the catchment with the greatest proportion of agricultural areas and a minimal area of lands which do not drain to the reservoir i e pits sinks depressions from the whole area of the direct catchment surface runoff flows into the reservoir the analysis of the dtm hillshade map and land cover map figs 4 and 5 shows that along the western bank of the reservoir there are narrow agricultural fields whose strips are oriented and ploughed perpendicular to reservoir banks parallel to the slopes in the remaining part of the direct catchment many fields are oriented and ploughed according to slope direction it does not comply with the rules of best management practices bmps in agricultural watersheds as regards recommended anti erosion measures contour ploughing after the analysis of surface runoff transport pathways fig 7 the studied catchment was divided into 6 classes of different separate accumulation areas according to the elementary direct catchment of the reservoir fig 8 area ranges were 0 10 ha 10 25 ha 25 50 ha 50 100 ha 100 200 ha and 200 ha and were selected according to the size of the analysed site as the main surface runoff areas were assigned those of surface area over 1 km2 additionally unconcentrated runoff areas were delineated near the shore from which direct transfer without the accumulation of surface runoff to the reservoir occurs as well as riparian surface runoff areas over 1 ha fig 8 four main pollutant delivery points dp where concentrated surface runoff pathway reaches the reservoir and two delivery edges de where unconcentrated surface runoff pathway from arable land reaches the reservoir on a long part of the shoreline were identified fig 8 through delivery point dp1 surface runoff reaches the reservoir from the area over 200 ha 468 ha that is intensively cultivated the area is also included in the 1 km2 range the main surface runoff area delivery points dp3 and dp4 are on surface runoff pathways which concentrate surface runoff from areas exceeding 25 ha 31 ha and 29 ha respectively designated delivery point dp2 and connected surface runoff accumulation area prove that the forest on the eastern bank of the reservoir does not play the role of an efficient riparian buffer zone surface runoff accumulation area of over 100 ha 194 ha developed in it the area is also assigned as the main surface runoff area 1 km2 concentrated surface flow allows the water with nutrients and sediments to pass through the vegetation barrier and discharge directly into the reservoir the water from surface runoff flows from a wooded area is expected to be less threatening for water quality in the reservoir but its area is large spatial arrangement and the extent of pathways suggest that within this area forest roads influence the concentration of runoff and erosion some of the surface runoff pathways overlap with forest roads fig 8 generally forests play a significant part in the regulation of runoff and prevention of soil erosion however to make this fully possible it is crucial to properly place forest roads in relation to local relief dabek et al 2017 lalika et al 2017 for the analysed direct catchment also the areas with delivery edge 1 and 2 were delineated de1 1750 m area ending with de1 69 ha de2 2130 m area ending with de2 50 ha even though there is no surface runoff pathways concentration the water from arable land flows directly into the reservoir through furrows in substantially long parts of the shoreline for the designated areas a mitigation strategy was suggested table 3 it took into account the size of the analysed area land use and terrain slopes the analysis of specific features leads to assessing the risk of runoff generation and pollutant transfer to reservoir the main activities should focus on preventing surface runoff concentration in the catchment area breaking diversion of surface runoff pathways it will also be necessary to introduce agricultural bmps and to change land use renounce field cultivation in riparian area introduce erosion control measures due to high concentrations of nitrogen compounds in surface waters of the studied catchment the suggested solutions are efficient as regards both phosphorus and nitrogen removal where surface runoff transport pathways inevitably reach water bodies in riparian areas solutions from ecohydrology and ecological engineering should be used such as riparian buffers of minimal width 10 m highly effective buffer zones constructed wetlands sequentional sedimentation biofiltration systems moreover surface runoff water could be directed to pre reservoirs bednarek et al 2016 benndorf and putz 1987 izydorczyk et al 2015 mander et al 2017 perrow and davy 2002 szklarek et al 2018 5 conclusion a facilitated access to unified geospatial data gathered in publicly available databases causes a dynamic growth of research connected to the risk of runoff generation digital terrain models obtained from lidar prove to be especially useful high resolution of lidar dtms enables to capture surface microtopography precisely indicates catchment area and surface runoff flow directions the presented approach may be used in designing and maintaining reservoirs in assessing the efficiency of protection activities i e riparian buffer zones the method may be used on a local scale even for small water retention reservoirs as it is possible to delineate surface runoff transport pathways for specific fields in designated areas especially prone to generating runoff certain agricultural bmps and anti erosion measures should be introduced riparian buffer zones may be constructed near delivery points as well as wetlands or other nature based solutions supporting the sedimentation of suspended solids and water purification indicating main pollutant delivery points and edges enables cost effective targeted mitigation of

1152,this study analyzes the water availability in the conchos river basin northern méxico through the amount and frequency of the precipitation precipitation is associated with the environmental flows in determining how much of the flow in the river has been altered by the effects of climate change or human influence changes in water were determined by two precipitation periods before 1961 1983 and after 1984 2008 using a climatological mesh database created by center of scientific research and higher education of ensenada two periods for their differences in the standardized precipitation index spi was calculated iha v7 program was used for the analysis of environmental flows in the after period there were significant increases in precipitation during the rainy season with a substantial decrease in minimum precipitations and in the number of storms on the other hand during the dry season it rained less making the climate extreme and indicating a change in the humidity patterns there was a total alteration of the environmental flows of the river this aspect generated a total loss of the frequency magnitude duration and periodicity of the environmental flows during the year due to the management of the dam for electricity generation irrigation and flood control altering the composition structure and function of the riparian ecosystem however the synergic effect of climate on the water availability was observed advantage of determining environmental flows is that decision makers can know how many changes have been introduced into the river flow

ecological flows decision makers can establish strategies for sustainable water management boulton 1999 efficient management of the aquatic system river corridor and wetlands requires the characterization of the natural flow regimes or pre existing prior to hydrological alteration using biologically relevant parameters as magnitude frequency and periodicity in relation to the conditions and trends in the existing biota to analyze later the changes generated anthropogenically or by climate change efforts in ecosystem management should consider the need to maintain and restore the natural characteristics of hydrological regimes for the purpose of ordering and maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem komar 1976 fischer and kummer 2000 tnc 2006 for this it is necessary to generate standardized tools that can assess the biophysical impacts of climate change where socioeconomic elements of ecosystems are included to generate strategies that can help in facing the effect of climate change in a way that is harmonized with sustainable development arnell 2010 cohen 2010 yarime et al 2010 considering the above it is necessary to review the existing tools to evaluate the alterations in hydrological flows due to river dams and or climate change for the effect they generate in the conservation of species the resilience of aquatic ecosystems as well as the welfare of the people who depend on them because rivers sustain and provide goods and services to the population supply of drinking water fishing recreation agriculture and electricity however limnological information is insufficient as well as the effect that climate change is exerting on water quality and its vulnerability in surface water bodies therefore in the present study the

magnitude of flow regimes environmental flows to determine how much of the flow in the river has been altered by the effects of climate change or by the changes introduced by human influence necessary focus to generate strategies that can help in facing the effect of climate change in a way that is harmonized with sustainable development in the conchos river 2 study area the conchos river basin is one of seven hydrological subregions that integrate 14 hydrological sub basins that form the rio grande rio bravo basin in méxico it is bordered on the north by the usa and to the east west and south by other mexican river basins this basin contributes 54 897 61hm3 year of the historic flow of the lower part of the rio grande rio bravo gastélum et al 2009 the conchos river is located in northern mexico borne on the eastern slope of the sierra madre occidental in the pine and oak forests in the region known as the sierra tarahumara crosses the broad plains of the chihuahuan desert and finally joins the rio bravo in the border area of ojinaga the conchos river basin covers 68 606km2 inegi 1999 is almost entirely within the state of chihuahua occupying 26 of the state territorial extension gutiérrez and carreón hernández 2004 the chihuahuan desert has been considered according to the analysis of biodiversity as one of the most important arid regions of the planet this desert is a centre of biodiversity for plants and vertebrates where rustic cacti are suitable for alkaline soils and low humidity as well as reptiles survivors of previous eras adapted to wide climatic fluctuations the

forests of the upper basin to the poplars that dominate the coastal landscape of the lower basin after being joined by the nonoava and balleza rivers and other tributaries the conchos river flows into la boquilla chihuahua s largest reservoir it is used to generate hydropower and meet irrigation demands the boquilla dam began operating in 1916 its curtain is 80m high with a capacity of 2894 hm3 kelly 2001 the monthly annual cycle of precipitation for the conchos river corresponds to a typical monsoon precipitation fig 2 thus there is a difference between the driest november to may and the wet june to october months the precipitation in the dry months does not exceed 0 5mm day whereas in the rainy season the precipitation is around 1 3mm day the rainiest months july august and september are consistent with the north american monsoon season reported in previous studies higgins and gochis 2007 gochis et al 2007 the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation of the conchos river basin during the entire study period 1961 2008 shows higher precipitation in the southwestern part of the basin the region with more precipitation had values between 600 and 800mm annually which correspond to the mountainous region a gradient of average precipitation was identified that decreases towards the southeast in the lower central part of the basin values around 400mm per year were observed as well as in the area between 29 and 31 n the aridest extent of the basin was the northernmost region with values around 300mm a little target area was shown in the map of the conchos river basin and where the next spi analysis was performed 3 methods 3 1 base of climatological data precipitation and surface temperature were analyzed using the climate gridded database created by cicese centro de investigación científica y de educación superior de ensenada such database hereinafter clicomg was generated from the official smn national meteorological service of mexico climate database which compiles more than 5000 stations and is stored in the clicom climatological computing system http clicom mex cicese mx malla clicomg was created by applying a basic level of data quality analysis and interpolated to a regular grid using the synographic mapping system symap method shepard 1984 this mesh uses the weighted average based on the root mean square deviation method of all the records in the vicinity of a grid cell to produce a 1 8 spatial grid resolution for all of mexico mckee et al 1995 shepard 1984 zhu and lettenmaier 2007 muñoz arriola et al 2009 clicomg covers a period from 1960 to 2008 the above data were used to calculate the spi created by mckee et al 1993 which is used to estimate potential drought or intense rainfall events in a given location the spi is a method to characterize dry or humid periods during a certain period of time mckee et al 1993 1995 spi is a simple and flexible method because only precipitation is needed to calculate it and it can analyze both wet and dry periods mckee et al 1993 1995 this is based on the probability of precipitation for any time scale by using the observed precipitation the probability of precipitation becomes an index wmo 2012 other methods to characterize the drought in a relatively more complex way exist such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among others however this study will be using spi because it is focused on the relationship that directly has the precipitation with the runoff the calculation of spi for any locality is based on the recording of long term precipitation for a desired period in this study 12 months called spi 12 this long term record is adjusted to a probability distribution and then transformed into a normal distribution so that the average spi for the locality and the desired period is zero edwards and mckee 1997 the positive values of spi indicate that precipitation is greater than the median and negative values that it is lower wmo 2012 the values of the index are categorized as recommended by wmo and are presented in table 1 the spi 12 was calculated for the period 1961 2008 the 12 months of 1960 has been used for the calculation of the spi of january of 1961 and so on the methodology described by edwards and mckee 1997 originally implemented in the programming languages c and fortran and later in the computational language r by wheatley 2010 was used to calculate the spi the starting point of the procedure is a monthly series of precipitations over a long recommended for at least 30 years for generating a series of averages it is taken a window of n months back of the month in question and a simple average is calculated while the number of months covering the window n is arbitrary it is common to take between 3 and 48 months to observe climatic phenomena at different time scales mckee et al 1993 the result is a series of averaged precipitations which are used to adjust to some kind of cumulative probability distribution function it has been suggested to adjust the data to the gamma probability distribution mckee et al 1993 the probability distribution that represents best the rainfall is still a matter of open discussion hanson and vogel 2012 the selection of the two parameter gamma continuous distribution manifests some representative advantages specifically for the calculation of spi which have been noted in other works guttman 1999 also to fit it to the cumulative distribution function of probabilities using of a non parametric statistical function known as the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf which can be determined directly from the data van der vaart 1998 in either case the adjustment is not made on the total data of the series of averages but on the stratification of them per month so that there would be twelve adjusted functions and the application of particular precipitation will depend on the month in which it is located guttman 1999 the final step in the methodology is to map the data that is the series of monthly precipitation averages to a series of spi indices this step takes as input the series of precipitation averages on the one hand and on the other the cumulative probability distribution function as shown in fig 3 for each of the precipitation averages of the series a probability was obtained and this probability was used as input for the inverse or quantile of the normal cumulative probability standardized function to obtain the spi that corresponds to that average precipitation by applying this procedure to each average of the series a time series of spis was obtained in order to compare the behaviour of the spi 12 we simply defined two periods based on the differences of the spi 12 shown in fig 4a note that the intensity and duration of the dry and wet periods change significantly by the mid part of the whole period therefore the before period was defined to be 1961 1984 and the after period 1985 2008 in order to quantify those differences among the periods it was calculated as a simple r index defined as r h 1 h 0 h 1 h 0 100 where h1 the value of the number of times a given spi 12 level from the before period 1985 2008 was inside the total 288 available months 48 years from the whole period 1961 2008 h0 the same as above but for the spi 12 level from the after period 1961 1984 this rate showed the observed change in the frequency of very rainy or very dry periods of both periods with respect to the total 1961 2008 period 3 2 environmental flows iha indicators of hydrologic alteration the analysis of flows was carried out through 1 hydrometric records of the altered flows by the basin or dam from 1949 to 2014 which included the comparative study of the flows variation for the before 1949 1984 and after period 1985 2014 the data were analyzed using graphs and statistics of the iha v7 program tnc 2006 to define the main trends in the temporal variation of daily expenses and the rva range of variability approach of hydrologic alteration indicators of the time flow series intra and interannual from the average daily flows the rva uses the variation of parameters values before period as a reference for defining the extent to which the flow regimes have been altered the quantitative understanding of rva is essential to know whether recent human activities have caused flows to move outside their rva this is especially relevant when the effects of anthropogenic stressors e g climate change invasive species are high and thus likely to move the system away from its rva in rva analysis the full range of pre impact data before period for each parameter was divided into three different categories the boundaries between categories were based on either percentiles values for the non parametric analysis the lowest category contains all values less than or equal to the 33rd percentile middle category contains all values falling in the range of the 34th to 67th percentiles and the highest category contains all values greater than the 67th percentile the program computes the expected frequency with which after period or post impact values of indicators of hydrological alteration iha parameters should fall within each category 33 and for each of the three categories this expected frequency is equal to the number of values in the category during the before period multiplied by the ratio of after period years to before period years iha factor is calculated for each of the three categories as rva observed frequency expected frequency expected frequency the non parametric analysis was performed estimating the medians and their dispersion by percentiles for the years considered the alterations imposed by flow regulation and or by changes in the climate after period were compared with the time series of the before period using the range of variability of each parameter given by the percentiles 25 and 75 this range of variability was used to assess the impact of climatic or anthropic change on environmental flows in the conchos river and possible scenarios were established for species of flora and fauna the hydrometric station is located on the tecuán channel 800m downstream from the dam s curtain which records the altered flow of the river due to the influence of the dam since 1949 for the analysis of the behaviour of the flows of the river conchos the available data of runoff and of the tecuan hydrometric station were selected in three periods 1 the runoff of the basin for the analysis of the natural flows from 1935 to 1949 2 the flows altered by the dam from 1949 to 1984 35 years and 3 the altered flow rates of the dam from 1985 to 2014 29 years to try to perform the comparative analysis of before and after and make them coincide with the rainfall records analysis considering that 30 years of records are the minimum suggested for carrying out a climate change analysis in any process omm 2012 table 2 4 results 4 1 variation of precipitation in the upper basin of the river conchos the results of spi 12 which were calculated with a window of observation of 12 months with special emphasis on wet or dry periods of long duration for this region spi plot indicates a large dry period about 1995 2003 and the duration of the wet very rain and dry low precipitations periods seems to last more for the after period fig 4a it observed high increases in drought rates index or spi 12 severely wet in dark grey to moderately wet in light grey in the after period but also an increase in the severely dry index in black and extremely dry in dark black also the behaviour of the spi 12 months for the 24 year periods of 1961 1984 before period and 1985 2008 after period through the percentage of the change r calculated shows a quantitative change in the frequency of very rainy or very dry periods of one period with respect to the other or for some region from the point of view of monthly precipitation it is known that these periods generally have a greater impact in the environmental and social sectors of any region 4 2 environmental flows the natural monthly average flow or environmental flows were totally altered for the construction of the la boquilla dam in the conchos river 1935 1949 the flow regime was altered in frequency magnitude duration and periodicity during the year due to the dam management for the generation of electric power irrigation and flood control this is corroborated in the percentage of depletion of flows during the year 66 62 in april and 98 58 in august from 1949 to 2014 this generated alterations in the composition structure and function of the riparian ecosystem table 3 the comparative study of the flows impaired by human influence ecological flows altered by the construction of the la boquilla dam for the period 1949 2014 was divided into two periods before 1949 1984 and after 1985 2014 it is observed that the flows were impacted by the management of the dam as indicated by the results the iha method 1 change in the day with a minimum flow of the january 1 to july 2 opposed to that expected 2 change in maximum flow from may 9 to april 18 this behaviour is completely opposite to that expected from a natural flow the maximum in the rain period and the minimum in the dry season an aspect that indicates the alteration of the flows by human influence 3 change in the number of low flow pulses from 9 to 4 with a duration of 3 to 8 days in january for the before and after period this show a decrease in frequency and an increase in duration in the flows 4 changes in duration of high flow pulses from 4 to 14 days respectively many days duration 5 changes in low flow peak magnitude duration and frequency of 0 04 and 0 m3 s with a duration of 3 and 8 days 6 the duration of major floods of 12 to 108 days for 8 august and 23 may respectively show changes in the number of days for the generation of a flow that is equivalent to a great flood and a change to the dry season may likewise the magnitude of the flow released during the whole year is very similar generating a homogeneous flow for all the times of the year with these altered flows it is possible to quantify the alteration by human influence and the synergic effect of climate change on riparian ecosystems that generates major alterations in the ecosystem it is observed in the increase of flows in the after period in the rain season and depletion of flow in the dry season wmo 2012 table 3 4 2 1 average monthly flows upper conchos river basin the altered average monthly flows of the dam indicated for the monthly averages flows were 0 45 december to 1 88 april for the before 1949 1984 period and from 0 0 november to 2 93 april m3 s for the after 1985 2014 the alteration of average flows occurred all year round mainly in the rainy season may june and july between the periods before and after 1949 1984 1985 2014 coincident with the increase in the precipitations however in the dry season the flow decreases significantly in the after period an aspect that may be indicating the low availability of water in the dam associated with the effects of climate change november with 0 m3 s of flow in addition the use of the resource for the generation of electricity and the increasing demand for water for agriculture and population growth fig 5 the rva components show greater hydrological alteration the increase of the flows from march to september which is explained by the increase of precipitations and the effects of the electric power generation in addition alterations in the minimum flows for 30 and 90 days also for the maximum flows with a duration of 1 3 7 30 and 90 days this implies that the dam generates high flows for a period of three continuous months and the variability in the frequency periodicity duration and magnitude of natural flows are lost fig 6 the number of days with zero flow is increased change in the date that appears as the minimum and maximum flow change in the number and duration of low pulses and the duration of high flow pulses both increase in duration the days with maximum flows have been lost to the variations in the number and duration of high pulses in the flows this implies changes in temporal variability with respect to the frequency duration periodicity and magnitude of the flows this implicates changes in the ecological conditions for the aquatic species in the river 5 discussion the monthly precipitation through the analysis of spi 12 in the conchos river for the selected sub basin indicates considerable differences between the before period 1961 1983 and the after period 1984 2008 this implies that in the after period the rains were more torrential in the rainy season and the periods of more intense droughts most of the dry and moisture severe and extreme levels are dominated by the after period in the target region maybe this means that the extremes for the spi are growing for the after years a result which could be in agreement with the general view of ipcc 2013 it was observed in the after period through rva the high intensity of large storms high frequency of small storms high pulses of precipitation predominance number of days with maximum rainfall followed by a duration of up to one month and the alteration of the date in which they appear as well as the positive and significant increase of precipitation in all months of the year indicating a wet period more rains for the sub basin as well as the substantial decrease in minimum precipitation and in the number of storms a significant precipitation decrease in the dry season these implies changes in the humidity patterns making the climate more extreme coincidently with livingstone 2003 who observed the increases in precipitation during autumn a similar behaviour in the variations on climate projections made in the northern half of the temperate zone of europe where changes include increased precipitation during the fall with extreme events of drought and wet and with the climate projections calculated north west mexico by ipcc bates et al 2008 and the usumacinta river which can be explained by the effects of climate change romero 2014 gonzález villela and montero martínez 2017 the greater number of days with zero precipitation in the initial period as well as the results of the index precipitation anomaly and percentage of change in the spi categories calculated for the target region can be associated with dry years and an extreme climate this period coincides with the prolonged drought recorded in north eastern mexico that reduced the flow of the river along with the levels of the dams and forced people to rely more and more on aquifers in the basin which are already over exploited along with this situation the pressure on the river conchos was increasing agricultural irrigation accounts for 90 of the water use in the basin population growth and industrialization two realities linked to the integration of the mexican and american economies and nafta north american free trade agreement have led to an increase in the demand for water for industry and for domestic use rocha 2005 deforestation and soil loss in the upper part of the basin represents the modification of the runoff of the catchment areas which can reduce the amount of water that must infiltrate this water in turn drags the unprotected soils and erode the channels all this affects water sources in the aquifers and reduce their availability romero 2014 precipitation affects the flow of the river in a significant way gutiérrez and carreón hernández 2004 however in the conchos the alteration of the flows due to the influence of climate change is less in comparison with the influence of the la boquilla dam located in the upper part of the conchos river as shown by a total alteration of the average natural monthly flow of the river where the percentage of depletion of flows during the year was from 66 62 in april to 98 58 in august this behaviour caused the total loss of the frequency magnitude duration and periodicity of the flows during the year due to the dam s management for electric power generation irrigation and flood control this generated alteration in the composition structure and function of the river and its riparian ecosystem river river corridor wetlands groundwater flora and fauna maza and barrios 2006 the homogenization of the flows generated an altered flow for all times of the year also the significant decrease in the dry season of the monthly average flow in the after period and the negative change with 0 m3 s in november due to the scarcity of the resource in the dry season may be associated with the lower availability of water for the dam romero 2014 therefore it is evident that the major environmental impact on the flows is by human influence than those caused by the synergistic effect on the availability of water by climate change these changes have impacted on observed temporal changes in the quality and quantity of water due in part to the drought in the 1950s in the conchos river as well as in the water conditions saltier and the decrease in the current which increased the erosive capacity of the water due to the weakening of the desiccated banks the few fish of neotropical origin in the conchos river are basically species that inhabit waters with stable temperatures and not very cold sometimes in springs of reduced size these fishes resist little changes and damage their stability and characteristics on the other hand the notorious loss of runoff causes loss of volume and leaves shallow stagnant variable temperature puddles that damage native species and favour exotic ones in other cases in conchos river the entire communities are impacted when they depend on the bottom of the sand gravel or clean rocks where they can nest the obstruction phenomenon is marked mainly in the first kilometres downstream of the dam where large areas of mud are formed especially in camargo where there is more mud and fewer species every day wwf méxico et al 2009 the eroded soil carried by the water increased the turbidity and the deposit of sediments on the bottom which in turn caused a decrease in the dissolved oxygen levels and the increase in temperature and the lower flow favoured the colonizing species and introduced species several species have penetrated from the lower parts of the basin and replaced the local to native species such is the case of gambusia speciose which has replaced gambusia senilis and pimephales vigilax to pimephales promelas likewise menidia beryllina to menidia jordani both introduced the taxonomic composition of the conchos river basin is highly variable and the causes of variability in the fish composition can be considered of both natural climate change and anthropogenic origin wwf méxico et al 2009 the quantitative understanding of the range of variability alteration is essential to know whether recent human activities have caused ecosystems to move outside their rva especially relevant when the effects of anthropogenic stressors e g climate change invasive species are high and thus likely to move the system away from its rva tnc 2006 therefore the potential for survival of any species may diminish if temporal and spatial patterns of species habitats shift outside their natural range of variation in other words contemporary anthropogenic change may diminish the viability of many species adapted to past or historical conditions and processes similarly because of limited understanding about ecosystems approximating past conditions offers one of the best means for predicting and reducing impacts to present day ecosystems analysis of an ecological system at different sites and over long periods provides the context to understand the driving variables constraints and behaviour of a system at local and shorter time scales landres et al 1999 accordingly it is necessary to elaborate specific initiatives and include a joint collaboration between researchers and policymakers to develop a satisfactory human and climatic impact assessment using the appropriate combination of scientific tools dabos and hirji 2003 arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2009 de smedt 2010 in the case of water development projects a flow assessment should be an essential component of human and climatic impact assessment impacts arising from alteration of a river s flow regime will always have the potential to be severe these impacts can often be mitigated through the design of environmental flows or compensation flows through resource

1152,this study analyzes the water availability in the conchos river basin northern méxico through the amount and frequency of the precipitation precipitation is associated with the environmental flows in determining how much of the flow in the river has been altered by the effects of climate change or human influence changes in water were determined by two precipitation periods before 1961 1983 and after 1984 2008 using a climatological mesh database created by center of scientific research and higher education of ensenada two periods for their differences in the standardized precipitation index spi was calculated iha v7 program was used for the analysis of environmental flows in the after period there were significant increases in precipitation during the rainy season with a substantial decrease in minimum precipitations and in the number of storms on the other hand during the dry season it rained less making the climate extreme and indicating a change in the humidity patterns there was a total alteration of the environmental flows of the river this aspect generated a total loss of the frequency magnitude duration and periodicity of the environmental flows during the year due to the management of the dam for electricity generation irrigation and flood control altering the composition structure and function of the riparian ecosystem however the synergic effect of climate on the water availability was observed advantage of determining environmental flows is that decision makers can know how many changes have been introduced into the river flow patterns by human consumption or by climate change keywords aquatic ecology water management ecosystemic analysis environmental flows climate change 1 introduction changes in the environment are significantly impacting rivers river corridors associated reservoirs and ecosystems degrading water quality reducing riverbed and habitat capacity for fish and wildlife and affecting their recreational and aesthetic value gustard 1992 arthington 1998 arthington et al 2006 fisrwg 1998 gafny et al 2000 jungwirth et al 2000 through the determination of water availability and its impact on ecological flows decision makers can establish strategies for sustainable water management boulton 1999 efficient management of the aquatic system river corridor and wetlands requires the characterization of the natural flow regimes or pre existing prior to hydrological alteration using biologically relevant parameters as magnitude frequency and periodicity in relation to the conditions and trends in the existing biota to analyze later the changes generated anthropogenically or by climate change efforts in ecosystem management should consider the need to maintain and restore the natural characteristics of hydrological regimes for the purpose of ordering and maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem komar 1976 fischer and kummer 2000 tnc 2006 for this it is necessary to generate standardized tools that can assess the biophysical impacts of climate change where socioeconomic elements of ecosystems are included to generate strategies that can help in facing the effect of climate change in a way that is harmonized with sustainable development arnell 2010 cohen 2010 yarime et al 2010 considering the above it is necessary to review the existing tools to evaluate the alterations in hydrological flows due to river dams and or climate change for the effect they generate in the conservation of species the resilience of aquatic ecosystems as well as the welfare of the people who depend on them because rivers sustain and provide goods and services to the population supply of drinking water fishing recreation agriculture and electricity however limnological information is insufficient as well as the effect that climate change is exerting on water quality and its vulnerability in surface water bodies therefore in the present study the availability of water in the conchos river basin through analysis of the amount and frequency of the precipitation was analyzed the availability of water was associated with the quantity frequency and magnitude of flow regimes environmental flows to determine how much of the flow in the river has been altered by the effects of climate change or by the changes introduced by human influence necessary focus to generate strategies that can help in facing the effect of climate change in a way that is harmonized with sustainable development in the conchos river 2 study area the conchos river basin is one of seven hydrological subregions that integrate 14 hydrological sub basins that form the rio grande rio bravo basin in méxico it is bordered on the north by the usa and to the east west and south by other mexican river basins this basin contributes 54 897 61hm3 year of the historic flow of the lower part of the rio grande rio bravo gastélum et al 2009 the conchos river is located in northern mexico borne on the eastern slope of the sierra madre occidental in the pine and oak forests in the region known as the sierra tarahumara crosses the broad plains of the chihuahuan desert and finally joins the rio bravo in the border area of ojinaga the conchos river basin covers 68 606km2 inegi 1999 is almost entirely within the state of chihuahua occupying 26 of the state territorial extension gutiérrez and carreón hernández 2004 the chihuahuan desert has been considered according to the analysis of biodiversity as one of the most important arid regions of the planet this desert is a centre of biodiversity for plants and vertebrates where rustic cacti are suitable for alkaline soils and low humidity as well as reptiles survivors of previous eras adapted to wide climatic fluctuations the complexity of freshwater fish positions the chihuahuan desert as the only desert region recognized for its great aquatic biodiversity de la maza benignos 2009 the river has a length of 749km and flows east northeast seven rivers feed the conchos and three main aquifers interact with the conchos river or its tributaries the conchos river and its tributaries supply water to three irrigation districts which total an area of 109 628ha the largest is the irrigation district 005 in delicias which covers 90 589 hectares and groups 12 503 users also provides water in compliance with international agreements rocha 2005 fig 1 the conchos river supplies water demand for industry agriculture and population and local ecological processes its watershed covers 30 of the chihuahua state surface the benefits of its waters extend along this route which culminates in the gulf of mexico supporting riverside and freshwater ecosystems characterized by the richness of its biodiversity and by the high index of endemism of its species the water in the region is used for crop irrigation supply public urban industrial livestock and electric power rocha 2005 the predominant vegetation is pine and oak forests of the upper basin to the poplars that dominate the coastal landscape of the lower basin after being joined by the nonoava and balleza rivers and other tributaries the conchos river flows into la boquilla chihuahua s largest reservoir it is used to generate hydropower and meet irrigation demands the boquilla dam began operating in 1916 its curtain is 80m high with a capacity of 2894 hm3 kelly 2001 the monthly annual cycle of precipitation for the conchos river corresponds to a typical monsoon precipitation fig 2 thus there is a difference between the driest november to may and the wet june to october months the precipitation in the dry months does not exceed 0 5mm day whereas in the rainy season the precipitation is around 1 3mm day the rainiest months july august and september are consistent with the north american monsoon season reported in previous studies higgins and gochis 2007 gochis et al 2007 the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation of the conchos river basin during the entire study period 1961 2008 shows higher precipitation in the southwestern part of the basin the region with more precipitation had values between 600 and 800mm annually which correspond to the mountainous region a gradient of average precipitation was identified that decreases towards the southeast in the lower central part of the basin values around 400mm per year were observed as well as in the area between 29 and 31 n the aridest extent of the basin was the northernmost region with values around 300mm a little target area was shown in the map of the conchos river basin and where the next spi analysis was performed 3 methods 3 1 base of climatological data precipitation and surface temperature were analyzed using the climate gridded database created by cicese centro de investigación científica y de educación superior de ensenada such database hereinafter clicomg was generated from the official smn national meteorological service of mexico climate database which compiles more than 5000 stations and is stored in the clicom climatological computing system http clicom mex cicese mx malla clicomg was created by applying a basic level of data quality analysis and interpolated to a regular grid using the synographic mapping system symap method shepard 1984 this mesh uses the weighted average based on the root mean square deviation method of all the records in the vicinity of a grid cell to produce a 1 8 spatial grid resolution for all of mexico mckee et al 1995 shepard 1984 zhu and lettenmaier 2007 muñoz arriola et al 2009 clicomg covers a period from 1960 to 2008 the above data were used to calculate the spi created by mckee et al 1993 which is used to estimate potential drought or intense rainfall events in a given location the spi is a method to characterize dry or humid periods during a certain period of time mckee et al 1993 1995 spi is a simple and flexible method because only precipitation is needed to calculate it and it can analyze both wet and dry periods mckee et al 1993 1995 this is based on the probability of precipitation for any time scale by using the observed precipitation the probability of precipitation becomes an index wmo 2012 other methods to characterize the drought in a relatively more complex way exist such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 or the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 among others however this study will be using spi because it is focused on the relationship that directly has the precipitation with the runoff the calculation of spi for any locality is based on the recording of long term precipitation for a desired period in this study 12 months called spi 12 this long term record is adjusted to a probability distribution and then transformed into a normal distribution so that the average spi for the locality and the desired period is zero edwards and mckee 1997 the positive values of spi indicate that precipitation is greater than the median and negative values that it is lower wmo 2012 the values of the index are categorized as recommended by wmo and are presented in table 1 the spi 12 was calculated for the period 1961 2008 the 12 months of 1960 has been used for the calculation of the spi of january of 1961 and so on the methodology described by edwards and mckee 1997 originally implemented in the programming languages c and fortran and later in the computational language r by wheatley 2010 was used to calculate the spi the starting point of the procedure is a monthly series of precipitations over a long recommended for at least 30 years for generating a series of averages it is taken a window of n months back of the month in question and a simple average is calculated while the number of months covering the window n is arbitrary it is common to take between 3 and 48 months to observe climatic phenomena at different time scales mckee et al 1993 the result is a series of averaged precipitations which are used to adjust to some kind of cumulative probability distribution function it has been suggested to adjust the data to the gamma probability distribution mckee et al 1993 the probability distribution that represents best the rainfall is still a matter of open discussion hanson and vogel 2012 the selection of the two parameter gamma continuous distribution manifests some representative advantages specifically for the calculation of spi which have been noted in other works guttman 1999 also to fit it to the cumulative distribution function of probabilities using of a non parametric statistical function known as the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf which can be determined directly from the data van der vaart 1998 in either case the adjustment is not made on the total data of the series of averages but on the stratification of them per month so that there would be twelve adjusted functions and the application of particular precipitation will depend on the month in which it is located guttman 1999 the final step in the methodology is to map the data that is the series of monthly precipitation averages to a series of spi indices this step takes as input the series of precipitation averages on the one hand and on the other the cumulative probability distribution function as shown in fig 3 for each of the precipitation averages of the series a probability was obtained and this probability was used as input for the inverse or quantile of the normal cumulative probability standardized function to obtain the spi that corresponds to that average precipitation by applying this procedure to each average of the series a time series of spis was obtained in order to compare the behaviour of the spi 12 we simply defined two periods based on the differences of the spi 12 shown in fig 4a note that the intensity and duration of the dry and wet periods change significantly by the mid part of the whole period therefore the before period was defined to be 1961 1984 and the after period 1985 2008 in order to quantify those differences among the periods it was calculated as a simple r index defined as r h 1 h 0 h 1 h 0 100 where h1 the value of the number of times a given spi 12 level from the before period 1985 2008 was inside the total 288 available months 48 years from the whole period 1961 2008 h0 the same as above but for the spi 12 level from the after period 1961 1984 this rate showed the observed change in the frequency of very rainy or very dry periods of both periods with respect to the total 1961 2008 period 3 2 environmental flows iha indicators of hydrologic alteration the analysis of flows was carried out through 1 hydrometric records of the altered flows by the basin or dam from 1949 to 2014 which included the comparative study of the flows variation for the before 1949 1984 and after period 1985 2014 the data were analyzed using graphs and statistics of the iha v7 program tnc 2006 to define the main trends in the temporal variation of daily expenses and the rva range of variability approach of hydrologic alteration indicators of the time flow series intra and interannual from the average daily flows the rva uses the variation of parameters values before period as a reference for defining the extent to which the flow regimes have been altered the quantitative understanding of rva is essential to know whether recent human activities have caused flows to move outside their rva this is especially relevant when the effects of anthropogenic stressors e g climate change invasive species are high and thus likely to move the system away from its rva in rva analysis the full range of pre impact data before period for each parameter was divided into three different categories the boundaries between categories were based on either percentiles values for the non parametric analysis the lowest category contains all values less than or equal to the 33rd percentile middle category contains all values falling in the range of the 34th to 67th percentiles and the highest category contains all values greater than the 67th percentile the program computes the expected frequency with which after period or post impact values of indicators of hydrological alteration iha parameters should fall within each category 33 and for each of the three categories this expected frequency is equal to the number of values in the category during the before period multiplied by the ratio of after period years to before period years iha factor is calculated for each of the three categories as rva observed frequency expected frequency expected frequency the non parametric analysis was performed estimating the medians and their dispersion by percentiles for the years considered the alterations imposed by flow regulation and or by changes in the climate after period were compared with the time series of the before period using the range of variability of each parameter given by the percentiles 25 and 75 this range of variability was used to assess the impact of climatic or anthropic change on environmental flows in the conchos river and possible scenarios were established for species of flora and fauna the hydrometric station is located on the tecuán channel 800m downstream from the dam s curtain which records the altered flow of the river due to the influence of the dam since 1949 for the analysis of the behaviour of the flows of the river conchos the available data of runoff and of the tecuan hydrometric station were selected in three periods 1 the runoff of the basin for the analysis of the natural flows from 1935 to 1949 2 the flows altered by the dam from 1949 to 1984 35 years and 3 the altered flow rates of the dam from 1985 to 2014 29 years to try to perform the comparative analysis of before and after and make them coincide with the rainfall records analysis considering that 30 years of records are the minimum suggested for carrying out a climate change analysis in any process omm 2012 table 2 4 results 4 1 variation of precipitation in the upper basin of the river conchos the results of spi 12 which were calculated with a window of observation of 12 months with special emphasis on wet or dry periods of long duration for this region spi plot indicates a large dry period about 1995 2003 and the duration of the wet very rain and dry low precipitations periods seems to last more for the after period fig 4a it observed high increases in drought rates index or spi 12 severely wet in dark grey to moderately wet in light grey in the after period but also an increase in the severely dry index in black and extremely dry in dark black also the behaviour of the spi 12 months for the 24 year periods of 1961 1984 before period and 1985 2008 after period through the percentage of the change r calculated shows a quantitative change in the frequency of very rainy or very dry periods of one period with respect to the other or for some region from the point of view of monthly precipitation it is known that these periods generally have a greater impact in the environmental and social sectors of any region 4 2 environmental flows the natural monthly average flow or environmental flows were totally altered for the construction of the la boquilla dam in the conchos river 1935 1949 the flow regime was altered in frequency magnitude duration and periodicity during the year due to the dam management for the generation of electric power irrigation and flood control this is corroborated in the percentage of depletion of flows during the year 66 62 in april and 98 58 in august from 1949 to 2014 this generated alterations in the composition structure and function of the riparian ecosystem table 3 the comparative study of the flows impaired by human influence ecological flows altered by the construction of the la boquilla dam for the period 1949 2014 was divided into two periods before 1949 1984 and after 1985 2014 it is observed that the flows were impacted by the management of the dam as indicated by the results the iha method 1 change in the day with a minimum flow of the january 1 to july 2 opposed to that expected 2 change in maximum flow from may 9 to april 18 this behaviour is completely opposite to that expected from a natural flow the maximum in the rain period and the minimum in the dry season an aspect that indicates the alteration of the flows by human influence 3 change in the number of low flow pulses from 9 to 4 with a duration of 3 to 8 days in january for the before and after period this show a decrease in frequency and an increase in duration in the flows 4 changes in duration of high flow pulses from 4 to 14 days respectively many days duration 5 changes in low flow peak magnitude duration and frequency of 0 04 and 0 m3 s with a duration of 3 and 8 days 6 the duration of major floods of 12 to 108 days for 8 august and 23 may respectively show changes in the number of days for the generation of a flow that is equivalent to a great flood and a change to the dry season may likewise the magnitude of the flow released during the whole year is very similar generating a homogeneous flow for all the times of the year with these altered flows it is possible to quantify the alteration by human influence and the synergic effect of climate change on riparian ecosystems that generates major alterations in the ecosystem it is observed in the increase of flows in the after period in the rain season and depletion of flow in the dry season wmo 2012 table 3 4 2 1 average monthly flows upper conchos river basin the altered average monthly flows of the dam indicated for the monthly averages flows were 0 45 december to 1 88 april for the before 1949 1984 period and from 0 0 november to 2 93 april m3 s for the after 1985 2014 the alteration of average flows occurred all year round mainly in the rainy season may june and july between the periods before and after 1949 1984 1985 2014 coincident with the increase in the precipitations however in the dry season the flow decreases significantly in the after period an aspect that may be indicating the low availability of water in the dam associated with the effects of climate change november with 0 m3 s of flow in addition the use of the resource for the generation of electricity and the increasing demand for water for agriculture and population growth fig 5 the rva components show greater hydrological alteration the increase of the flows from march to september which is explained by the increase of precipitations and the effects of the electric power generation in addition alterations in the minimum flows for 30 and 90 days also for the maximum flows with a duration of 1 3 7 30 and 90 days this implies that the dam generates high flows for a period of three continuous months and the variability in the frequency periodicity duration and magnitude of natural flows are lost fig 6 the number of days with zero flow is increased change in the date that appears as the minimum and maximum flow change in the number and duration of low pulses and the duration of high flow pulses both increase in duration the days with maximum flows have been lost to the variations in the number and duration of high pulses in the flows this implies changes in temporal variability with respect to the frequency duration periodicity and magnitude of the flows this implicates changes in the ecological conditions for the aquatic species in the river 5 discussion the monthly precipitation through the analysis of spi 12 in the conchos river for the selected sub basin indicates considerable differences between the before period 1961 1983 and the after period 1984 2008 this implies that in the after period the rains were more torrential in the rainy season and the periods of more intense droughts most of the dry and moisture severe and extreme levels are dominated by the after period in the target region maybe this means that the extremes for the spi are growing for the after years a result which could be in agreement with the general view of ipcc 2013 it was observed in the after period through rva the high intensity of large storms high frequency of small storms high pulses of precipitation predominance number of days with maximum rainfall followed by a duration of up to one month and the alteration of the date in which they appear as well as the positive and significant increase of precipitation in all months of the year indicating a wet period more rains for the sub basin as well as the substantial decrease in minimum precipitation and in the number of storms a significant precipitation decrease in the dry season these implies changes in the humidity patterns making the climate more extreme coincidently with livingstone 2003 who observed the increases in precipitation during autumn a similar behaviour in the variations on climate projections made in the northern half of the temperate zone of europe where changes include increased precipitation during the fall with extreme events of drought and wet and with the climate projections calculated north west mexico by ipcc bates et al 2008 and the usumacinta river which can be explained by the effects of climate change romero 2014 gonzález villela and montero martínez 2017 the greater number of days with zero precipitation in the initial period as well as the results of the index precipitation anomaly and percentage of change in the spi categories calculated for the target region can be associated with dry years and an extreme climate this period coincides with the prolonged drought recorded in north eastern mexico that reduced the flow of the river along with the levels of the dams and forced people to rely more and more on aquifers in the basin which are already over exploited along with this situation the pressure on the river conchos was increasing agricultural irrigation accounts for 90 of the water use in the basin population growth and industrialization two realities linked to the integration of the mexican and american economies and nafta north american free trade agreement have led to an increase in the demand for water for industry and for domestic use rocha 2005 deforestation and soil loss in the upper part of the basin represents the modification of the runoff of the catchment areas which can reduce the amount of water that must infiltrate this water in turn drags the unprotected soils and erode the channels all this affects water sources in the aquifers and reduce their availability romero 2014 precipitation affects the flow of the river in a significant way gutiérrez and carreón hernández 2004 however in the conchos the alteration of the flows due to the influence of climate change is less in comparison with the influence of the la boquilla dam located in the upper part of the conchos river as shown by a total alteration of the average natural monthly flow of the river where the percentage of depletion of flows during the year was from 66 62 in april to 98 58 in august this behaviour caused the total loss of the frequency magnitude duration and periodicity of the flows during the year due to the dam s management for electric power generation irrigation and flood control this generated alteration in the composition structure and function of the river and its riparian ecosystem river river corridor wetlands groundwater flora and fauna maza and barrios 2006 the homogenization of the flows generated an altered flow for all times of the year also the significant decrease in the dry season of the monthly average flow in the after period and the negative change with 0 m3 s in november due to the scarcity of the resource in the dry season may be associated with the lower availability of water for the dam romero 2014 therefore it is evident that the major environmental impact on the flows is by human influence than those caused by the synergistic effect on the availability of water by climate change these changes have impacted on observed temporal changes in the quality and quantity of water due in part to the drought in the 1950s in the conchos river as well as in the water conditions saltier and the decrease in the current which increased the erosive capacity of the water due to the weakening of the desiccated banks the few fish of neotropical origin in the conchos river are basically species that inhabit waters with stable temperatures and not very cold sometimes in springs of reduced size these fishes resist little changes and damage their stability and characteristics on the other hand the notorious loss of runoff causes loss of volume and leaves shallow stagnant variable temperature puddles that damage native species and favour exotic ones in other cases in conchos river the entire communities are impacted when they depend on the bottom of the sand gravel or clean rocks where they can nest the obstruction phenomenon is marked mainly in the first kilometres downstream of the dam where large areas of mud are formed especially in camargo where there is more mud and fewer species every day wwf méxico et al 2009 the eroded soil carried by the water increased the turbidity and the deposit of sediments on the bottom which in turn caused a decrease in the dissolved oxygen levels and the increase in temperature and the lower flow favoured the colonizing species and introduced species several species have penetrated from the lower parts of the basin and replaced the local to native species such is the case of gambusia speciose which has replaced gambusia senilis and pimephales vigilax to pimephales promelas likewise menidia beryllina to menidia jordani both introduced the taxonomic composition of the conchos river basin is highly variable and the causes of variability in the fish composition can be considered of both natural climate change and anthropogenic origin wwf méxico et al 2009 the quantitative understanding of the range of variability alteration is essential to know whether recent human activities have caused ecosystems to move outside their rva especially relevant when the effects of anthropogenic stressors e g climate change invasive species are high and thus likely to move the system away from its rva tnc 2006 therefore the potential for survival of any species may diminish if temporal and spatial patterns of species habitats shift outside their natural range of variation in other words contemporary anthropogenic change may diminish the viability of many species adapted to past or historical conditions and processes similarly because of limited understanding about ecosystems approximating past conditions offers one of the best means for predicting and reducing impacts to present day ecosystems analysis of an ecological system at different sites and over long periods provides the context to understand the driving variables constraints and behaviour of a system at local and shorter time scales landres et al 1999 accordingly it is necessary to elaborate specific initiatives and include a joint collaboration between researchers and policymakers to develop a satisfactory human and climatic impact assessment using the appropriate combination of scientific tools dabos and hirji 2003 arthington et al 2006 poff et al 2009 de smedt 2010 in the case of water development projects a flow assessment should be an essential component of human and climatic impact assessment impacts arising from alteration of a river s flow regime will always have the potential to be severe these impacts can often be mitigated through the design of environmental flows or compensation flows through resource

1153,the biochar is a solid residue obtained from thermolysis pyrolysis of various biomass feedstock including lignocellulosic waste the issues associated with the production and application or usage of the biochar have been dynamically developed throughout the world in recent years and the application of biochar in soils has been widely discussed as a possible and simple way to sequestrate carbon and improve soil s chemical and physical properties for better plant growth the present paper deals with an overview of the currently available knowledge on the above subject and is widely supported by authors own research results the results of authors investigation on biochar application to polish soils indicate that addition of biochar into soils in different proportions increase the soil carbon content ph and plant growth it is discussed that the biochar production would be an important component of circular bioregions economy and a powerful tool for clean energy conversion and atmospheric carbon sink in order to counteract climate changes keywords biochar circular bioregions thermolysis smokeless biocomposite fuels 1 introduction industrial development and increased production of goods and services as well as modern and intensive agriculture are associated with increased consumption of raw materials and energy and decreased involvement of human labor so far the production of energy as well as various goods and services has always been accompanied by the formation of waste according to the so called linear economy focused on the production of goods while the waste had been thrown away the linear economy model has thus nothing to do with sustainable development and it has recently been replaced by a circular economy approach that has emerged as a promising alternative since the circular economy does not waste resources but rather promotes better use of the raw materials in the circular economy approach a close to nature model is proposed where the amount of waste is minimized and the waste is recycled and reused based on that idea the concept of circular bioregions cb has been created in poland according to the lodz declaration the bioregions are sustainable and renewable energy systems including biorefineries and prosumer energy distribution systems that are focused on achieving a net zero energy balance with simultaneous low emission of co2 lodz declaration of bioregions 2016 the production and application of the biochar fits perfectly to the cb concept that has been briefly mentioned above the concept of cbs and more sustainable and environmentally oriented economic development becomes more and more important in the developed countries due to numerous problems associated for instance with the lack of good quality water overconsumption of artificial fertilizers by agriculture or overproduction of waste jezierska thöle et al 2016 the awareness of those problems is becoming more common also in poland where numerous reports kędzior and zawadzki 2017 krogulec 2018 kundzewicz et al 2017 usowicz and lipiec 2017 provide data that the country faces problems with soil quality and draught which may become a serious problem for polish agriculture particularly in central poland where the soils are quite poor and have been facing the lack of water since several years krogulec 2018 usowicz and lipiec 2017 in the case of poland significant contribution to climate changes and worsening of water resources for agriculture is made by the power generation sector which requires significant amount of water for the electricity generation and is still based on the combustion of coal thus emitting significant amount of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas poland is therefore forced by other eu member countries to decrease the net emission of co2 and every tool or technology that may help to counteract climate changes and improve country s poor water resources is worth developing an interesting solution for reaching those goals may be provided by the use of carbonized biomass the biochar bc the bc is carbon rich solid produced due to thermal treatment thermolysis or pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen antal and grønli 2003 industrial production of the biochar has recently become an important part of the renewable bioenergy production strategy with simultaneous removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the manufacture of environmentally beneficial products of biomass origin during thermolysis roughly 50 80 of biomass may be converted into combustible liquids and or vapors that can be then directly used for bioenergy production baishali 2014 bis and gajewski 1994 kobyłecki 2014 the remaining 20 50 of the biomass is converted into biochar i e a solid product that retains some properties of the residual feedstock and is essentially composed of amorphous carbon and crystallites of polycondensed aromatics with interspersed voids and ash baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 since the bc tends to decompose slowly in the environment it is thus considered as a promising temporal sink for atmospheric co2 baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 individual properties of the bcs depend on feedstock and pyrolysis parameters kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 by controlling those factors it is possible to create specially targeted and value added designed bcs for specific environmental applications e g as soil improvers liu et al 2013 mclaren 2012 nelissen et al 2014 heavy metal sorbents kobyłecki 2014 or sorbents for the removal of organic contaminants from water mohan et al 2014 as briefly presented above the bc offers significant environmental benefits and its properties depend on the composition of original biomass as well as the temperature and feedstock residence time in the thermolysis reactor in this paper a brief review of the biochar properties and production has been carried out and some chosen promising applications of the biochar are presented the information is supported by authors own experimental data targeted on the use of biochar in polish conditions e g as coal replacement in smokeless fuels in order to minimize the emission of co2 and particulate matter from the combustion processes or the application of the biochar as soil amendment to capture water and increase soil ph the authors also carried out some field experiments at some low quality agricultural soils in central poland i e on the area that has been facing serious water shortages since many years the authors believe that the application of biochar to low quality polish soils may be a promising way not only for the improvement of water retentiveness and soil productivity but also for the decrease of country s net emission of co2 that is currently quite high since polish power generation facilities are still to a large extend 80 based on the combustion of coal kuchler and bridge 2018 2 biochar as an alternative to carbon capture and storage scientific sources dealing with the analysis of the global carbon balance on earth report that there is a huge imbalance between the emission of carbon to the atmosphere and its absorption by all possible ways such imbalance leads to continuous increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the emission is nowadays assumed at roughly 4 1 109 mg yr kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 such huge difference between the emission and carbon absorption should put the attention of the decision makers to give the highest priority to the development and implementation of new technologies focused on efficient capture and long time storage of carbon outside earth atmosphere the classical carbon capture and storage ccs technologies are currently not very much promoted due to the lack of sufficiently proven commercial implementations of the demo plants as well as high investment and operating costs brought about by significant reduction of the efficiency of electricity generation the increased demand for electricity cannot be fulfilled exclusively by photovoltaics windmills or biomass combustion gasification plants particularly that one cannot forget about the need to increase the production of food and simultaneously to counteract the draughts and lack of water at large areas which were previously used for agriculture numerous newspapers report e g that the amount of biofuels produced from maize planted on the area similar to that of the u s would not be enough to drive all the cars in that country the authors of the current paper believe that practical implementation of the sustainable development idea should provide the world community with a low cost carbon reduction technology bearing that in mind a long time co2 sequestration by biomass processing and the production of the bc and the storage of the bc in soil seems to be particularly promising the activities associated with biochar oriented research and promotion are being patronized by numerous institutions such as e g the international biochar initiative ibi www biochar international org that is a non profit organization supporting academics politicians farmers gardeners and businessmen who deal with sustainable production and application of the bc the bc biochar also called biocarbon or biocoal is a substance having properties similar to charcoal cf fig 1 and may be produced due to pyrolysis gasification or thermolysis kobyłecki 2014 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 of various biomass feedstock such as energy crops forest waste biomass processing waste or other biomass of agricultural origin the bc is characterized not only by a more homogenous composition than the original material baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 but also by a very well developed internal pore structure cf fig 2 some example parameters of the biomass and the produced biochar are given in table 1 kobyłecki 2014 analysis of the data indicates that the biochar is almost dry and contains more carbon and ash and less volatiles than the original biomass feedstock compared with biomass the biochar is also characterized by significantly higher energy density apart from its commonly known sorption properties associated with well developed internal structure the bc is also used as renewable fuel for large scale combustion plants the fuel is characterized by high reactivity high carbon content c 80 and high heating value lhv up to 27mj kg kobyłecki 2014 recently the bc has also been considered as a potentially important solution for long term storage of carbon in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions the interest toward the application of the biochar as a co2 sequester has come out from the investigation of amazonia land and the discovery of the so called terra preta black land of the indians lehman and joseph 2009 the terra preta soil most probably originated through targeted and systematic human efforts the soil is very fertile and capable to regenerate itself and maintain its positive features for a long time the structure and properties of the terra preta strongly contrast with its surrounding and poor amazon soils although it was created by people living in the amazon basin even some 2500 years ago the terra preta soil still covers significant areas of the amazon perhaps even up to 10 of the surface it is estimated that the terra preta soil is capable to maintain its positive properties for hundreds of years since it is still able to produce extraordinary yields to make the terra preta soil the indians mixed up crushed pieces of biochar obtained from charred trees and fragments of clay pottery mud or even fish and animal debris and added the mixture to the soil thus forming a loamy mixture characterized by good sorption properties and being a good base for numerous microorganisms that enhance its fertility the kayapo indian tribe in brazil still produce terra preta like soil called terra mulata according to the researchers who have spent some time to investigate the life and customs of this tribe the creation of terra mulata farmland involves permanent slow firing or rather smoldering of plants and trees with no visible fire although the works on more detailed identification of the terra preta microorganisms are still going on this type of soil is believed to play significant role in the restoration of rainforests and the development of more sustainable farming in the amazon area in order to counteract negative effects associated with the existence of large oil palm farms that are focused on the production of biofuels due to the extraordinary fertility of the black soil being the result of its enrichment with carbon potential application of the terra preta to minimize world famine is also taken into consideration since the main and crucial constituent of the terra preta is carbon wider implementation of carbon based agriculture and the sequestration of carbon in soil may significantly contribute to the decrease of the co2 emission and thus to the control of the greenhouse effect since carbon atoms in bc molecules are strongly linked to each other they are resistant to microbial attacks and decomposition mineralization of the feedstock such phenomenon is contrary to the processes that drive carbon conversion in most of the organic substances e g in hummus where carbon undergoes mineralization in soil very quickly usually within 1 5 years jining et al 2014 and is then emitted as co2 back to the atmosphere the bc is resistant to microbes and thus it is characterized by a very high potential to stabilize and store carbon in soil and cheaply remove the co2 from air and sequestrate carbon outside of the atmosphere recent radiological studies confirm that bc derived from forest fires some 10 000 years ago still remains in soil lehman and joseph 2009 other investigations carried out on australian savanna indicated that the average time of bc residence in soil is between 1000 and 2000 years mclaren 2012 the decomposition time for the bc from forest burning in western canada is of similar order as the half decay time of some radioactive elements and is estimated at over 6000 years mclaren 2012 the half life time of the bcs derived from self ignition of some grasslands in russia or savannas in zimbabwe mclaren 2012 is significantly shorter estimated at hundreds of years but it is believed that the shortening of the biochar residence time in those regions is due to intensive soil erosion rather than due to the acceleration of the mineralization process currently from the standpoint of permanent sequestration and storage of carbon outside earth s atmosphere the period of roughly 1000 years is assumed as sufficient as shown in table 1 the biochar contains roughly up to 90 of carbon c thus indicating that up to 0 9mg of c corresponding to 3 3mg of co2 may be captured due to the deposition of each 1mg of the biochar in soil bis 2013 kobyłecki 2014 the data for the usa indicate lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2006 that the optimum yearly biochar dose for soil in order to increase soil productivity is roughly 76mg ha which corresponds to the depositon of roughly 251mg of co2 per ha in poland the size of the agricultural land is roughly 16 2million ha and 60 8 of it are rather sandy and low quality assuming those numbers and the values similar to those given by lehmann et al lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2006 the potential for co2 deposition in polish soil is roughly 2 4billion mg of co2 since the current emission of co2 from large scale power generation facilities in poland is estimated at roughly 0 15billion mg per year the sequestration potential is enough to balance the emission for 16 years bis et al 2015 lodz declaration of bioregions 2016 2 1 biochar soil additive based on the information given in the above chapter numerous intensive studies focused on the investigation of the effect of bc addition on soil properties had been carried out bis et al 2015 ding et al 2010 galvez et al 2012 gray et al 2014 jining et al 2014 knowles et al 2011 lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2011 nelissen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 sunil and ajay 2012 tang et al 2013 troy et al 2013 usowicz et al 2014 2016 usowicz and lipiec 2017 www biochar international org the experiments indicated that soils rich in carbon are excellent basis for the cultivation of crops and advanced farming some more recent papers dealing with the application of the bc to soil kobyłecki 2014 mclaren 2012 report the following positive effects associated with such activity the bc increases soil fertilization in two ways the first one is associated with the improvement of the cation exchange potential and thus easier absorption of the fertilizers by the plants while the second one is the result of limited precipitation fertilizer leaching from soil due to the storage of the fertilizer inside the bc pores both ways are possible increasing the efficiency of fertilizer uptake by the plants furthermore the increase of soil ability to capture nutrients and fertilizers in the plant root zone that is achieved by the addition of a porous bc cf fig 2 may in many cases significantly counteract the leaching of nitrogen to rivers and water reservoirs that is a serious problem associated with intensive farming the porous structure of the bc provides excellent conditions for maintaining life and intensive reproduction of various soil microorganisms and thus the bc can be applied to recultivate various degraded soils the bc may significantly improve water retention of soils as well as may neutralize soil acidity by providing the conditions for ph increase the bc may also significantly reduce any uncontrolled release of ch4 and n2o from the processes of natural decay in soils both gases are greenhouse gases much more harmful than co2 2 2 biochar for counteracting the drought due to its numerous advantages such as the ability to adsorb and retain water cf fig 3 the bc seems to be a desirable soil component in many locations the bc ability to capture water results from its high porosity and large surface area due to its porous structure various nutrients agrochemicals or phosphorus containing compounds may also be adsorbed by bc particles and retained for plant benefits in the case the biochar is added to soil the plants growing on biochar containing soils are therefore healthier and the fertilizers leaching from such soils are limited in order to counteract draughts such as the severe drought of 2014 gray et al 2014 the state of california has proposed various grants and subsidies to farmers to improve the water supply and consumption unfortunately the policy only addressed challenges associated with more efficient supplies of the reduced water allocations to the fields better management of the water resources on the fields is of similar importance and it may only be addressed by the addition of some soil supplements like e g compost or biochar the compost is helpful but unfortunately it must be practically reapplied every year an economic return analysis indicates that the addition of the bc to soil as a drought proofing measure would pay itself back rather quickly the large scale implementation of the bc could thus help to save california s agriculture the costs of bc application over time will likely be comparable to the costs of the upgrading of the irrigation systems without the bc just a more efficient water delivery system may not be enough to compensate for the reduced water allocations both nowadays as well as in the future due to its high porosity the bc may be efficiently used to adsorb or desorb water and thus may act as a moisture buffer e g for composting furthermore the bc can also effectively reduce bad odours and counteract the loss of nitrogen compounds for instance the composting of the poultry litter with a 20 addition of the bc could reduce the emission of ammonia by over 60 and the total nitrogen losses by roughy 50 3 biochar production at the czestochowa university of technology as briefly mentioned in the second paragraph the bc is obtained by thermal treatment of fine biomass particles or biomass waste in oxygen free atmospheres at least at 280 300 c this temperature range is the beginning of thermal decomposition of organic substance in the feedstock as a result one obtains gaseous products and the solid residue the bc the gaseous products may contain both condensable components such as water light hydrocarbons oil or tars and non condensable gases including carbon monoxide co methane ch4 carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 the process of thermochemical decomposition carried out in order to obtain mostly carbon as the product residue is called the carbonization baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 and the process of wood conversion to make charcoal can be given as an example here the thermochemical conversion focused primarily on the production of gas is called gasification while the term pyrolysis is used to describe the conversion process leading to the production of gas liquid and solid products from the feedstock typical parameters for pyrolysis are temperatures between 400 and 600 c and pressures of roughly 1 5bar efficient pyrolysis is quite expensive since it requires the organic substance to be dry before it is being fed into the reaction chamber usually may contain 10 moisture the practical and continuous implementation of pyrolysis is quite complicated since it requires to overcome numerous technical difficulties such as e g the condensation of bio oils or their separation from tar the tar related problems are also crucial for practical implementation of the gasification processes gaseous biomass tar compounds may react with each other under inert conditions thermal cracking or may react with volatile gas components such as h2 h2o and co2 gasification high rates of thermal cracking require high temperature of an order of 1200 c or higher depending on the residence time at that temperature in order to provide the conditions for breaking down enough tars so that the remaining gas can be used for catalytic synthesis or can be transported without any problems to the downstream devices such as a gas engine or gas turbine authors own experiences with biomass tars as well as the data from other researchers indicate that during pyrolysis or gasification of the biomass the tars tend to condense and then gradually carbonize or polymerize at roughly 200 400 c those reactions initially produce a sticky dark brown or black syrup and then after sufficiently longer reaction time a brittle and shiny carbon as a result the sticky or solid deposits block completely the tubs of the biomass processing plant taking the above problems into consideration the authors have chosen another way to realize efficiently and continuously the process of biomass carbonization the idea described in the patent document bis and gajewski 1994 is focused on the elimination of difficult extraction of the bio oils from the pyrolytic gas by simply burning the gaseous and liquid products in a centrifugal combustion chamber directly adjacent to the process retort such approach not only eliminates the above described problems and the blockage of the gas pipelines but also allows to minimize the heat losses according to the idea the carbonization reactor may be oriented either horizontally or vertically a view of an example vertical prototype reactor is shown in fig 4 such technique to produce the biochar can be applied not only to the fine biomass containing materials but also to its mixtures with other substances such as e g waste or coal co thermolysis of crushed biomass with coal allows to produce new type of smokeless fuels well suited for the use in small municipal utilities as a powerful weapon to combat smog episodes more on that type of fuel will be discussed in some later sections of this paper depending on the type of processed biomass or coal wood chips crushed straw vegetable residues digestive waste spent mushroom compost poultry liters swine manure coal tailings or any of their mixtures etc as well as their initial moisture content significant amount of heat could be taken over from reactor s hot exhaust gases fig 5 shows the energy content in the bc and the hot flue gas during thermal processing of the biomass the results indicate that the energy splitting is very much depended on the initial moisture content of the feedstock the blue area in the right corresponds to the most commonly available biomass as received state the line representing the energy content in the bc clearly indicates positive effects of biomass valorization the process is particularly recommended for very wet feedstock such as e g biomass waste the authors have adopted the term autothermal valorization of biofuels avb to describe such valorization and carbonization of the biomass fig 6 shows the relationship between the heat content in hot exhaust gases from the avb reactor operated with a maximum bc yield i e the case when the volatile content in the bc vm 0 the relationship as well as the curves shown in fig 5 indicate that the upper feedstock moisture cannot exceed roughly 60 70 to enable to operate the reactor in an autothermal carbonization mode since the temperatures of the hot flue gases from the avb combustion chamber are roughly at 700 900 c baishali 2014 bis and gajewski 1994 kobyłecki 2014 the gas may be quite easily cooled to 140 160 c in steam or water heat recovery boilers and the recovered heat may be then effectively used to produce electricity heat or chill in a model circular bioregion cb facility cf fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the avb reactor as a key component of the cb plant and may become a kind of nucleus or heart of the cb facility 4 some chosen applications of the biochar in poland the technologies of bc production as well as the properties and possible applications of the bc have been investigated at the department of energy engineering of the czestochowa university of technology dee czut since 2001 bis and gajewski 1994 bis et al 2015 kobyłecki 2014 as a result numerous technical or practical solutions have appeared some of the most important ones are briefly outlined below 4 1 low emission smokeless biocomposite fuel independently from the issues associated with co2 emission the conversion of energy from coal is also accompanied by the emission of other toxic substances similar process occurs during the combustion of other solid fuels including various types of biomass in the latter case however the co2 emissions are zero since it is assumed that the carbon emitted during biomass combustion equals with the amount of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis the need to reduce the emission of co2 is mainly the consequence of the implementation of a consistent eu climate policy while the urgent need to reduce the emissions of pollutants from solid fuel combustion plants is an important matter for the health of people living nearby in many eu countries e g in the uk numerous regions areas and zones are regulated by law that prohibits the emission of any smoke except the combustion of authorized fuels especially smokeless fuels in appropriate combustors burners boilers or ovens unauthorized fuels including wood may only be burnt in some specially adapted devices commonly used smokeless fuels are those combustible substances that burn without a visible smoke according to the wikipedia the smoke is a colloidal system in which the colloidal particles are fine solids and the dispersion medium is gas referring this definition to the combustion of fuels the smoke may be defined as a gaseous suspension containing very fine particulates alongside fog the smoke is also a form of aerosol and it is the most common variant of the gasohol in urbanized areas the smoke and fog may form smog the smoke is mainly associated with the combustion of solid fuels because gaseous fuels do not contain any solid substances the liquids also do not contain any solid substances but inadequate organization of their combustion may lead to the formation of soot although smokeless fuels do not emit solid particles during their combustion it should be kept in mind that various gaseous substances including poisonous ones like e g co may often be formed as result of secondary combustion reactions among the commonly used solid fuels the anthracite is treated as a standard smokeless fuel but it is important to remember that the consequence of its combustion is quite high emission of the greenhouse co2 gas many researchers blame the emission of fine colloidal inorganic particles particulate matter pm as responsible for the formation of smoke the emission of pm significantly affects the deterioration of human health and environment quality since the pm may contain variety of elements and chemically aggressive substances including cancerogenics e g pahs ultrafine pms are also responsible for the initialization of deposit formation and the corrosion of boiler heat transfer surfaces the reason that smokeless fuels do not emit particulates during their combustion is associated with physical and chemical composition of those fuels anthracite for example is treated as a low pollutant emitter and contains up to 98 of carbon the fuel does not emit gaseous tars at temperatures lower than its ignition temperature the emission of vapors at temperatures lower than fuel s ignition temperature depends on fuel composition apart from anthracite four main components can be distinguished in any solid fuel i e moisture m volatile matter vm fixed carbon fc and ash a the combustible volatiles vms formed during fuel heating and thermal decomposition may contain a wide range of components including hydrocarbons and hetero compounds of oxygen nitrogen and sulfur those compounds burn in the vicinity of fuel particles higher carbonates e g geologically older coals contain more inflammable hydrocarbons with higher ignition temperature longer combustion times and higher values of the combustion heat on the other hand the volatile components in young coals as well as in biomass contain more aliphatic and less aromatic alcohols consequently the burning of such fuels is shorter but more intensive the fixed carbon in those fuels is mainly elemental carbon and their composition is very similar to anthracite the moisture m is physically and chemically related to fuel type while the ash a is composed of a variety of solid minerals or impurities e g sand igneous rock metal salts non metals heavy metals etc the m and a form together a ballast that does not participate in the combustion process but affects its chemical and thermal results by hindering the diffusion of oxygen to the reaction surface the ballast also absorbs heat generated during combustion and if the process temperature is sufficiently high some of the ballast substances may melt and react with each other from this point of view solid fuels including biomass can be treated as heterogeneous mixtures of gaseous fuels and carbon with more or less impurities it should be noted that such a heterogeneous mixture appears only as a result of fuel thermal treatment e g pyrolysis starts in boiler furnace the increase of the vm content in fuels characterized by low lhv brings about the decrease of the fc contribution and thus the reduction of the combustion time the fuel will burn faster and the flame will be longer thus increasing the rate of heat transfer by radiation this feature is very important to achieve the maximum volumetric heat load in the furnace on the other hand in the case of small boilers including the central heating units such fuel feature causes that the fuels become less useful less volatiles lead to a prolonged combustion process that is largely based on relatively slow reactions between the fc and oxygen too low volatile content in the fuel can be linked to more unburned carbon in the ash while the use of fuels with high vm content e g higher than required by technological solution will result with increased exhaust loss and the formation of many harmful substances including particulates pm10 soot aerosols etc since those particles are mainly responsible for the formation of smoke it becomes obvious why the composition of authorized and smokeless fuels in the uk is only limited to a small group of fuels and energetic coals especially flame coals and the biomass is not included in that group fine particulates are adsorbed on well developed surface of the burning coal or biomass especially when significant amount of steam molecules with dissolved alkali and tar is present in the flue gases direct combustion of raw biomass is thus not recommended both because of the uncontrolled emission of pollutants as well as due to low density and low calorific value of the biomass that is also significantly degraded by its high moisture content depending on the type of biomass and the operating conditions the bc yields are between 25 and 40 over 70 of the alkaline compounds mainly na and k as well as mg ca and p remain in the bc the presence of phosphorus the element of life is crucial from the point of view of the application of bc as soil additive or soil improver since almost no sulfur and less than 20 of the initial chlorine is contained in the bc and significant reduction of the pm1 emission during the combustion occurs the bc becomes a truly clean fuel low emission of particulate matter is the result of the removal of volatile compounds and chlorine during the carbonization of the biomass the above results confirm previous statements that the combustion of inorganic containing volatile components is the dominant process during the combustion of biomass and is mainly responsible for the emission of pm1 and pm2 5 the properties of the bc and the investigation on thermal treatment of biomass have forced the authors to develop in cooperation with some polish companies the biocomposite fuel bcf production technology bis 2013 the bcf is formed from various bcs and hard coal stocks with appropriate additives and is produced by simultaneous heating co thermolysis of the mixture of biomass coal tailings and culms some preliminary results shown in figs 8 and 9 are very promising particularly in terms of reducing the emissions of co nox so2 and pm the new smokeless fuel that meets the above criteria can be successfully used in smoke free zones the fuel is made up of a mixture of coal and biomass with suitable additives the mixture is then subjected to thermolysis and some beneficial changes of the biomass and coal occur during the process both in terms of their chemical composition and morphology upon leaving the reactor the thermally transformed mixture is briquetted or pelletized with the addition of a special binder fig 8 the research results indicated that simultaneous thermolysis of coal and biomass brings about a synergy effect with respect to product yield and quality as well as the amount and composition of the flue gases some basic parameters of an example bcf are summarized in table 2 the combustion of the bcf brings about no emission of smoke and harmful components because the limited amount of bcf volatiles are burned inside pores of the heated coke thus providing the conditions for the most effective and cleanest flameless combustion to occur cf fig 9 the emission of some basic flue gas components as well as boiler efficiency during the combustion of coal and the bcf are shown in table 3 the comparison of the data clearly indicates lower emission of pollutants in the case of bcf combustion it should also be stressed that combustion of the bcf brings about an additional ecological effect namely at least 30 lower emissions of co2 4 2 biochar as soil improver the porous structure of the bc is excellent for its application as a soil additive the bc added to soil reduces soil density and positively affects the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of soil usowicz et al 2014 2016 the bc may be used in agriculture as organic fertilizer that is decomposed for a very long time and may thus positively affect soil fertility as well as the amount of biogenic components and soil physical biological and water properties galvez et al 2012 lehmann et al 2011 mohan et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 the bc also participates in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle the research results indicated that addition of the bc brings about the decrease of the nitrification level i e the decrease of nh3 oxidization moreover it influences the increase of the number of ammonification bacteria and reduces the emission of n2o due to the stimulation of nitrogen immobilization zheng et al 2013 according to the research carried out by ding et al ding et al 2010 the application of some 0 5 of bc to the upper soil layer causes the decrease of nh4 leaching by 15 2 due to the adsorption of ammonia ions on the surface of the bc zheng et al 2013 the reduced washing out of no3 from soil after the application of bc fertilization was also reported by knowles et al 2011 positive effect of the bc addition on nitrogen management was also proven in the research carried out by nelissen et al 2014 where the authors reported the reduction of n2o emission by 52 84 and the emission of no by 47 67 a positive bc to soil effect may also be observed by the variation of soil biological properties since the bc influences the quality and quantity of soil microflora galvez et al 2012 nelissen et al 2014 tang et al 2013 www biochar international org due to large specific surface and porous structure of the bc see fig 2 suitable living and development conditions for the soil microflora are created galvez et al 2012 sunil and ajay 2012 in the research carried out by lehmann et al 2011 considerable increase of microbiological activity after the implementation of bc fertilization was reported the positive effect was associated with the increase of the number of microorganisms as well as the increase of the biodiversity of soil microflora that may also additionally influence the stability of the ecosystem and protect the system against any pathogenic microorganisms the increased microbiological activities result in higher rate of mineralization and thus bring about the increase of nutrient bioavailability for the plants sunil and ajay 2012 physical and chemical properties of the bc such as a well developed specific surface area and porosity positively affect not only the biological or microbiological properties of the soil but also improve its chemical properties and water retention the investigation carried out by the authors indicated that depending on the origin and particle size of the bc its water sorption capacity may reach even 0 85kg of h2o per each kg of bc fig 10 through the increased water retention the addition of bc to soil improves water air relations and brings about the decrease of leaching of the biogenic components from soil the bc acts as a filter that prolongates the retention time for water solutions sunil and ajay 2012 zheng et al 2013 moreover the addition of the bc brings about the increase of soil ph and the increase of total cation exchange capacity cec and thus better capture of nutrients by plants galvez et al 2012 nelissen et al 2014 tang et al 2013 www biochar international org to confirm the above mentioned positive effects of the application of the bc as soil additive the authors carried out some simple field research on soil of class iv in southern poland two experimental groups of fields were separated from regular tillage area in 2013 both groups were subdivided into five sections 2m 2m each i e one reference section without the addition of bc three sections were the bc was added in quantities of 3kg m2 7 5kg m2 and 10kg m2 and one section where the bc was mixed up with cattle slurry manure csm in proportion 1 1 by weight to compensate the characteristic odor of the slurry and the mixture was then applied at 7 5kg of bc m2 in all the test fields the bc was mixed up with soil for a depth of roughly 25cm maize and miscanthus were planted on the fields the results are shown in figs 11 14 in all cases positive effects of the bc addition can be seen 4 3 biochar addition to control soil ph as it is commonly known the ph of soil is one of the basic factors that affect soil fertility and thus the yield of cultivated plants the effect of ph on soil chemical properties is multidirectional namely it prevents the leaching of toxic aluminum counteracts the impoverishment of the soil sorption complex nutrient storage in soil and determines the availability of nutrients for plants aluminum is the third largest contributor 7 96 to earth crust it is found in numerous mineral compounds mainly aluminosilicates to become toxic to plants aluminum compounds must decompose become soluble and must penetrate to the soil section where direct contact of plant roots with aluminum occurs the decomposition of aluminum compounds and their toxicity depend on soil ph as the ph decreases the number of h ions being the natural activator of the dissolution processes for aluminum compounds increase depending on the concentration of those h ions the dissolution of the aluminum compounds may be gradual with a slow decrease of the ph of soil solution or rapid with a very fast acidification of soil it is assumed that the decrease of ph by one unit results in a 1000 fold increase of the concentration of toxic aluminum al3 cations the content of such aluminum cations become revealed in the soil solution already at ph of 5 8 above that value the aluminum compounds in soil are insoluble and thus are non toxic for the plants the content of al3 cations rapidly increases below ph 4 7 mineral components cations are essential for life and are bound in soil by a negatively charged soil sorption complex which is made up of mineral particles clay minerals and caries in temperate soils the sorption complex is to a large extent over 80 filled with alkaline cations like calcium magnesium or potassium i e the basic nutrients for plants the role of calcium in relation to other basic cations is superior the remaining part of the soil sorption complex consists of the so called acidic cations hydrogen h and aluminum al3 acidification of soil leads to the replacement of the basic cations with acidic cations that are not nutrients for the plants as a result alkaline cations mainly calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are eluted from the topsoil and thus the crop plants lose the necessary nutrient ingredients at the same time it has to be emphasized that acidic environment provide unwanted conditions for the sorption complex and also reduce the sorption capacity of the soil thus leading to its degradation the degradation of soil also results in a significant decrease of its water content the nutrients from soil are taken up by plant roots from aqueous solutions the solubility of nutrients and hence their availability to plants depend to a large extent on soil ph and vary for individual components one of the crucial nutrients is phosphorus mainly present in soil in the form of aluminum iron calcium or magnesium phosphates all characterized by generally poor solubility the transitions of phosphorous containing compounds into soluble or insoluble forms are continuously occurring in soil and are very much affected by soil ph the ph has also a direct impact on the activity of soil microorganisms since different groups have various requirements for optimal ph in the acidic environment for instance the mushrooms are intensively grown up however the vast majority of microflora species prefer neutral ph therefore the excess of acidic cations in soil disturbs a number of biological processes and has a negative effect on nutrient uptake and consequently on the crop yield it is usually agreed that acidic soils are characterized by significant decrease of microorganism activity the microorganisms play an important role since they decompose plant residues the reduction of the release of minerals from dead plants and natural fertilizers in soil oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrates worse supply of nitrogen to crops and as a consequence their slower growth capture atmospheric nitrogen the majority of bacteria living in symbiosis with higher plants are the nitrobacter thus worsening the nitrogen supply to crops and bringing about lower yield the ph of the soil samples taken from authors own experimental test fields is shown in fig 15 it should be emphasized that neither fertilizer nor lime were added to soil during field preparation and plant growth the data clearly indicate positive effect of the addition of bc on soil ph the ph increase is consistent with the above remarks and confirms the increase of soil fertility cf figs 11 14 4 4 biochar for co2 sequestration the bc plays also an important role in the regulation of the dynamics and circulation of c and n galvez et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 and may thus affect the increase of organic matter content in soil high content of stable fraction of organic carbon is desirable and thus the bc may take part in the biosequestration of carbon in soils mohan et al 2014 as a reservoir of quite slowly mineralized carbon the bc becomes a powerful tool to decrease the greenhouse effect brought about by excessive emission of co2 mohan et al 2014 taking into account that the average time mean residence time mrt for bc decomposition in soil is estimated at approx 1300 4000 years sunil and ajay 2012 one may assume that by the application of the bc to agricultural fields one may cause permanent deposition of some 428gt of c on earth sunil and ajay 2012 some small content of more labile fractions of the bc may undergo faster decomposition thus increasing the amount of organic matter in soil soil organic matter som and the amount of mineralized nutrients available for the plants sunil and ajay 2012 the above remarks confirm the results of the investigations of c content in soil samples taken from authors experimental fields the results are summarized in fig 16 the carbon content in soil is stable and roughly corresponds to the amount of the added bc except for the fields where the biochar cattle manure mixtures were added in both test field groups similar differences in the carbon content in soil are observed 5 summary the description of biochar bc properties as well as its application and production technology that have been presented and discussed in the current paper summarizes some basic information on the subject and presents a promising role the bc can play in the bioeconomy concept development to prevent further climate change increase carbon sequestration potential and soil ammetioration potential for food production it in no way limit other perspectives and possibilities of any sophisticated bc manufacturing and applications e g in polygeneration systems where electricity heat chill and at least one additional commercial product are produced the information and opinion contained in this paper are essentially related to two issues associated with 1 the use of bc as soil quality improver and a tool to sequestrate carbon dioxide and 2 the development of a technology to produce bcf from bc coal and additives sorbents and binders due to the requirements associated with manuscript size the perspective application of the bc as fuel in direct carbon fuel cells dcfcs kacprzak et al 2014 and integration of the thermolysis reactor with digestive reactor for the production of bc from digestate residue dr have been omitted the dcfcs allow to generate electricity with very high efficiency and no emission of pollutants the carbonization of the dr allows to solve the problem associated with the use of solid anaerobic digestate in agriculture the authors do hope however that the information given in the present paper will become helpful to understand better the philosophy of biochar production and application as a potential tool to combat climate changes emission of pollutants and droughts the development of the bc idea in poland is the result of polish scientific and technological activities and the cooperation between science and industry the growing international network of various institutions dealing with bc confirm huge potential of the biochar for its promising use in agriculture technology and everyday life

1153,the biochar is a solid residue obtained from thermolysis pyrolysis of various biomass feedstock including lignocellulosic waste the issues associated with the production and application or usage of the biochar have been dynamically developed throughout the world in recent years and the application of biochar in soils has been widely discussed as a possible and simple way to sequestrate carbon and improve soil s chemical and physical properties for better plant growth the present paper deals with an overview of the currently available knowledge on the above subject and is widely supported by authors own research results the results of authors investigation on biochar application to polish soils indicate that addition of biochar into soils in different proportions increase the soil carbon content ph and plant growth it is discussed that the biochar production would be an important component of circular bioregions economy and a powerful tool for clean energy conversion and atmospheric carbon sink in order to counteract climate changes keywords biochar circular bioregions thermolysis smokeless biocomposite fuels 1 introduction industrial development and increased production of goods and services as well as modern and intensive agriculture are associated with increased consumption of raw materials and energy and decreased involvement of human labor so far the production of energy as well as various goods and services has always been accompanied by the formation of waste according to the so called linear economy focused on the production of goods while the waste had been thrown away the linear economy model has thus nothing to do with sustainable development and it has recently been replaced by a circular economy approach that has emerged as a promising alternative since the circular economy does not waste resources but rather promotes better use of the raw materials in the circular economy approach a close to nature model is proposed where the amount of waste is minimized and the waste is recycled and reused based on that idea the concept of circular bioregions cb has been created in poland according to the lodz declaration the bioregions are sustainable and renewable energy systems including biorefineries and prosumer energy distribution systems that are focused on achieving a net zero energy balance with simultaneous low emission of co2 lodz declaration of bioregions 2016 the production and application of the biochar fits perfectly to the cb concept that has been briefly mentioned above the concept of cbs and more sustainable and environmentally oriented economic development becomes more and more important in the developed countries due to numerous problems associated for instance with the lack of good quality water overconsumption of artificial fertilizers by agriculture or overproduction of waste jezierska thöle et al 2016 the awareness of those problems is becoming more common also in poland where numerous reports kędzior and zawadzki 2017 krogulec 2018 kundzewicz et al 2017 usowicz and lipiec 2017 provide data that the country faces problems with soil quality and draught which may become a serious problem for polish agriculture particularly in central poland where the soils are quite poor and have been facing the lack of water since several years krogulec 2018 usowicz and lipiec 2017 in the case of poland significant contribution to climate changes and worsening of water resources for agriculture is made by the power generation sector which requires significant amount of water for the electricity generation and is still based on the combustion of coal thus emitting significant amount of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas poland is therefore forced by other eu member countries to decrease the net emission of co2 and every tool or technology that may help to counteract climate changes and improve country s poor water resources is worth developing an interesting solution for reaching those goals may be provided by the use of carbonized biomass the biochar bc the bc is carbon rich solid produced due to thermal treatment thermolysis or pyrolysis of biomass in the absence of oxygen antal and grønli 2003 industrial production of the biochar has recently become an important part of the renewable bioenergy production strategy with simultaneous removal of carbon from the atmosphere and the manufacture of environmentally beneficial products of biomass origin during thermolysis roughly 50 80 of biomass may be converted into combustible liquids and or vapors that can be then directly used for bioenergy production baishali 2014 bis and gajewski 1994 kobyłecki 2014 the remaining 20 50 of the biomass is converted into biochar i e a solid product that retains some properties of the residual feedstock and is essentially composed of amorphous carbon and crystallites of polycondensed aromatics with interspersed voids and ash baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 since the bc tends to decompose slowly in the environment it is thus considered as a promising temporal sink for atmospheric co2 baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 individual properties of the bcs depend on feedstock and pyrolysis parameters kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 by controlling those factors it is possible to create specially targeted and value added designed bcs for specific environmental applications e g as soil improvers liu et al 2013 mclaren 2012 nelissen et al 2014 heavy metal sorbents kobyłecki 2014 or sorbents for the removal of organic contaminants from water mohan et al 2014 as briefly presented above the bc offers significant environmental benefits and its properties depend on the composition of original biomass as well as the temperature and feedstock residence time in the thermolysis reactor in this paper a brief review of the biochar properties and production has been carried out and some chosen promising applications of the biochar are presented the information is supported by authors own experimental data targeted on the use of biochar in polish conditions e g as coal replacement in smokeless fuels in order to minimize the emission of co2 and particulate matter from the combustion processes or the application of the biochar as soil amendment to capture water and increase soil ph the authors also carried out some field experiments at some low quality agricultural soils in central poland i e on the area that has been facing serious water shortages since many years the authors believe that the application of biochar to low quality polish soils may be a promising way not only for the improvement of water retentiveness and soil productivity but also for the decrease of country s net emission of co2 that is currently quite high since polish power generation facilities are still to a large extend 80 based on the combustion of coal kuchler and bridge 2018 2 biochar as an alternative to carbon capture and storage scientific sources dealing with the analysis of the global carbon balance on earth report that there is a huge imbalance between the emission of carbon to the atmosphere and its absorption by all possible ways such imbalance leads to continuous increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the emission is nowadays assumed at roughly 4 1 109 mg yr kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 such huge difference between the emission and carbon absorption should put the attention of the decision makers to give the highest priority to the development and implementation of new technologies focused on efficient capture and long time storage of carbon outside earth atmosphere the classical carbon capture and storage ccs technologies are currently not very much promoted due to the lack of sufficiently proven commercial implementations of the demo plants as well as high investment and operating costs brought about by significant reduction of the efficiency of electricity generation the increased demand for electricity cannot be fulfilled exclusively by photovoltaics windmills or biomass combustion gasification plants particularly that one cannot forget about the need to increase the production of food and simultaneously to counteract the draughts and lack of water at large areas which were previously used for agriculture numerous newspapers report e g that the amount of biofuels produced from maize planted on the area similar to that of the u s would not be enough to drive all the cars in that country the authors of the current paper believe that practical implementation of the sustainable development idea should provide the world community with a low cost carbon reduction technology bearing that in mind a long time co2 sequestration by biomass processing and the production of the bc and the storage of the bc in soil seems to be particularly promising the activities associated with biochar oriented research and promotion are being patronized by numerous institutions such as e g the international biochar initiative ibi www biochar international org that is a non profit organization supporting academics politicians farmers gardeners and businessmen who deal with sustainable production and application of the bc the bc biochar also called biocarbon or biocoal is a substance having properties similar to charcoal cf fig 1 and may be produced due to pyrolysis gasification or thermolysis kobyłecki 2014 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 of various biomass feedstock such as energy crops forest waste biomass processing waste or other biomass of agricultural origin the bc is characterized not only by a more homogenous composition than the original material baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 liu et al 2013 sun et al 2014 but also by a very well developed internal pore structure cf fig 2 some example parameters of the biomass and the produced biochar are given in table 1 kobyłecki 2014 analysis of the data indicates that the biochar is almost dry and contains more carbon and ash and less volatiles than the original biomass feedstock compared with biomass the biochar is also characterized by significantly higher energy density apart from its commonly known sorption properties associated with well developed internal structure the bc is also used as renewable fuel for large scale combustion plants the fuel is characterized by high reactivity high carbon content c 80 and high heating value lhv up to 27mj kg kobyłecki 2014 recently the bc has also been considered as a potentially important solution for long term storage of carbon in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions the interest toward the application of the biochar as a co2 sequester has come out from the investigation of amazonia land and the discovery of the so called terra preta black land of the indians lehman and joseph 2009 the terra preta soil most probably originated through targeted and systematic human efforts the soil is very fertile and capable to regenerate itself and maintain its positive features for a long time the structure and properties of the terra preta strongly contrast with its surrounding and poor amazon soils although it was created by people living in the amazon basin even some 2500 years ago the terra preta soil still covers significant areas of the amazon perhaps even up to 10 of the surface it is estimated that the terra preta soil is capable to maintain its positive properties for hundreds of years since it is still able to produce extraordinary yields to make the terra preta soil the indians mixed up crushed pieces of biochar obtained from charred trees and fragments of clay pottery mud or even fish and animal debris and added the mixture to the soil thus forming a loamy mixture characterized by good sorption properties and being a good base for numerous microorganisms that enhance its fertility the kayapo indian tribe in brazil still produce terra preta like soil called terra mulata according to the researchers who have spent some time to investigate the life and customs of this tribe the creation of terra mulata farmland involves permanent slow firing or rather smoldering of plants and trees with no visible fire although the works on more detailed identification of the terra preta microorganisms are still going on this type of soil is believed to play significant role in the restoration of rainforests and the development of more sustainable farming in the amazon area in order to counteract negative effects associated with the existence of large oil palm farms that are focused on the production of biofuels due to the extraordinary fertility of the black soil being the result of its enrichment with carbon potential application of the terra preta to minimize world famine is also taken into consideration since the main and crucial constituent of the terra preta is carbon wider implementation of carbon based agriculture and the sequestration of carbon in soil may significantly contribute to the decrease of the co2 emission and thus to the control of the greenhouse effect since carbon atoms in bc molecules are strongly linked to each other they are resistant to microbial attacks and decomposition mineralization of the feedstock such phenomenon is contrary to the processes that drive carbon conversion in most of the organic substances e g in hummus where carbon undergoes mineralization in soil very quickly usually within 1 5 years jining et al 2014 and is then emitted as co2 back to the atmosphere the bc is resistant to microbes and thus it is characterized by a very high potential to stabilize and store carbon in soil and cheaply remove the co2 from air and sequestrate carbon outside of the atmosphere recent radiological studies confirm that bc derived from forest fires some 10 000 years ago still remains in soil lehman and joseph 2009 other investigations carried out on australian savanna indicated that the average time of bc residence in soil is between 1000 and 2000 years mclaren 2012 the decomposition time for the bc from forest burning in western canada is of similar order as the half decay time of some radioactive elements and is estimated at over 6000 years mclaren 2012 the half life time of the bcs derived from self ignition of some grasslands in russia or savannas in zimbabwe mclaren 2012 is significantly shorter estimated at hundreds of years but it is believed that the shortening of the biochar residence time in those regions is due to intensive soil erosion rather than due to the acceleration of the mineralization process currently from the standpoint of permanent sequestration and storage of carbon outside earth s atmosphere the period of roughly 1000 years is assumed as sufficient as shown in table 1 the biochar contains roughly up to 90 of carbon c thus indicating that up to 0 9mg of c corresponding to 3 3mg of co2 may be captured due to the deposition of each 1mg of the biochar in soil bis 2013 kobyłecki 2014 the data for the usa indicate lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2006 that the optimum yearly biochar dose for soil in order to increase soil productivity is roughly 76mg ha which corresponds to the depositon of roughly 251mg of co2 per ha in poland the size of the agricultural land is roughly 16 2million ha and 60 8 of it are rather sandy and low quality assuming those numbers and the values similar to those given by lehmann et al lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2006 the potential for co2 deposition in polish soil is roughly 2 4billion mg of co2 since the current emission of co2 from large scale power generation facilities in poland is estimated at roughly 0 15billion mg per year the sequestration potential is enough to balance the emission for 16 years bis et al 2015 lodz declaration of bioregions 2016 2 1 biochar soil additive based on the information given in the above chapter numerous intensive studies focused on the investigation of the effect of bc addition on soil properties had been carried out bis et al 2015 ding et al 2010 galvez et al 2012 gray et al 2014 jining et al 2014 knowles et al 2011 lehman and joseph 2009 lehmann et al 2011 nelissen et al 2014 sun et al 2014 sunil and ajay 2012 tang et al 2013 troy et al 2013 usowicz et al 2014 2016 usowicz and lipiec 2017 www biochar international org the experiments indicated that soils rich in carbon are excellent basis for the cultivation of crops and advanced farming some more recent papers dealing with the application of the bc to soil kobyłecki 2014 mclaren 2012 report the following positive effects associated with such activity the bc increases soil fertilization in two ways the first one is associated with the improvement of the cation exchange potential and thus easier absorption of the fertilizers by the plants while the second one is the result of limited precipitation fertilizer leaching from soil due to the storage of the fertilizer inside the bc pores both ways are possible increasing the efficiency of fertilizer uptake by the plants furthermore the increase of soil ability to capture nutrients and fertilizers in the plant root zone that is achieved by the addition of a porous bc cf fig 2 may in many cases significantly counteract the leaching of nitrogen to rivers and water reservoirs that is a serious problem associated with intensive farming the porous structure of the bc provides excellent conditions for maintaining life and intensive reproduction of various soil microorganisms and thus the bc can be applied to recultivate various degraded soils the bc may significantly improve water retention of soils as well as may neutralize soil acidity by providing the conditions for ph increase the bc may also significantly reduce any uncontrolled release of ch4 and n2o from the processes of natural decay in soils both gases are greenhouse gases much more harmful than co2 2 2 biochar for counteracting the drought due to its numerous advantages such as the ability to adsorb and retain water cf fig 3 the bc seems to be a desirable soil component in many locations the bc ability to capture water results from its high porosity and large surface area due to its porous structure various nutrients agrochemicals or phosphorus containing compounds may also be adsorbed by bc particles and retained for plant benefits in the case the biochar is added to soil the plants growing on biochar containing soils are therefore healthier and the fertilizers leaching from such soils are limited in order to counteract draughts such as the severe drought of 2014 gray et al 2014 the state of california has proposed various grants and subsidies to farmers to improve the water supply and consumption unfortunately the policy only addressed challenges associated with more efficient supplies of the reduced water allocations to the fields better management of the water resources on the fields is of similar importance and it may only be addressed by the addition of some soil supplements like e g compost or biochar the compost is helpful but unfortunately it must be practically reapplied every year an economic return analysis indicates that the addition of the bc to soil as a drought proofing measure would pay itself back rather quickly the large scale implementation of the bc could thus help to save california s agriculture the costs of bc application over time will likely be comparable to the costs of the upgrading of the irrigation systems without the bc just a more efficient water delivery system may not be enough to compensate for the reduced water allocations both nowadays as well as in the future due to its high porosity the bc may be efficiently used to adsorb or desorb water and thus may act as a moisture buffer e g for composting furthermore the bc can also effectively reduce bad odours and counteract the loss of nitrogen compounds for instance the composting of the poultry litter with a 20 addition of the bc could reduce the emission of ammonia by over 60 and the total nitrogen losses by roughy 50 3 biochar production at the czestochowa university of technology as briefly mentioned in the second paragraph the bc is obtained by thermal treatment of fine biomass particles or biomass waste in oxygen free atmospheres at least at 280 300 c this temperature range is the beginning of thermal decomposition of organic substance in the feedstock as a result one obtains gaseous products and the solid residue the bc the gaseous products may contain both condensable components such as water light hydrocarbons oil or tars and non condensable gases including carbon monoxide co methane ch4 carbon dioxide co2 and hydrogen h2 the process of thermochemical decomposition carried out in order to obtain mostly carbon as the product residue is called the carbonization baishali 2014 kobyłecki 2014 lehman and joseph 2009 and the process of wood conversion to make charcoal can be given as an example here the thermochemical conversion focused primarily on the production of gas is called gasification while the term pyrolysis is used to describe the conversion process leading to the production of gas liquid and solid products from the feedstock typical parameters for pyrolysis are temperatures between 400 and 600 c and pressures of roughly 1 5bar efficient pyrolysis is quite expensive since it requires the organic substance to be dry before it is being fed into the reaction chamber usually may contain 10 moisture the practical and continuous implementation of pyrolysis is quite complicated since it requires to overcome numerous technical difficulties such as e g the condensation of bio oils or their separation from tar the tar related problems are also crucial for practical implementation of the gasification processes gaseous biomass tar compounds may react with each other under inert conditions thermal cracking or may react with volatile gas components such as h2 h2o and co2 gasification high rates of thermal cracking require high temperature of an order of 1200 c or higher depending on the residence time at that temperature in order to provide the conditions for breaking down enough tars so that the remaining gas can be used for catalytic synthesis or can be transported without any problems to the downstream devices such as a gas engine or gas turbine authors own experiences with biomass tars as well as the data from other researchers indicate that during pyrolysis or gasification of the biomass the tars tend to condense and then gradually carbonize or polymerize at roughly 200 400 c those reactions initially produce a sticky dark brown or black syrup and then after sufficiently longer reaction time a brittle and shiny carbon as a result the sticky or solid deposits block completely the tubs of the biomass processing plant taking the above problems into consideration the authors have chosen another way to realize efficiently and continuously the process of biomass carbonization the idea described in the patent document bis and gajewski 1994 is focused on the elimination of difficult extraction of the bio oils from the pyrolytic gas by simply burning the gaseous and liquid products in a centrifugal combustion chamber directly adjacent to the process retort such approach not only eliminates the above described problems and the blockage of the gas pipelines but also allows to minimize the heat losses according to the idea the carbonization reactor may be oriented either horizontally or vertically a view of an example vertical prototype reactor is shown in fig 4 such technique to produce the biochar can be applied not only to the fine biomass containing materials but also to its mixtures with other substances such as e g waste or coal co thermolysis of crushed biomass with coal allows to produce new type of smokeless fuels well suited for the use in small municipal utilities as a powerful weapon to combat smog episodes more on that type of fuel will be discussed in some later sections of this paper depending on the type of processed biomass or coal wood chips crushed straw vegetable residues digestive waste spent mushroom compost poultry liters swine manure coal tailings or any of their mixtures etc as well as their initial moisture content significant amount of heat could be taken over from reactor s hot exhaust gases fig 5 shows the energy content in the bc and the hot flue gas during thermal processing of the biomass the results indicate that the energy splitting is very much depended on the initial moisture content of the feedstock the blue area in the right corresponds to the most commonly available biomass as received state the line representing the energy content in the bc clearly indicates positive effects of biomass valorization the process is particularly recommended for very wet feedstock such as e g biomass waste the authors have adopted the term autothermal valorization of biofuels avb to describe such valorization and carbonization of the biomass fig 6 shows the relationship between the heat content in hot exhaust gases from the avb reactor operated with a maximum bc yield i e the case when the volatile content in the bc vm 0 the relationship as well as the curves shown in fig 5 indicate that the upper feedstock moisture cannot exceed roughly 60 70 to enable to operate the reactor in an autothermal carbonization mode since the temperatures of the hot flue gases from the avb combustion chamber are roughly at 700 900 c baishali 2014 bis and gajewski 1994 kobyłecki 2014 the gas may be quite easily cooled to 140 160 c in steam or water heat recovery boilers and the recovered heat may be then effectively used to produce electricity heat or chill in a model circular bioregion cb facility cf fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the avb reactor as a key component of the cb plant and may become a kind of nucleus or heart of the cb facility 4 some chosen applications of the biochar in poland the technologies of bc production as well as the properties and possible applications of the bc have been investigated at the department of energy engineering of the czestochowa university of technology dee czut since 2001 bis and gajewski 1994 bis et al 2015 kobyłecki 2014 as a result numerous technical or practical solutions have appeared some of the most important ones are briefly outlined below 4 1 low emission smokeless biocomposite fuel independently from the issues associated with co2 emission the conversion of energy from coal is also accompanied by the emission of other toxic substances similar process occurs during the combustion of other solid fuels including various types of biomass in the latter case however the co2 emissions are zero since it is assumed that the carbon emitted during biomass combustion equals with the amount of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis the need to reduce the emission of co2 is mainly the consequence of the implementation of a consistent eu climate policy while the urgent need to reduce the emissions of pollutants from solid fuel combustion plants is an important matter for the health of people living nearby in many eu countries e g in the uk numerous regions areas and zones are regulated by law that prohibits the emission of any smoke except the combustion of authorized fuels especially smokeless fuels in appropriate combustors burners boilers or ovens unauthorized fuels including wood may only be burnt in some specially adapted devices commonly used smokeless fuels are those combustible substances that burn without a visible smoke according to the wikipedia the smoke is a colloidal system in which the colloidal particles are fine solids and the dispersion medium is gas referring this definition to the combustion of fuels the smoke may be defined as a gaseous suspension containing very fine particulates alongside fog the smoke is also a form of aerosol and it is the most common variant of the gasohol in urbanized areas the smoke and fog may form smog the smoke is mainly associated with the combustion of solid fuels because gaseous fuels do not contain any solid substances the liquids also do not contain any solid substances but inadequate organization of their combustion may lead to the formation of soot although smokeless fuels do not emit solid particles during their combustion it should be kept in mind that various gaseous substances including poisonous ones like e g co may often be formed as result of secondary combustion reactions among the commonly used solid fuels the anthracite is treated as a standard smokeless fuel but it is important to remember that the consequence of its combustion is quite high emission of the greenhouse co2 gas many researchers blame the emission of fine colloidal inorganic particles particulate matter pm as responsible for the formation of smoke the emission of pm significantly affects the deterioration of human health and environment quality since the pm may contain variety of elements and chemically aggressive substances including cancerogenics e g pahs ultrafine pms are also responsible for the initialization of deposit formation and the corrosion of boiler heat transfer surfaces the reason that smokeless fuels do not emit particulates during their combustion is associated with physical and chemical composition of those fuels anthracite for example is treated as a low pollutant emitter and contains up to 98 of carbon the fuel does not emit gaseous tars at temperatures lower than its ignition temperature the emission of vapors at temperatures lower than fuel s ignition temperature depends on fuel composition apart from anthracite four main components can be distinguished in any solid fuel i e moisture m volatile matter vm fixed carbon fc and ash a the combustible volatiles vms formed during fuel heating and thermal decomposition may contain a wide range of components including hydrocarbons and hetero compounds of oxygen nitrogen and sulfur those compounds burn in the vicinity of fuel particles higher carbonates e g geologically older coals contain more inflammable hydrocarbons with higher ignition temperature longer combustion times and higher values of the combustion heat on the other hand the volatile components in young coals as well as in biomass contain more aliphatic and less aromatic alcohols consequently the burning of such fuels is shorter but more intensive the fixed carbon in those fuels is mainly elemental carbon and their composition is very similar to anthracite the moisture m is physically and chemically related to fuel type while the ash a is composed of a variety of solid minerals or impurities e g sand igneous rock metal salts non metals heavy metals etc the m and a form together a ballast that does not participate in the combustion process but affects its chemical and thermal results by hindering the diffusion of oxygen to the reaction surface the ballast also absorbs heat generated during combustion and if the process temperature is sufficiently high some of the ballast substances may melt and react with each other from this point of view solid fuels including biomass can be treated as heterogeneous mixtures of gaseous fuels and carbon with more or less impurities it should be noted that such a heterogeneous mixture appears only as a result of fuel thermal treatment e g pyrolysis starts in boiler furnace the increase of the vm content in fuels characterized by low lhv brings about the decrease of the fc contribution and thus the reduction of the combustion time the fuel will burn faster and the flame will be longer thus increasing the rate of heat transfer by radiation this feature is very important to achieve the maximum volumetric heat load in the furnace on the other hand in the case of small boilers including the central heating units such fuel feature causes that the fuels become less useful less volatiles lead to a prolonged combustion process that is largely based on relatively slow reactions between the fc and oxygen too low volatile content in the fuel can be linked to more unburned carbon in the ash while the use of fuels with high vm content e g higher than required by technological solution will result with increased exhaust loss and the formation of many harmful substances including particulates pm10 soot aerosols etc since those particles are mainly responsible for the formation of smoke it becomes obvious why the composition of authorized and smokeless fuels in the uk is only limited to a small group of fuels and energetic coals especially flame coals and the biomass is not included in that group fine particulates are adsorbed on well developed surface of the burning coal or biomass especially when significant amount of steam molecules with dissolved alkali and tar is present in the flue gases direct combustion of raw biomass is thus not recommended both because of the uncontrolled emission of pollutants as well as due to low density and low calorific value of the biomass that is also significantly degraded by its high moisture content depending on the type of biomass and the operating conditions the bc yields are between 25 and 40 over 70 of the alkaline compounds mainly na and k as well as mg ca and p remain in the bc the presence of phosphorus the element of life is crucial from the point of view of the application of bc as soil additive or soil improver since almost no sulfur and less than 20 of the initial chlorine is contained in the bc and significant reduction of the pm1 emission during the combustion occurs the bc becomes a truly clean fuel low emission of particulate matter is the result of the removal of volatile compounds and chlorine during the carbonization of the biomass the above results confirm previous statements that the combustion of inorganic containing volatile components is the dominant process during the combustion of biomass and is mainly responsible for the emission of pm1 and pm2 5 the properties of the bc and the investigation on thermal treatment of biomass have forced the authors to develop in cooperation with some polish companies the biocomposite fuel bcf production technology bis 2013 the bcf is formed from various bcs and hard coal stocks with appropriate additives and is produced by simultaneous heating co thermolysis of the mixture of biomass coal tailings and culms some preliminary results shown in figs 8 and 9 are very promising particularly in terms of reducing the emissions of co nox so2 and pm the new smokeless fuel that meets the above criteria can be successfully used in smoke free zones the fuel is made up of a mixture of coal and biomass with suitable additives the mixture is then subjected to thermolysis and some beneficial changes of the biomass and coal occur during the process both in terms of their chemical composition and morphology upon leaving the reactor the thermally transformed mixture is briquetted or pelletized with the addition of a special binder fig 8 the research results indicated that simultaneous thermolysis of coal and biomass brings about a synergy effect with respect to product yield and quality as well as the amount and composition of the flue gases some basic parameters of an example bcf are summarized in table 2 the combustion of the bcf brings about no emission of smoke and harmful components because the limited amount of bcf volatiles are burned inside pores of the heated coke thus providing the conditions for the most effective and cleanest flameless combustion to occur cf fig 9 the emission of some basic flue gas components as well as boiler efficiency during the combustion of coal and the bcf are shown in table 3 the comparison of the data clearly indicates lower emission of pollutants in the case of bcf combustion it should also be stressed that combustion of the bcf brings about an additional ecological effect namely at least 30 lower emissions of co2 4 2 biochar as soil improver the porous structure of the bc is excellent for its application as a soil additive the bc added to soil reduces soil density and positively affects the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of soil usowicz et al 2014 2016 the bc may be used in agriculture as organic fertilizer that is decomposed for a very long time and may thus positively affect soil fertility as well as the amount of biogenic components and soil physical biological and water properties galvez et al 2012 lehmann et al 2011 mohan et al 2014 zheng et al 2013 the bc also participates in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle the research results indicated that addition of the bc brings about the decrease of the nitrification level i e the decrease of nh3 oxidization moreover it influences the increase of the number of ammonification bacteria and reduces the emission of n2o due to the stimulation of nitrogen immobilization zheng et al 2013 according to the research carried out by ding et al ding et al 2010 the application of some 0 5 of bc to the upper soil layer causes the decrease of nh4 leaching by 15 2 due to the adsorption of ammonia ions on the surface of the bc zheng et al 2013 the reduced washing out of no3 from soil after the application of bc fertilization was also reported by knowles et al 2011 positive effect of the bc addition on nitrogen management was also proven in the research carried out by nelissen et al 2014 where the authors reported the reduction of n2o emission by 52 84 and the emission of no by 47 67 a positive bc to soil effect may also be observed by the variation of soil biological properties since the bc influences the quality and quantity of soil microflora galvez et al 2012 nelissen et al 2014 tang et al 2013 www biochar international org due to large specific surface and porous structure of the bc see fig 2 suitable living and development conditions for the soil microflora are created galvez et al 2012 sunil and ajay 2012 in the research carried out by lehmann et al 2011 considerable increase of microbiological activity after the implementation of bc fertilization was reported the positive effect was associated with the increase of the number of microorganisms as well as the increase of the biodiversity of soil microflora that may also additionally influence the stability of the ecosystem and protect the system against any pathogenic microorganisms the increased microbiological activities result in higher rate of mineralization and thus bring about the increase of nutrient bioavailability for the plants sunil and ajay 2012 physical and chemical properties of the bc such as a well developed specific surface area and porosity positively affect not only the biological or microbiological properties of the soil but also improve its chemical properties and water retention the investigation carried out by the authors indicated that depending on the origin and particle size of the bc its water sorption capacity may reach even 0 85kg of h2o per each kg of bc fig 10 through the increased water retention the addition of bc to soil improves water air relations and brings about the decrease of leaching of the biogenic components from soil the bc acts as a filter that prolongates the retention time for water solutions sunil and ajay 2012 zheng et al 2013 moreover the addition of the bc brings about the increase of soil ph and the increase of total cation exchange capacity cec and thus better capture of nutrients by plants galvez et al 2012 nelissen et al 2014 tang et al 2013 www biochar international org to confirm the above mentioned positive effects of the application of the bc as soil additive the authors carried out some simple field research on soil of class iv in southern poland two experimental groups of fields were separated from regular tillage area in 2013 both groups were subdivided into five sections 2m 2m each i e one reference section without the addition of bc three sections were the bc was added in quantities of 3kg m2 7 5kg m2 and 10kg m2 and one section where the bc was mixed up with cattle slurry manure csm in proportion 1 1 by weight to compensate the characteristic odor of the slurry and the mixture was then applied at 7 5kg of bc m2 in all the test fields the bc was mixed up with soil for a depth of roughly 25cm maize and miscanthus were planted on the fields the results are shown in figs 11 14 in all cases positive effects of the bc addition can be seen 4 3 biochar addition to control soil ph as it is commonly known the ph of soil is one of the basic factors that affect soil fertility and thus the yield of cultivated plants the effect of ph on soil chemical properties is multidirectional namely it prevents the leaching of toxic aluminum counteracts the impoverishment of the soil sorption complex nutrient storage in soil and determines the availability of nutrients for plants aluminum is the third largest contributor 7 96 to earth crust it is found in numerous mineral compounds mainly aluminosilicates to become toxic to plants aluminum compounds must decompose become soluble and must penetrate to the soil section where direct contact of plant roots with aluminum occurs the decomposition of aluminum compounds and their toxicity depend on soil ph as the ph decreases the number of h ions being the natural activator of the dissolution processes for aluminum compounds increase depending on the concentration of those h ions the dissolution of the aluminum compounds may be gradual with a slow decrease of the ph of soil solution or rapid with a very fast acidification of soil it is assumed that the decrease of ph by one unit results in a 1000 fold increase of the concentration of toxic aluminum al3 cations the content of such aluminum cations become revealed in the soil solution already at ph of 5 8 above that value the aluminum compounds in soil are insoluble and thus are non toxic for the plants the content of al3 cations rapidly increases below ph 4 7 mineral components cations are essential for life and are bound in soil by a negatively charged soil sorption complex which is made up of mineral particles clay minerals and caries in temperate soils the sorption complex is to a large extent over 80 filled with alkaline cations like calcium magnesium or potassium i e the basic nutrients for plants the role of calcium in relation to other basic cations is superior the remaining part of the soil sorption complex consists of the so called acidic cations hydrogen h and aluminum al3 acidification of soil leads to the replacement of the basic cations with acidic cations that are not nutrients for the plants as a result alkaline cations mainly calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 are eluted from the topsoil and thus the crop plants lose the necessary nutrient ingredients at the same time it has to be emphasized that acidic environment provide unwanted conditions for the sorption complex and also reduce the sorption capacity of the soil thus leading to its degradation the degradation of soil also results in a significant decrease of its water content the nutrients from soil are taken up by plant roots from aqueous solutions the solubility of nutrients and hence their availability to plants depend to a large extent on soil ph and vary for individual components one of the crucial nutrients is phosphorus mainly present in soil in the form of aluminum iron calcium or magnesium phosphates all characterized by generally poor solubility the transitions of phosphorous containing compounds into soluble or insoluble forms are continuously occurring in soil and are very much affected by soil ph the ph has also a direct impact on the activity of soil microorganisms since different groups have various requirements for optimal ph in the acidic environment for instance the mushrooms are intensively grown up however the vast majority of microflora species prefer neutral ph therefore the excess of acidic cations in soil disturbs a number of biological processes and has a negative effect on nutrient uptake and consequently on the crop yield it is usually agreed that acidic soils are characterized by significant decrease of microorganism activity the microorganisms play an important role since they decompose plant residues the reduction of the release of minerals from dead plants and natural fertilizers in soil oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrates worse supply of nitrogen to crops and as a consequence their slower growth capture atmospheric nitrogen the majority of bacteria living in symbiosis with higher plants are the nitrobacter thus worsening the nitrogen supply to crops and bringing about lower yield the ph of the soil samples taken from authors own experimental test fields is shown in fig 15 it should be emphasized that neither fertilizer nor lime were added to soil during field preparation and plant growth the data clearly indicate positive effect of the addition of bc on soil ph the ph increase is consistent with the above remarks and confirms the increase of soil fertility cf figs 11 14 4 4 biochar for co2 sequestration the bc plays also an important role in the regulation of the dynamics and circulation of c and n galvez et al 2012 zheng et al 2013 and may thus affect the increase of organic matter content in soil high content of stable fraction of organic carbon is desirable and thus the bc may take part in the biosequestration of carbon in soils mohan et al 2014 as a reservoir of quite slowly mineralized carbon the bc becomes a powerful tool to decrease the greenhouse effect brought about by excessive emission of co2 mohan et al 2014 taking into account that the average time mean residence time mrt for bc decomposition in soil is estimated at approx 1300 4000 years sunil and ajay 2012 one may assume that by the application of the bc to agricultural fields one may cause permanent deposition of some 428gt of c on earth sunil and ajay 2012 some small content of more labile fractions of the bc may undergo faster decomposition thus increasing the amount of organic matter in soil soil organic matter som and the amount of mineralized nutrients available for the plants sunil and ajay 2012 the above remarks confirm the results of the investigations of c content in soil samples taken from authors experimental fields the results are summarized in fig 16 the carbon content in soil is stable and roughly corresponds to the amount of the added bc except for the fields where the biochar cattle manure mixtures were added in both test field groups similar differences in the carbon content in soil are observed 5 summary the description of biochar bc properties as well as its application and production technology that have been presented and discussed in the current paper summarizes some basic information on the subject and presents a promising role the bc can play in the bioeconomy concept development to prevent further climate change increase carbon sequestration potential and soil ammetioration potential for food production it in no way limit other perspectives and possibilities of any sophisticated bc manufacturing and applications e g in polygeneration systems where electricity heat chill and at least one additional commercial product are produced the information and opinion contained in this paper are essentially related to two issues associated with 1 the use of bc as soil quality improver and a tool to sequestrate carbon dioxide and 2 the development of a technology to produce bcf from bc coal and additives sorbents and binders due to the requirements associated with manuscript size the perspective application of the bc as fuel in direct carbon fuel cells dcfcs kacprzak et al 2014 and integration of the thermolysis reactor with digestive reactor for the production of bc from digestate residue dr have been omitted the dcfcs allow to generate electricity with very high efficiency and no emission of pollutants the carbonization of the dr allows to solve the problem associated with the use of solid anaerobic digestate in agriculture the authors do hope however that the information given in the present paper will become helpful to understand better the philosophy of biochar production and application as a potential tool to combat climate changes emission of pollutants and droughts the development of the bc idea in poland is the result of polish scientific and technological activities and the cooperation between science and industry the growing international network of various institutions dealing with bc confirm huge potential of the biochar for its promising use in agriculture technology and everyday life

1154,the article presents a novel practical sustainable and multi purpose conceptual method for urban lakes water treatment it is based on the separation of the inflowing water from the lake s main body with an impermeable barrier and a construction of enhanced littoral zone the impermeable barrier alongside the shoreline creates a new littoral zone between the land and the lake water inflowing water as well as nutrient rich seepage water from a direct catchment will be pretreated in a specially constructed biotic and abiotic zones the naturally formed community of macrophytes in the littoral zone ensures biological pretreatment the remaining phosphorus load will be eliminated in the abiotic part of the system composed of natural cost efficient and easily accessible sorption material based on nutrients budget calculated for a few urban lakes we estimate that the diversion of the main nutrient rich river inflow and the cutoff of the littoral zone will reduce a load of nitrogen and phosphorus by more than 80 and 90 respectively keywords lake restoration lake protection water treatment phosphorus precipitation nitrogen removal 1 introduction surface waterbodies supply water for hydropower and irrigation domestic and stock consumption provide economic benefits through fisheries and tourism and assure protection of biodiversity and flood mitigation potential the progressive degradation of lakes and reservoirs as a result of urbanization climate change and agricultural intensification requires new tools to limit the eutrophication processes dunalska et al 2015 2018 hamilton et al 2009 lin et al 2011 molle et al 2005 wilk woźniak et al 2014 numerous studies indicate that lakes restoration is a difficult operation expensive causing a lot of technical difficulties and the obtained results are not always compatible with expectations cooke et al 2005 dunalska et al 2007 hamilton et al 2016 mackay et al 2014 thus far there have been a number of methods developed and implemented for lake and catchment restoration cooke et al 2005 dunalska et al 2014 hamilton and dada 2016 søndergaard et al 2007 but loads of nutrients imported into water bodies continue to be large enough to sustain primary production frequently and especially in urban lakes once the water and sewage management has been regulated runoffs of stormwater and melted snow turn into a serious problem barałkiewicz et al 2014 dunalska et al 2015 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 another issue is the so called human factor that is intentional pollution of water for example by illegal discharge of sewage and wastewater or unintentional damage due to inadequate knowledge of water ecosystems an example is when shorelines are damaged due to the removal of macrophytes construction of piers or deformation of the shore relief to create a beach such actions eliminate natural biogeochemical barriers and destroy habitats for fish invertebrates and zooplankton housing development in the nearest proximity to a water body also changes the land relief as well as reducing the soil sorption and retention capacity tong and chen 2002 welty 2009 considering that the shore of the lake is the last barrier to protect the lake against the inflow of pollution the aim of the study was to design a new practical sustainable and multi purpose method consisting of the elimination of point non point and diffuse sources of pollution in a shore of the lake the concept included not only the pollution cut off but also their simultaneous treatment by using abiotic and biotic environmental processes and engineering biotechnology and ecohydrology tools 2 description of the method sources of pollution will be cut off by fencing a selected section of the shoreline from the open water with an impermeable barrier fig 1 the wall will consist of a system of pvc partitions as well as being aesthetic such pvc barrier profiles are resistant to biological corrosion rusting cracking scratching abrasion or uv radiation moreover they can be shaped into both convex and concave curves which means that a whole barrier can be adjusted to the shape of the water body s natural shoreline the barrier profiles should be assembled from the water side so as to avoid any damage to the belt of rushes and reeds the assembly work consists of installing profiles mechanically by pressing them into the ground with vibration hammers along previously fitted formers dunalska et al 2015 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 the new littoral zone separated with the wall between the land and the barrier wall diverts nutrient rich inflows stormwater and surface and subsurface runoffs while the naturally formed community of rushes biotic zone ensures biological pretreatment owing to its complex systems of rhizomes and roots the common reed which dominates in the littoral zone of eutrophic lakes favours the development of microorganisms which participate actively in water purification gajewska et al 2014 numerous studies concerning wastewater treatment carried out on constructed wetlands have demonstrated the high effectiveness in the removal of organic substances over 90 for bod5 and cod and ammonium nitrogen 20 90 depending on the system setup which was a consequence of the conditions favourable for nitrification processes through the intensive growth and biomass gain plants accumulate phosphorus as well kadlec and wallace 2008 luederitz et al 2001 ławniczak 2011 mucha et al 2017 the remaining phosphorus load will be eliminated in the abiotic part of the system that is in partitions filled with natural cost efficient and easily accessible sorption material abiotic zone fig 2 calcium compounds are recommended to be used as good adsorbents of phosphorus jóźwiakowski et al 2017 molle et al 2005 vohla et al 2011 while being harmless to the biocenosis and posing no ecotoxicological threat prepas et al 2001 coprecipitation of phosphates with calcite is a well known process occurring in nature where it contributes to self purification of waters koschel et al 1983 hamilton et al 2009 ostrofsky and miller 2017 another advantage of calcium compounds is that they ensure the permanent immobilization of phosphorus regardless of any changes in oxygen conditions hart et al 2003 lin et al 2011 carbonate minerals can be mixed with leca light expanded clay aggregate in order to increase the hydrological conductivity and decrease the weight of abiotic barriers additional advantage of this substrate is a good phosphorus sorption capacity as well sieńska and dunalska 2015 suliman et al 2005 öövel et al 2007 abiotic barriers should be made from lattice structures to protect before clogging of the system in which gabion cages filled with carbonate minerals and leca will be placed it is possible to consider other sorption materials provided they are safe for the environment and have been tested in terms of their adsorption properties towards phosphorus the height and width of barriers should be adjusted to the dimensions of the zone where water flows through the separated littoral zone the site where the barriers will be built will depend on the length of the water pretreatment zone and the way the water body s catchment is developed and managed an access from the land to abiotic barriers in the shoreline zone must be secured so as to be able to renew the sorption material when establishing the dimensions of a future water flow zone it is recommended to take into consideration the volume of water imported by the inflows the volume of water from the surface and subsurface runoffs and hydraulic resistance due to the presence of water plants and abiotic barriers the actual design of a water pretreatment system in the littoral zone will depend on the geological structure of the bed morphometric structure of a given water body how the catchment has been developed and is managed and on potential sources of pollution as regards flow through lakes with a positive water balance a large supply of water from groundwater resources an optimal solution would be to cut off the water inflow where a river flows into the lake by closing the barrier profiles any further flow of water would continue along the shoreline between the land and the impermeable barrier directly into the outflow which means that river waters will be conveyed outside the catchment of the given lake while being pretreated having passed through the system of emergent plants biotic zone and sorption material abiotic zone to ensure the hydrological safety of the water body it is advisable to design a penstock valve with a slide lock at both the major inflow and outflow of the river it is also necessary to consider designing a fish ladder to enable aquatic organisms to migrate freely when the water budget is limited in order to maintain constant water levels in lakes it is recommended to secure an inflow of pretreated river waters at any site along the shoreline of the lake it has been calculated that the main nutrient rich inflow diversion and the cut off other sources of pollution in the zone of the impermeable barrier can reduce the large external load of nitrogen and phosphorus in a case of lake wolsztyńskie it will be 84 and 92 respectively the phosphorus load of the main river dojca river will decrease from 1877kg p y 1 to 156kg p y 1 dunalska et al 2018 similar results were received for lake wierzysko the system of impermeable barrier will cause a 76 reduction of the load of phosphorus imported from the wierzyca river to the lake from 3 101kg p y 1to 744kg p y 1 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 in the system of lakes kartuskie after applying pretreatment in a new littoral zone separated with the wall and then using a different restoration methods inside the lakes the estimated phosphorus load reduction will be expected to be 37 in mielenko lake 62 in karczemne lake 92 in klasztorne małe lake and 79 in klasztorne duże lake dunalska et al 2015 in addition proper design of the shoreline gives the preservation of the aquatic environment s aesthetic qualities as well as the tourist and recreational functions it is very important that the final design of the abiotic barrier and or impermeable barrier built as a levee include construction of some foot bridges and viewing platforms which will give free access to the lake water all construction solutions should be safe for the quality of water all construction work should be performed according to the developed technical specification prepared in line with the current legal regulations and standards when executing the commissioned project all work tasks should be scheduled in compliance with the conditions and deadlines limiting the scope of construction work that are stipulated in the pertinent decision on the environmental conditions underlying the approval for building the structure conditions under which the building work should be conducted and in all other decisions related to this project 3 summary the method proposed above enable us to completely cut off the open waters of the lake from the main river inflow as well as from non point and diffuse sources of pollution from the direct catchment the system of impermeable barriers along the shoreline of the lake creates a new littoral zone between the land and the barrier wall novelty of this solution is the simultaneous reduction of pollutants including numerous biogenic substances responsible for water eutrophication in the new zone of water flow the natural communities of emergent

wetlands high level of the phosphorus reduction can be achieved by using the abiotic part of the system that is in partitions filled with natural cost efficient and easily accessible sorption material
