3005,recent heavy rainfall induced flood events for example in germany australia and usa have highlighted the relevance of countermeasures in saving human lives and preventing property damage newly introduced ml based flood forecasting methods rely on high intensity synthetic rainfall events due to the sparsity of their real counterpart such synthetic data instances can be produced by precipitation generators trained in an adversarial setting on historical rainfall data capturing processes for rainfall data are often highly distributed with multiple radar stations contributing to a centralised data set however data centralisation entails challenges regarding data stream logistics data locality and memory overhead distributed analytics da aims to overcome these challenges through decentralised model training by bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa in this work we propose a feasibility study evaluating the applicability of da on hydrological data as example of use we choose the decentralised training of rainfall data generators we introduce a rainfall generator training procedure relying on generative adversarial networks gans and evaluate two da algorithms federated learning fl and cyclic institutional incremental learning ciil we compare the resulting training outcomes with the centralised model training cl approach and find ciil performed similarly to cl but less stable while fl outperformed cl by 7 5 we conclude that the proven feasibility of fl in our simulated distributed setting lays the groundwork for utilising this approach in realistic environments of grander scale while overcoming potential privacy concerns or logistical challenges in the setting of centralised analytics keywords hydrological data distributed data distributed analytics data generation 1 introduction with worldwide weather extremes expected to gain in frequency and intensity heavy rainfall induced floods pose an increasing risk to property and civilian security seneviratne et al 2012 hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 this subject has especially acquired momentum after e g the july 2021 floods in western germany and numerous other worldwide flash

such as early warning systems ews hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 jordans 2021 davies 2021a c b d in particular urban populations are at high risk due to the threats posed by so called pluvial heavy rainfall induced floods in urban areas which form rapidly and have a short forecasting time hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 acosta coll et al 2018 this time sensitive factor in ews emphasises the importance of reliable real time modelling of urban pluvial floods flood management and conceptualisation of disaster response strategies hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 2021 despite their high accuracy and success in flood modelling applications physically based models have long computation times and therefore are of limited use for real time modelling henonin et al 2013 löwe et al 2017 against this backdrop different machine learning ml approaches have been developed to overcome the computation time bottleneck of physically based flood models bermúdez et al 2018 2019 kim et al 2019a recently a new ml approach using adversarial training techniques for pluvial flood modelling has gained considerable attention and outperformed existing ml architectures hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 while this approach has shown promising results in terms of computation speed and accuracy its reliability highly depends on the availability of realistic and high quality rainfall data a common procedure to collect adequate data is the aggregation of different datasets from geographically distributed measuring sites for example the radolan 2 2 radolan available online https www dwd de de leistungen radolan radolan html accessed 01 september 2021 procedure centralises and combines data from 17 radar stations to create composite rainfall maps 3 3 composite creation available online https www dwd de de forschung wettervorhersage met fachverfahren wetterradarverfahren komposit erstellung node html accessed 01 september 2021 however the process of centralising data to a single location is often accompanied by logistical challenges such as a steady data uplink between multiple measuring sites involving a sufficiently large bandwidth and stationary failure management additionally the data storage requirements could constitute an emerging problem if the time resolution of the data is increased and more data is transmitted to the central server the dilemma becomes even worse if researchers aim to gain insights about rare events e g high intensity precipitation data which implies that complete datasets must be downloaded in order to achieve a sufficiently large dataset lastly the lack of data has been recently approached by involving data using crowdsourcing platforms or measuring sites from citizen scientists nonetheless the rising role of citizen data for specific use cases pose additional challenges like data ownership and other legal issues which must be solved first meier et al 2017 krennert et al 2018 solutions for these prevalent challenges originate from distributed analytics da da resembles a paradigm shift in that it brings the analysis to the data instead of vice versa welten et al 2021 limited to model training applications da overcomes the previously mentioned challenges associated with data centralisation by having institutions train models on their data locally instead of participating in data sharing sheller et al 2020 consequently data stays within institutional borders and data premises keep the control over their data at any time this paradigm limits the data exchange e g model parameters and analysis code to a necessary minimum and enables data analysis without preceding download of vast amounts of data however while da was shown to be feasible in the medical domain as models trained using da in a decentralised environment performed comparably to those trained on centralised data an application of da to hydrological data has not been deeply investigated yet sheller et al 2020 2018 chang et al 2018 1 1 objective our goal is the application of well established da methods to hydrological data demonstrating the feasibility of such approaches in this domain due to the sparsity of actual high intensity rainfall events in historical datasets we have chosen a use case which includes the development and training of data generators specialised in the creation of high intensity precipitation data these generators can then supplement other data driven applications such as pluvial flood prediction with practically unlimited rainfall data in this work we aim to circumvent the mentioned data centralisation overhead and simulate ml model training at each data premise i e radar stations we tested the hypothesis that decentrally trained data generators for synthetic rainfall data can replace their centrally trained counterparts and approach this setting by evaluating different training heuristics and their synthetic data quality 1 2 findings and contributions this work showcases a method of generating new and realistic high intensity synthetic rainfall events using decentralised model training these synthetic rainfall events are generated by rainfall generators based on a generative adversarial network architecture our model denoted synraingan receives historical high intensity rainfall events sampled from an open source data distribution as training input for the sampling procedure an algorithm has been implemented enabling sampling per various levels of precipitation which has been used to create the training set testing the architecture in a centralised environment showed that it produces rainfall generators synthesising realistic high intensity rainfall events as opposed to historical rainfall events the synthetic data showed no signs of noise these findings show that synthetic rainfall data eliminates data sparsity and proves to be more reliable and flexible for use since rainfall data capturing processes are highly distributed the feasibility of training rainfall generators on decentralised rainfall data has been evaluated by applying da in a simulated distributed environment we simulate the setting of several data managing institutions by partitioning an open source rainfall dataset from the german weather service dwd according to its spatial dimensions along approximated radar station boundaries subsequently we have trained synraingan in this environment using the da approaches of federated learning fl and cyclic incremental institutional learning ciil the resulting models have been capable of generating new and realistic synthetic rainfall events fl has been able to produce rainfall generators performing 7 5 better than the centralised approach called centralised learning cl while ciil performed comparatively to cl we conclude that training generative models in a decentralised hydrological data environment is feasible our approach could open up entirely new possibilities for generative model training for example hundreds of citizen radar stations located in germany could be integrated into analysis or training processes assisting existing official radar stations and eliminating a potentially complicated centralisation process with potential data privacy concerns 4 4 citizen radar stations available online https kachelmannwetter com de amateurstationen deutschland niederschlag 20210721 1200z html accessed 01

generators for synthetic rainfall data on a centralised and decentralised data basis further in section 4 we present our experiment outcomes and evaluate them according to our quality metric in section 5 we discuss the results of the experiments and section 6 provides a conclusion and details future work 2 related work this section covers related work in hydrological data analysis section 2 1 and provides insights into the current state of the art in da section 2 2 2 1 hydrological data hydrological data captures processes occurring in various hydrological systems e g precipitation groundwater levels or streamflow this data is relevant to grasping the behaviour of a particular setting and is the basis for risk management through predictive modelling 5 5 the importance of hydrological data available online https www hydrology org uk hydrological data php accessed 01 september 2021 typical applications of hydrological data and models utilising such data lie in water resources management weather forecasting and infrastructure design andersson et al 2015 hydrological data capturing processes are inherently decentralised motivating the application of da to analytical tasks in this field especially radar based precipitation data is relevant in this regard radolan radar online aneichung calibration is one of such procedures capturing precipitation events and has been in routine operation since june 2005 in real time operation radolan provides area wide spatially and temporally highly resolved quantitative precipitation data through an hourly combination of precipitation values measured at 17 ground based c band radar stations in germany kreklow et al 2020 these radar stations capture precipitation values by measuring signals reflected by precipitation in the atmosphere the german weather service dwd offers various radolan products related to historical precipitation data on the open data dwd server differing in spatial temporal and intensity resolution of the data wetterdienst 2016 such radolan products have seen use in various applications e g retrospective analysis and prognosis of erosion related to precipitation occurrences fischer 2019 müller et al 2016 deumlich 2011 additionally zhang et al already has utilised rainfall generators capable of generating sequences of synthetic extreme rainfall data based on radar data zhang et al 2019b nevertheless since 2005 multiple hundred gigabytes of raw data 6 6 for example the dwd open data server https opendata dwd de have been generated which pose a growing overhead for model development because conventionally these data products must be downloaded priorly the data volume even grows further if we increase the time resolution of the radolan products at this point the amount of raw data increases up to terabyte range to circumvent this storage overhead da poses a valuable option 2 2 distributed analytics by nature hydrological data e g rainfall data is highly distributed across city federal state or even country borders wetterdienst 2016 the consequence is the necessity of a data centralisation workflow which poses several challenges such as the locality of data as we have mentioned before sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 for example from a logistical and technical perspective data from multiple radar stations has to be centralised first in order to perform any analysis this requires steady and consistent data streams to the central data repository which transfers amounts of data every hour in real time wetterdienst 2016 further data centralisation has the immanent danger of a single point of failure which hinders data analysis the logistical overhead might become even more complex if we involve citizens as data providers who support the crowdsourcing of additional data products which might foster reliable data analysis but the data ownership might not be clearly solved meier et al 2017 sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 bell et al 2015 snik et al 2014 from an abstract perspective the current state of the art brings data to the analysis which comes along with the above mentioned challenges the concepts of da follow a paradigm shift da aims to overcome these challenges by having data premises collaboratively take part in analytical processes without transmitting their data to a central location by bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa as data remains within institutional borders bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 da is helpful in environments that are heavily distributed and produce high volumes of data sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 hard et al 2019 in such environments data centralisation processes for central model training might pose a significant bottleneck leading to distributed model training approaches being more feasible because the communication costs are comparatively small if we solely transmit analysis code e g model updates or gradients bonawitz et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021a in the following we will present two common da approaches which can be found in the literature and have been especially applied in the healthcare domain sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021a b welten et al 2022 as an overview we have depicted these two methods in fig 1 federated learning mcmahan et al first introduced fl due to the difficulties involved with training models on decentralised data from mobile devices bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 kerkouche et al 2021a fl follows the da paradigm associated with parallel execution of model training tasks and has been applied in several domains bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021b during the fl process see fig 1 data managing institutions refrain from sharing their data to a central location and instead share updates of models locally trained on their data these models are sent out by a server located at a central location after receiving model updates the server aggregates them marking the completion of a federated round optionally the aggregated model parameters may be sent to the institutions for further training rounds in the medical domain sheller et al applied fl to brain tumour segmentation and concluded that the approach yields models performing similarly to models trained in a centralised environment sheller et al 2020 2018 fl has also been utilised in smartphone next word keyboard prediction and blockchain settings hard et al 2019 kim et al 2019b institutional incremental learning instead of parallel training the institutional incremental learning iil methodology also referred to as weight transfer wt covers the da paradigm of successive executions of model training tasks welten et al 2021 chang et al 2018 each collaborating institution trains a shared model exactly once with the model being successively transmitted between institutions an extension to this method is cyclic iil ciil in which this process is repeated for a given number of cycles chang et al 2018 ciil has been applied to several use cases in e g the healthcare care domain sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 mou et al 2021 the experimental study by chang et al has shown that the model trained by ciil achieve results comparable to the centralised approach chang et al 2018 mou welten et al have applied ciil to model training for skin lesion detection and have shown a similar performance to the centralised model training mou et al 2021 sheller et al has compared the above mentioned fl approach for the brain tumour segmentation with ciil and has revealed that fl performs superiorly sheller et al 2018 2020 as we have shown the immanent characteristic of hydrological data is its distribution across multiple data sites causing considerations about efficiency and data locality these challenges are even exacerbated if we aim to learn from rare events e g high intensity precipitation events which enforces downloads of entire datasets to extract enough training data in this work we address these challenges by performing model training decentrally we exemplarily show how data generators for high intensity data can be developed by retaining data instances at their origin the concept and the model training approach is presented in the next section 3 concept in this section we present our concept for the decentralised training of rainfall data generators we first start with the dataset selection and the associated sampling procedure to extract high intensity rainfall data for the generator training in section 3 1 then we present the used model architecture which we train to generate synthetic precipitation data in section 3 2 finally we delve into the application of the above mentioned da methods section 2 in our scenario fig 2 illustrates the simulated scenario from a top level perspective note that we have made all development artefacts available online 7 7 https github com sawelt hydroda 3 1 dataset selection and preprocessing raw dataset one open source accessible precipitation data repository is the open data server of the dwd which provides various radolan data products 8 8 radolan products available online https opendata dwd de climate environment cdc grids germany homyehosty radolan historical bin accessed 01 september 2021 with multiple radolan products being available we have chosen the rw product which is a composite of precipitation data from multiple radar stations and thus can be regarded as a centralised data set originating from multiple data sources rw consists of over 130 000 encoded historical rainfall events measured by multiple radar stations the spatial temporal and intensity resolutions of these events are 1 km 2 1 h and 1 0 1 mm h respectively wetterdienst 2016 each radar station has a horizontal range of about 150 km these historical rainfall events cover 900 km 2 mainly over germany and represent the summed up rainfall values captured by a varying number of radar stations within one hour therefore each hour beginning june 1 2005 is represented as an event in this data set wetterdienst 2016 for this work the timespan of hourly rainfall events captured is limited to june 1 2005 december 31 2020 in our study this raw data set contains a total of 136 539 rainfall events and amounts to 204 gb it is subsequently referred to as rw data set each 900 km 2 rainfall event is encoded in a data file containing a header section and a binary section separated by an end of text character the header encodes various information e g intensity resolution or date of measurement the binary section contains 810 000 double bytes each encoding one rainfall value little endian wetterdienst 2016 interpreting each double byte at a time enables the construction of a 900 900 cartesian coordinate system modelling a 900 km 2 rainfall event due to the spatial resolution of 1 km 2 each precipitation value measures the hourly rainfall per km 2 these values are either integer values v 0 1 4095 or undefined no value measured the given intensity resolution of 1 0 1 mm h indicates that an integer value of v represents rainfall intensity of v 10 mm h wetterdienst 2016 the first double byte of the binary section represents the rainfall value located at cartesian coordinate 0 0 while double byte 810 000 captures the value at coordinate 899 899 we refer to fig 3 for visualisation of an rw product file the rw data set given the discussed interpretation is utilised to sample smaller scale rainfall events for generator training in a centralised environment simulating a distributed environment as previously mentioned the rw product is a composite of the data recorded by multiple radar stations 23 of which we focus on in this work wetterdienst 2016 in our scenario we simulate a distributed environment by using 23 subsets d r w 1 d r w 23 these data sets resemble the rw product pre composition before the centralisation process however contrary to the rw product the individual radar stations data is not open source accessible thus the composition process which created the rw product must first be reversed this reversal is executed by partitioning each event of the rw data set into several individual events as have been recorded by the radar stations at the time of capture hence each 900 km 2 historical rainfall event is partitioned into 23 300 km 2 rainfall events contained in the corresponding data sets the 300 km 2 size of each event from the distributed environment is caused by each radar station s radius being at most 150 km following the above mentioned approach we apply the following workflow to each rainfall event in rw 1 computing the set of operational radar stations and the corresponding radius r based on the date on which historical rainfall event has been captured 2 defining each operational radar station s bounds around the radar stations cartesian coordinates x y for radius r bresenham 1977 3 extracting the rainfall values recorded within the bounds of each radar station x and adding the corresponding 300 km 2 event to the data set d r w x precipitation values outside the radar are set to u n d e f i n e d building the training set based on d r w 1 d r w 23 we build our distributed training sets for the model training ideally the training input should have the same format as the desired rainfall generator output to facilitate model training in this work we define the input format as a 32 km 2 area covering high intensity rainfall events as we aim to generate such type of data since rainfall events from the drw data sets cover an area of 300 km 2 we sample from each high dimensional event several 32 32 matrices representing 32 km 2 rainfall events to build up 23 training sets nonetheless this naïve procedure does not guarantee that each training instance contains a region of high intensity rainfall data we extend this procedure by a cluster detection algorithm which finds accumulations of high intensity rainfall values in the 300 km 2 area the sampling algorithm works as follows if the sampling algorithm detects a cluster it spans a 32 km 2 patch around each accumulation subsequently we apply data augmentation by randomly shifting the bounds of the patch in each of the four directions such that the cluster continues to lie within these bounds this procedure establishes four areas each containing the cluster and resembles a two dimensional sliding window concept see fig 4 employing this method results in larger data sets of higher variation and enables a better model generalisation during training mikołajczyk and grochowski 2018 after applying this procedure to each of the 23 data sets we have obtained our distributed training data for the rainfall data generators note that our scenario is simulated usually data pre processing and harmonisation across distributed data sources is an additional challenge involving intensive coordination between the data premises in our setting we implicitly assume that this coordination has been done priorly as it is not part of our study next we present our generator composition which us trained on these data sets decentrally 3 2 model creation training and evaluation metric model creation training procedure generative models pose a valuable option to supplement model training if data of specific type e g high intensity precipitation is sparse one popular approach is the development of generative adversarial networks gans which have been applied to the hydrology domain and geosciences already goodfellow et al 2014 creswell et al 2018 scher and peßenteiner 2021 leinonen et al 2021 applied to unsupervised learning tasks some of the most frequent uses of gans include image generation or image to image translation zhang et al 2019b creswell et al 2018 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 brock et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a worth mentioning another prominent class of generative models are variational autoencoders which are applicable in the fields of image generation or reconstruction kingma and welling 2013 hou et al 2017 huang et al 2018 nevertheless we have decided to use gans in our study since our work mainly focuses on the applicability of da on precipitation data rather than finding the best performing model architecture a gan consists of two adversaries the generative model generator g and the discriminative model discriminator d goodfellow et al 2014 creswell et al 2018 g transforms input noise variables sampled from a random distribution into synthesised data which is a 32 km 2 rainfall event in our case simultaneously d aims to distinguish between the synthetic input from g and real data goodfellow et al 2014 g s training goal is the generation of high quality synthetic data instances which are indistinguishable from real data consequently g can be implicitly used to generate high intensity precipitation data in our work we apply deep convolutional generative adversarial networks dcgans which expand upon the gan framework by utilising an architecture based on convolutional neural networks cnns radford et al 2015 initial experiments have shown that the training with the standard dcgan architecture has exhibited unstable behaviour due to this reason we decided to diverge from this model architecture we have explored several combinations of layer and activation functions until we have found a model architecture that is used in our main experiments we have summarised the structure of our synraingan in table 1 the size of our model amounts to 50 mb which have to be transmitted between the institutions and represents a significant reduction of communication cost compared to the centralisation of raw data during a training epoch the weights of g and d are updated based on batches of 32 32 historical rainfall events we divide an epoch into two phases 1 d is trained on a randomly sampled half batch of training data labelled as such then g generates a half batch of differently labelled synthetic data which d also trains on this phase is repeated until d correctly distinguishes synthetic and actual data from each other with a pre defined accuracy of d a c c 0 1 see fig 5a 2 g is trained by combining g and d into one model first g generates synthetic data these training instances are passed forward through d without any weight update through extended backpropagation the weights of g are finally updated see fig 5b creswell et al 2018 training strategies we introduce three gan training strategies differentiated by the environment in which they are applied the cl strategy represents the traditional method of training gans on a single local data set the high intensity training data set for cl is sampled from the rw data set representing the centralised approach the gan is subsequently trained by repetition of the above mentioned training procedure we consider cl as our baseline since it represents the state of the art in model training in contrast to cl da see section 2 2 is simulated by training on multiple data sets d r w 1 d r w 23 each managed by a radar station in this study we evaluate two da approaches fl and ciil see section 2 2 during fl each institution independently trains a copy of synraingan on its data set for epc epochs per cycle per institution epochs afterwards the replicas are aggregated by instantiating an updated global model with their weights being the average of all synraingan replica weights with the assignation of the aggregated models to each institution one federated round comes to an end for simplicity federated rounds are referred to as cycles for ciil the radar stations are arranged into a sequence according to their id in alphabetical order training via ciil begins with the first institution of this sequence training the gan by repeating epc training procedures on the training data set of the corresponding station synraingan is passed on to each institution until each institution has subsequently trained it completing one cycle this procedure can be repeated for several cycles performance evaluation metric to compare cl with both decentralised strategies and assign scores to each generator we apply the so called 1 nearest neighbour classifier 1nnc approach which has been explained in more detail in figure 6 lopez paz and oquab 2016 guan and loew 2020 we have chosen this evaluation methodology because an nnc only requires a distance metric in contrast alternative approaches like the inception score involve pre trained auxiliary models which have to be adapted according to our setting guan and loew 2020 we consider this evaluation metric because first the gan accuracy does not give any conclusion about the quality of the synthetic data and second the accuracy is fixed during each training procedure using the threshold parameter d a c c therefore a more sophisticated quality metric is needed which compares the generated data with real data the intuition is that if the synthetic data is indistinguishable from the real world data the generator has learned how to produce real data and is of high quality in detail 1nnc works as follows the classifier compares two differently labelled batches r real of size n and s synthetic by classifying each element of both batches to its nearest neighbour from either sample set if the element and its nearest neighbour are from the same batch the resulting accuracy is 1 with the averaged accuracy of all classifications providing a corresponding score r and s are identical if 1 n n c 0 5 i e the classifier finds them impossible to distinguish b in fig 6 a score of 1 n n c 0 5 means that the gan overfits r a in fig 6 while 1 n n c 0 5 shows dissimilarity between the two data distributions c in fig 6 guan et al regularised the 1nnc score introducing the simplified r1nnc score with a best worst value of 1 0 guan and loew 2020 xu et al 2018 r 1 n n c 2 1 n n c 1 1 since the outcome of the 1nnc metric depends on the selected datasets r and s for the evaluation we repeat the evaluation several times and build the average after presenting our scenario of de centralised model training we conduct several experiments and evaluate the performance of each training strategy in the next section 4 4 experiments in this section we first present the experiment including synraingan trained on centralised rainfall data ultimately the synraingan architecture is applied in a simulated distributed setting using fl and ciil 4 1 overview to establish a training set of high intensity rainfall events for application of the cl approach the sampling algorithm see section 3 is applied to the rw data set the resulting set denoted d 1 contains 261 613 32 32 high intensity rainfall events analogously the distributed environment is realised with 23 individual training data sets d r w 1 d r w 23 representing the corresponding radar station s data the explicit data distribution across the radar station network can be found online 9 9 https github com sawelt hydroda we further combine multiple training data sets simulating varying numbers of institutions in the network to gain insights about the scalability of our approach all synraingan instances utilise the adam optimisation algorithm with hyper parameters α 0 0002 β 1 0 9 β 2 0 999 and ϵ 1 0 8 including the binary cross entropy loss function kingma and ba 2014 the mini batch size is 128 which means that each learner uses the same batch size of 128 constantly for a synraingan performance evaluation metric the 1nnc method see section 3 is utilised to stabilise this scoring procedure each application averages 100 1nnc evaluations on 0 3 784 instances of the training data this decision is based on the time complexity of the knnc as the calculation time for the evaluation score significantly increases with the number of instances we therefore have to find a trade off between evaluation accuracy and time consumption during synraingan training the normalised r1nnc score rounded to the fourth decimal place is evaluated in a uniform interval of epochs note that the optimal value of this score is 1 while the worst possible value is 0 4 2 centralised model training we conduct our central model training using different discriminator accuracy constraints d a c c section 3 the arbitrarily chosen initial value of d a c c 0 8 discriminator training threshold per epoch was increased by 0 05 repetitively in three executions of synraingan training in total training performance of four synraingans are compared differing in training hyper parameters d a c c 0 8 0 85 0 9 0 95 we find that the increasing value d a c c improved training stability 10 10 we interpret the training stability as the range of the boxplots the narrower the range is the more stable is the training with the distribution of r1nnc scores becoming narrower see fig 7a the best rainfall generator instance arose from training with d a c c 0 9 after 6150 epochs and is labelled g 6150 r1nnc score of 0 8473 note all subsequent experiments utilise d a c c 0 9 for synraingan training beyond the analysis of the accuracy as shown above we also investigate the synthetic output of synraingan supported by its high r1nnc score and visual examination g 6150 generates synthetic rainfall events with high resemblance to corresponding training samples indicating a successful training see fig 8 however the data distributions of synthetic data and training data are not identical because the r1nnc score does not approximately equal the optimal value of 1 despite dissimilar distribution we detect a reduction of noise in the synthetic data instances as it can be seen in fig 8 therefore the output of synraingan does not show measuring errors in other words synraingan has a noise cancelling effect on the input data 4 3 decentralised model training in the following the results of synraingan training in the simulated decentralised precipitation data environment are presented as this work represents a feasibility study the objective of these experiments is the demonstration of the da capabilities by producing comparable results for detailed enumeration of all scores we refer to table 2 we have found that all strategies converge at a similar pace see fig 9 furthermore significant performance drops were consistently observed for ciil fl was by far the most stable approach with the lowest score deviations outperforming cl and ciil in this regard see fig 9 the highest r1nnc score from fl was 7 5 higher than the cl counterpart furthermore the median score of fl was 10 8 higher than the cl median ciil generally performed worse or comparatively than fl and cl with its highest score being 6 9 lower than the highest fl score and 12 7 lower than the median score respectively on the other hand the maximum ciil score is similar to the cl score nevertheless the median score is slightly below cl 3 2 the performance drop and the high deviations during ciil training see fig 9 b has motivated us to shortly investigate this phenomenon in more detail as shown in fig 9 we find high fluctuations in performance yielding less stability during training a slight correlation can be found between an institutions data set size and the r1nnc score performance after training on the institution as depicted in fig 10 on average training on data from the smallest institutions i 1 i 5 led to a continuous decrease of the score during training see fig 10 this behaviour can be explained with overfitting as the model tends to overfit the data of the smaller institutions and loses the ability to generalise after training on these institutions the performance increases again as more data is available at subsequent stations e g i 6 i 23 the performance therefore fluctuates within each cycle causing high deviations and unstable model training as a consequence we derive two important insights from the ciil experiments first as fig 10 implies varying data set sizes between institutions counteract a stable model training and second the order of the institutions also affect the performance as multiple low sized institutions in succession cause performance drops this phenomenon has been already partially demonstrated in related work sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 we have further investigated the behaviour of ciil in a different scenario which involves a reduction of institutions the previous da experiments were conducted in an environment of 23 institutions arranged in a sequence each institutions manages a high intensity rainfall event data set sampled from the historical data distribution of the corresponding radar station two new environments are now introduced to study the effect of fewer institutions during da in these environments each institution may manage training data sets combining the sampled historical rainfall events from multiple radar stations environment 2 contains twelve institutions each managing the training data sampled from radar stations located in the same federal state of germany in this environment all low sized data sets from institutions i 1 i 5 are eliminated through merging with larger data sets extending from the previous experiments environment 2 enables further analysing the effect of these miniature data sets on da the effects of the elimination of smallest institutions in environment 2 might overshadow the general consequences of reducing the number of institutions thus the number of institutions is reduced once more resulting in environment 3 to establish this environment the rw coverage area is split into four quadrants of equal size each institution from environment 3 manages the combined training data sampled from the same quadrant of the rw coverage area with creation of this environment no further low sized institutions are eliminated resulting in the focus lying on the general effect of reducing the number of institutions we find that ciil benefits from a smaller network as the median performance increases by approximately 4 9 which means that ciil does not scale well the more stations collaborate on the training for fl the first reduction to twelve institutions resulted in improved performance while the second to four institutions has led to worse performance these described experiments have been summarised in table 3 5 discussion in our experiments the synraingan model was utilised to probe the feasibility of da with respect to distributed hydrological data we have conducted multiple experiments including the training of synraingan with variously configured da approaches fl and ciil to compare the performances with the cl approach our results have shown that the highest scored generator from ciil achieved a score within the error margins of the highest scored cl rainfall generator showing that the approaches produce comparable results we argue that the sampling algorithm applied to each data set produces different outputs indicating a possible reason for the lower performance caused by less opportunity for the synraingan to generalise additionally it has become evident that ciil is severely unstable with high performance drops occurring this instability indicated by a high standard deviation during training is a sign of so called catastrophic forgetting sheller et al 2020 this phenomenon is prevalent in recent ciil studies and is caused by models favouring the most recently seen training data thus primarily caused by institution hops during training sheller et al 2020 2018 hence our study results meet the outcomes of other studies for this phenomenon to be noticeable in training on precipitation events the data distributions of the institutions must differ this is the case for training on 23 institutions due to institutions with comparatively low amounts of data miniature institutions this data sparsity in institutions was shown to cause drops in performance although becoming negligible with increasing data set sizes nevertheless eliminating these miniature institutions through combination to larger institutions only slightly improved the standard deviation therefore the data distributions must also differ in aspects other than size one such difference may arise due to institutions managing precipitation data captured in differing regions which might be more vulnerable to high intensity rainfall events and might influence the training at each institution these weather conditions may vary enough to be noticeable during ciil increasing epc per institution caused the extent of this phenomenon to grow this increase is expected as more extensive training on data from one institution implies that training on the next institution s data set results in greater adjustments to the synraingan parameters since the next station possibly provides different patterns decreasing the number of institutions through the combination of such also mitigates performance drops most likely due to larger data sets and less drastic shifts in distribution occurring between institution hops instead of continuous successive training ciil fl aggregates multiple separately trained models the best rainfall generator from fl performed 7 5 better than the cl counterpart with the median performance being 10 8 higher the superiority of fl is a consistent pattern in a related fl study by sheller et al the fl approach has not exceeded the data shared approaches performance in such a way sheller et al 2020 furthermore fl resulted in increased stability during training given by the lower standard deviation which might be based on the model averaging as it is conducted during fl such an ensemble typically produces better performing models and increases stability barutçuoğlu and alpaydın 2003 we also note differing data distributions due to regional differences in precipitation data which could also have an effect on training while such significant shifts in data composition may have negatively affected ciil they might benefit fl due to the strategy being executed in parallel instead of sequentially the subsequent synraingan aggregation by fl enables the combination of the learning processes instead of instantly training the synraingan on dissimilar data as with ciil however we find that an increased epc parameter has resulted in worse performance pointing towards some catastrophic forgetting during fl before aggregation as it is shown in table 3 this phenomenon is expected as more extended consecutive training of each institution on a previously aggregated synraingan biases its output towards the institutions data these shortcomings caused by catastrophic forgetting seem to be eliminated by aggregation of the institutions synraingans we have shown that the application of fl and ciil for synraingan training is feasible yielding rainfall generators with realistic output we have revealed that ciil is most likely not suited for even larger scale applications 23 institutions e g integration of citizen data sets of training on rainfall data due to the implications of catastrophic forgetting on the other hand fl seems to be a suitable approach and excels in environments with many individual institutions although institutions with insufficient data negatively influence fl one possible way to mitigate this might be to aggregate the synraingans with weighted averages corresponding to institutions data set sizes the threats to the validity of our study results are mainly based on the high computational complexity of the sampling and evaluation methods as well as data inconsistencies like differences in the centralised and decentralised data due to the randomness of the sliding window approach during sampling although the proposed synraingan architecture was shown to generate realistic synthetic rainfall events a more optimal architecture might exist the experimental results and derived conclusion might differ for other model architectures although the focus of our work has been on the application of da to an exemplary task a distributed environment drw for da application to synraingan training was created by partitioning the centralised rw data set the rw data set represents a composite of multiple radar stations and the goal was to reverse this composition process the reversal of this process has not been possible to the fullest extent due to overlapping values being consolidated during composition thus the distributed environment does not fully represent the actual rainfall data captured by the radar stations with irregularities in areas where radars overlap furthermore the utilised historical data contains a remarkable amount of noise likely attributable to measurement errors see fig 8 however we argue these problems of data inconsistencies are negligible since the synraingan was shown to generalise well even given wide spread noise during ciil the order in which the institutions train during a cycle has been fixed a different order of institutions would undoubtedly produce different results likewise with 23 possible combinations of institution orders existing for 23 institutions probing all these would not be computationally feasible based on the instability analysis within cycles we can conclude that inserting small institutions between large ones most likely would result in a close to optimal order minimising performance drops and increasing the overall performance based on our results we cannot generalise our insights as the outcome depends on the chosen setup it might be probable that a more suitable sequence might exists nevertheless according to the definition by sheller et al we interpret the sequence selection as part of the hyper parameter tuning which has played a minor role in our study since we mainly focused on the demonstration of the da capabilities sheller et al 2020 6 conclusion and future work the decentralised nature of precipitation data captured in multiple highly distributed radar stations has motivated the objective of investigating the feasibility of da on decentralised rainfall data the proposed synraingan architecture represents a modified version of the dcgan architecture adjusted for the given use case of generating high intensity synthetic rainfall data the synraingan takes 32 32 rainfall events as training input and produces rainfall generators capable of synthesising such events from random noise the high intensity training input has been sampled from a centralised rainfall data set with the proposed sampling algorithm to test the architecture this algorithm contributes a method of extracting small scale rainfall events from historical spatio temporal data sets employing various input parameters such as size and level of intensity with synraingan we contribute model architecture which enables the synthesis of highly realistic rainfall events a statement supported by visual and statistical analysis this statistical analysis has been conducted applying a custom implementation of the 1nnc approach which is reliable albeit computationally complex to simulate a distributed environment for the application of da training strategies fl and ciil the rw rainfall data set has been partitioned into 23 individual data sets these sets contain data captured by corresponding 23 radar stations which contributed to the centralised rw data set experiments have been conducted by applying the fl and ciil paradigms to synraingan training in the simulated distributed environment the experiment results led us to conclude that training rainfall generators on decentralised rainfall data is feasible and reduces the costs of transferring data to a central location however the degree of feasibility depends on the environment and utilised training approach ciil generally performed worse than fl in all regards and performed on par with cl ciil performance was lower when confronted with high numbers of institutions sparse data institutions and more epochs per institution in such scenarios the extent to which the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting occurred is more severe on the other hand fl was well suited in the given decentralised environment and even outperformed the data sharing approach by 7 5 a higher number of institutions was shown to be beneficial to the approach we conclude that the most likely reason for this lies in the spatial nature of the training data this enabled the synraingan trained on fl to generalise more such patterns individually during parallel training on institutional data 6 1 future work our synraingan architecture gives one such generative model with potential for application in model training for pluvial flood forecasting one such forecasting approach which might benefit from synraingan is floodgan by hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 the synthetic high intensity rainfall data can supplement the floodgan training to produce more reliable flood predictions as future work we intend to achieve compatibility between decentrally trained synraingan and floodgan to avoid the overhead of data centralisation furthermore many radar stations from citizen scientists exist throughout europe individually capturing such data applying fl in such environments could eliminate privacy and data ownership concerns possibilities for future research might also include the investigation of other decentralised data products in the da scenario for several use cases like nowcasting or drought prediction credit authorship contribution statement sascha

3005,recent heavy rainfall induced flood events for example in germany australia and usa have highlighted the relevance of countermeasures in saving human lives and preventing property damage newly introduced ml based flood forecasting methods rely on high intensity synthetic rainfall events due to the sparsity of their real counterpart such synthetic data instances can be produced by precipitation generators trained in an adversarial setting on historical rainfall data capturing processes for rainfall data are often highly distributed with multiple radar stations contributing to a centralised data set however data centralisation entails challenges regarding data stream logistics data locality and memory overhead distributed analytics da aims to overcome these challenges through decentralised model training by bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa in this work we propose a feasibility study evaluating the applicability of da on hydrological data as example of use we choose the decentralised training of rainfall data generators we introduce a rainfall generator training procedure relying on generative adversarial networks gans and evaluate two da algorithms federated learning fl and cyclic institutional incremental learning ciil we compare the resulting training outcomes with the centralised model training cl approach and find ciil performed similarly to cl but less stable while fl outperformed cl by 7 5 we conclude that the proven feasibility of fl in our simulated distributed setting lays the groundwork for utilising this approach in realistic environments of grander scale while overcoming potential privacy concerns or logistical challenges in the setting of centralised analytics keywords hydrological data distributed data distributed analytics data generation 1 introduction with worldwide weather extremes expected to gain in frequency and intensity heavy rainfall induced floods pose an increasing risk to property and civilian security seneviratne et al 2012 hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 this subject has especially acquired momentum after e g the july 2021 floods in western germany and numerous other worldwide flash

importance of reliable real time modelling of urban pluvial floods flood management and conceptualisation of disaster response strategies hofmann and schüttrumpf 2019 2021 despite their high accuracy and success in flood modelling applications physically based models have long computation times and therefore are of limited use for real time modelling henonin et al 2013 löwe et al 2017 against this backdrop different machine learning ml approaches have been developed to overcome the computation time bottleneck of physically based flood models bermúdez et al 2018 2019 kim et al 2019a recently a new ml approach using adversarial training techniques for pluvial flood modelling has gained considerable attention and outperformed existing ml architectures hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 while this approach has shown promising results in terms of computation speed and accuracy its reliability highly depends on the availability of realistic and high quality rainfall data a common procedure to collect adequate data is the aggregation of different datasets from geographically distributed measuring sites for example the radolan 2 2 radolan available online https www dwd de de leistungen radolan radolan html accessed 01 september 2021 procedure centralises and combines data from 17 radar stations to create composite rainfall maps 3 3 composite creation available online https www dwd de de forschung wettervorhersage met fachverfahren wetterradarverfahren komposit erstellung node html accessed 01 september 2021 however the process of centralising data to a single location is often accompanied by logistical challenges such as a steady data uplink between multiple measuring sites involving a sufficiently large bandwidth and stationary failure management additionally the data storage requirements could constitute an emerging problem if the time resolution of the data is increased and more data is transmitted to the central server the dilemma becomes even worse if researchers aim to gain insights about rare events e g high intensity precipitation data which implies that complete datasets must be downloaded in order to achieve a sufficiently large dataset lastly the lack of data has been recently approached by involving data using crowdsourcing platforms or measuring sites from citizen scientists nonetheless the rising role of citizen data for specific use cases pose additional challenges like data ownership and other legal issues which must be solved first meier et al 2017 krennert et al 2018 solutions for these prevalent challenges originate from distributed analytics da da resembles a paradigm shift in that it brings the analysis to the data instead of vice versa welten et al 2021 limited to model training applications da overcomes the previously mentioned challenges associated with data centralisation by having institutions train models on their data locally instead of participating in data sharing sheller et al 2020 consequently data stays within institutional borders and data premises keep the control over their data at any time this paradigm limits the data exchange e g model parameters and analysis code to a necessary minimum and enables data analysis without preceding download of vast amounts of data however while da was shown to be feasible in the medical domain as models trained using da in a decentralised environment performed comparably to those trained on centralised data an application of da to hydrological data has not been deeply investigated yet sheller et al 2020 2018 chang et al 2018 1 1 objective our goal is the application of well established da methods to hydrological data demonstrating the feasibility of such approaches in this domain due to the sparsity of actual high intensity rainfall events in historical datasets we have chosen a use case which includes the development and training of data generators specialised in the creation of high intensity precipitation data these generators can then supplement other data driven applications such as pluvial flood prediction with practically unlimited rainfall data in this work we aim to circumvent the mentioned data centralisation overhead and simulate ml model training at each data premise i e radar stations we tested the hypothesis that decentrally trained data generators for synthetic rainfall data can replace their centrally trained counterparts and approach this setting by evaluating different training heuristics and their synthetic data quality 1 2 findings and contributions this work showcases a method of generating new and realistic high intensity synthetic rainfall events using decentralised model training these synthetic rainfall events are generated by rainfall generators based on a generative adversarial network architecture our model denoted synraingan receives historical high intensity rainfall events sampled from an open source data distribution as training input for the sampling procedure an algorithm has been implemented enabling sampling per various levels of precipitation which has been used to create the training set testing the architecture in a centralised environment showed that it produces rainfall generators synthesising realistic high intensity rainfall events as opposed to historical rainfall events the synthetic data showed no signs of noise these findings show that synthetic rainfall data eliminates data sparsity and proves to be more reliable and flexible for use since rainfall data capturing processes are highly distributed the feasibility of training rainfall generators on decentralised rainfall data has been evaluated by applying da in a simulated distributed environment we simulate the setting of several data managing institutions by partitioning an open source rainfall dataset from the german weather service dwd according to its spatial dimensions along approximated radar station boundaries subsequently we have trained synraingan in this environment using the da approaches of federated learning fl and cyclic incremental institutional learning ciil the resulting models have been capable of generating new and realistic synthetic rainfall events fl has been able to produce rainfall generators performing 7 5 better than the centralised approach called centralised learning cl while ciil performed comparatively to cl we conclude that training generative models in a decentralised hydrological data environment is feasible our approach could open up entirely new possibilities for generative model training for example hundreds of citizen radar stations located in germany could be integrated into analysis or training processes assisting existing official radar stations and eliminating a potentially complicated centralisation process with potential data privacy concerns 4 4 citizen radar stations available online https kachelmannwetter com de amateurstationen deutschland niederschlag 20210721 1200z html accessed 01

generators for synthetic rainfall data on a centralised and decentralised data basis further in section 4 we present our experiment outcomes and evaluate them according to our quality metric in section 5 we discuss the results of the experiments and section 6 provides a conclusion and details future work 2 related work this section covers related work in hydrological data analysis section 2 1 and provides insights into the current state of the art in da section 2 2 2 1 hydrological data hydrological data captures processes occurring in various hydrological systems e g precipitation groundwater levels or streamflow this data is relevant to grasping the behaviour of a particular setting and is the basis for risk management through predictive modelling 5 5 the importance of hydrological data available online https www hydrology org uk hydrological data php accessed 01 september 2021 typical applications of hydrological data and models utilising such data lie in water resources management weather forecasting and infrastructure design andersson et al 2015 hydrological data capturing processes are inherently decentralised motivating the application of da to analytical tasks in this field especially radar based precipitation data is relevant in this regard radolan radar online aneichung calibration is one of such procedures capturing precipitation events and has been in routine operation since june 2005 in real time operation radolan provides area wide spatially and temporally highly resolved quantitative precipitation data through an hourly combination of precipitation values measured at 17 ground based c band radar stations in germany kreklow et al 2020 these radar stations capture precipitation values by measuring signals reflected by precipitation in the atmosphere the german weather service dwd offers various radolan products related to historical precipitation data on the open data dwd server differing in spatial temporal and intensity resolution of the data wetterdienst 2016 such radolan products have seen use in various applications e g retrospective analysis and prognosis of erosion related to precipitation occurrences fischer 2019 müller et al 2016 deumlich 2011 additionally zhang et al already has utilised rainfall generators capable of generating sequences of synthetic extreme rainfall data based on radar data zhang et al 2019b nevertheless since 2005 multiple hundred gigabytes of raw data 6 6 for example the dwd open data server https opendata dwd de have been generated which pose a growing overhead for model development because conventionally these data products must be downloaded priorly the data volume even grows further if we increase the time resolution of the radolan products at this point the amount of raw data increases up to terabyte range to circumvent this storage overhead da poses a valuable option 2 2 distributed analytics by nature hydrological data e g rainfall data is highly distributed across city federal state or even country borders wetterdienst 2016 the consequence is the necessity of a data centralisation workflow which poses several challenges such as the locality of data as we have mentioned before sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 for example from a logistical and technical perspective data from multiple radar stations has to be centralised first in order to perform any analysis this requires steady and consistent data streams to the central data repository which transfers amounts of data every hour in real time wetterdienst 2016 further data centralisation has the immanent danger of a single point of failure which hinders data analysis the logistical overhead might become even more complex if we involve citizens as data providers who support the crowdsourcing of additional data products which might foster reliable data analysis but the data ownership might not be clearly solved meier et al 2017 sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 bell et al 2015 snik et al 2014 from an abstract perspective the current state of the art brings data to the analysis which comes along with the above mentioned challenges the concepts of da follow a paradigm shift da aims to overcome these challenges by having data premises collaboratively take part in analytical processes without transmitting their data to a central location by bringing the algorithm to the data instead of vice versa as data remains within institutional borders bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 da is helpful in environments that are heavily distributed and produce high volumes of data sheller et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 hard et al 2019 in such environments data centralisation processes for central model training might pose a significant bottleneck leading to distributed model training approaches being more feasible because the communication costs are comparatively small if we solely transmit analysis code e g model updates or gradients bonawitz et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021a in the following we will present two common da approaches which can be found in the literature and have been especially applied in the healthcare domain sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021a b welten et al 2022 as an overview we have depicted these two methods in fig 1 federated learning mcmahan et al first introduced fl due to the difficulties involved with training models on decentralised data from mobile devices bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 kerkouche et al 2021a fl follows the da paradigm associated with parallel execution of model training tasks and has been applied in several domains bonawitz et al 2019 mcmahan et al 2017 hard et al 2019 kerkouche et al 2021b during the fl process see fig 1 data managing institutions refrain from sharing their data to a central location and instead share updates of models locally trained on their data these models are sent out by a server located at a central location after receiving model updates the server aggregates them marking the completion of a federated round optionally the aggregated model parameters may be sent to the institutions for further training rounds in the medical domain sheller et al applied fl to brain tumour segmentation and concluded that the approach yields models performing similarly to models trained in a centralised environment sheller et al 2020 2018 fl has also been utilised in smartphone next word keyboard prediction and blockchain settings hard et al 2019 kim et al 2019b institutional incremental learning instead of parallel training the institutional incremental learning iil methodology also referred to as weight transfer wt covers the da paradigm of successive executions of model training tasks welten et al 2021 chang et al 2018 each collaborating institution trains a shared model exactly once with the model being successively transmitted between institutions an extension to this method is cyclic iil ciil in which this process is repeated for a given number of cycles chang et al 2018 ciil has been applied to several use cases in e g the healthcare care domain sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 mou et al 2021 the experimental study by chang et al has shown that the model trained by ciil achieve results comparable to the centralised approach chang et al 2018 mou welten et al have applied ciil to model training for skin lesion detection and have shown a similar performance to the centralised model training mou et al 2021 sheller et al has compared the above mentioned fl approach for the brain tumour segmentation with ciil and has revealed that fl performs superiorly sheller et al 2018 2020 as we have shown the immanent characteristic of hydrological data is its distribution across multiple data sites causing considerations about efficiency and data locality these challenges are even exacerbated if we aim to learn from rare events e g high intensity precipitation events which enforces downloads of entire datasets to extract enough training data in this work we address these challenges by performing model training decentrally we exemplarily show how data generators for high intensity data can be developed by retaining data instances at their origin the concept and the model training approach is presented in the next section 3 concept in this section we present our concept for the decentralised training of rainfall data generators we first start with the dataset selection and the associated sampling procedure to extract high intensity rainfall data for the generator training in section 3 1 then we present the used model architecture which we train to generate synthetic precipitation data in section 3 2 finally we delve into the application of the above mentioned da methods section 2 in our scenario fig 2 illustrates the simulated scenario from a top level perspective note that we have made all development artefacts available online 7 7 https github com sawelt hydroda 3 1 dataset selection and preprocessing raw dataset one open source accessible precipitation data repository is the open data server of the dwd which provides various radolan data products 8 8 radolan products available online https opendata dwd de climate environment cdc grids germany homyehosty radolan historical bin accessed 01 september 2021 with multiple radolan products being available we have chosen the rw product which is a composite of precipitation data from multiple radar stations and thus can be regarded as a centralised data set originating from multiple data sources rw consists of over 130 000 encoded historical rainfall events measured by multiple radar stations the spatial temporal and intensity resolutions of these events are 1 km 2 1 h and 1 0 1 mm h respectively wetterdienst 2016 each radar station has a horizontal range of about 150 km these historical rainfall events cover 900 km 2 mainly over germany and represent the summed up rainfall values captured by a varying number of radar stations within one hour therefore each hour beginning june 1 2005 is represented as an event in this data set wetterdienst 2016 for this work the timespan of hourly rainfall events captured is limited to june 1 2005 december 31 2020 in our study this raw data set contains a total of 136 539 rainfall events and amounts to 204 gb it is subsequently referred to as rw data set each 900 km 2 rainfall event is encoded in a data file containing a header section and a binary section separated by an end of text character the header encodes various information e g intensity resolution or date of measurement the binary section contains 810 000 double bytes each encoding one rainfall value little endian wetterdienst 2016 interpreting each double byte at a time enables the construction of a 900 900 cartesian coordinate system modelling a 900 km 2 rainfall event due to the spatial resolution of 1 km 2 each precipitation value measures the hourly rainfall per km 2 these values are either integer values v 0 1 4095 or undefined no value measured the given intensity resolution of 1 0 1 mm h indicates that an integer value of v represents rainfall intensity of v 10 mm h wetterdienst 2016 the first double byte of the binary section represents the rainfall value located at cartesian coordinate 0 0 while double byte 810 000 captures the value at coordinate 899 899 we refer to fig 3 for visualisation of an rw product file the rw data set given the discussed interpretation is utilised to sample smaller scale rainfall events for generator training in a centralised environment simulating a distributed environment as previously mentioned the rw product is a composite of the data recorded by multiple radar stations 23 of which we focus on in this work wetterdienst 2016 in our scenario we simulate a distributed environment by using 23 subsets d r w 1 d r w 23 these data sets resemble the rw product pre composition before the centralisation process however contrary to the rw product the individual radar stations data is not open source accessible thus the composition process which created the rw product must first be reversed this reversal is executed by partitioning each event of the rw data set into several individual events as have been recorded by the radar stations at the time of capture hence each 900 km 2 historical rainfall event is partitioned into 23 300 km 2 rainfall events contained in the corresponding data sets the 300 km 2 size of each event from the distributed environment is caused by each radar station s radius being at most 150 km following the above mentioned approach we apply the following workflow to each rainfall event in rw 1 computing the set of operational radar stations and the corresponding radius r based on the date on which historical rainfall event has been captured 2 defining each operational radar station s bounds around the radar stations cartesian coordinates x y for radius r bresenham 1977 3 extracting the rainfall values recorded within the bounds of each radar station x and adding the corresponding 300 km 2 event to the data set d r w x precipitation values outside the radar are set to u n d e f i n e d building the training set based on d r w 1 d r w 23 we build our distributed training sets for the model training ideally the training input should have the same format as the desired rainfall generator output to facilitate model training in this work we define the input format as a 32 km 2 area covering high intensity rainfall events as we aim to generate such type of data since rainfall events from the drw data sets cover an area of 300 km 2 we sample from each high dimensional event several 32 32 matrices representing 32 km 2 rainfall events to build up 23 training sets nonetheless this naïve procedure does not guarantee that each training instance contains a region of high intensity rainfall data we extend this procedure by a cluster detection algorithm which finds accumulations of high intensity rainfall values in the 300 km 2 area the sampling algorithm works as follows if the sampling algorithm detects a cluster it spans a 32 km 2 patch around each accumulation subsequently we apply data augmentation by randomly shifting the bounds of the patch in each of the four directions such that the cluster continues to lie within these bounds this procedure establishes four areas each containing the cluster and resembles a two dimensional sliding window concept see fig 4 employing this method results in larger data sets of higher variation and enables a better model generalisation during training mikołajczyk and grochowski 2018 after applying this procedure to each of the 23 data sets we have obtained our distributed training data for the rainfall data generators note that our scenario is simulated usually data pre processing and harmonisation across distributed data sources is an additional challenge involving intensive coordination between the data premises in our setting we implicitly assume that this coordination has been done priorly as it is not part of our study next we present our generator composition which us trained on these data sets decentrally 3 2 model creation training and evaluation metric model creation training procedure generative models pose a valuable option to supplement model training if data of specific type e g high intensity precipitation is sparse one popular approach is the development of generative adversarial networks gans which have been applied to the hydrology domain and geosciences already goodfellow et al 2014 creswell et al 2018 scher and peßenteiner 2021 leinonen et al 2021 applied to unsupervised learning tasks some of the most frequent uses of gans include image generation or image to image translation zhang et al 2019b creswell et al 2018 liu et al 2017 yi et al 2017 brock et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a worth mentioning another prominent class of generative models are variational autoencoders which are applicable in the fields of image generation or reconstruction kingma and welling 2013 hou et al 2017 huang et al 2018 nevertheless we have decided to use gans in our study since our work mainly focuses on the applicability of da on precipitation data rather than finding the best performing model architecture a gan consists of two adversaries the generative model generator g and the discriminative model discriminator d goodfellow et al 2014 creswell et al 2018 g transforms input noise variables sampled from a random distribution into synthesised data which is a 32 km 2 rainfall event in our case simultaneously d aims to distinguish between the synthetic input from g and real data goodfellow et al 2014 g s training goal is the generation of high quality synthetic data instances which are indistinguishable from real data consequently g can be implicitly used to generate high intensity precipitation data in our work we apply deep convolutional generative adversarial networks dcgans which expand upon the gan framework by utilising an architecture based on convolutional neural networks cnns radford et al 2015 initial experiments have shown that the training with the standard dcgan architecture has exhibited unstable behaviour due to this reason we decided to diverge from this model architecture we have explored several combinations of layer and activation functions until we have found a model architecture that is used in our main experiments we have summarised the structure of our synraingan in table 1 the size of our model amounts to 50 mb which have to be transmitted between the institutions and represents a significant reduction of communication cost compared to the centralisation of raw data during a training epoch the weights of g and d are updated based on batches of 32 32 historical rainfall events we divide an epoch into two phases 1 d is trained on a randomly sampled half batch of training data labelled as such then g generates a half batch of differently labelled synthetic data which d also trains on this phase is repeated until d correctly distinguishes synthetic and actual data from each other with a pre defined accuracy of d a c c 0 1 see fig 5a 2 g is trained by combining g and d into one model first g generates synthetic data these training instances are passed forward through d without any weight update through extended backpropagation the weights of g are finally updated see fig 5b creswell et al 2018 training strategies we introduce three gan training strategies differentiated by the environment in which they are applied the cl strategy represents the traditional method of training gans on a single local data set the high intensity training data set for cl is sampled from the rw data set representing the centralised approach the gan is subsequently trained by repetition of the above mentioned training procedure we consider cl as our baseline since it represents the state of the art in model training in contrast to cl da see section 2 2 is simulated by training on multiple data sets d r w 1 d r w 23 each managed by a radar station in this study we evaluate two da approaches fl and ciil see section 2 2 during fl each institution independently trains a copy of synraingan on its data set for epc epochs per cycle per institution epochs afterwards the replicas are aggregated by instantiating an updated global model with their weights being the average of all synraingan replica weights with the assignation of the aggregated models to each institution one federated round comes to an end for simplicity federated rounds are referred to as cycles for ciil the radar stations are arranged into a sequence according to their id in alphabetical order training via ciil begins with the first institution of this sequence training the gan by repeating epc training procedures on the training data set of the corresponding station synraingan is passed on to each institution until each institution has subsequently trained it completing one cycle this procedure can be repeated for several cycles performance evaluation metric to compare cl with both decentralised strategies and assign scores to each generator we apply the so called 1 nearest neighbour classifier 1nnc approach which has been explained in more detail in figure 6 lopez paz and oquab 2016 guan and loew 2020 we have chosen this evaluation methodology because an nnc only requires a distance metric in contrast alternative approaches like the inception score involve pre trained auxiliary models which have to be adapted according to our setting guan and loew 2020 we consider this evaluation metric because first the gan accuracy does not give any conclusion about the quality of the synthetic data and second the accuracy is fixed during each training procedure using the threshold parameter d a c c therefore a more sophisticated quality metric is needed which compares the generated data with real data the intuition is that if the synthetic data is indistinguishable from the real world data the generator has learned how to produce real data and is of high quality in detail 1nnc works as follows the classifier compares two differently labelled batches r real of size n and s synthetic by classifying each element of both batches to its nearest neighbour from either sample set if the element and its nearest neighbour are from the same batch the resulting accuracy is 1 with the averaged accuracy of all classifications providing a corresponding score r and s are identical if 1 n n c 0 5 i e the classifier finds them impossible to distinguish b in fig 6 a score of 1 n n c 0 5 means that the gan overfits r a in fig 6 while 1 n n c 0 5 shows dissimilarity between the two data distributions c in fig 6 guan et al regularised the 1nnc score introducing the simplified r1nnc score with a best worst value of 1 0 guan and loew 2020 xu et al 2018 r 1 n n c 2 1 n n c 1 1 since the outcome of the 1nnc metric depends on the selected datasets r and s for the evaluation we repeat the evaluation several times and build the average after presenting our scenario of de centralised model training we conduct several experiments and evaluate the performance of each training strategy in the next section 4 4 experiments in this section we first present the experiment including synraingan trained on centralised rainfall data ultimately the synraingan architecture is applied in a simulated distributed setting using fl and ciil 4 1 overview to establish a training set of high intensity rainfall events for application of the cl approach the sampling algorithm see section 3 is applied to the rw data set the resulting set denoted d 1 contains 261 613 32 32 high intensity rainfall events analogously the distributed environment is realised with 23 individual training data sets d r w 1 d r w 23 representing the corresponding radar station s data the explicit data distribution across the radar station network can be found online 9 9 https github com sawelt hydroda we further combine multiple training data sets simulating varying numbers of institutions in the network to gain insights about the scalability of our approach all synraingan instances utilise the adam optimisation algorithm with hyper parameters α 0 0002 β 1 0 9 β 2 0 999 and ϵ 1 0 8 including the binary cross entropy loss function kingma and ba 2014 the mini batch size is 128 which means that each learner uses the same batch size of 128 constantly for a synraingan performance evaluation metric the 1nnc method see section 3 is utilised to stabilise this scoring procedure each application averages 100 1nnc evaluations on 0 3 784 instances of the training data this decision is based on the time complexity of the knnc as the calculation time for the evaluation score significantly increases with the number of instances we therefore have to find a trade off between evaluation accuracy and time consumption during synraingan training the normalised r1nnc score rounded to the fourth decimal place is evaluated in a uniform interval of epochs note that the optimal value of this score is 1 while the worst possible value is 0 4 2 centralised model training we conduct our central model training using different discriminator accuracy constraints d a c c section 3 the arbitrarily chosen initial value of d a c c 0 8 discriminator training threshold per epoch was increased by 0 05 repetitively in three executions of synraingan training in total training performance of four synraingans are compared differing in training hyper parameters d a c c 0 8 0 85 0 9 0 95 we find that the increasing value d a c c improved training stability 10 10 we interpret the training stability as the range of the boxplots the narrower the range is the more stable is the training with the distribution of r1nnc scores becoming narrower see fig 7a the best rainfall generator instance arose from training with d a c c 0 9 after 6150 epochs and is labelled g 6150 r1nnc score of 0 8473 note all subsequent experiments utilise d a c c 0 9 for synraingan training beyond the analysis of the accuracy as shown above we also investigate the synthetic output of synraingan supported by its high r1nnc score and visual examination g 6150 generates synthetic rainfall events with high resemblance to corresponding training samples indicating a successful training see fig 8 however the data distributions of synthetic data and training data are not identical because the r1nnc score does not approximately equal the optimal value of 1 despite dissimilar distribution we detect a reduction of noise in the synthetic data instances as it can be seen in fig 8 therefore the output of synraingan does not show measuring errors in other words synraingan has a noise cancelling effect on the input data 4 3 decentralised model training in the following the results of synraingan training in the simulated decentralised precipitation data environment are presented as this work represents a feasibility study the objective of these experiments is the demonstration of the da capabilities by producing comparable results for detailed enumeration of all scores we refer to table 2 we have found that all strategies converge at a similar pace see fig 9 furthermore significant performance drops were consistently observed for ciil fl was by far the most stable approach with the lowest score deviations outperforming cl and ciil in this regard see fig 9 the highest r1nnc score from fl was 7 5 higher than the cl counterpart furthermore the median score of fl was 10 8 higher than the cl median ciil generally performed worse or comparatively than fl and cl with its highest score being 6 9 lower than the highest fl score and 12 7 lower than the median score respectively on the other hand the maximum ciil score is similar to the cl score nevertheless the median score is slightly below cl 3 2 the performance drop and the high deviations during ciil training see fig 9 b has motivated us to shortly investigate this phenomenon in more detail as shown in fig 9 we find high fluctuations in performance yielding less stability during training a slight correlation can be found between an institutions data set size and the r1nnc score performance after training on the institution as depicted in fig 10 on average training on data from the smallest institutions i 1 i 5 led to a continuous decrease of the score during training see fig 10 this behaviour can be explained with overfitting as the model tends to overfit the data of the smaller institutions and loses the ability to generalise after training on these institutions the performance increases again as more data is available at subsequent stations e g i 6 i 23 the performance therefore fluctuates within each cycle causing high deviations and unstable model training as a consequence we derive two important insights from the ciil experiments first as fig 10 implies varying data set sizes between institutions counteract a stable model training and second the order of the institutions also affect the performance as multiple low sized institutions in succession cause performance drops this phenomenon has been already partially demonstrated in related work sheller et al 2018 chang et al 2018 we have further investigated the behaviour of ciil in a different scenario which involves a reduction of institutions the previous da experiments were conducted in an environment of 23 institutions arranged in a sequence each institutions manages a high intensity rainfall event data set sampled from the historical data distribution of the corresponding radar station two new environments are now introduced to study the effect of fewer institutions during da in these environments each institution may manage training data sets combining the sampled historical rainfall events from multiple radar stations environment 2 contains twelve institutions each managing the training data sampled from radar stations located in the same federal state of germany in this environment all low sized data sets from institutions i 1 i 5 are eliminated through merging with larger data sets extending from the previous experiments environment 2 enables further analysing the effect of these miniature data sets on da the effects of the elimination of smallest institutions in environment 2 might overshadow the general consequences of reducing the number of institutions thus the number of institutions is reduced once more resulting in environment 3 to establish this environment the rw coverage area is split into four quadrants of equal size each institution from environment 3 manages the combined training data sampled from the same quadrant of the rw coverage area with creation of this environment no further low sized institutions are eliminated resulting in the focus lying on the general effect of reducing the number of institutions we find that ciil benefits from a smaller network as the median performance increases by approximately 4 9 which means that ciil does not scale well the more stations collaborate on the training for fl the first reduction to twelve institutions resulted in improved performance while the second to four institutions has led to worse performance these described experiments have been summarised in table 3 5 discussion in our experiments the synraingan model was utilised to probe the feasibility of da with respect to distributed hydrological data we have conducted multiple experiments including the training of synraingan with variously configured da approaches fl and ciil to compare the performances with the cl approach our results have shown that the highest scored generator from ciil achieved a score within the error margins of the highest scored cl rainfall generator showing that the approaches produce comparable results we argue that the sampling algorithm applied to each data set produces different outputs indicating a possible reason for the lower performance caused by less opportunity for the synraingan to generalise additionally it has become evident that ciil is severely unstable with high performance drops occurring this instability indicated by a high standard deviation during training is a sign of so called catastrophic forgetting sheller et al 2020 this phenomenon is prevalent in recent ciil studies and is caused by models favouring the most recently seen training data thus primarily caused by institution hops during training sheller et al 2020 2018 hence our study results meet the outcomes of other studies for this phenomenon to be noticeable in training on precipitation events the data distributions of the institutions must differ this is the case for training on 23 institutions due to institutions with comparatively low amounts of data miniature institutions this data sparsity in institutions was shown to cause drops in performance although becoming negligible with increasing data set sizes nevertheless eliminating these miniature institutions through combination to larger institutions only slightly improved the standard deviation therefore the data distributions must also differ in aspects other than size one such difference may arise due to institutions managing precipitation data captured in differing regions which might be more vulnerable to high intensity rainfall events and might influence the training at each institution these weather conditions may vary enough to be noticeable during ciil increasing epc per institution caused the extent of this phenomenon to grow this increase is expected as more extensive training on data from one institution implies that training on the next institution s data set results in greater adjustments to the synraingan parameters since the next station possibly provides different patterns decreasing the number of institutions through the combination of such also mitigates performance drops most likely due to larger data sets and less drastic shifts in distribution occurring between institution hops instead of continuous successive training ciil fl aggregates multiple separately trained models the best rainfall generator from fl performed 7 5 better than the cl counterpart with the median performance being 10 8 higher the superiority of fl is a consistent pattern in a related fl study by sheller et al the fl approach has not exceeded the data shared approaches performance in such a way sheller et al 2020 furthermore fl resulted in increased stability during training given by the lower standard deviation which might be based on the model averaging as it is conducted during fl such an ensemble typically produces better performing models and increases stability barutçuoğlu and alpaydın 2003 we also note differing data distributions due to regional differences in precipitation data which could also have an effect on training while such significant shifts in data composition may have negatively affected ciil they might benefit fl due to the strategy being executed in parallel instead of sequentially the subsequent synraingan aggregation by fl enables the combination of the learning processes instead of instantly training the synraingan on dissimilar data as with ciil however we find that an increased epc parameter has resulted in worse performance pointing towards some catastrophic forgetting during fl before aggregation as it is shown in table 3 this phenomenon is expected as more extended consecutive training of each institution on a previously aggregated synraingan biases its output towards the institutions data these shortcomings caused by catastrophic forgetting seem to be eliminated by aggregation of the institutions synraingans we have shown that the application of fl and ciil for synraingan training is feasible yielding rainfall generators with realistic output we have revealed that ciil is most likely not suited for even larger scale applications 23 institutions e g integration of citizen data sets of training on rainfall data due to the implications of catastrophic forgetting on the other hand fl seems to be a suitable approach and excels in environments with many individual institutions although institutions with insufficient data negatively influence fl one possible way to mitigate this might be to aggregate the synraingans with weighted averages corresponding to institutions data set sizes the threats to the validity of our study results are mainly based on the high computational complexity of the sampling and evaluation methods as well as data inconsistencies like differences in the centralised and decentralised data due to the randomness of the sliding window approach during sampling although the proposed synraingan architecture was shown to generate realistic synthetic rainfall events a more optimal architecture might exist the experimental results and derived conclusion might differ for other model architectures although the focus of our work has been on the application of da to an exemplary task a distributed environment drw for da application to synraingan training was created by partitioning the centralised rw data set the rw data set represents a composite of multiple radar stations and the goal was to reverse this composition process the reversal of this process has not been possible to the fullest extent due to overlapping values being consolidated during composition thus the distributed environment does not fully represent the actual rainfall data captured by the radar stations with irregularities in areas where radars overlap furthermore the utilised historical data contains a remarkable amount of noise likely attributable to measurement errors see fig 8 however we argue these problems of data inconsistencies are negligible since the synraingan was shown to generalise well even given wide spread noise during ciil the order in which the institutions train during a cycle has been fixed a different order of institutions would undoubtedly produce different results likewise with 23 possible combinations of institution orders existing for 23 institutions probing all these would not be computationally feasible based on the instability analysis within cycles we can conclude that inserting small institutions between large ones most likely would result in a close to optimal order minimising performance drops and increasing the overall performance based on our results we cannot generalise our insights as the outcome depends on the chosen setup it might be probable that a more suitable sequence might exists nevertheless according to the definition by sheller et al we interpret the sequence selection as part of the hyper parameter tuning which has played a minor role in our study since we mainly focused on the demonstration of the da capabilities sheller et al 2020 6 conclusion and future work the decentralised nature of precipitation data captured in multiple highly distributed radar stations has motivated the objective of investigating the feasibility of da on decentralised rainfall data the proposed synraingan architecture represents a modified version of the dcgan architecture adjusted for the given use case of generating high intensity synthetic rainfall data the synraingan takes 32 32 rainfall events as training input and produces rainfall generators capable of synthesising such events from random noise the high intensity training input has been sampled from a centralised rainfall data set with the proposed sampling algorithm to test the architecture this algorithm contributes a method of extracting small scale rainfall events from historical spatio temporal data sets employing various input parameters such as size and level of intensity with synraingan we contribute model architecture which enables the synthesis of highly realistic rainfall events a statement supported by visual and statistical analysis this statistical analysis has been conducted applying a custom implementation of the 1nnc approach which is reliable albeit computationally complex to simulate a distributed environment for the application of da training strategies fl and ciil the rw rainfall data set has been partitioned into 23 individual data sets these sets contain data captured by corresponding 23 radar stations which contributed to the centralised rw data set experiments have been conducted by applying the fl and ciil paradigms to synraingan training in the simulated distributed environment the experiment results led us to conclude that training rainfall generators on decentralised rainfall data is feasible and reduces the costs of transferring data to a central location however the degree of feasibility depends on the environment and utilised training approach ciil generally performed worse than fl in all regards and performed on par with cl ciil performance was lower when confronted with high numbers of institutions sparse data institutions and more epochs per institution in such scenarios the extent to which the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting occurred is more severe on the other hand fl was well suited in the given decentralised environment and even outperformed the data sharing approach by 7 5 a higher number of institutions was shown to be beneficial to the approach we conclude that the most likely reason for this lies in the spatial nature of the training data this enabled the synraingan trained on fl to generalise more such patterns individually during parallel training on institutional data 6 1 future work our synraingan architecture gives one such generative model with potential for application in model training for pluvial flood forecasting one such forecasting approach which might benefit from synraingan is floodgan by hofmann and schüttrumpf 2021 the synthetic high intensity rainfall data can supplement the floodgan training to produce more reliable flood predictions as future work we intend to achieve compatibility between decentrally trained synraingan and floodgan to avoid the overhead of data centralisation furthermore many radar stations from citizen scientists exist throughout europe individually capturing such data applying fl in such environments could eliminate privacy and data ownership concerns possibilities for future research might also include the investigation of other decentralised data products in the da scenario for several use cases like nowcasting or drought prediction credit authorship contribution statement sascha

3006,conventional water infrastructure designs for flood and low flows are usually based on the assumption of stationarity of extreme events however recent evidence suggests that the influences of climate variability and human activities have made the hypothesis of stationarity questionable in this study we used the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or the reservoir index ri the nonstationary models were then used to analyse annual flood and low flow frequency at four hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the huaihe river basin including dapoling dpl changtaiguan ctg zhuganpu zgp and xixian xx stations annual floods were represented by the maximum daily streamflow in each year and low flows were represented by the 95th quantile of the daily streamflow q95 in each year the change point and trend analysis revealed that the flood series of the zgp station and the low flow series of the dpl and xx stations exhibited significant downward and upward trends p 0 1 respectively the low flow series of the zgp station showed a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 gamlss modelling results showed that in comparison with stationary models nonstationary models that included precipitation and the arctic oscillation climate index as covariates for the gamma distribution location parameter provided a superior description of the flood series at the four stations nonstationary models that incorporated precipitation and or ri as covariates for the weibull distribution parameters fit the low flow series better than stationary models at all stations furthermore we found that nonstationary models outperformed stationary models in terms of flood frequency analysis covering all flood observation points and capturing the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes for the low flow frequency analysis the comparison results showed that the nonstationary and stationary models performed identically for the dpl ctg and xx stations where no significant change point was detected however for the zgp station where a significant change point was detected the nonstationary models performed better than the stationary models and could accurately capture the changes in the magnitude of the estimated low flow values before and after the change point overall the proposed nonstationary model can serve as a tool for nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series under the influence of climate variability and reservoir regulations thus providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design keywords flood low flow nonstationary frequency analysis climatic variables reservoir index data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction floods are one of the most frequent and destructive natural disasters worldwide causing significant economic losses and fatalities every year baldassarre et al 2017 neri et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 flood risk has increased over the past century and is projected to further increase in the future as a result of climate change population growth and economic development sun et al 2018c neri et al 2019 slater et al 2021a another type of streamflow extreme process that is a low flow process is also an important issue in water resource management laaha and blöschl 2005 jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 leong and yokoo 2021 accurate estimates of low flow characteristics are required for multiple purposes in water resource management and engineering including environmental flow requirements water use and discharge into streams and hydropower operations smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2005 2006 floriancic et al 2021 therefore one of the major challenges facing the hydrology field is understanding how flood and low flow events are evolving and how likely they are to unfold beyond their historical distributions under the influence of multiple drivers such as climate variability and human activities lópez and francés 2013 kam and sheffield 2016 gai et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 slater et al 2021a in this respect flood and low flow frequency analysis is commonly used by hydrologists conventional flood and low flow frequency analyses assume that flood or low flow series are independent stationary and identically distributed chen et al 2021 in other words flood or low flow series fluctuate randomly within an unchanging range of variability and are free of trends and abrupt changes however several recent studies have found that climate change anthropogenic interference and land use change have made the hypothesis of stationarity widely questionable salas and obeysekera 2014 du et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 baldassarre et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the international association of hydrological sciences iahs scientific decade 2013 2022 entitled panta rhei everything flows states that global climate and hydrological systems are suffering substantial changes under changing environmental conditions montanari et al 2013 improving our ability to cope with floods in current and future climates necessitates an improved theoretical understanding and the adoption of more sophisticated set of approaches milly et al 2008 pointed out that the stationarity hypothesis should be abandoned and called for innovative thinking or methods to provide reliable and useful estimates of hydrological variables for water management under nonstationary conditions conventional hydrology related planning or designs usually depend on the analysis of the observed data in the past to inform estimation of the corresponding hydrological variables in the future however the present nonstationary conditions mean that the past observed data may no longer provide all necessary information concerning the future statistical behaviour of extreme floods or low flows chen et al 2021 for example increasing trends in the mean flow series may lead to the underestimation of flood quantiles and increase the failure risk of hydraulic structures conversely decreasing trends could result in the overestimation of low flow quantiles and increased costs associated with infrastructure overdesign bayazit 2015 therefore attempting to consider nonstationarity in the process of hydrological frequency analysis is critical for human adaptability to changing environments various concepts and methods for nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis have been proposed in the literature khaliq et al 2006 and salas et al 2018 presented outstanding reviews that included the incorporation of trends in parameter distributions trends in statistical moments the quantile regression method and the local likelihood method the most common approach is to incorporate temporal trends into the parameters of the distributions resulting in a time varying model delgado et al 2010 the time varying model assumes that the parameters of the distributions for frequency analysis fluctuate over time making it a useful tool for reconstructing the hydrological frequency characteristics in addition to time varying nonstationary models some researchers have attempted to incorporate climatic variables and or anthropogenic indicators that can reflect human influence in nonstationary models for frequency analysis the earliest attempt was to incorporate climate indices e g enso pdo and ao indices as external covariates in nonstationary models assuming linear or nonlinear dependence lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 some studies explored the possibility of incorporating meteorological variables e g precipitation and temperature as covariates into nonstationary models du et al 2015 chen et al 2021 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 in addition to climatic variables other studies have incorporated the impact of human activities into nonstationary models villarini et al 2009a incorporated a population index into nonstationary models of flood frequency analysis to describe the impact of land use changes sun et al 2018c and slater et al 2019 considered the influence of agricultural land cover changes in statistical frameworks for seasonal streamflow forecasting and flood frequency evaluations lópez and francés 2013 proposed a reservoir index ri to represent the impacts of reservoir regulations on the streamflow regime they used it as a covariate in nonstationary models to analyse the changes in flood frequency in continental spanish rivers furthermore van ogtrop et al 2011 incorporated climate indices that describe the pacific and indian ocean sea surface temperatures as covariates into the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework to make probabilistic 6 and 12 month forecasts of streamflow occurrence and intensity in australia slater and villarini 2018 and neri et al 2019 used hydro meteorological variables from general circulation models gcms as predictors to conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal and decadal streamflow processes overall the results of the above studies showed that using climatic variables or anthropogenic indicators as covariates in statistical models can improve the description and prediction of streamflow processes however existing studies usually perform nonstationary analysis on either flood or low flow processes and research on driving force attribution and frequency analysis of both nonstationary flood and low flow processes is still limited at present and in the future water conservation engineering design tends to meet more management goals such as ensuring flood prevention and low flow demand simultaneously therefore a comprehensive understanding of these two nonstationary processes will provide valuable insights for extreme event risk assessment water conservancy infrastructure design and water resource management therefore the aim of the present study was to use gamlss to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or the reservoir index ri the nonstationary models were then applied for both flood and low flow frequency analysis the upper reaches of the huaihe river basin hrb were selected to examine the proposed nonstationary model because climate variability and reservoir regulations in this area have impacts on extreme streamflow processes i e flood and low flow according to several studies shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 the study was divided into three parts 1 a change point and trend analysis of flood and low flow series to identify their nonstationary behaviours 2 the construction and validation of nonstationary models and 3 the application of nonstationary models in flood and low flow frequency analysis the proposed nonstationary models in this study are expected to provide a tool for nonstationary flood and low flow frequency analysis in the upper reaches of the hrb thereby providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design and water resource management 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper reaches of the hrb controlled by the xixian hydrological station were selected as the study area fig 1 the study area extends from longitudes 113 25 e to 115 e and latitudes 31 5 n to 32 75 n covering an area of 10190 km2 and lying in transition zone between the mid latitude humid climate and semi arid climate jiang et al 2017 according to previous research shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 climate variability and reservoir regulations influence streamflow processes in the upper reaches of the hrb therefore four hydrological stations fig 1 were selected from the study area to perform the nonstationary frequency analysis including dapoling dpl changtaiguan ctg zhuganpu zgp and xixian xx stations due to the influence of the east asian monsoon approximately 70 of the precipitation and streamflow of the four stations occur between may and september and the annual average temperature of these five months is also the highest of the year 2 2 data daily precipitation data measured by 35 rain gauges streamflow records of four hydrological stations and reservoir information from 1955 to 2016 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the storage capacities control areas and completion years of the nanwan and shishankou reservoirs in the study area were 1630 million and 372 million m3 1090 and 306 km2 and 1955 and 1968 respectively flood data fig 2 a d that is the series of annual maximum daily streamflow were extracted from daily streamflow records from the four hydrological stations lópez and francés 2013 the low flow characteristics fig 2 e h were the streamflow quantile q95 smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2005 the daily streamflow that is equal to or exceeds 95 of all days in a year this low flow characteristic is widely employed globally because of its relevance in multiple topics of water resource management laaha and blöschl 2006 note that the selection of annual flood and low flow data in this study corresponds to the hydrological year of the study area which begins on 1 may and ends on 30 april of the following year shi et al 2011 2 3 candidate explanatory covariates according to previous studies chen et al 2021 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 precipitation is an essential climatic variable that is closely related to extreme streamflow processes in this study annual precipitation was selected as the candidate climatic covariate in addition sun et al 2018a b found that the el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and north atlantic oscillation nao had impacts on the streamflow of the hrb therefore the ao nao pdo and enso indices were selected alternative climatic covariates to investigate the impacts of climate variability on flood and low flow processes these indices were obtained from the noaa physical sciences laboratory psl https psl noaa gov data climateindices in terms of anthropogenic influence previous studies shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 have pointed out that reservoir management is the primary anthropogenic activity in the upper reaches of hrb therefore we adopted ri described in section 3 3 to parametrically characterise the reservoir regulation 3 methods in this section we present an overview of the methods used to evaluate the presence of change points and temporal trends we also introduce the calculations of the ri and gamlss models 3 1 change point analysis the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a widely used nonparametric test method for identifying change points this approach considers a time series as two samples represented by x1 xt and xt 1 xn then the pettitt indices ut n can be calculated as 1 u t n j 1 t i 1 n sgn x j x i t 1 n where 2 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 the p value of the ut n can be computed as follows 3 p 2 exp 6 u t n 2 n 3 n 2 in this study if p 0 1 we consider the presence of a significant change point wang et al 2021 and the time series is divided into two parts at the location of the change point t 3 2 temporal trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a widely used nonparametric method for trend analysis for a series x x 1 x 2 x n the standard normal statistic z is estimated as follows 4 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where 5 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 however it should be noted that the results of the mk test can be affected by the presence of serial and cross correlation hamed 2008 therefore we referred to villarini et al 2009b and zou et al 2018 to identify trends of flood or low flow series using the following steps 1 the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient ρ1 was computed 2 if ρ1 0 1 the mk test was directly applied to the series otherwise 3 the mk test was applied to a pre process time series x 2 ρ 1 x 1 x 3 ρ 1 x 2 x n ρ 1 x n 1 furthermore as suggested by villarini et al 2009a change points present one possible mode of nonstationarity whereas long term trends constitute a second mode of nonstationarity in a time series the mk test may detect a significant trend when in fact the majority of the change over time occurs as a single change point therefore in this study a temporal trend analysis was performed on the entire time series in which no change point was detected if a change point was detected the series before and after it were subjected to independent trend analyses pettitt and mk tests were performed on platform r using the freely available trend package available at https cran r project org web packages trend trend pdf 3 3 reservoir index ri lópez and francés 2013 proposed the reservoir index ri as an indicator of the impact of reservoirs on flow regimes it is defined as follows 7 ri i 1 n a i a t v i c t where n is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station vi is the total capacity of each reservoir and ct is the mean annual streamflow of the gauge station however jiang et al 2015 pointed out that the effect of each individual upstream reservoir on low flow downstream is not only linked to the ratio of its individual catchment area to the catchment area controlled by the gauge station that is ai at but also to the ratio of its individual capacity vi to the total upstream reservoir capacity vt that is vi vt therefore they augmented eq 7 by replacing ct with vt in this study we applied this modified ri to explore the impacts of reservoir regulation on flood and low flow regimes the modified ri is expressed as follows 8 ri i 1 n a i a t v i v t 3 4 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss given the potential for nonstationary behaviour in hydrologic systems models that can dynamically capture changes in the probability density function over time should be implemented villarini et al 2009a chen et al 2021 the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss proposed by rigby et al 2005 provide a flexible modelling framework for regression models with time varying distribution parameters recently the gamlss model has been successfully used in the nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series lópez and francés 2013 du et al 2015 the gamlss framework assumes that independent observations yi for i 1 2 3 n have a distribution function f y i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ p i is a vector of p distribution parameters accounting for the location scale and shape of random variable characteristics usually p is less than or equal to four since the 1 2 3 and 4 parameter families ensure sufficient flexibility for most applications in hydrology given an n length vector of the response variable yt y1 yn let gk for k 1 2 p be known monotonic link functions relating the distribution parameters to explanatory variables and random effects through an additive model given by 9 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where ηk and θk are vectors of length n e g θ k t θ k 1 θ k 2 θ k n β k t β 1 k β 2 k β jkk is a parameter vector of length jk x k is a matrix of explanatory variables i e covariates of order n jk z jk is a fixed known n qjk design matrix and γjk is a qjk dimensional random variable in eq 9 the linear predictors ηk for k 1 p comprises a parametric component x kβk linear functions of explanatory variables and the additive component z jkγjk linear functions of stochastic variables in particular if z jk in where in is an n n identity matrix and γjk h jk h jk x jk for all combinations of j and k in eq 9 we obtain the semi parametric additive formulation of gamlss 10 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k h jk x jk where θk is the parameter vector of length n x jk is a matrix of explanatory variables of order n m βk is a parameter vector of length m and hjk denotes the functional dependence of the distribution parameters on explanatory variables xjk which is a column of matrix x jk this dependence can be linear or smoothed using smoothing terms and the smooth dependence is based on a cubic spline function lópez and francés 2013 based on villarini et al 2009a and du et al 2015 the 2 parameter gamma ga and weibull wei distributions listed in table 1 were selected for the modelling of the flood and low flow series respectively in this case we simplified eq 10 as follows 11 g 1 μ η 1 j 1 j 1 h j 1 x j 1 12 g 2 σ η 2 j 1 j 2 h j 2 x j 2 for i 1 n where µ and σ are vectors of size n in this study we investigated the dependence of the moments of distribution via parameters on precipitation climate indices and ri an optimal nonstationary model accounting for change points and monotonic temporal trends in the model parameters was selected using the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 where the maximum likelihood value is penalised by the number of independently adjusted parameters a model with a minimum aic value was selected however because the aic value does not provide information regarding the quality of the fitting villarini et al 2009b a visual inspection of the diagnostic plots of the residuals i e worm plots was performed to assess the performance of the selected nonstationary model lópez and francés 2013 all calculations were made on the r platform using the freely available gamlss package rigby et al 2005 available at https cran r project org web packages gamlss gamlss pdf 4 results 4 1 change point and temporal trend analysis previous research shi et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 has pointed out that reservoir regulations could cause step changes in streamflow processes in the upper reaches of the hrb for example fig 3 a shows that the ri of the zgp station increased from 0 012 in 1979 to 0 022 in 1980 indicating that the regulation capacity of this catchment controlled by the zgp station nearly doubled meanwhile the low flow at this station also changed significantly before and after 1980 the pettitt test method was therefore applied to investigate the presence of change points in the annual flood and low flow series of the four stations in the upper reaches of the hrb as shown in table 2 the low flow series of the zgp station exhibited a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 the long term trend is another form of nonstationarity in extreme hydrological series in this study the mk test was used to analyse the long term trends of annual flood and low flow series as described in section 3 2 the mk test was performed on the entire time series for which no significant change point was detected otherwise temporal trend analysis was performed on the subseries before and after the change point we performed autocorrelation analysis for the annual flood and low flow series the computed lag 1 serial correlation coefficient ρ1 of both the flood and low flow series for the four stations was 0 1 suggesting that year to year correlation is not an important element of trend detection therefore the mk test was directly applied to this series for the annual flood series only zgp table 2 showed a significant downward trend p 0 1 for the annual low flow series table 2 a significant upward trend p 0 1 was detected at the dpl and xx stations overall these results reveal that the flood and low flow time series of some stations exhibited some modes of nonstationarity 4 2 gamlss modelling this section examines the gamlss models for the parametric modelling of the flood and low flow records of the four stations the suitability of the fitted models was evaluated using optimality criteria and diagnostic graphical tools based on the analysis in section 4 1 the change points are mainly associated with changes in ri and long term trends are usually associated with climate variability therefore for records with no change point we compared the aic scores of different models 1 stationary model 1 in which the parameters of a distribution function remain constant 2 nonstationary model 2 in which location parameter μ is modelled as a function of climatic variables through a link function listed in table 1 3 nonstationary model 3 in which the scale parameter σ is modelled as a function of climatic variables 4 nonstationary model 4 in which location and scale parameters μ and σ are modelled as functions of climatic variables for records in which significant change points were detected we incorporated ri in addition to climatic variables into parameter μ or σ to account for abrupt changes villarini et al 2009b a nonstationary model with the minimum aic was selected for further frequency analysis gamma and weibull distributions with logarithmic link functions for both location and scale parameters were selected for modelling flood and low flow records respectively taking the zgp station as an example the results of the gamlss fitting of model parameters as well as the ranking based on the aic are shown in detail in table 3 in comparison with other models nonstationary models 2 and 4 are a better fit for the flood and low flow series respectively the optimal nonstationary models of both flood and low flow for the four stations and their external covariates are summarised in table 4 for annual flood records precipitation and ao were two significant covariates for all stations for the location parameter μ suggesting a strong correlation between the climatic variables and annual flood records shi et al 2011 a cubic spline is used to highlight non linear dependencies in flood properties over precipitation while the dependence of parameter μ on ao is linear for the low flow series precipitation was a significant covariate for all stations for the location parameter μ for the low flow series of the zgp station where a significant change point was detected ri was a significant covariate for both parameters μ and σ the dependence of μ and σ on ri was linear besides filliben correlation coefficient is another indicator for evaluating the performance of a gamlss model for a sample size of 62 years annual flood series from 1955 to 2016 the critical value of the filliben correlation coefficient at the 10 significance level p 0 1 should be 0 981 in this study the filliben coefficients of the four stations were 0 988 0 986 0 992 and 0 981 for the flood series and 0 994 0 984 0 990 and 0 988 for the low flow series overall the filliben coefficients of all the optimal nonstationary models for the flood and low flow series at the four stations were 0 981 indicating that there were no significant deviations from normality in the residuals diagnostic graphical tools such as worm plots could visually display the normality of the residuals when the fit is good the points should be aligned preferably on the black line and within the grey curves delimiting the 95 confidence intervals fig 4 shows the fit of the nonstationary model for four representative series including the annual flood series at the zgp station and low flow series at the dpl zgp and xx stations in which significant change points or temporal trends were detected these figures also support the inference that the nonstationary models adequately fit the data a centile line figure can also provide a visual check of the accuracy of the model fit for example fig 5 depicts the observed data as well as the estimated 5th 25th 50th median 75th and 95th percentile lines for the annual flood and low flow records of the zgp station for the flood series the estimated percentiles of nonstationary model 2 fig 5 b can capture the majority of the observed points as well as the downward trend associated with the flood data for the low flow series nonstationary model 4 fig 5 d provided a better description of the changes in the low flow series before and after the change point than stationary model 1 thus reflecting the impacts of reservoir regulations on the magnitude of low flow the median and the other estimated percentiles of nonstationary model 4 all increase with the abrupt increase in the ri after 1980 fig 3 b and can capture more observed points than those of stationary model 1 centile line figures of other stations for flood or low flow series also showed that the nonstationary model outperformed stationary model 1 figures not shown overall the improvement after incorporating external covariates e g climatic variables and ri in the fit of flood and low flow series is clear 4 3 frequency analysis using nonstationary model generally the return period is a key concept for the frequency analysis of flood and low flow events hesarkazzazi et al 2021 for stationary model 1 constructed in section 4 2 the probability p that a flood or low flow value will be larger than a certain design value in a year is expressed in terms of the return period t i e t 1 p for example a t year flood exceeded once in t years according to the design values provided by the huaihe water conservancy commission qin et al 2021 and other previous studies smakhtin 2001 lópez and francés 2013 100 year flood and 2 year low flow events were selected for flood and low flow frequency analyses respectively the corresponding flood or low flow quantiles for each year for the optimal nonstationary models identified based on the aic criterion in section 4 2 can be calculated by using the distribution parameters i e parameters μ and σ as estimated for that year this allows for a direct comparison of stationary and nonstationary models for flood and low flow frequency analyses for the flood frequency analysis left panel in fig 6 the 100 year flood values estimated by stationary model 1 for the dpl ctg zgp and xx stations were 3121 4348 2508 and 9129 m3 s respectively for nonstationary model 2 the estimated 100 year flood values all show a downward trend and their trend line deviates downward from the estimated value of the model 1 over time specifically the 100 year flood value estimated by model 1 failed to cover the observed flood events in 1975 and 1968 i e 3580 and 11900 m3 s for the dpl and xx stations in which no significant temporal trend change was detected respectively but the values estimated by model 2 could cover all the observed flood points for the zgp station in which a significant downward trend p 0 1 was detected in the first half of the study period 1955 1990 the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 fluctuated around those estimated by model 1 however during the second half of the study period 1991 2016 almost all the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 were lower than those estimated by model 1 overall for the flood frequency analysis of stationary and nonstationary stations nonstationary model 2 performed better than stationary model 1 because nonstationary model 2 used precipitation and climate indices as covariates table 4 its estimated 100 year flood values not only covered all the observed flood events but also captured the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes for the low flow frequency analysis right panel in fig 6 the estimated 2 year low flow values for dpl ctg and xx stations in which no significant change point was detected covered 30 24 and 33 observed low flow points for stationary model 1 and 28 22 and 30 observed low flow points for nonstationary model 2 nonstationary model 2 which considers climatic variables as covariates does not perform significantly better than the stationary model in the analysis of low flow frequency however for the zgp station in which a significant change point was detected in 1980 the estimated 2 year low flow value by model 1 could cover most of the observed low flow points in the period before the change point 1955 1979 but could only capture a few of the observed low flow points during the period after the change point 1980 2016 nonstationary model 4 for the zgp station which considers the influence of reservoir regulation by introducing the ri index could reasonably describe the change in the magnitude of the estimated 2 year low flow values and could cover more observed points the estimated 2 year low flow value ranges for the model 4 increased from 0 51 1 31 m3 s during 1955 1979 to 1 65 4 28 m3 s during 1980 2016 this change is dramatic especially when compared with the value estimated by model 1 1 71 m3 s in general for stations with no significantly abrupt change point nonstationary model 2 using climatic variables as covariates and stationary model 1 performed equally well in the low flow frequency analysis for stations with significantly abrupt changes in the low flow series i e zgp station nonstationary model 4 incorporating ri as a covariate outperformed stationary model 1 in the low flow frequency analysis 5 discussion traditional flood or low flow frequency analyses are based on the stationarity assumption in which the parameters of the distributions are constant xiong et al 2018 however the impacts of climate variability and human activities challenge this fundamental assumption and the statistical distribution parameters may vary with these factors jiang et al 2015 in this study we proposed a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as functions of climatic variables and or ri for the flood and low flow records in which significant temporal trends or abrupt change points were detected the nonstationary models were a better fit than the stationary models the evaluation of the normality of the residuals for example filliben correlation coefficients and worm plots fig 4 supported the conclusion that the nonstationary models fit the data adequately comparisons of the centile lines fig 5 also reflected the improvement in the fitting of flood and low flow series after incorporating external covariates e g climatic variables and ri this highlights the flexibility of the nonstationary model to account for change points and temporal trends related to climate variability and reservoir regulations thus providing a useful tool for nonstationary flood and low flow analysis climate variability is widely recognised as one of the most important nonstationary drivers of flood or low flow processes slater et al 2021b in this study no significant change point was detected in the flood series of the four stations in the upper hrb only the flood series of the zgp stations showed a significant downward trend p 0 1 further analysis fig 3 b revealed that the trend of the observed flood series at the zgp station was consistent with that of the annual precipitation series therefore nonstationary models incorporating annual precipitation and large scale climate indices as covariates were constructed based on the gamlss model to consider the impact of climate variability on flood frequency analysis for the stations in which flood series have stationary characteristics i e dpl ctg xx stations or have a significant downward trend i e zgp station the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 can cover all the observed flood points and can capture the generally decreasing trend in flood series and scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes however the 100 year flood values estimated by model 1 are constant throughout the entire study period this stationary model cannot consider the impacts of climate variability on the flood processes and may result in an overestimation of the design flood values therefore incorporating climate variables as covariates into nonstationary models can provide reasonably designed flood values for changing environments there have been systematic simulations of future precipitation and large scale climate indices in cmip5 and the latest cmip6 datasets ruiz barradas et al 2013 lin et al 2018 xia et al 2021 such attempts expand the possibility for using nonstationary models as effective tools to explore future flood and low flow processes under nonstationary conditions in addition to climate variability reservoir regulation direct anthropogenic water resource management behaviour is another nonstationary factor for extreme hydrological processes wang et al 2020 in this study nonstationary analysis results showed that only the low flow series at the zgp station had a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 further analysis fig 3 a revealed that the change point of the low flow at the zgp station was closely related to the changes in its ri therefore in addition to climate variables model 2 for low flow of dpl ctg xx stations ri was incorporated as a covariate to construct nonstationary model 4 for the zgp station to consider the impacts of climate variability and reservoir regulations on low flow processes for stations with no significant change points in the low flow series models 1 and 2 performed equally well in the low flow frequency analysis for the zgp station in which a significant change point was detected stationary model 1 overestimated and underestimated the 2 year low flow design values before and after the change point respectively fig 6 f however model 4 outperformed model 1 and could accurately capture the changes in magnitude of the 2 year designed low flow values before and after the change point these findings were consistent with those obtained in recent studies shi et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 that is the reservoir operation plan in the study area usually considers the allocation of water resources to make it more evenly distributed in a year these anti seasonal regulations fig 7 increase the streamflow during the dry season thereby indirectly increasing the low flow magnitude it is therefore effective to incorporate the ri as a covariate into the nonstationary model to perform the low flow frequency analysis assuming that reservoir regulations lead to a significant abrupt change in the hydrological extreme process finally this study has some limitations that should be emphasised apart from climatic variables represented by precipitation and climate indices and reservoir regulations represented by ri there are other factors that can also lead to nonstationarity these include land use and cover change and water resource management as well as irrigation abstraction and inter basin water transfers do et al 2017 slater et al 2021b therefore other parameterisation schemes or methods that can account for human activities can be developed and incorporated into nonstationary models 6 conclusions in this study we used the gamlss framework to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or ri the nonstationary model was then applied for flood and low flow frequency analysis as such our consideration of the nonstationary impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic reservoir regulation on flood and low flow processes was the innovative part of this research we examined the proposed nonstationary model for four stations in the upper reaches of the hrb in china the results of the change point and temporal trend analysis showed that the annual flood record of the zgp station had a significant downward trend p 0 1 and the annual low flow series of the dpl and xx stations showed significant upward trends p 0 1 the annual low flow series of the zgp station exhibited a significant change in 1980 p 0 1 the results of the gamlss modelling showed that the nonstationary model incorporating precipitation and the arctic oscillation climatic index as covariates for location parameter μ of the gamma distribution gave a better fit for the flood series at the four stations than stationary models the nonstationary model that incorporated precipitation as covariates for location parameter μ of the weibull distribution provide a better fitting for the low flow series at the dpl ctg and xx stations in comparison with the stationary models especially for low flow series of zgp station the nonstationary model incorporating precipitation and ri as covariates for location parameter μ and ri as covariates for scale parameter σ of the weibull distribution gave a better fit than stationary models the improvement after incorporating climatic variables and ri in the description of flood and low flow series was clear and corresponds with optimality criteria e g aic and worm plots furthermore for flood frequency analysis comparison results showed that nonstationary models outperformed stationary models and could cover all flood observation points and capture the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes regarding the low flow frequency analysis the comparison results showed that the nonstationary and stationary models performed equally for the dpl ctg and xx stations in which no significant change point was detected however for zgp stations with significant abrupt changes in low flow series the nonstationary models performed better than the stationary model and could accurately capture the change in the magnitude of the designed low flow values before and after the change point overall the proposed nonstationary model can serve as a tool for the nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series under the influence of climate variability and human activities thus providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design and water resource

3006,conventional water infrastructure designs for flood and low flows are usually based on the assumption of stationarity of extreme events however recent evidence suggests that the influences of climate variability and human activities have made the hypothesis of stationarity questionable in this study we used the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or the reservoir index ri the nonstationary models were then used to analyse annual flood and low flow frequency at four hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the huaihe river basin including dapoling dpl changtaiguan ctg zhuganpu zgp and xixian xx stations annual floods were represented by the maximum daily streamflow in each year and low flows were represented by the 95th quantile of the daily streamflow q95 in each year the change point and trend analysis revealed that the flood series of the zgp station and the low flow series of the dpl and xx stations exhibited significant downward and upward trends p 0 1 respectively the low flow series of the zgp station showed a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 gamlss modelling results showed that in comparison with stationary models nonstationary models that included precipitation and the arctic oscillation climate index as covariates for the gamma distribution location parameter provided a superior description of the flood series at the four stations nonstationary models that incorporated precipitation and or ri as covariates for the weibull distribution parameters fit the low flow series better than stationary models at all stations furthermore we found that nonstationary models outperformed stationary models in terms of flood frequency analysis covering all flood observation points and capturing the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes for the low flow frequency analysis the comparison results showed that the nonstationary and stationary models performed identically for the dpl ctg and xx stations where no significant change point was detected however for the zgp station where a significant change point was detected the nonstationary models performed better than the stationary models and could accurately capture the changes in the magnitude of the estimated low flow values before and after the change point overall the proposed nonstationary model can serve as a tool for nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series under the influence of climate variability and reservoir regulations thus providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design keywords flood low flow nonstationary frequency analysis climatic variables reservoir index data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction floods are one of the most frequent and destructive natural disasters worldwide causing significant economic losses and fatalities every year baldassarre et al 2017 neri et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 flood risk has increased over the past century and is projected to further increase in the future as a result of climate change population growth and economic development sun et al 2018c neri et al 2019 slater et al 2021a another type of streamflow extreme process that is a low flow process is also an important issue in water resource management laaha and blöschl 2005 jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 leong and yokoo 2021 accurate estimates of low flow characteristics are required for multiple purposes in water resource management and engineering including environmental flow requirements water use and discharge into streams and hydropower operations smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2005 2006 floriancic et al 2021 therefore one of the major challenges facing the hydrology field is understanding how flood and low flow events are evolving and how likely they are to unfold beyond their historical distributions under the influence of multiple drivers such as climate variability and human activities lópez and francés 2013 kam and sheffield 2016 gai et al 2019 jiang et al 2021 slater et al 2021a in this respect flood and low flow frequency analysis is commonly used by hydrologists conventional flood and low flow frequency analyses assume that flood or low flow series are independent stationary and identically distributed chen et al 2021 in other words flood or low flow series fluctuate randomly within an unchanging range of variability and are free of trends and abrupt changes however several recent studies have found that climate change anthropogenic interference and land use change have made the hypothesis of stationarity widely questionable salas and obeysekera 2014 du et al 2015 jiang et al 2015 baldassarre et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the international association of hydrological sciences iahs scientific decade 2013 2022 entitled panta rhei everything flows states that global climate and hydrological systems are suffering substantial changes under changing environmental conditions montanari et al 2013 improving our ability to cope with floods in current and future climates necessitates an improved theoretical understanding and the adoption of more sophisticated set of approaches milly et al 2008 pointed out that the stationarity hypothesis should be abandoned and called for innovative thinking or methods to provide reliable and useful estimates of hydrological variables for water management under nonstationary conditions conventional hydrology related planning or designs usually depend on the analysis of the observed data in the past to inform estimation of the corresponding hydrological variables in the future however the present nonstationary conditions mean that the past observed data may no longer provide all necessary information concerning the future statistical behaviour of extreme floods or low flows chen et al 2021 for example increasing trends in the mean flow series may lead to the underestimation of flood quantiles and increase the failure risk of hydraulic structures conversely decreasing trends could result in the overestimation of low flow quantiles and increased costs associated with infrastructure overdesign bayazit 2015 therefore attempting to consider nonstationarity in the process of hydrological frequency analysis is critical for human adaptability to changing environments various concepts and methods for nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis have been proposed in the literature khaliq et al 2006 and salas et al 2018 presented outstanding reviews that included the incorporation of trends in parameter distributions trends in statistical moments the quantile regression method and the local likelihood method the most common approach is to incorporate temporal trends into the parameters of the distributions resulting in a time varying model delgado et al 2010 the time varying model assumes that the parameters of the distributions for frequency analysis fluctuate over time making it a useful tool for reconstructing the hydrological frequency characteristics in addition to time varying nonstationary models some researchers have attempted to incorporate climatic variables and or anthropogenic indicators that can reflect human influence in nonstationary models for frequency analysis the earliest attempt was to incorporate climate indices e g enso pdo and ao indices as external covariates in nonstationary models assuming linear or nonlinear dependence lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 some studies explored the possibility of incorporating meteorological variables e g precipitation and temperature as covariates into nonstationary models du et al 2015 chen et al 2021 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 in addition to climatic variables other studies have incorporated the impact of human activities into nonstationary models villarini et al 2009a incorporated a population index into nonstationary models of flood frequency analysis to describe the impact of land use changes sun et al 2018c and slater et al 2019 considered the influence of agricultural land cover changes in statistical frameworks for seasonal streamflow forecasting and flood frequency evaluations lópez and francés 2013 proposed a reservoir index ri to represent the impacts of reservoir regulations on the streamflow regime they used it as a covariate in nonstationary models to analyse the changes in flood frequency in continental spanish rivers furthermore van ogtrop et al 2011 incorporated climate indices that describe the pacific and indian ocean sea surface temperatures as covariates into the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework to make probabilistic 6 and 12 month forecasts of streamflow occurrence and intensity in australia slater and villarini 2018 and neri et al 2019 used hydro meteorological variables from general circulation models gcms as predictors to conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal and decadal streamflow processes overall the results of the above studies showed that using climatic variables or anthropogenic indicators as covariates in statistical models can improve the description and prediction of streamflow processes however existing studies usually perform nonstationary analysis on either flood or low flow processes and research on driving force attribution and frequency analysis of both nonstationary flood and low flow processes is still limited at present and in the future water conservation engineering design tends to meet more management goals such as ensuring flood prevention and low flow demand simultaneously therefore a comprehensive understanding of these two nonstationary processes will provide valuable insights for extreme event risk assessment water conservancy infrastructure design and water resource management therefore the aim of the present study was to use gamlss to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or the reservoir index ri the nonstationary models were then applied for both flood and low flow frequency analysis the upper reaches of the huaihe river basin hrb were selected to examine the proposed nonstationary model because climate variability and reservoir regulations in this area have impacts on extreme streamflow processes i e flood and low flow according to several studies shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 the study was divided into three parts 1 a change point and trend analysis of flood and low flow series to identify their nonstationary behaviours 2 the construction and validation of nonstationary models and 3 the application of nonstationary models in flood and low flow frequency analysis the proposed nonstationary models in this study are expected to provide a tool for nonstationary flood and low flow frequency analysis in the upper reaches of the hrb thereby providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design and water resource management 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the upper reaches of the hrb controlled by the xixian hydrological station were selected as the study area fig 1 the study area extends from longitudes 113 25 e to 115 e and latitudes 31 5 n to 32 75 n covering an area of 10190 km2 and lying in transition zone between the mid latitude humid climate and semi arid climate jiang et al 2017 according to previous research shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 climate variability and reservoir regulations influence streamflow processes in the upper reaches of the hrb therefore four hydrological stations fig 1 were selected from the study area to perform the nonstationary frequency analysis including dapoling dpl changtaiguan ctg zhuganpu zgp and xixian xx stations due to the influence of the east asian monsoon approximately 70 of the precipitation and streamflow of the four stations occur between may and september and the annual average temperature of these five months is also the highest of the year 2 2 data daily precipitation data measured by 35 rain gauges streamflow records of four hydrological stations and reservoir information from 1955 to 2016 were collected from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources of china the storage capacities control areas and completion years of the nanwan and shishankou reservoirs in the study area were 1630 million and 372 million m3 1090 and 306 km2 and 1955 and 1968 respectively flood data fig 2 a d that is the series of annual maximum daily streamflow were extracted from daily streamflow records from the four hydrological stations lópez and francés 2013 the low flow characteristics fig 2 e h were the streamflow quantile q95 smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2005 the daily streamflow that is equal to or exceeds 95 of all days in a year this low flow characteristic is widely employed globally because of its relevance in multiple topics of water resource management laaha and blöschl 2006 note that the selection of annual flood and low flow data in this study corresponds to the hydrological year of the study area which begins on 1 may and ends on 30 april of the following year shi et al 2011 2 3 candidate explanatory covariates according to previous studies chen et al 2021 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 precipitation is an essential climatic variable that is closely related to extreme streamflow processes in this study annual precipitation was selected as the candidate climatic covariate in addition sun et al 2018a b found that the el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao and north atlantic oscillation nao had impacts on the streamflow of the hrb therefore the ao nao pdo and enso indices were selected alternative climatic covariates to investigate the impacts of climate variability on flood and low flow processes these indices were obtained from the noaa physical sciences laboratory psl https psl noaa gov data climateindices in terms of anthropogenic influence previous studies shi et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 have pointed out that reservoir management is the primary anthropogenic activity in the upper reaches of hrb therefore we adopted ri described in section 3 3 to parametrically characterise the reservoir regulation 3 methods in this section we present an overview of the methods used to evaluate the presence of change points and temporal trends we also introduce the calculations of the ri and gamlss models 3 1 change point analysis the pettitt test pettitt 1979 is a widely used nonparametric test method for identifying change points this approach considers a time series as two samples represented by x1 xt and xt 1 xn then the pettitt indices ut n can be calculated as 1 u t n j 1 t i 1 n sgn x j x i t 1 n where 2 sgn θ 1 θ 0 0 θ 0 1 θ 0 the p value of the ut n can be computed as follows 3 p 2 exp 6 u t n 2 n 3 n 2 in this study if p 0 1 we consider the presence of a significant change point wang et al 2021 and the time series is divided into two parts at the location of the change point t 3 2 temporal trend analysis the mann kendall mk trend test method recommended by the world meteorological organization is a widely used nonparametric method for trend analysis for a series x x 1 x 2 x n the standard normal statistic z is estimated as follows 4 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 where 5 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i 6 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 however it should be noted that the results of the mk test can be affected by the presence of serial and cross correlation hamed 2008 therefore we referred to villarini et al 2009b and zou et al 2018 to identify trends of flood or low flow series using the following steps 1 the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient ρ1 was computed 2 if ρ1 0 1 the mk test was directly applied to the series otherwise 3 the mk test was applied to a pre process time series x 2 ρ 1 x 1 x 3 ρ 1 x 2 x n ρ 1 x n 1 furthermore as suggested by villarini et al 2009a change points present one possible mode of nonstationarity whereas long term trends constitute a second mode of nonstationarity in a time series the mk test may detect a significant trend when in fact the majority of the change over time occurs as a single change point therefore in this study a temporal trend analysis was performed on the entire time series in which no change point was detected if a change point was detected the series before and after it were subjected to independent trend analyses pettitt and mk tests were performed on platform r using the freely available trend package available at https cran r project org web packages trend trend pdf 3 3 reservoir index ri lópez and francés 2013 proposed the reservoir index ri as an indicator of the impact of reservoirs on flow regimes it is defined as follows 7 ri i 1 n a i a t v i c t where n is the number of reservoirs upstream of the gauge station ai is the catchment area of each reservoir at is the catchment area of the gauge station vi is the total capacity of each reservoir and ct is the mean annual streamflow of the gauge station however jiang et al 2015 pointed out that the effect of each individual upstream reservoir on low flow downstream is not only linked to the ratio of its individual catchment area to the catchment area controlled by the gauge station that is ai at but also to the ratio of its individual capacity vi to the total upstream reservoir capacity vt that is vi vt therefore they augmented eq 7 by replacing ct with vt in this study we applied this modified ri to explore the impacts of reservoir regulation on flood and low flow regimes the modified ri is expressed as follows 8 ri i 1 n a i a t v i v t 3 4 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss given the potential for nonstationary behaviour in hydrologic systems models that can dynamically capture changes in the probability density function over time should be implemented villarini et al 2009a chen et al 2021 the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss proposed by rigby et al 2005 provide a flexible modelling framework for regression models with time varying distribution parameters recently the gamlss model has been successfully used in the nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series lópez and francés 2013 du et al 2015 the gamlss framework assumes that independent observations yi for i 1 2 3 n have a distribution function f y i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ p i is a vector of p distribution parameters accounting for the location scale and shape of random variable characteristics usually p is less than or equal to four since the 1 2 3 and 4 parameter families ensure sufficient flexibility for most applications in hydrology given an n length vector of the response variable yt y1 yn let gk for k 1 2 p be known monotonic link functions relating the distribution parameters to explanatory variables and random effects through an additive model given by 9 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where ηk and θk are vectors of length n e g θ k t θ k 1 θ k 2 θ k n β k t β 1 k β 2 k β jkk is a parameter vector of length jk x k is a matrix of explanatory variables i e covariates of order n jk z jk is a fixed known n qjk design matrix and γjk is a qjk dimensional random variable in eq 9 the linear predictors ηk for k 1 p comprises a parametric component x kβk linear functions of explanatory variables and the additive component z jkγjk linear functions of stochastic variables in particular if z jk in where in is an n n identity matrix and γjk h jk h jk x jk for all combinations of j and k in eq 9 we obtain the semi parametric additive formulation of gamlss 10 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k h jk x jk where θk is the parameter vector of length n x jk is a matrix of explanatory variables of order n m βk is a parameter vector of length m and hjk denotes the functional dependence of the distribution parameters on explanatory variables xjk which is a column of matrix x jk this dependence can be linear or smoothed using smoothing terms and the smooth dependence is based on a cubic spline function lópez and francés 2013 based on villarini et al 2009a and du et al 2015 the 2 parameter gamma ga and weibull wei distributions listed in table 1 were selected for the modelling of the flood and low flow series respectively in this case we simplified eq 10 as follows 11 g 1 μ η 1 j 1 j 1 h j 1 x j 1 12 g 2 σ η 2 j 1 j 2 h j 2 x j 2 for i 1 n where µ and σ are vectors of size n in this study we investigated the dependence of the moments of distribution via parameters on precipitation climate indices and ri an optimal nonstationary model accounting for change points and monotonic temporal trends in the model parameters was selected using the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 where the maximum likelihood value is penalised by the number of independently adjusted parameters a model with a minimum aic value was selected however because the aic value does not provide information regarding the quality of the fitting villarini et al 2009b a visual inspection of the diagnostic plots of the residuals i e worm plots was performed to assess the performance of the selected nonstationary model lópez and francés 2013 all calculations were made on the r platform using the freely available gamlss package rigby et al 2005 available at https cran r project org web packages gamlss gamlss pdf 4 results 4 1 change point and temporal trend analysis previous research shi et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 has pointed out that reservoir regulations could cause step changes in streamflow processes in the upper reaches of the hrb for example fig 3 a shows that the ri of the zgp station increased from 0 012 in 1979 to 0 022 in 1980 indicating that the regulation capacity of this catchment controlled by the zgp station nearly doubled meanwhile the low flow at this station also changed significantly before and after 1980 the pettitt test method was therefore applied to investigate the presence of change points in the annual flood and low flow series of the four stations in the upper reaches of the hrb as shown in table 2 the low flow series of the zgp station exhibited a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 the long term trend is another form of nonstationarity in extreme hydrological series in this study the mk test was used to analyse the long term trends of annual flood and low flow series as described in section 3 2 the mk test was performed on the entire time series for which no significant change point was detected otherwise temporal trend analysis was performed on the subseries before and after the change point we performed autocorrelation analysis for the annual flood and low flow series the computed lag 1 serial correlation coefficient ρ1 of both the flood and low flow series for the four stations was 0 1 suggesting that year to year correlation is not an important element of trend detection therefore the mk test was directly applied to this series for the annual flood series only zgp table 2 showed a significant downward trend p 0 1 for the annual low flow series table 2 a significant upward trend p 0 1 was detected at the dpl and xx stations overall these results reveal that the flood and low flow time series of some stations exhibited some modes of nonstationarity 4 2 gamlss modelling this section examines the gamlss models for the parametric modelling of the flood and low flow records of the four stations the suitability of the fitted models was evaluated using optimality criteria and diagnostic graphical tools based on the analysis in section 4 1 the change points are mainly associated with changes in ri and long term trends are usually associated with climate variability therefore for records with no change point we compared the aic scores of different models 1 stationary model 1 in which the parameters of a distribution function remain constant 2 nonstationary model 2 in which location parameter μ is modelled as a function of climatic variables through a link function listed in table 1 3 nonstationary model 3 in which the scale parameter σ is modelled as a function of climatic variables 4 nonstationary model 4 in which location and scale parameters μ and σ are modelled as functions of climatic variables for records in which significant change points were detected we incorporated ri in addition to climatic variables into parameter μ or σ to account for abrupt changes villarini et al 2009b a nonstationary model with the minimum aic was selected for further frequency analysis gamma and weibull distributions with logarithmic link functions for both location and scale parameters were selected for modelling flood and low flow records respectively taking the zgp station as an example the results of the gamlss fitting of model parameters as well as the ranking based on the aic are shown in detail in table 3 in comparison with other models nonstationary models 2 and 4 are a better fit for the flood and low flow series respectively the optimal nonstationary models of both flood and low flow for the four stations and their external covariates are summarised in table 4 for annual flood records precipitation and ao were two significant covariates for all stations for the location parameter μ suggesting a strong correlation between the climatic variables and annual flood records shi et al 2011 a cubic spline is used to highlight non linear dependencies in flood properties over precipitation while the dependence of parameter μ on ao is linear for the low flow series precipitation was a significant covariate for all stations for the location parameter μ for the low flow series of the zgp station where a significant change point was detected ri was a significant covariate for both parameters μ and σ the dependence of μ and σ on ri was linear besides filliben correlation coefficient is another indicator for evaluating the performance of a gamlss model for a sample size of 62 years annual flood series from 1955 to 2016 the critical value of the filliben correlation coefficient at the 10 significance level p 0 1 should be 0 981 in this study the filliben coefficients of the four stations were 0 988 0 986 0 992 and 0 981 for the flood series and 0 994 0 984 0 990 and 0 988 for the low flow series overall the filliben coefficients of all the optimal nonstationary models for the flood and low flow series at the four stations were 0 981 indicating that there were no significant deviations from normality in the residuals diagnostic graphical tools such as worm plots could visually display the normality of the residuals when the fit is good the points should be aligned preferably on the black line and within the grey curves delimiting the 95 confidence intervals fig 4 shows the fit of the nonstationary model for four representative series including the annual flood series at the zgp station and low flow series at the dpl zgp and xx stations in which significant change points or temporal trends were detected these figures also support the inference that the nonstationary models adequately fit the data a centile line figure can also provide a visual check of the accuracy of the model fit for example fig 5 depicts the observed data as well as the estimated 5th 25th 50th median 75th and 95th percentile lines for the annual flood and low flow records of the zgp station for the flood series the estimated percentiles of nonstationary model 2 fig 5 b can capture the majority of the observed points as well as the downward trend associated with the flood data for the low flow series nonstationary model 4 fig 5 d provided a better description of the changes in the low flow series before and after the change point than stationary model 1 thus reflecting the impacts of reservoir regulations on the magnitude of low flow the median and the other estimated percentiles of nonstationary model 4 all increase with the abrupt increase in the ri after 1980 fig 3 b and can capture more observed points than those of stationary model 1 centile line figures of other stations for flood or low flow series also showed that the nonstationary model outperformed stationary model 1 figures not shown overall the improvement after incorporating external covariates e g climatic variables and ri in the fit of flood and low flow series is clear 4 3 frequency analysis using nonstationary model generally the return period is a key concept for the frequency analysis of flood and low flow events hesarkazzazi et al 2021 for stationary model 1 constructed in section 4 2 the probability p that a flood or low flow value will be larger than a certain design value in a year is expressed in terms of the return period t i e t 1 p for example a t year flood exceeded once in t years according to the design values provided by the huaihe water conservancy commission qin et al 2021 and other previous studies smakhtin 2001 lópez and francés 2013 100 year flood and 2 year low flow events were selected for flood and low flow frequency analyses respectively the corresponding flood or low flow quantiles for each year for the optimal nonstationary models identified based on the aic criterion in section 4 2 can be calculated by using the distribution parameters i e parameters μ and σ as estimated for that year this allows for a direct comparison of stationary and nonstationary models for flood and low flow frequency analyses for the flood frequency analysis left panel in fig 6 the 100 year flood values estimated by stationary model 1 for the dpl ctg zgp and xx stations were 3121 4348 2508 and 9129 m3 s respectively for nonstationary model 2 the estimated 100 year flood values all show a downward trend and their trend line deviates downward from the estimated value of the model 1 over time specifically the 100 year flood value estimated by model 1 failed to cover the observed flood events in 1975 and 1968 i e 3580 and 11900 m3 s for the dpl and xx stations in which no significant temporal trend change was detected respectively but the values estimated by model 2 could cover all the observed flood points for the zgp station in which a significant downward trend p 0 1 was detected in the first half of the study period 1955 1990 the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 fluctuated around those estimated by model 1 however during the second half of the study period 1991 2016 almost all the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 were lower than those estimated by model 1 overall for the flood frequency analysis of stationary and nonstationary stations nonstationary model 2 performed better than stationary model 1 because nonstationary model 2 used precipitation and climate indices as covariates table 4 its estimated 100 year flood values not only covered all the observed flood events but also captured the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes for the low flow frequency analysis right panel in fig 6 the estimated 2 year low flow values for dpl ctg and xx stations in which no significant change point was detected covered 30 24 and 33 observed low flow points for stationary model 1 and 28 22 and 30 observed low flow points for nonstationary model 2 nonstationary model 2 which considers climatic variables as covariates does not perform significantly better than the stationary model in the analysis of low flow frequency however for the zgp station in which a significant change point was detected in 1980 the estimated 2 year low flow value by model 1 could cover most of the observed low flow points in the period before the change point 1955 1979 but could only capture a few of the observed low flow points during the period after the change point 1980 2016 nonstationary model 4 for the zgp station which considers the influence of reservoir regulation by introducing the ri index could reasonably describe the change in the magnitude of the estimated 2 year low flow values and could cover more observed points the estimated 2 year low flow value ranges for the model 4 increased from 0 51 1 31 m3 s during 1955 1979 to 1 65 4 28 m3 s during 1980 2016 this change is dramatic especially when compared with the value estimated by model 1 1 71 m3 s in general for stations with no significantly abrupt change point nonstationary model 2 using climatic variables as covariates and stationary model 1 performed equally well in the low flow frequency analysis for stations with significantly abrupt changes in the low flow series i e zgp station nonstationary model 4 incorporating ri as a covariate outperformed stationary model 1 in the low flow frequency analysis 5 discussion traditional flood or low flow frequency analyses are based on the stationarity assumption in which the parameters of the distributions are constant xiong et al 2018 however the impacts of climate variability and human activities challenge this fundamental assumption and the statistical distribution parameters may vary with these factors jiang et al 2015 in this study we proposed a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as functions of climatic variables and or ri for the flood and low flow records in which significant temporal trends or abrupt change points were detected the nonstationary models were a better fit than the stationary models the evaluation of the normality of the residuals for example filliben correlation coefficients and worm plots fig 4 supported the conclusion that the nonstationary models fit the data adequately comparisons of the centile lines fig 5 also reflected the improvement in the fitting of flood and low flow series after incorporating external covariates e g climatic variables and ri this highlights the flexibility of the nonstationary model to account for change points and temporal trends related to climate variability and reservoir regulations thus providing a useful tool for nonstationary flood and low flow analysis climate variability is widely recognised as one of the most important nonstationary drivers of flood or low flow processes slater et al 2021b in this study no significant change point was detected in the flood series of the four stations in the upper hrb only the flood series of the zgp stations showed a significant downward trend p 0 1 further analysis fig 3 b revealed that the trend of the observed flood series at the zgp station was consistent with that of the annual precipitation series therefore nonstationary models incorporating annual precipitation and large scale climate indices as covariates were constructed based on the gamlss model to consider the impact of climate variability on flood frequency analysis for the stations in which flood series have stationary characteristics i e dpl ctg xx stations or have a significant downward trend i e zgp station the 100 year flood values estimated by model 2 can cover all the observed flood points and can capture the generally decreasing trend in flood series and scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes however the 100 year flood values estimated by model 1 are constant throughout the entire study period this stationary model cannot consider the impacts of climate variability on the flood processes and may result in an overestimation of the design flood values therefore incorporating climate variables as covariates into nonstationary models can provide reasonably designed flood values for changing environments there have been systematic simulations of future precipitation and large scale climate indices in cmip5 and the latest cmip6 datasets ruiz barradas et al 2013 lin et al 2018 xia et al 2021 such attempts expand the possibility for using nonstationary models as effective tools to explore future flood and low flow processes under nonstationary conditions in addition to climate variability reservoir regulation direct anthropogenic water resource management behaviour is another nonstationary factor for extreme hydrological processes wang et al 2020 in this study nonstationary analysis results showed that only the low flow series at the zgp station had a significant change point in 1980 p 0 1 further analysis fig 3 a revealed that the change point of the low flow at the zgp station was closely related to the changes in its ri therefore in addition to climate variables model 2 for low flow of dpl ctg xx stations ri was incorporated as a covariate to construct nonstationary model 4 for the zgp station to consider the impacts of climate variability and reservoir regulations on low flow processes for stations with no significant change points in the low flow series models 1 and 2 performed equally well in the low flow frequency analysis for the zgp station in which a significant change point was detected stationary model 1 overestimated and underestimated the 2 year low flow design values before and after the change point respectively fig 6 f however model 4 outperformed model 1 and could accurately capture the changes in magnitude of the 2 year designed low flow values before and after the change point these findings were consistent with those obtained in recent studies shi et al 2011 jiang et al 2020 that is the reservoir operation plan in the study area usually considers the allocation of water resources to make it more evenly distributed in a year these anti seasonal regulations fig 7 increase the streamflow during the dry season thereby indirectly increasing the low flow magnitude it is therefore effective to incorporate the ri as a covariate into the nonstationary model to perform the low flow frequency analysis assuming that reservoir regulations lead to a significant abrupt change in the hydrological extreme process finally this study has some limitations that should be emphasised apart from climatic variables represented by precipitation and climate indices and reservoir regulations represented by ri there are other factors that can also lead to nonstationarity these include land use and cover change and water resource management as well as irrigation abstraction and inter basin water transfers do et al 2017 slater et al 2021b therefore other parameterisation schemes or methods that can account for human activities can be developed and incorporated into nonstationary models 6 conclusions in this study we used the gamlss framework to construct a nonstationary model in which the parameters of the selected distributions were modelled as a function of climatic variables i e climate indices and precipitation and or ri the nonstationary model was then applied for flood and low flow frequency analysis as such our consideration of the nonstationary impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic reservoir regulation on flood and low flow processes was the innovative part of this research we examined the proposed nonstationary model for four stations in the upper reaches of the hrb in china the results of the change point and temporal trend analysis showed that the annual flood record of the zgp station had a significant downward trend p 0 1 and the annual low flow series of the dpl and xx stations showed significant upward trends p 0 1 the annual low flow series of the zgp station exhibited a significant change in 1980 p 0 1 the results of the gamlss modelling showed that the nonstationary model incorporating precipitation and the arctic oscillation climatic index as covariates for location parameter μ of the gamma distribution gave a better fit for the flood series at the four stations than stationary models the nonstationary model that incorporated precipitation as covariates for location parameter μ of the weibull distribution provide a better fitting for the low flow series at the dpl ctg and xx stations in comparison with the stationary models especially for low flow series of zgp station the nonstationary model incorporating precipitation and ri as covariates for location parameter μ and ri as covariates for scale parameter σ of the weibull distribution gave a better fit than stationary models the improvement after incorporating climatic variables and ri in the description of flood and low flow series was clear and corresponds with optimality criteria e g aic and worm plots furthermore for flood frequency analysis comparison results showed that nonstationary models outperformed stationary models and could cover all flood observation points and capture the generally decreasing trend in flood series as well as a decrease in the scatter of estimated flood value magnitudes regarding the low flow frequency analysis the comparison results showed that the nonstationary and stationary models performed equally for the dpl ctg and xx stations in which no significant change point was detected however for zgp stations with significant abrupt changes in low flow series the nonstationary models performed better than the stationary model and could accurately capture the change in the magnitude of the designed low flow values before and after the change point overall the proposed nonstationary model can serve as a tool for the nonstationary frequency analysis of flood and low flow series under the influence of climate variability and human activities thus providing a reference for regional water infrastructure design and water resource

3007,mangrove wetlands connecting the land and sea are critical and dynamic ecosystems which act as biogeochemical reactors that influence the concentrations and distributions of heavy metals in the groundwater and adjacent seawater in this paper a subtropical mangrove wetland in china was selected to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater heavy metals and the driving mechanism along an intertidal transect with distinct undulated topography and vegetation zonation along the transect five groundwater observation wells w1 5 were set to collect groundwater samples at three different sediment depths 0 5 1 2 and 2 0 m and the advective flux between groundwater and surface water were calculated during four seasonal sampling campaigns from 2019 to 2020 the results showed that the seaward w1 3 acted as the groundwater discharge area while the landward w4 5 served as the surface water recharge area the results of single factor contamination index showed that a potential pollution risk of hg existed at the study sites the distribution of other heavy metals in the mangrove groundwater exhibited a seasonal variability along the transect during the sampling campaigns for example the relative high concentrations of fe pb cu cr and zn focused in the landward zones in the dry seasons autumn and winter 2019 whereas they changed to the seaward zones in the wet seasons summer and autumn 2020 moreover the intertidal aquifer can act as a sink to enrich heavy metals in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 but become a source to discharge heavy metals to the sea in summer 2020 the above migration patterns of heavy metals were ascribed to the multiple complex factors including the seawater groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activities this study contributed to the better understanding of heavy metal behaviors in mangrove groundwater so as to improve the sustainable management of mangrove wetlands under the pressure of anthropogenic activities and climate change keywords mangrove wetland coastal groundwater heavy metals seasonal variation submarine groundwater discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mangrove wetlands as coastal transitional ecosystems connect the land and the oceans and are widely distributed in the intertidal coastal zones of tropical and subtropical regions between 30 n and 30 s giri et al 2011 they provide diverse ecological values including maintaining biodiversity blue carbon sequestration prevention of shoreline erosion water purification and climate regulation chen et al 2018 costanza et al 2014 teh et al 2009 wang and gu 2021 water pollution in mangrove wetlands caused by the input of various anthropogenic pollutants has been widely reported worldwide among which heavy metal pollutants are the main ones kulkarni et al 2018 recent studies have showed that excessive enrichment of heavy metals will not only influence the mangroves healthy but also enter the food chain and pose a threat to human health bourgeois et al 2020 he et al 2014 lu et al 2018 mangrove sediments are natural filters to buffer heavy metals due to their specific sedimentary properties i e richness in fine grained sediments and organic matters they can effectively trap heavy metals from groundwater suspended solids and surface water bastakoti et al 2018 marchand et al 2016 thanh nho et al 2019 bastakoti et al 2018 observed that the contents of organic matters were 10 times higher inside versus outside the mangroves in the mangawhai estuary of new zealand however the heavy metals in wetland systems are not simply migrated from surface water to sediments due to the complicated interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as tidal flushing robinson et al 2018 liu et al 2019 irregular wave xin et al 2010 bioturbations he et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a redox reactions beck et al 2008 o connor et al 2018 and microbial activities mcallister et al 2015 the precipitated heavy metals in sediments could be released into the groundwater or surface water via submarine groundwater discharge sgd when the above processes changed atkinson et al 2007 holloway et al 2016 thanh nho et al 2020 therefore the hydrological conditions and biogeochemical reactions usually determine whether mangrove systems are a net sink or source of heavy metals liu et al 2019 telfeyan et al 2017 our current understanding of the geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in mangrove groundwater was mainly based on tidal scale or single sampling events e g holloway et al 2018 holloway et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the variability at the seasonal scale and driving mechanism remains unclear but the crucial effects of seasonal changes on hydrology and redox conditions have been demonstrated heiss and michael 2014 o connor et al 2018 for example gonneea et al 2013 found that the seasonal movement of salinity interface can change the barium concentrations in groundwater by more than three orders of magnitude in the estuarine zone in waquoit bay mcallister et al 2015 found that the seasonal changes affect microbial controls on the location and composition of the fe mineralized zone in a beach aquifer at cape shores delaware although some studies focused on the variations of heavy metals at the seasonal scale they paid little attention to the intertidal aquifers with mangrove coverage and only analyzed single or several kinds of heavy metals charbonnier et al 2013 mori et al 2019 thanh nho et al 2018 sgd is widely regarded as a significant pathway to transport heavy metals to coastal waters burnett et al 2003 trezzi et al 2016a the magnitude of which may be equal to or exceed the fluxes carried by river water li et al 2018 sanders et al 2012 wang et al 2019 in particular mangrove wetlands are an important area for studying sgd sadat noori et al 2017 because such fluxes may be up to approximately one third of annual global river discharge to the ocean tait et al 2016 therefore the high concentrations of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands will not only affect the mangrove growth but also impact the budget of heavy metals in the ocean and likely pollute the food chain marchand et al 2016 trezzi et al 2016a in addition the pollution assessment of heavy metals has been extensively researched and evaluated in mangrove sediments jiang et al 2020 thanh nho et al 2019 while heavy metals have been seldom evaluated in mangrove groundwater in this study we hypothesized that the heavy metals in mangrove groundwater at our study site had high spatiotemporal variability even at the intertidal scale and the migration mechanism was affected by multiple factors such as the redox conditions topography sampling seasons and hydrological factors like tides rainfall and the surface water groundwater interactions to test these hypotheses we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy metals fe pb cu cr zn ba hg as ni and cd in mangrove groundwater along an intertidal transect with a distinct undulated topography and vegetation zonation during four different seasons the groundwater monitoring was also conducted to analyze the surface water and groundwater interaction dynamics by estimating the rates of groundwater outflow and surface water inflow the hydrodynamic parameters including duration frequency and height of inundation were also quantitatively calculated to identify the hydrologic processes under the dual effects of topography and tides at different sampling points the statistical analysis was also employed to analyze the potential migration mechanism of heavy metals in the groundwater finally the pollution conditions and fluxes of groundwater seawater exchange derived heavy metals were estimated to emphasize the roles of mangrove intertidal aquifer as a sink or source of heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in hailing island hli national wetland park of mangrove forest yangjiang city southwest china hli has a total area of 108 89 km2 and is about 16 km away from the estuary of moyang river fig 1 a it belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by a mild climate and an annual average temperature of 22 c the annual mean rainfall here is 2040 mm mostly occurring in summer and autumn hli has a mixed semidiurnal tide type with two cycles of high and low tides in one day and a mean tidal range of 1 5 m the wetland park only has an area of 0 32 km2 but multiple mangrove species including sonneratia apetala kandelia obovata avicennia marina and laguncularia racemosa are living there the study site is not typical of subtropical sites since it has a landward groundwater control through the presence of a dam and fish ponds providing a relatively stable groundwater recharge fig 1b the sediments are mainly composed of a low permeability mud layer with a thickness of 0 3 1 0 m at the shallow layer and the high permeability sand layer at the bottom layer from the point of view of the vegetation zonation the transect could be classified into the interior mangrove at the landward boundary fringe mangrove in the middle and bare mudflat at the seaward boundary the interior mangrove zone has a higher surface elevation which is mainly occupied by bushy and tall 2 3 m avicennia marina trees the fringe mangrove with a lower elevation and gentle slope is composed of small and sparse seedlings 2 2 fieldwork and measurement in the study site a typical intertidal transect with a distinct undulated topography and mangrove plants was chosen along the transect we set up 5 monitoring wells w1 5 which consisted of pvc tubes with pressure sensors ltc diver solinst and buried at a depth of 0 3 m below the sediment surface fig 1c w1 3 were in the fringe mangrove zone and w4 5 were in the interior mangrove zone it should be noted that a large slope break occurs between w4 and w3 we added an additional monitoring well w0 without pressure sensor in a bare mudflat for the contrastive groundwater sampling all sensors monitored the groundwater level electrical conductivity and temperature at an hourly frequency from november 8 2019 to march 1 2020 groundwater and seawater samples were collected during four seasonal sampling campaigns in autumn and winter in 2019 and summer and autumn in 2020 considering the limited activities caused by the covid 19 we did not conduct sampling in spring 2020 causing a discontinuity in time the groundwater was easily extracted at different depths 0 5 1 2 and 2 0 m when a stainless steel sampler pushpointtm groundwater sampler was used www mheproducts com nearby each well w0 5 at low tides fig s1 meanwhile two nearshore seawater samples were collected for comparison at each sampling campaign the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of w1 5 was determined by the multi diameter falling head method wang et al 2014 the surface elevations and relative distances of the above wells were measured at a low tide by an rtk real time kinematic altimeter hi target china based on the beidou navigation satellite system the in situ physicochemical parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential orp and salinity of collected water samples were immediately measured by a calibrated multi parameter probe hanan instruments hi 9829 the accuracy of ph orp and salinity is 0 02 ph 1 0 mv orp and 0 01 psu respectively all water samples were filtered by 0 45 μm semi permeable glass fibre membranes with syringes then put into a brown polythene bottle and stored in the refrigerator 4 c until laboratory measurements the concentrations of fe pb cu cr zn ba as ni and cd were determined with the icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific usa hg was measured by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9760 2 3 data treatment 2 3 1 surface water groundwater exchange the vertical exchange rate qn l t was calculated based on the generalized darcy s law by the following equation ma et al 2015 1 q n δ k v h surface h w δ l ε c w c s 2 where kv denotes the vertical hydraulic

the j th well w1 5 were calculated by the following equations ma et al 2015 2 q out 1 t e t 0 t 0 t e max t 0 q n t d t 3 q in 1 t e t 0 t 0 t e max t 0 q n t d t where t0 and te are the initial and end times for the calculated period which are 0 and 360 h respectively based on the groundwater level monitored three groundwater dynamic parameters including the inundation duration id inundation height ih m and inundation frequency if d were quantified to explore the potential influence on spatial patterns of heavy metals in different sampling sites id was calculated as the ratio of the inundation time to the total observation time so that it was the percentage of time that surface water was over the wetland surface xiao et al 2017 ih was the average value of water depth above the sediment surface during high tides if is calculated as the average number of inundation events per day 2 3 2 pollution assessment of heavy metals considering the fact that the intertidal aquifer is a complex mixed zone of seawater and groundwater it is difficult to represent the water quality by using a single water type groundwater or seawater quality standard xiao et al 2019b therefore we used the single factor contamination index sfci which combined the water quality standards of groundwater and seawater to evaluate the pollution conditions of heavy metals in the intertidal mangrove groundwater qu et al 2020 xiao et al 2019b 4 sfc i i c i s i c i g i c i s i g i where ci denotes the concentration of the heavy metal of the i th groundwater sample si and gi are standard values for groundwater class ⅴ cfgs 2017 and seawater class ⅳ cfss 1997 table s2 respectively it should be noted that due to the lack of seawater quality standards the values of sfci of fe and ba are determined by ci gi pollution of the i th heavy metals occurs when sfci 1 2 3 3 estimation of heavy metal fluxes based on the results of groundwater surface water exchange rates of each well associated heavy

analyses in this study the hierarchical cluster analysis hca and pearson correlation analysis were combined to analyze the relationships among variables hca a data classification method groups similar objects into the same group rakotondrabe et al 2018 the smaller the distance the more similar or close the two objects chen et al 2007 hca includes q type i e studying the relationship between samples and r type i e studying the relationships among variables here hca was conducted according to ward s method with the euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity güler et al 2002 moya et al 2015 the one way analysis of variance anova with 95 confidence intervals was employed to determine differences between the four sampling campaigns and among surface middle and lower zones there are significant differences between samples when the significance p is 0 05 all the statistical computations and correlated results were performed by origin 2021 originlab northampton ma the topography and heavy metals or physicochemical parameters were presented in 2 d contour maps using the kriging tool in surfer 13 golden software 3 results 3 1 hydrologic dynamic characteristics during the monitoring period the total rainfall reached 1860 mm slightly less than the multi year average 2040 mm the rainfall mainly concentrated in june to september in 2019 accounting for 62 of the annual rainfall in general four sampling campaigns were carried out in dry autumn and winter in 2019 and wet summer and autumn in 2020 seasons fig s2 the groundwater level at each well fluctuated periodically with tides when the surface was flooding and the variation range decreased toward the inland fig 2 for example along the transect the average groundwater level at w1 3 1 25 m was obviously larger than that of w4 5 1 03 m in addition the average inundation duration 72 09 and height 0 59 m at w1 3 were also larger than those at w4 5 48 45 and 0 41 m whereas the inundation frequency was approximately equal in w1 2 and w4 5 fig 2f the highest inundation frequency 1 75 d at w3 may be caused by the steep slope break of surface elevation which leads to more recirculating seawater the outflow and inflow rates estimated by eq 1 in the autumn and winter of 2019 are shown in fig 3 there was a large inflow rate in the interior mangrove with the maximum at w4 followed by w5 but the outflow rate was nearly zero from w3 to w1 the outflow and inflow rates had an obviously increasing trend the maximum outflow rates occurred at w1 reaching 0 10 and 0 08 m d in autumn and winter 2019 respectively in general w4 5 acted as the recharge zone for seawater and w1 3 was the groundwater discharge zone forming a surface water groundwater circulation system compared with autumn 2019 the outflow rate of w1 3 had decreased by approximately 0 18 times from 0 05 to 0 04 m d on average but the inflow rate of w1 5 had increased by about 0 11 times from 0 28 to 0 31 m d on average in winter 2019 3 2 physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical parameters ph p 0 01 salinity p 0 01 orp p 0 05 of mangrove groundwater significantly varied with sampling seasons in addition the ph salinity and orp in the recharge and discharge zone were distinct and usually the minimum values appeared at the recharge zone and increased toward the sea along the transect fig 4 the differences between the surface middle and lower zones were not statistically significant p 0 05 the average ph in groundwater was always lower than that in seawater reaching the minimum in summer 2020 7 4 0 2 and maximum in autumn 2020 7 7 0 2 table s3 the average salinity in groundwater ranged from 24 5 in autumn 2019 to 27 3 in autumn 2020 and was close to that of seawater during all sampling campaigns indicating that the intertidal groundwater was strongly influenced by the periodic mixing of seawater nevertheless a high saline plume formed around w2 and extended down several meters 2 m depth the center of the plume remained stationary w2 whereas the extent and concentration varied obviously with the seasons fig 4b the maximum plume of width 60 m and salinity 30 ppt was observed in autumn 2020 the orp in the groundwater varied significantly with the seasons and generally a much more reduced environment was obtained in summer 2020 than in other seasons groundwater samples along the entire transect showed reduction potential in the winter 2019 and summer 2020 while in the autumn 2019 and 2020 the recharge zone manifested stronger reduction potential and slight oxidation potential existed in the seaward ones w0 3 fig 4c w4 seemed to be more reduced than all other sampling points and the minimum value 419 5 mv appeared here in summer 2020 3 3 heavy metals 3 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution the statistical analysis for heavy metal concentrations in mangrove groundwater and seawater were shown in table s3 the mean concentrations of heavy metals in the groundwater during the four seasonal campaigns expressed as microgram per liter were in the following descending order fe 151 37 ba 43 40 zn 32 59 cr 2 36 as 1 86 cu 1 85 ni 0 73 pb 0 58 hg 0 11 the concentration of fe was much higher than other heavy metals indicating a fe rich environment besides this order varied seasonally but the top three fe zn and ba were constant cd is not discussed in this paper because 85 of the samples were below the detection limit and the concentration in the detected samples was also suitable to the water quality standard table s2 the results obtained from the anova analysis indicated that the concentrations of heavy metals except fe in mangrove groundwater presented significant differences between four seasonal campaigns the significant level of cu cr zn and as were at p 0 05 and pb ba hg and ni were at p 0 01 the differences between each other showed that at least one season was significantly different with other seasons although the differences in the average concentrations of fe in the four sampling campaigns were not statistically significant the maximum concentration reached as high as 616 1 μg l during winter 2019 and as low as 42 7 μg l during autumn 2019 some heavy metals had consistent seasonal patterns which might indicate a constant source and or chemical reactions the average concentrations of fe pb and cu in both seawater and groundwater increased in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 and decreased in summer 2020 fig 5 a c however hg as and ni in groundwater decreased in winter 2019 and increased in summer 2020 fig 5g i the variation patterns of cr zn and ba in groundwater were unique fig 5d f especially zn continued to decrease from 68 6 to 16 38 μg l the spatial distributions of heavy metals showed a more complicated migration pattern most heavy metals displayed a high concentration plume at the landward zone e g at w5 in the autumn and winter of 2019 i e dry season while in summer and autumn of 2020 i e wet season the plume moved towards the seaward direction especially for cu cr and zn fig 6 in autumn and winter of 2019 the heavy metal concentrations tended to decrease closer to the sea boundary i e fe pb cu cr and zn but the concentrations of hg and as were lower in the landward direction only slightly enriched in the w4 surface zone in autumn 2019 fig 6g h in summer of 2020 the heavy metals except ba were in low concentration levels at w5 and the high concentrations occurred at w2 4 fig 6a e g i by autumn of 2020 the landward heavy metals decreased more and accumulated closer to the sea w0 1 such as cu cr zn ba and hg fig 6c g it was noteworthy that pb cu and cr became slightly enriched at w5 again fig 6b d indicating that the enrichment trend seemed to have a seasonal cycle throughout the transect the vertical variation in heavy metals in the groundwater during sampling campaigns seemed not to be as obvious as horizontal variability on the whole the heavy metals had no significant difference in the vertical directions among surface middle and lower zones p 0 05 during seasonal campaigns except as the concentration of which at the surface zone was obviously higher than that at the lower zone p 0 05 in autumn 2019 however some vertical deviations were observed notably patches of high or low heavy metal concentrations in the vertical distribution showed highly heterogeneity such as fe at w3 and hg at w2 in autumn 2019 and ba at w1 in autumn 2020 fig 6 3 3 2 pollution assessment of heavy metals as shown in fig 7 the spatial distribution of the calculated sfci indicated that none of the heavy metals exceeded the pollution threshold sfci 1 among them the first and second largest values of sfci appeared in hg which were 0 45 in autumn 2019 and 0 42 in summer 2020 respectively and they both occurred in the lower zone of w2 therefore there seemed no heavy metal contamination in mangrove groundwater but there existed a slight potential pollution risk of hg the concentrations of investigated heavy metals in the two seawater samples were less than class ⅴ in the seawater quality standards gb t 14848 2017 indicating that the heavy metal pollution did not occur in the seawater as well 3 3 3 heavy metal fluxes according to eqs 5 6 and 7 the heavy metal fluxes including effluxes fin influxes fout and net fluxes fne t in autumn and winter 2019 were shown in fig 8 in these two seasons the effluxes and influxes of fe zn and ba were 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of other heavy metals which were constant with their concentration order the horizontal variation of heavy metal fluxes matched well with the surface water groundwater exchange rates which were mainly infiltrated at w4 5 and discharged at w1 3 the net fluxes of heavy metals were negative except hg indicating the investigated transect mainly accepted the input of heavy metals from seawater from the autumn to winter 2019 the heavy metal fluxes varied widely due to the seasonal variations of heavy metal concentrations in groundwater seawater and groundwater surface water exchange rates the effluxes of fe cr zn ba hg and as decreased with the decreasing sgd rate but the pb cu and ni increased by 0 01 0 96 and 0 26 times although the inflow rates of seawater increased by 0 11 times fe pb zn and ni increased by 0 13 2 45 0 55 and 3 35 times and cu cr ba and as decreased by 0 40 0 09 0 26 and 0 38 times in addition the net fluxes of fe pb zn and ni increased by 0 17 2 89 0 66 and 3 72 times and the cu cr ba hg and as decreased by 0 45 0 06 0 22 0 69 and 0 25 times respectively 3 4 q type hca analysis as shown in fig 9 all the sampling points had clustered into two groups by q type hca in four sampling campaigns according to their similarities among variables ph orp salinity and nine varieties of heavy metals generally the seaward groundwater discharge zone at w0 3 was classified into one group cluster 1 while the seawater recharge zone at w4 5 belonged to the other group cluster 2 for example in winter 2019 cluster 2 only consisted of 4 s 4 m 5 s 5 m and 5 l according to their similar features fig 9b the hca results also exhibited that in autumn 2019 surface or lower zone which consisted of 0 s 1 s 2 s and 4 s was easier to be classified into one group at the distance of 6 fig 9a but the other seasons had no obvious similarity at depths these above differences by q type hca were consistent with the spatial distribution of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals figs 4 and 6 this proved again that there were obvious hydrologic and chemical zoning behaviors at the mangrove intertidal transect 4 discussion 4 1 correlation analyses and seasonal variability the r type hca classified the variables into three groups but the members of within group had seasonal variability fig 10 for example the ph orp and salinity were closely related to each other according to r type hca and pearson correlation analysis especially in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 were grouped together as shown in fig 4 the seaward groundwater was characterized by high values of ph orp and salinity these may indicate that the mangrove groundwater was intensely influenced by the seawater mixing the relationship between heavy metals was closest in summer 2020 as all heavy metals except ni were grouped fig 10c while in the other seasons the nine heavy metals were generally grouped into three groups fig 10a b d variations in within group members may indicate that the factors influencing physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in the groundwater exhibited seasonal variability the relationships between different heavy metals were both complicated and seasonally variable the mangrove groundwater in this study was rich in fe mean concentration 151 4 μg l an essential redox reactive element kristensen et al 2017 telfeyan et al 2017 fe and zn were always classified into the same group and there was a high correlation between them in the winter 2019 p 0 01 and summer 2020 p 0 05 fig 9 furthermore fe showed different degrees of positive correlation with pb p 0 01 cr p 0 05 ba p 0 05 winter 2019 cu p 0 01 summer 2020 and ni p 0 05 autumn 2020 fig 9 indicating that the redox cycling of fe species exerted important biogeochemical effects on other heavy metals for example both fe hydr oxides and fe sulfide minerals can sequester heavy metals by effective adsorption and co precipitation and release heavy metals when redox conditions changed bone et al 2006 bower et al 2008 charette and sholkovitz 2006 han et al 2013 kalnejais et al 2015 pan et al 2021 richard et al 2016 rinklebe and shaheen 2017 in addition fe species in oxidized or reduced environments can directly chemically react with some heavy metals for example fe iii is a strong oxidant which can act as an electron acceptor to oxidize some reductive heavy metals in oxic aquatic environments hg 0 can be relatively quickly oxidized to high water soluble hg ⅱ by various reagents including fe hydr oxides and fe phosphates stein et al 1996 zhu et al 2018 therefore most heavy metals in the groundwater e g pb cu cr zn and ba showed increased trends when fe concentrations increased whereas hg and as with low concentrations seemed to be removed by fe biogeochemical cycles fig 6 moreover ba had a strong positive correlation with fe p 0 05 cr p 0 05 zn p 0 05 pb p 0 01 and ni p 0 01 in the winter 2019 and in a group or was closer to other heavy metals according to r type hca fig 10 ba a natural geochemical indicator is a geochemical analogue of radium which can be released from suspended matter during saltwater and freshwater mixing gonneea et al 2013 peterson et al 2008 in the intertidal aquifer ba concentrations in groundwater can peak over a wide range of salinity 2 20 and decrease when the salinity exceeds this range santos et al 2011 in this study the maximum salinity at w2 along the transect which was 27 3 26 8 28 2 and 30 3 for autumn winter 2019 and summer autumn 2020 respectively likely leading to the lowest concentration of ba fig 4b and 6f 4 2 factors driving heavy metal migration the results in this study showed the obvious differences in the concentration and distribution of heavy metals between the recharge zone w4 5 and discharge zone w0 3 in different seasons years the heavy metal migration in the groundwater of intertidal mangroves were affected by surface water groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activity these factors varied with the seasons resulting in complex migration patterns of heavy metals the hydrological conditions play an important role in driving the heavy metal migrations and changing the redox conditions beck et al 2017 liu et al 2019 two visible seasonal enrichment areas of heavy metals appeared at w5 in the recharge zone autumn and winter 2019 and at w0 1 in the discharge zone autumn 2020 respectively fig 6 the encounter of oxic seawater and hypoxic groundwater would change the heavy metal phases and form biogeochemical reaction hotspots in addition non conservative addition or removal may occur during the mixing process of seawater and groundwater mori et al 2019 beck et al 2017 though the correlation between heavy metals and salinity was not apparent we observed that the groundwater with the same salinity with seawater showed a clear difference in concentrations of heavy metal for example in the summer 2020 the concentration of fe in seawater was about 61 1 μg l while for the same salinity 25 26 the concentrations in the groundwater ranged widely from 63 8 to 354 3 μg l however the dynamic hydrology parameters of the groundwater seemed to have little effect on the heavy metals in this frequently inundated intertidal transect the inundation duration and depth in the recharge zone were relatively low but with lower orp and higher heavy metal influxes than the discharge zone which was unexpected because the large inundation duration and depth generally result in a more reducing environment and promote seawater infiltration kristensen et al 2017 moreover the seawater infiltration was an important reason for the seasonal variation of heavy metals in the groundwater due to the high salinity of the transect groundwater 26 2 2 5 on average during the four seasonal sampling campaigns the impact of inland fresh groundwater discharge on heavy metals was expected to be low the concentrations of heavy metals in seawater and transect groundwater showed a consistently seasonal variation trend but their magnitude relation had obvious seasonal changes except that the concentrations of ba and hg were always higher than those in seawater during four sampling campaigns fig 5 in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 all heavy metal concentrations except fe and cu in winter in groundwater were lower than those in seawater indicating that the intertidal aquifer can effectively sequester and buffer the discharge of heavy metals to the sea charette and sholkovitz 2006 mcallister et al 2015 in summer 2020 heavy metals in the groundwater were higher than those in the seawater which became a source of heavy metals discharging into the ocean o connor et al 2018 showed that fe may be remobilized seasonally within the intertidal aquifer and serve as a periodic source of dissolved fe therefore the intertidal aquifer may act as a seasonal source or sink to discharge or sequester heavy metals vegetation zonation directly affected the surface water groundwater exchange rates and biogeochemical reactions in the interior mangrove many macropores e g crab burrows and decayed roots increased the sediment permeability and provided the preferential conduit which led to larger heavy metal influxes than fringe mangrove and bare mudflat mangrove sediments were characterized by high organic matters bastakoti et al 2018 pan et al 2019 which usually reached the maximum concentrations during high productivity summer o connor et al 2018 sanders et al 2015 santos et al 2009 further the remineralization of organic matters would consume the fe oxides oxygen and other electron acceptors and heavy metals formed relatively stable complexes with organic ligands to promote the solubility of heavy metals e g fe pb cu cr zn hg as ni etc beck et al 2008 costa et al 2020 richard et al 2016 rinklebe and shaheen 2017 this might be one of the reasons for the accumulation of heavy metals in the interior mangrove in the autumn and winter of 2019 by the summer and autumn of 2020 the remineralization of organic matters and the rainfall enhanced fresh groundwater discharge may lead to a stronger reducing environment 277 4 mv and 128 6 mv in interior mangroves than in the autumn and winter of 2019 54 9 mv and 42 4 mv these would cause heavy metal oxides to dissolve as a local source transported from the recharge zone to the discharge zone ultimately precipitating with iron sulfides in the sediments during the transport process in addition the anthropogenic activities may be another reason responsible for the seasonal difference of heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater from the beginning of 2020 the outbreak of covid 19 caused attenuated anthropogenic activities and thus limited industrial and agricultural production throughout china recent studies have indicated that covid 19 significantly improved china s air and river water quality in the short term wang and su 2020 liu et al 2022 as a protected mangrove ecosystem hli had been rarely directly impacted by industrial pollution however there existed many seafood restaurant and fish ponds in the vicinity of the mangrove wetland which can affect groundwater quality particularly in the wet seasons previous studies have verified their crucial roles in regulating the distribution and mobility of heavy metals in the groundwater of mangrove wetlands feng et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 in this study the concentrations of fe pb cu and cr in the groundwater decreased significantly in summer 2020 fig 5 whereas after a certain period of industrial and agricultural recovery e g in autumn 2020 the heavy metal concentrations returned to or even exceeded pre covid 19 values therefore the covid 19 induced attenuation of anthropogenic activities may relieve the terrestrial input of heavy metals in coastal regions to a large extent 4 3 comparison and uncertainty although there was no heavy metal pollution both in groundwater and seawater through the pollution assessment fig 7 some heavy metals were still at high concentration levels in this study for example the concentrations of fe cu cr zn as and hg were generally greater than those in other studies of mangrove groundwater table 1 in addition to anthropogenic activities such as the adjacent aquaculture which may transport metals into groundwater it should be noted that the study area may be affected by pollutants from the pearl river and moyang river basins due to the influence of seasonal monsoon winds ge et al 2018 liu et al 2010 in the moyang river estuary about 16 km away from hli mangrove wetland the concentrations of fe cu cr zn and hg in the groundwater were at the same magnitude but the pb was about 10 50 fold higher than hli deng et al 2018 moreover the concentrations of fe cu cr zn and hg even exceeded those in the pearl river estuary in comparison with three recent studies fang and wang 2022 luo et al 2021 niu et al 2021 therefore there may be a high ecological risk of fe cu cr zn as and hg in hli mangrove wetland the heavy metal fluxes carried by sgd in this study were within the range of other studies worldwide that were seriously impacted by human activities table 2 in particular the sgd associated cu cr as and ni fluxes were in the same order of magnitude compared with the greater bay area china but the fluxes of pb and zn were an order of magnitude higher luo et al 2021 further the sgd associated hg flux was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of waquoit bay usa bone et al 2007 the heavy metals were mainly infiltrated at w4 5 and discharged from w1 3 but the influxes of heavy metals were usually greater than effluxes during autumn and winter of 2019 fnet 0 the imbalance caused by surface water groundwater interactions was mainly related to the calculated length of the transect mangrove groundwater discharge still occurred beyond w1 toward the sea but the calculated length focused the zone between w1 and w5 according to the locations of the monitoring wells in addition the uncertainties were also caused by measurement errors including groundwater level 0 1 electrical conductivity 2 and vertical hydraulic conductivities by in situ falling head method 10 surface elevations and heavy metal concentrations were proven not to cause great errors ma et al 2015 qu et al 2017 5 conclusion the present study investigated the spatiotemporal patterns and fluxes of groundwater derived heavy metals in the intertidal aquifer in a subtropical mangrove wetland in china the spatial distribution and migration mechanism of heavy metals in this paper were explained by multiple factors including seawater groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activities the average concentrations of heavy metals displayed significant seasonal differences except fe through the anova analysis and were mainly controlled by seawater infiltration the heavy metals were mainly accumulated in the landward recharge zone in dry seasons autumn and winter 2019 with the concentrations showing a decreasing trend toward the sea however the enrichment trend of heavy metals reversed in wet seasons summer and autumn 2020 which were mainly modulated by the more reduced environment enhanced fresh groundwater discharge and attenuated anthropogenic activities mangrove groundwater generally acted as the source of heavy metals discharged into the sea in summer 2020 but changed as a sink in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 due to the seasonal variabilities in redox influenced biogeochemical reactions and covid 19 associated reduction in anthropogenic activities the concentrations of fe cu cr zn hg and as in hli mangrove groundwater were usually high and existed a potential hg pollution risk indicated by sfci in addition the higher zn and hg fluxes derived by groundwater discharge may have harmful effects on the health of mangrove ecosystems and coastal marine environments seasonal scale dynamics of heavy metals in the groundwater of mangroves in the intertidal zone has received only minor attention and this study could provide basic information for the effective management of mangrove protection and ecological

3007,mangrove wetlands connecting the land and sea are critical and dynamic ecosystems which act as biogeochemical reactors that influence the concentrations and distributions of heavy metals in the groundwater and adjacent seawater in this paper a subtropical mangrove wetland in china was selected to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater heavy metals and the driving mechanism along an intertidal transect with distinct undulated topography and vegetation zonation along the transect five groundwater observation wells w1 5 were set to collect groundwater samples at three different sediment depths 0 5 1 2 and 2 0 m and the advective flux between groundwater and surface water were calculated during four seasonal sampling campaigns from 2019 to 2020 the results showed that the seaward w1 3 acted as the groundwater discharge area while the landward w4 5 served as the surface water recharge area the results of single factor contamination index showed that a potential pollution risk of hg existed at the study sites the distribution of other heavy metals in the mangrove groundwater exhibited a seasonal variability along the transect during the sampling campaigns for example the relative high concentrations of fe pb cu cr and zn focused in the landward zones in the dry seasons autumn and winter 2019 whereas they changed to the seaward zones in the wet seasons summer and autumn 2020 moreover the intertidal aquifer can act as a sink to enrich heavy metals in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 but become a source to discharge heavy metals to the sea in summer 2020 the above migration patterns of heavy metals were ascribed to the multiple complex factors including the seawater groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activities this study contributed to the better understanding of heavy metal behaviors in mangrove groundwater so as to improve the sustainable management of mangrove wetlands under the pressure of anthropogenic activities and climate change keywords mangrove wetland coastal groundwater heavy metals seasonal variation submarine groundwater discharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mangrove wetlands as coastal transitional ecosystems connect the land and the oceans and are widely distributed in the intertidal coastal zones of tropical and subtropical regions between 30 n and 30 s giri et al 2011 they provide diverse ecological values including maintaining biodiversity blue carbon sequestration prevention of shoreline erosion water purification and climate regulation chen et al 2018 costanza et al 2014 teh et al 2009 wang and gu 2021 water pollution in mangrove wetlands caused by the input of various anthropogenic pollutants has been widely reported worldwide among which heavy metal pollutants are the main ones kulkarni et al 2018 recent studies have showed that excessive enrichment of heavy metals will not only influence the mangroves healthy but also enter the food chain and pose a threat to human health bourgeois et al 2020 he et al 2014 lu et al 2018 mangrove sediments are natural filters to buffer heavy metals due to their specific sedimentary properties i e richness in fine grained sediments and organic matters they can effectively trap heavy metals from groundwater suspended solids and surface water bastakoti et al 2018 marchand et al 2016 thanh nho et al 2019 bastakoti et al 2018 observed that the contents of organic matters were 10 times higher inside versus outside the mangroves in the mangawhai estuary of new zealand however the heavy metals in wetland systems are not simply migrated from surface water to sediments due to the complicated interactions between hydrological and biogeochemical processes such as tidal flushing robinson et al 2018 liu et al 2019 irregular wave xin et al 2010 bioturbations he et al 2017 xiao et al 2019a redox reactions beck et al 2008 o connor et al 2018 and microbial activities mcallister et al 2015 the precipitated heavy metals in sediments could be released into the groundwater or surface water via submarine groundwater discharge sgd when the above processes changed atkinson et al 2007 holloway et al 2016 thanh nho et al 2020 therefore the hydrological conditions and biogeochemical reactions usually determine whether mangrove systems are a net sink or source of heavy metals liu et al 2019 telfeyan et al 2017 our current understanding of the geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in mangrove groundwater was mainly based on tidal scale or single sampling events e g holloway et al 2018 holloway et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the variability at the seasonal scale and driving mechanism remains unclear but the crucial effects of seasonal changes on hydrology and redox conditions have been demonstrated heiss and michael 2014 o connor et al 2018 for example gonneea et al 2013 found that the seasonal movement of salinity interface can change the barium concentrations in groundwater by more than three orders of magnitude in the estuarine zone in waquoit bay mcallister et al 2015 found that the seasonal changes affect microbial controls on the location and composition of the fe mineralized zone in a beach aquifer at cape shores delaware although some studies focused on the variations of heavy metals at the seasonal scale they paid little attention to the intertidal aquifers with mangrove coverage and only analyzed single or several kinds of heavy metals charbonnier et al 2013 mori et al 2019 thanh nho et al 2018 sgd is widely regarded as a significant pathway to transport heavy metals to coastal waters burnett et al 2003 trezzi et al 2016a the magnitude of which may be equal to or exceed the fluxes carried by river water li et al 2018 sanders et al 2012 wang et al 2019 in particular mangrove wetlands are an important area for studying sgd sadat noori et al 2017 because such fluxes may be up to approximately one third of annual global river discharge to the ocean tait et al 2016 therefore the high concentrations of heavy metals in mangrove wetlands will not only affect the mangrove growth but also impact the budget of heavy metals in the ocean and likely pollute the food chain marchand et al 2016 trezzi et al 2016a in addition the pollution assessment of heavy metals has been extensively researched and evaluated in mangrove sediments jiang et al 2020 thanh nho et al 2019 while heavy metals have been seldom evaluated in mangrove groundwater in this study we hypothesized that the heavy metals in mangrove groundwater at our study site had high spatiotemporal variability even at the intertidal scale and the migration mechanism was affected by multiple factors such as the redox conditions topography sampling seasons and hydrological factors like tides rainfall and the surface water groundwater interactions to test these hypotheses we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy metals fe pb cu cr zn ba hg as ni and cd in mangrove groundwater along an intertidal transect with a distinct undulated topography and vegetation zonation during four different seasons the groundwater monitoring was also conducted to analyze the surface water and groundwater interaction dynamics by estimating the rates of groundwater outflow and surface water inflow the hydrodynamic parameters including duration frequency and height of inundation were also quantitatively calculated to identify the hydrologic processes under the dual effects of topography and tides at different sampling points the statistical analysis was also employed to analyze the potential migration mechanism of heavy metals in the groundwater finally the pollution conditions and fluxes of groundwater seawater exchange derived heavy metals were estimated to emphasize the roles of mangrove intertidal aquifer as a sink or source of heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in hailing island hli national wetland park of mangrove forest yangjiang city southwest china hli has a total area of 108 89 km2 and is about 16 km away from the estuary of moyang river fig 1 a it belongs to a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by a mild climate and an annual average temperature of 22 c the annual mean rainfall here is 2040 mm mostly occurring in summer and autumn hli has a mixed semidiurnal tide type with two cycles of high and low tides in one day and a mean tidal range of 1 5 m the wetland park only has an area of 0 32 km2 but multiple mangrove species including sonneratia apetala kandelia obovata avicennia marina and laguncularia racemosa are living there the study site is not typical of subtropical sites since it has a landward groundwater control through the presence of a dam and fish ponds providing a relatively stable groundwater recharge fig 1b the sediments are mainly composed of a low permeability mud layer with a thickness of 0 3 1 0 m at the shallow layer and the high permeability sand layer at the bottom layer from the point of view of the vegetation zonation the transect could be classified into the interior mangrove at the landward boundary fringe mangrove in the middle and bare mudflat at the seaward boundary the interior mangrove zone has a higher surface elevation which is mainly occupied by bushy and tall 2 3 m avicennia marina trees the fringe mangrove with a lower elevation and gentle slope is composed of small and sparse seedlings 2 2 fieldwork and measurement in the study site a typical intertidal transect with a distinct undulated topography and mangrove plants was chosen along the transect we set up 5 monitoring wells w1 5 which consisted of pvc tubes with pressure sensors ltc diver solinst and buried at a depth of 0 3 m below the sediment surface fig 1c w1 3 were in the fringe mangrove zone and w4 5 were in the interior mangrove zone it should be noted that a large slope break occurs between w4 and w3 we added an additional monitoring well w0 without pressure sensor in a bare mudflat for the contrastive groundwater sampling all sensors monitored the groundwater level electrical conductivity and temperature at an hourly frequency from november 8 2019 to march 1 2020 groundwater and seawater samples were collected during four seasonal sampling campaigns in autumn and winter in 2019 and summer and autumn in 2020 considering the limited activities caused by the covid 19 we did not conduct sampling in spring 2020 causing a discontinuity in time the groundwater was easily extracted at different depths 0 5 1 2 and 2 0 m when a stainless steel sampler pushpointtm groundwater sampler was used www mheproducts com nearby each well w0 5 at low tides fig s1 meanwhile two nearshore seawater samples were collected for comparison at each sampling campaign the vertical hydraulic conductivity kv of w1 5 was determined by the multi diameter falling head method wang et al 2014 the surface elevations and relative distances of the above wells were measured at a low tide by an rtk real time kinematic altimeter hi target china based on the beidou navigation satellite system the in situ physicochemical parameters such as ph oxidation reduction potential orp and salinity of collected water samples were immediately measured by a calibrated multi parameter probe hanan instruments hi 9829 the accuracy of ph orp and salinity is 0 02 ph 1 0 mv orp and 0 01 psu respectively all water samples were filtered by 0 45 μm semi permeable glass fibre membranes with syringes then put into a brown polythene bottle and stored in the refrigerator 4 c until laboratory measurements the concentrations of fe pb cu cr zn ba as ni and cd were determined with the icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific usa hg was measured by atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9760 2 3 data treatment 2 3 1 surface water groundwater exchange the vertical exchange rate qn l t was calculated based on the generalized darcy s law by the following equation ma et al 2015 1 q n δ k v h surface h w δ l ε c w c s 2 where kv denotes the vertical hydraulic conductivity l t summarized in table s1 hsurface is equal to the transect surface elevation due to the seepage face development if the transect surface elevation esurface l is greater than tidal level

the j th well w1 5 were calculated by the following equations ma et al 2015 2 q out 1 t e t 0 t 0 t e max t 0 q n t d t 3 q in 1 t e t 0 t 0 t e max t 0 q n t d t where t0 and te are the initial and end times for the calculated period which are 0 and 360 h respectively based on the groundwater level monitored three groundwater dynamic parameters including the inundation duration id inundation height ih m and inundation frequency if d were quantified to explore the potential influence on spatial patterns of heavy metals in different sampling sites id was calculated as the ratio of the inundation time to the total observation time so that it was the percentage of time that surface water was over the wetland surface xiao et al 2017 ih was the average value of water depth above the sediment surface during high tides if is calculated as the average number of inundation events per day 2 3 2 pollution assessment of heavy metals considering the fact that the intertidal aquifer is a complex mixed zone of seawater and groundwater it is difficult to represent the water quality by using a single water type groundwater or seawater quality standard xiao et al 2019b therefore we used the single factor contamination index sfci which combined the water quality standards of groundwater and seawater to evaluate the pollution conditions of heavy metals in the intertidal mangrove groundwater qu et al 2020 xiao et al 2019b 4 sfc i i c i s i c i g i c i s i g i where ci denotes the concentration of the heavy metal of the i th groundwater sample si and gi are standard values for groundwater class ⅴ cfgs 2017 and seawater class ⅳ cfss 1997 table s2 respectively it should be noted that due to the lack of seawater quality standards the values of sfci of fe and ba are determined by ci gi pollution of the i th heavy metals occurs when sfci 1 2 3 3 estimation of heavy metal fluxes based on the results of groundwater surface water exchange rates of each well associated heavy

analyses in this study the hierarchical cluster analysis hca and pearson correlation analysis were combined to analyze the relationships among variables hca a data classification method groups similar objects into the same group rakotondrabe et al 2018 the smaller the distance the more similar or close the two objects chen et al 2007 hca includes q type i e studying the relationship between samples and r type i e studying the relationships among variables here hca was conducted according to ward s method with the euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity güler et al 2002 moya et al 2015 the one way analysis of variance anova with 95 confidence intervals was employed to determine differences between the four sampling campaigns and among surface middle and lower zones there are significant differences between samples when the significance p is 0 05 all the statistical computations and correlated results were performed by origin 2021 originlab northampton ma the topography and heavy metals or physicochemical parameters were presented in 2 d contour maps using the kriging tool in surfer 13 golden software 3 results 3 1 hydrologic dynamic characteristics during the monitoring period the total rainfall reached 1860 mm slightly less than the multi year average 2040 mm the rainfall mainly concentrated in june to september in 2019 accounting for 62 of the annual rainfall in general four sampling campaigns were carried out in dry autumn and winter in 2019 and wet summer and autumn in 2020 seasons fig s2 the groundwater level at each well fluctuated periodically with tides when the surface was flooding and the variation range decreased toward the inland fig 2 for example along the transect the average groundwater level at w1 3 1 25 m was obviously larger than that of w4 5 1 03 m in addition the average inundation duration 72 09 and height 0 59 m at w1 3 were also larger than those at w4 5 48 45 and 0 41 m whereas the inundation frequency was approximately equal in w1 2 and w4 5 fig 2f the highest inundation frequency 1 75 d at w3 may be caused by the steep slope break of surface elevation which leads to more recirculating seawater the outflow and inflow rates estimated by eq 1 in the autumn and winter of 2019 are shown in fig 3 there was a large inflow rate in the interior mangrove with the maximum at w4 followed by w5 but the outflow rate was nearly zero from w3 to w1 the outflow and inflow rates had an obviously increasing trend the maximum outflow rates occurred at w1 reaching 0 10 and 0 08 m d in autumn and winter 2019 respectively in general w4 5 acted as the recharge zone for seawater and w1 3 was the groundwater discharge zone forming a surface water groundwater circulation system compared with autumn 2019 the outflow rate of w1 3 had decreased by approximately 0 18 times from 0 05 to 0 04 m d on average but the inflow rate of w1 5 had increased by about 0 11 times from 0 28 to 0 31 m d on average in winter 2019 3 2 physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical parameters ph p 0 01 salinity p 0 01 orp p 0 05 of mangrove groundwater significantly varied with sampling seasons in addition the ph salinity and orp in the recharge and discharge zone were distinct and usually the minimum values appeared at the recharge zone and increased toward the sea along the transect fig 4 the differences between the surface middle and lower zones were not statistically significant p 0 05 the average ph in groundwater was always lower than that in seawater reaching the minimum in summer 2020 7 4 0 2 and maximum in autumn 2020 7 7 0 2 table s3 the average salinity in groundwater ranged from 24 5 in autumn 2019 to 27 3 in autumn 2020 and was close to that of seawater during all sampling campaigns indicating that the intertidal groundwater was strongly influenced by the periodic mixing of seawater nevertheless a high saline plume formed around w2 and extended down several meters 2 m depth the center of the plume remained stationary w2 whereas the extent and concentration varied obviously with the seasons fig 4b the maximum plume of width 60 m and salinity 30 ppt was observed in autumn 2020 the orp in the groundwater varied significantly with the seasons and generally a much more reduced environment was obtained in summer 2020 than in other seasons groundwater samples along the entire transect showed reduction potential in the winter 2019 and summer 2020 while in the autumn 2019 and 2020 the recharge zone manifested stronger reduction potential and slight oxidation potential existed in the seaward ones w0 3 fig 4c w4 seemed to be more reduced than all other sampling points and the minimum value 419 5 mv appeared here in summer 2020 3 3 heavy metals 3 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution the statistical analysis for heavy metal concentrations in mangrove groundwater and seawater were shown in table s3 the mean concentrations of heavy metals in the groundwater during the four seasonal campaigns expressed as microgram per liter were in the following descending order fe 151 37 ba 43 40 zn 32 59 cr 2 36 as 1 86 cu 1 85 ni 0 73 pb 0 58 hg 0 11 the concentration of fe was much higher than other heavy metals indicating a fe rich environment besides this order varied seasonally but the top three fe zn and ba were constant cd is not discussed in this paper because 85 of the samples were below the detection limit and the concentration in the detected samples was also suitable to the water quality standard table s2 the results obtained from the anova analysis indicated that the concentrations of heavy metals except fe in mangrove groundwater presented significant differences between four seasonal campaigns the significant level of cu cr zn and as were at p 0 05 and pb ba hg and ni were at p 0 01 the differences between each other showed that at least one season was significantly different with other seasons although the differences in the average concentrations of fe in the four sampling campaigns were not statistically significant the maximum concentration reached as high as 616 1 μg l during winter 2019 and as low as 42 7 μg l during autumn 2019 some heavy metals had consistent seasonal patterns which might indicate a constant source and or chemical reactions the average concentrations of fe pb and cu in both seawater and groundwater increased in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 and decreased in summer 2020 fig 5 a c however hg as and ni in groundwater decreased in winter 2019 and increased in summer 2020 fig 5g i the variation patterns of cr zn and ba in groundwater were unique fig 5d f especially zn continued to decrease from 68 6 to 16 38 μg l the spatial distributions of heavy metals showed a more complicated migration pattern most heavy metals displayed a high concentration plume at the landward zone e g at w5 in the autumn and winter of 2019 i e dry season while in summer and autumn of 2020 i e wet season the plume moved towards the seaward direction especially for cu cr and zn fig 6 in autumn and winter of 2019 the heavy metal concentrations tended to decrease closer to the sea boundary i e fe pb cu cr and zn but the concentrations of hg and as were lower in the landward direction only slightly enriched in the w4 surface zone in autumn 2019 fig 6g h in summer of 2020 the heavy metals except ba were in low concentration levels at w5 and the high concentrations occurred at w2 4 fig 6a e g i by autumn of 2020 the landward heavy metals decreased more and accumulated closer to the sea w0 1 such as cu cr zn ba and hg fig 6c g it was noteworthy that pb cu and cr became slightly enriched at w5 again fig 6b d indicating that the enrichment trend seemed to have a seasonal cycle throughout the transect the vertical variation in heavy metals in the groundwater during sampling campaigns seemed not to be as obvious as horizontal variability on the whole the heavy metals had no significant difference in the vertical directions among surface middle and lower zones p 0 05 during seasonal campaigns except as the concentration of which at the surface zone was obviously higher than that at the lower zone p 0 05 in autumn 2019 however some vertical deviations were observed notably patches of high or low heavy metal concentrations in the vertical distribution showed highly heterogeneity such as fe at w3 and hg at w2 in autumn 2019 and ba at w1 in autumn 2020 fig 6 3 3 2 pollution assessment of heavy metals as shown in fig 7 the spatial distribution of the calculated sfci indicated that none of the heavy metals exceeded the pollution threshold sfci 1 among them the first and second largest values of sfci appeared in hg which were 0 45 in autumn 2019 and 0 42 in summer 2020 respectively and they both occurred in the lower zone of w2 therefore there seemed no heavy metal contamination in mangrove groundwater but there existed a slight potential pollution risk of hg the concentrations of investigated heavy metals in the two seawater samples were less than class ⅴ in the seawater quality standards gb t 14848 2017 indicating that the heavy metal pollution did not occur in the seawater as well 3 3 3 heavy metal fluxes according to eqs 5 6 and 7 the heavy metal fluxes including effluxes fin influxes fout and net fluxes fne t in autumn and winter 2019 were shown in fig 8 in these two seasons the effluxes and influxes of fe zn and ba were 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than those of other heavy metals which were constant with their concentration order the horizontal variation of heavy metal fluxes matched well with the surface water groundwater exchange rates which were mainly infiltrated at w4 5 and discharged at w1 3 the net fluxes of heavy metals were negative except hg indicating the investigated transect mainly accepted the input of heavy metals from seawater from the autumn to winter 2019 the heavy metal fluxes varied widely due to the seasonal variations of heavy metal concentrations in groundwater seawater and groundwater surface water exchange rates the effluxes of fe cr zn ba hg and as decreased with the decreasing sgd rate but the pb cu and ni increased by 0 01 0 96 and 0 26 times although the inflow rates of seawater increased by 0 11 times fe pb zn and ni increased by 0 13 2 45 0 55 and 3 35 times and cu cr ba and as decreased by 0 40 0 09 0 26 and 0 38 times in addition the net fluxes of fe pb zn and ni increased by 0 17 2 89 0 66 and 3 72 times and the cu cr ba hg and as decreased by 0 45 0 06 0 22 0 69 and 0 25 times respectively 3 4 q type hca analysis as shown in fig 9 all the sampling points had clustered into two groups by q type hca in four sampling campaigns according to their similarities among variables ph orp salinity and nine varieties of heavy metals generally the seaward groundwater discharge zone at w0 3 was classified into one group cluster 1 while the seawater recharge zone at w4 5 belonged to the other group cluster 2 for example in winter 2019 cluster 2 only consisted of 4 s 4 m 5 s 5 m and 5 l according to their similar features fig 9b the hca results also exhibited that in autumn 2019 surface or lower zone which consisted of 0 s 1 s 2 s and 4 s was easier to be classified into one group at the distance of 6 fig 9a but the other seasons had no obvious similarity at depths these above differences by q type hca were consistent with the spatial distribution of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals figs 4 and 6 this proved again that there were obvious hydrologic and chemical zoning behaviors at the mangrove intertidal transect 4 discussion 4 1 correlation analyses and seasonal variability the r type hca classified the variables into three groups but the members of within group had seasonal variability fig 10 for example the ph orp and salinity were closely related to each other according to r type hca and pearson correlation analysis especially in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 were grouped together as shown in fig 4 the seaward groundwater was characterized by high values of ph orp and salinity these may indicate that the mangrove groundwater was intensely influenced by the seawater mixing the relationship between heavy metals was closest in summer 2020 as all heavy metals except ni were grouped fig 10c while in the other seasons the nine heavy metals were generally grouped into three groups fig 10a b d variations in within group members may indicate that the factors influencing physicochemical parameters and heavy metals in the groundwater exhibited seasonal variability the relationships between different heavy metals were both complicated and seasonally variable the mangrove groundwater in this study was rich in fe mean concentration 151 4 μg l an essential redox reactive element kristensen et al 2017 telfeyan et al 2017 fe and zn were always classified into the same group and there was a high correlation between them in the winter 2019 p 0 01 and summer 2020 p 0 05 fig 9 furthermore fe showed different degrees of positive correlation with pb p 0 01 cr p 0 05 ba p 0 05 winter 2019 cu p 0 01 summer 2020 and ni p 0 05 autumn 2020 fig 9 indicating that the redox cycling of fe species exerted important biogeochemical effects on other heavy metals for example both fe hydr oxides and fe sulfide minerals can sequester heavy metals by effective adsorption and co precipitation and release heavy metals when redox conditions changed bone et al 2006 bower et al 2008 charette and sholkovitz 2006 han et al 2013 kalnejais et al 2015 pan et al 2021 richard et al 2016 rinklebe and shaheen 2017 in addition fe species in oxidized or reduced environments can directly chemically react with some heavy metals for example fe iii is a strong oxidant which can act as an electron acceptor to oxidize some reductive heavy metals in oxic aquatic environments hg 0 can be relatively quickly oxidized to high water soluble hg ⅱ by various reagents including fe hydr oxides and fe phosphates stein et al 1996 zhu et al 2018 therefore most heavy metals in the groundwater e g pb cu cr zn and ba showed increased trends when fe concentrations increased whereas hg and as with low concentrations seemed to be removed by fe biogeochemical cycles fig 6 moreover ba had a strong positive correlation with fe p 0 05 cr p 0 05 zn p 0 05 pb p 0 01 and ni p 0 01 in the winter 2019 and in a group or was closer to other heavy metals according to r type hca fig 10 ba a natural geochemical indicator is a geochemical analogue of radium which can be released from suspended matter during saltwater and freshwater mixing gonneea et al 2013 peterson et al 2008 in the intertidal aquifer ba concentrations in groundwater can peak over a wide range of salinity 2 20 and decrease when the salinity exceeds this range santos et al 2011 in this study the maximum salinity at w2 along the transect which was 27 3 26 8 28 2 and 30 3 for autumn winter 2019 and summer autumn 2020 respectively likely leading to the lowest concentration of ba fig 4b and 6f 4 2 factors driving heavy metal migration the results in this study showed the obvious differences in the concentration and distribution of heavy metals between the recharge zone w4 5 and discharge zone w0 3 in different seasons years the heavy metal migration in the groundwater of intertidal mangroves were affected by surface water groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activity these factors varied with the seasons resulting in complex migration patterns of heavy metals the hydrological conditions play an important role in driving the heavy metal migrations and changing the redox conditions beck et al 2017 liu et al 2019 two visible seasonal enrichment areas of heavy metals appeared at w5 in the recharge zone autumn and winter 2019 and at w0 1 in the discharge zone autumn 2020 respectively fig 6 the encounter of oxic seawater and hypoxic groundwater would change the heavy metal phases and form biogeochemical reaction hotspots in addition non conservative addition or removal may occur during the mixing process of seawater and groundwater mori et al 2019 beck et al 2017 though the correlation between heavy metals and salinity was not apparent we observed that the groundwater with the same salinity with seawater showed a clear difference in concentrations of heavy metal for example in the summer 2020 the concentration of fe in seawater was about 61 1 μg l while for the same salinity 25 26 the concentrations in the groundwater ranged widely from 63 8 to 354 3 μg l however the dynamic hydrology parameters of the groundwater seemed to have little effect on the heavy metals in this frequently inundated intertidal transect the inundation duration and depth in the recharge zone were relatively low but with lower orp and higher heavy metal influxes than the discharge zone which was unexpected because the large inundation duration and depth generally result in a more reducing environment and promote seawater infiltration kristensen et al 2017 moreover the seawater infiltration was an important reason for the seasonal variation of heavy metals in the groundwater due to the high salinity of the transect groundwater 26 2 2 5 on average during the four seasonal sampling campaigns the impact of inland fresh groundwater discharge on heavy metals was expected to be low the concentrations of heavy metals in seawater and transect groundwater showed a consistently seasonal variation trend but their magnitude relation had obvious seasonal changes except that the concentrations of ba and hg were always higher than those in seawater during four sampling campaigns fig 5 in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 all heavy metal concentrations except fe and cu in winter in groundwater were lower than those in seawater indicating that the intertidal aquifer can effectively sequester and buffer the discharge of heavy metals to the sea charette and sholkovitz 2006 mcallister et al 2015 in summer 2020 heavy metals in the groundwater were higher than those in the seawater which became a source of heavy metals discharging into the ocean o connor et al 2018 showed that fe may be remobilized seasonally within the intertidal aquifer and serve as a periodic source of dissolved fe therefore the intertidal aquifer may act as a seasonal source or sink to discharge or sequester heavy metals vegetation zonation directly affected the surface water groundwater exchange rates and biogeochemical reactions in the interior mangrove many macropores e g crab burrows and decayed roots increased the sediment permeability and provided the preferential conduit which led to larger heavy metal influxes than fringe mangrove and bare mudflat mangrove sediments were characterized by high organic matters bastakoti et al 2018 pan et al 2019 which usually reached the maximum concentrations during high productivity summer o connor et al 2018 sanders et al 2015 santos et al 2009 further the remineralization of organic matters would consume the fe oxides oxygen and other electron acceptors and heavy metals formed relatively stable complexes with organic ligands to promote the solubility of heavy metals e g fe pb cu cr zn hg as ni etc beck et al 2008 costa et al 2020 richard et al 2016 rinklebe and shaheen 2017 this might be one of the reasons for the accumulation of heavy metals in the interior mangrove in the autumn and winter of 2019 by the summer and autumn of 2020 the remineralization of organic matters and the rainfall enhanced fresh groundwater discharge may lead to a stronger reducing environment 277 4 mv and 128 6 mv in interior mangroves than in the autumn and winter of 2019 54 9 mv and 42 4 mv these would cause heavy metal oxides to dissolve as a local source transported from the recharge zone to the discharge zone ultimately precipitating with iron sulfides in the sediments during the transport process in addition the anthropogenic activities may be another reason responsible for the seasonal difference of heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater from the beginning of 2020 the outbreak of covid 19 caused attenuated anthropogenic activities and thus limited industrial and agricultural production throughout china recent studies have indicated that covid 19 significantly improved china s air and river water quality in the short term wang and su 2020 liu et al 2022 as a protected mangrove ecosystem hli had been rarely directly impacted by industrial pollution however there existed many seafood restaurant and fish ponds in the vicinity of the mangrove wetland which can affect groundwater quality particularly in the wet seasons previous studies have verified their crucial roles in regulating the distribution and mobility of heavy metals in the groundwater of mangrove wetlands feng et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 in this study the concentrations of fe pb cu and cr in the groundwater decreased significantly in summer 2020 fig 5 whereas after a certain period of industrial and agricultural recovery e g in autumn 2020 the heavy metal concentrations returned to or even exceeded pre covid 19 values therefore the covid 19 induced attenuation of anthropogenic activities may relieve the terrestrial input of heavy metals in coastal regions to a large extent 4 3 comparison and uncertainty although there was no heavy metal pollution both in groundwater and seawater through the pollution assessment fig 7 some heavy metals were still at high concentration levels in this study for example the concentrations of fe cu cr zn as and hg were generally greater than those in other studies of mangrove groundwater table 1 in addition to anthropogenic activities such as the adjacent aquaculture which may transport metals into groundwater it should be noted that the study area may be affected by pollutants from the pearl river and moyang river basins due to the influence of seasonal monsoon winds ge et al 2018 liu et al 2010 in the moyang river estuary about 16 km away from hli mangrove wetland the concentrations of fe cu cr zn and hg in the groundwater were at the same magnitude but the pb was about 10 50 fold higher than hli deng et al 2018 moreover the concentrations of fe cu cr zn and hg even exceeded those in the pearl river estuary in comparison with three recent studies fang and wang 2022 luo et al 2021 niu et al 2021 therefore there may be a high ecological risk of fe cu cr zn as and hg in hli mangrove wetland the heavy metal fluxes carried by sgd in this study were within the range of other studies worldwide that were seriously impacted by human activities table 2 in particular the sgd associated cu cr as and ni fluxes were in the same order of magnitude compared with the greater bay area china but the fluxes of pb and zn were an order of magnitude higher luo et al 2021 further the sgd associated hg flux was 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of waquoit bay usa bone et al 2007 the heavy metals were mainly infiltrated at w4 5 and discharged from w1 3 but the influxes of heavy metals were usually greater than effluxes during autumn and winter of 2019 fnet 0 the imbalance caused by surface water groundwater interactions was mainly related to the calculated length of the transect mangrove groundwater discharge still occurred beyond w1 toward the sea but the calculated length focused the zone between w1 and w5 according to the locations of the monitoring wells in addition the uncertainties were also caused by measurement errors including groundwater level 0 1 electrical conductivity 2 and vertical hydraulic conductivities by in situ falling head method 10 surface elevations and heavy metal concentrations were proven not to cause great errors ma et al 2015 qu et al 2017 5 conclusion the present study investigated the spatiotemporal patterns and fluxes of groundwater derived heavy metals in the intertidal aquifer in a subtropical mangrove wetland in china the spatial distribution and migration mechanism of heavy metals in this paper were explained by multiple factors including seawater groundwater interactions vegetation zonation biogeochemical reactions and anthropogenic activities the average concentrations of heavy metals displayed significant seasonal differences except fe through the anova analysis and were mainly controlled by seawater infiltration the heavy metals were mainly accumulated in the landward recharge zone in dry seasons autumn and winter 2019 with the concentrations showing a decreasing trend toward the sea however the enrichment trend of heavy metals reversed in wet seasons summer and autumn 2020 which were mainly modulated by the more reduced environment enhanced fresh groundwater discharge and attenuated anthropogenic activities mangrove groundwater generally acted as the source of heavy metals discharged into the sea in summer 2020 but changed as a sink in winter 2019 and autumn 2020 due to the seasonal variabilities in redox influenced biogeochemical reactions and covid 19 associated reduction in anthropogenic activities the concentrations of fe cu cr zn hg and as in hli mangrove groundwater were usually high and existed a potential hg pollution risk indicated by sfci in addition the higher zn and hg fluxes derived by groundwater discharge may have harmful effects on the health of mangrove ecosystems and coastal marine environments seasonal scale dynamics of heavy metals in the groundwater of mangroves in the intertidal zone has received only minor attention and this study could provide basic information for the effective management of mangrove protection and ecological restoration in the future credit authorship contribution statement zhenyang li conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing original draft feng pan methodology writing review editing kai

3008,playa lakes have been promoted as potential point sources of recharge to the high plains aquifer but information about recharge rates is only available for the southern high plains where soils and substrate differ significantly from the central high plains the goal of this study is to determine the degree to which functioning playas contribute to recharge of the aquifer in the central high plains this is accomplished through a multifaceted study across a single 34 43 day long playa hydroperiod combining physical and geochemical evidence to measure fluid flux through the playa and geochemical evidence of fluid flux through the nearby interplaya the hydroperiod resulted in increased matric potential and decreases in chloride and other anion concentrations in the vadose zone beneath the playa and increases in groundwater levels downgradient likely indicating recharge to the aquifer over the course of the short event anion concentrations are significantly higher in the interplaya compared with the playa while fluid flux estimates are significantly higher beneath the playa the fluid fluxes determined in this study are consistent with estimates from elsewhere in the high plains region the combination of physical and geochemical data decreased the uncertainty and improved the overall conclusion that recharge rates are higher beneath the playa than the interplaya providing evidence that playas in the central high plains function similarly to those in the southern high plains keywords chloride mass balance chlorine 36 high plains aquifer matric potential recharge vadose zone data availability i have shared the data used in this paper in the supplementary file 1 introduction playas are mostly small internally drained closed basin ephemeral lakes with varying periods of inundation or hydroperiod and are the most significant surface water feature on much of the high plains numbering over 75 000 across the landscape bartuszevige 2018 irrigation withdrawals from the underlying high plains aquifer hpa account for 23 of the total groundwater use in the united states and have resulted in an over 60 reduction in the saturated thickness from pre irrigation development 1950 to 2014 2016 and water level declines exceeding 50 m in some areas maupin and barber 2005 mcguire 2017 under current pumping rates and average climatic conditions water level declines will continue likely compromising future use of the aquifer butler et al 2013 whittemore et al 2016 improved estimates of water availability and management of the hpa requires improved identification of recharge pathways and quantification of recharge rates recharge to the hpa is spatially variable due to precipitation and recharge generally increasing from the south to north and west to east and evapotranspiration generally greatest in the south crosbie et al 2013 previously published recharge estimates for kansas 5 to 54 mm yr indicate a travel time of 270 to over 1000 years for infiltrated water to travel through the 15 to 100 m thick vadose zone to the aquifer gurdak et al 2007 katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 stanton et al 2011 notwithstanding the presence of agricultural contaminants in the aquifer indicates recharge of modern water since the 1950s in some locations which is indicative of a 100 year travel time to the water table mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 the faster paths to the aquifer are likely through focused recharge and preferential flow paths including areas with ponded surface water such as ephemeral streambeds ditches shallow depressions irrigated cropland and playas fryar et al 2001 gurdak et al 2007 gurdak et al 2008 meixner et al 2016 nativ 1992 several studies of recharge through the dense system of southern high plains shp playas see playa distribution map in fig 1 concluded that recharge rates through playas 60 to 120 mm yr are higher than diffuse recharge through the surrounding landscape 0 2 to 32 mm yr gurdak et al 2007 gurdak and roe 2009 gurdak and roe 2010 meixner et al 2016 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood et al 1997 recharge rates within an individual playa are variable through time controlled by rain flux infiltration rate saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and macropore fluid flux which varies with the formation of desiccation cracks between hydroperiods and may only occur once every few years gurdak and roe 2009 gurdak and roe 2010 although playas are abundant in kansas 22 000 fig 1 the possibility for recharge through central high plains chp playas to the hpa has not been investigated bowen 2011 this is addressed herein by determining water fluxes in the chp through both a playa and interplaya identifying periods of downward fluid flux during playa inundation and quantifying travel times to the hpa 2 study site the study focuses on ehmke playa 38 4429 100 6031 located on the chp in lane county kansas fig 1 this location was selected for study because 1 the water table is relatively shallow 15 m below ground surface 2 the land surface has not been affected significantly by anthropogenic modification with rangeland surrounding the playa and less than half of the watershed cultivated agriculture without irrigation limiting agricultural influences to the playa or run on water 3 its eastward longitude within the cluster of playas in western kansas fig 1c has a relatively higher average annual precipitation increasing the probability of precipitation events sufficient to produce runoff into the playa during the period of investigation 4 the playa has accumulated little to no anthropogenically accelerated sediment so hydric soils form the surface of the playa floor and 5 because the current landowner s ancestors originally settled the land thereby providing knowledge of its use dating from the middle 1800s the ehmke playa frequently contains ponded water though these hydroperiods occur at irregular intervals due to variations in climate playa soils are mapped as the ness series fine smectitic mesic ustic epiaquerts soil survey staff 2021 with well developed hydric soil indicators in the core or center part of the playa sink and fewer indicators surrounding the core the most extensive development of desiccation cracks macropores occurs in the core area of the playa though they have been observed throughout the playa the hpa underlies the study site and consists of unconsolidated alluvial gravel sand silt and clay deposited to the east of the rocky mountains during the miocene and pliocene epoch gutentag et al 1984 ludvigson et al 2009 the ehmka playa has its primary inflow on the southwest end fig 1a the playa watershed kastens et al 2016 covers approximately 438 ha consisting of an average of 57 non irrigated cropland and 39 grass pasture wetland water during 2011 2020 according to the usda cropland data layer usda 2022 the playa has been mapped using 2 m lidar digital terrain model aerial imagery and through soil survey differences between these delineations are described in the supplementary information and displayed in fig 1a these different delineations indicate the playa surface is between 38 9 and 70 5 ha with a depth between 0 23 m and 1 54 m for a capacity between 8 140 m3 and 254 000 m3 see supplementary table 1 for a comparison of these values between the different mapping methods as discussed in the supplementary information this large range largely depends on whether features such as the delta are included and how much of the annulus sidewall is included 3 methods surface and subsurface sensors were installed in the center of the playa in june 2016 fig 1a primary above ground sensors include an automated tipping bucket rain gauge campbell cc5mpx camera and sr50a automated sonic ranging sensor water level recorder and ground target additional sensors monitor wind temperature barometric pressure and net radiation dielectric water potential sensors mps 6 decagon devices inc were used to help determine moisture flux and were emplaced at depths of 0 12 m sensor 1 0 47 m sensor 2 0 96 m sensor 3 and 1 52 m sensor 4 in a pit excavated adjacent to the power and electronics stand see supplementary fig 1 the shallowest three sensors were located in the dark colored hydric soil with sensor 3 located just above an abrupt change in soil color sensor 4 was placed below the color change in grey brown soil additional detail on sensor accuracy and limitations can be found in the supplementary information three monitoring wells were installed at the study site in june 2016 fig 1a see supplementary tables 2 and 3 for construction and location details well 1 is located in the playa center within the fenced instrumentation area well 2 is adjacent to the road in the southeastern corner of the section on the southeast side of the playa basin and at the toe of the lunette well 3 is in the southwestern corner of the section and adjacent to the southwestern corner of the playa near the inflow surface elevations were extracted from 2 m lidar digital terrain model dtm data each well was instrumented with a solinst levellogger edge pressure transducer allowing for half hourly water level measurements with a solinst barologger also placed in well 1 a total of seven soil cores were obtained from the study site with four used in the present study to determine pore water chemistry fig 1a see supplementary table 3 for locations these include epc 1 and 2 in the playa center completed with a giddings soil coring machine in june 2016 to depths of 5 4 m and 5 3 m carbonate lentils caliche impeded coring with the giddings preventing the collection of a core through the entire vadose zone in august 2017 additional soil cores were collected using an acker hollow stem auger including epc 5 in the playa center completed to a depth of 11 7 m and epc 7 in the north interplaya completed to depth of 16 8 m fig 1a this second set of borings reached the water table in both locations completely sampling the vadose zone pore water chemistry was analyzed every 1 m in epc 5 and 7 and every 0 5 m in epc 1 and 2 pore water samples and gravimetric water contents were obtained using the same methods described by katz et al 2016 and described in detail in the supplementary information after pore water extraction and filtration sample chemistry was determined a 5 ml aliquot of each pore water sample was analyzed on the ion chromatograph ic for fluoride chloride bromide nitrate and sulfate instrument quantification limit calculations are described in the supplementary information results were output from the ic in mg l 1 but converted to mg kg 1 of dry soil using the following equation 1 a n i o n e x t r a c t e d w a t e r m g l θ g p a s t e g g 1 ρ w a t e r m l g 1 l 1000 m l 1000 g 1 k g a n i o n s o i l m g k g where θgpaste is the gravimetric water content of the saturated paste described above and the density of water ρwater is assumed 1 g ml 1 the mg kg 1 concentration was then converted to mg l 1 of pore water eq 1 2 a n i o n s o i l m g k g 1 θ g f i e l d g g 1 k g 1000 g ρ w a t e r g m l 1000 m l 1 l a n i o n p o r e w a t e r m g l using the same leach and extraction procedure an additional six samples located directly adjacent to samples selected for anion analysis were prepared for 36cl analysis after extraction the samples were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes where 80 mg of agno3 crystals and 5 ml of hno3 were added to precipitate agcl the samples were kept in the dark during precipitation centrifuged and the supernatant poured off after drying at 60 c overnight in the dark tubes were capped wrapped in aluminum foil and then sent to australian national university for further purification to remove sulfur followed by accelerator mass spectrometry analysis using the 14ud pelletron accelerator fifield et al 2010 fifield et al 2013 a decagon devices dualhead infiltrometer was used to measure the ksat of the surface soil at four locations fig 1a two measurements were collected at the playa center inf 1 and 2 near epc 1 and two measurements were collected at the interplaya inf 3 and 4 near epc 7 see supplementary table 3 for locations ksat is calculated by averaging the results from three pressure cycles additional information on instrument settings are provided in the supplementary information 3 1 fluid flux calculations fluid flux is calculated using several different methods with different assumptions which provide information about fluid flux at different temporal scales to better constrain fluid flux rates 3 1 1 back of the envelope infiltration an estimate of infiltration velocity during saturated conditions can be made using a darcy calculation darcy flux estimates combines the ksat estimates obtained from the dual head infiltrometer with the vertical hydraulic gradient and porosity in the vadose zone hydraulic conductivity and gradient are highly variable but in this simplified calculation the vertical hydraulic gradient during ponding is the maximum height of ponded water above the land surface relative to a recently wetted subsurface 3 1 2 wetting front advance monitoring the wetting front advance can provide estimates of fluid flux e g allison et al 1994 jolly et al 1989 scanlon et al 2008 warrick et al 1971 a wetting front that moves down a profile is a function of water stored in a profile that is dislodged in advance of the infiltrating water resulting in a pressure front jolly et al 1989 as this rate is generally faster than expected for the newly infiltrating water the ratio between the rate of movement of the pressure and infiltration fronts can be determined by comparing the water contents before and after the wetting events jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 to estimate the rate of advance for infiltrating water from the movement of the wetting front the time at which matric potential sensors were initially wet to field capacity is compared and multiplied by the ratio of the change in water content from prior to the hydroperiod and during the hydroperiod jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 here the average gravimetric water content from the upper two meters of pre and post hydroperiod core are used to determine the ratio this method assumes piston flow and does not account for preferential pathways jolly et al 1989 not all wetting front advances produce recharge and water flux without changes to vadose zone water content can occur sophocleous 1991 3 1 3 chloride peak displacement fluid flux was also estimated based on chloride peak displacement in the playa center where chloride vadose zone profiles were collected in consecutive years following the method of stonestrom et al 2003 3 1 4 chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance cmb method is widely used to approximate recharge rates in non marine strata by comparing the concentration of chloride in the vadose zone system with the concentration of chloride input to the surface e g allison and hughes 1978 allison et al 1994 allison and hughes 1983 phillips 1994 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 scanlon et al 2007 stonestrom et al 2007 walvoord and phillips 2004 wood and sanford 1995 this method is preferred over water balance calculations when measuring fluid recharge flux to aquifers in semiarid regions where large evapotranspiration rates and inter annual variations in precipitation result in a large error when calculating the typically small 100 mm yr recharge rates scanlon 1991 the inputs for the cmb used here are similar to those applied at a study site approximately 90 km to the n nw and described in katz et al 2016 with the following modifications described below the average 1952 2017 annual precipitation 505 mm was obtained from a national weather service monitoring station in scott city kansas located approximately 26 8 km west of the ehmke playa high plains regional climate center 2018 wet chloride deposition is monitored approximately 37 3 km northwest of the study site in scott county ks with a mean annual 1984 2017 deposition of 0 08 g m3 nadp 2021 as discussed by katz et al 2016 this volumetric value is within the error of the average wet chloride deposition value from three chp and shp monitoring sites with similar precipitation rates mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 thus although dry deposition is currently unknown for kansas as with the previous studies katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 an average annual wet and dry chloride deposition value of 0 3 g m2 is used for the current study it should be noted the average annual wet chloride deposition is slightly lower and the average annual precipitation is slightly higher than the reference site in texas 530 km to the south to avoid underestimating the total amount of chloride deposition in the playa basin the cmb calculations beneath the playa are adjusted following wood and sanford 1995 and scanlon and goldsmith 1997 to account for the additional chloride mass contributed from run on water in the adjusted equation 3 q cl p cl p r a b cl r a f qcl is the chloride deposition flux to the land surface m l2 p is precipitation l clp is the chloride concentration in precipitation wet and dry m l3 0 6 g m3 which is determined by dividing the average annual wet and dry chloride deposition 0 3 g m2 by the average annual depth of liquid precipitation 0 5 m r is runoff l a b is the area of the watershed 14 km2 a f is the area of the playa 0 51 km2 and cl r is the concentration of chloride in the run off water m l3 cl r is assumed the same as cl p at this site or 0 6 g m3 because there are not sufficient quantities of chloride sources in surficial sediments to alter the concentration in run off water if there are additional sources of chloride and clr is greater than clp the recharge rate would be underestimated it is not likely that clr would be less than clp given the conservative nature of chloride eq 3 can be divided by the cluz or the chloride mass in the unsaturated zone to determine the chloride flux beyond the root zone values for runoff r to the studied playa are not available but in shp playas r values of between 5 and 10 of annual precipitation p have been reported scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood and sanford 1995 given the soil texture and watershed characteristics a runoff value of 10 is likely reasonable for this study area however the chp experiences substantial inter annual variations in precipitation 370 to 845 mm and higher values for r may be more representative of wetter years to constrain realistic possibilities fluid flux through the playa was estimated equation 3 with values for r of 5 25 3 mm yr 10 50 1 mm yr and 20 101 mm yr of p chloride travel time in the vadose zone is calculated in the cmb by averaging the volumetric mass of chloride cluz in a depth interval and dividing by the chloride deposition for instance qcl in eq 3 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 4 t t 0 z θ vfield c l uz d z q cl 3 2 hydrus 1d simulations the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2018 is used to simulate vadose zone fluid flux beneath the playa resulting from a single hydroperiod the purpose of this is to understand the effects of different initial wetting conditions on the subsurface system and understand whether it is possible for a wetting front to reach the water table during a single hydroperiod like the one observed during the study the upper boundary condition is derived from the precipitation measured at the site from december 2016 through june 2017 i e the atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer option was selected with no precipitation for the remainder of the simulation which extended for 45 years the maximum ponding depth allowed is set at 0 5 m the maximum observed at the site during the study time steps were allowed to vary between 1 10 5 and 20 days 2 74 10 8 to 0 0548 yr with an initial step of 0 0001 days 2 7 10 7 yr since playas are closed basins runoff outflow is not considered water content tolerance and pressure head tolerance were set to 0 01 and 10 mm respectively the lower boundary condition is free draining the soil grid is simplified from a combination of the epc 4 and 5 cores and consists of four soil textures silt silt loam sandy loam and loam in 14 discrete zones see supplementary table 5 soil hydraulic parameters for these soil textures are selected from the default values pre programmed with hydrus 1d see supplementary table 6 a van genuchten mualem single porosity model van genuchten 1980 is used without hysteresis the initial mp is set to values of 60 000 10 000 and 3 300 mm for three different simulations to understand the effects of ponding during extremely dry dry and moist antecedent soil moisture conditions to understand the effects of the initial wetting conditions on downward fluid movement the progress of the wetting front in the hydrus 1d simulations is observed at several nodes the arrival of the wetting front is determined two ways 1 using the time of the initial increase in mp and 2 the timing of peak mp the times between the arrival of the wetting front at the different observation nodes are then compared relative to their distances 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical characteristics of the hydroperiod 4 1 1 precipitation and hydroperiod playa inundation hydroperiod precipitation and mp data from four soil depths are available for a total of 354 days between december 2016 june 2017 and december 2018 june 2019 but are not available between june 2017 and november 2018 due to a programming and download error fig 2 despite the missing data spring and early summer is when a playa hydroperiod is most likely and when the one hydroperiod of the study is observed from april to may of 2017 the one hydroperiod observed during the study fig 2 began following the intense and large precipitation event on 12 april 2017 with the playa remaining wet through late may 2017 43 days prior to this the playa had not been inundated to the annulus or rim of the basin for 2 or 3 years vance and louise ehmke personal communication the first indication of ponding 20 mm depth is recorded by the depth sensor at 6 40 pm on 12 april by 13 april water reaches a peak depth of 200 mm at the weather station water levels in the playa slowly decline until two pulses of higher water levels following precipitation events between 27 april and 2 may 46 2 mm precipitation and 10 11 may 25 1 mm precipitation ponded water depths decline to 50 mm by 27 april but increase following the rain event to at least 340 mm on 4 may some spurious water depth measurements on 3 and 4 may are not considered and it is possible the peak depth was not recorded the cause of the sensor malfunction is not clear wind speeds are roughly average 400 mm s during this period and as the malfunction is observed in both day and night measurements is likely not a result of glare water levels decline to 90 mm on 10 may rising again to 140 mm on 12 may likely the result of the precipitation event on 10 11 may surface water levels then decline until 25 may when ponded water is no longer observed with the depth sensor indicating a 43 day hydroperiod this roughly corresponds with visual inspection of digital pictures from the weather station camera which indicate inundation of the playa from 13 april through 16 may 2017 or a 34 day hydroperiod this minimum estimate is affected by limitations of the camera angle as the camera points towards the east and not downward the growth of grasses and wetland plants limit the detail obtained from the camera as water levels recede compared with the depth sensor which targets a fixed metal plate the rate of decline in playa ponded water depth is consistently linear and relatively similar for all three periods after each peak surface water depth water depths decline at a rate of 13 2 mm d 4 820 mm yr r 0 992 p 0 0001 after the first peak on 12 april and 13 1 mm d 4 780 mm yr r 0 989 p 0 0001 after the peak on 4 may the decline after the final peak on 12 may is considered in two parts the first from 12 to 19 may and a second from 20 to 27 may because a small rain event on 19 may resulted in a slight pause in the water depth decline over the former period water depths decline at a rate of 13 6 mm d 4 960 mm yr r 0 993 p 0 0001 and 11 8 mm d 4 310 mm yr r 0 91 p 0 0001 over the latter the depth sensor did not record any ponding events during the 2018 2019 measurement period positive measurements between january and march 2019 record snow pack depth rather than ponding in the playa the playa is located in a very windy generally featureless and treeless environment with blowing and drifting of snow a common occurrence when snow is present as a result the snow depths recorded at the weather station may or may not be representative of total snow depths in the surrounding playa the depth sensor spike on 26 may 2019 occurs over a brief 20 minute period during which 20 mm of rain fell fig 2 as the apparent depth immediately drops back to background levels following the rain event the spike is likely a result of reflections from the rain affecting the sensor rather than an actual measurement of ponding in the playa the amount and intensity of precipitation events is used to distinguish threshold conditions that lead to playa ponding during the study across the two winter summer transitions rain fell on 60 days averaging 8 2 mm d the playa ponded only once following the heaviest 79 3 mm total and most intense single day rainfall event on 12 april 2017 both the peak 106 7 mm hr over a 10 minute period fig 3 and overall average 34 0 mm hr over the 140 minute event intensity of this precipitation event was higher than any other event the single day event with the next highest total 34 8 mm 28 march 2017 which occurs on the first day of a 2 day event with total precipitation of 53 8 mm does not result in ponding in the playa the intensity of this event was much less peaking at 10 7 mm hr over a 10 minute period and averaging 3 3 mm hr over the event over a longer period of nine days 18 26 may 2019 inclusive of two single days free of precipitation a total of 91 4 mm of precipitation is recorded the highest amount for any wet period the average overall precipitation rate 4 6 mm hr during intervals with measured precipitation is considerably less than the average during the event resulting in ponding of the playa the second highest peak precipitation rate measured 83 3 mm hr over a 10 minute period is observed at the end of this wet period 26 may 2019 on this day a total of 22 4 mm of precipitation fell over 90 min at an average intensity of 13 4 mm hr this also did not result in ponding of the playa from this limited dataset it appears that intense precipitation events are more likely to result in ponding in the playa than lower intensity multi day precipitation events however the effects of the growing season cannot be neglected as the relatively intense storm event at the end of the multi day wet period in 2019 an event that did not result in ponding occurs when the growing season was further along mid late may regardless it is suggested that more than 54 mm of precipitation but not more than 79 3 mm of precipitation in a 36 hour period is needed for ponding the average intensity of the precipitation event should be somewhere above 13 4 mm hr but does not need to exceed 34 0 mm hr as monitoring continues it is hoped this data could be applied across the thousands of unmonitored playas to improve recharge estimates further as precipitation patterns change this information will provide a means to better predict the effects of changing precipitation patterns on recharge 4 1 2 soil moisture matric potential is very negative 6000 kpa throughout all installed depths 120 470 960 and 1520 mm until the end of march 2017 possibly indicative of sensors that are still air dry and not in equilibrium with the surrounding matrix due to insufficient initial contact with the soil as a result sensor readings are not considered to provide a quantitative measure of actual mp until field capacity fc is first recorded several pressure pulses qualitatively indicate increases in soil moisture and fluid flow between february and april but the mp associated with these events are extremely low eventually all sensors record a rapid increase in pressure from 6000 kpa to 33 kpa over less than ten hours at each individual sensor with the change observed in the shallowest sensor thirteen days prior to the deeper sensors fig 2 supplementary fig 2 rain events totaling 56 9 mm between 23 march at 8 00 pm and 29 march at 11 30 am including 43 7 mm on 28 29 march preceded an increase in mp to above fc in sensor 1 on 29 march after initially peaking at 11 kpa on 30 march mp remains between 12 and 11 kpa through 9 april then declines until the large precipitation event on 12 april reaching a minimum of 14 kpa on the afternoon of 11 april fc is not observed in sensors 2 4 until after the large precipitation event on april 12 fig 3 the subsurface effects of the large precipitation event on 12 april 2017 and subsequent playa hydroperiod are eventually observed at all four sensors as the wetting front moves downwards fig 3 at sensor 1 mp increases from 14 to 11 kpa over 80 min starting at 8 50 pm just 40 min after the end of the rain event this is followed by a slower increase in mp to 10 kpa by 16 april at 4 20 pm where it remains until 30 may mp at sensor 2 quickly reaches 11 kpa by 10 40 pm on 12 april but increases more slowly to 10 kpa by 14 april where it remains until 31 may mp does not increase to above fc in sensors 3 and 4 until 13 and 14 april respectively after reaching fc the mp increase is more gradual in both of these deeper sensors reaching 10 kpa on 14 april and 22 april for sensors 3 and 4 respectively the soil then starts to dry shortly after the playa hydroperiod ends fig 2 supplementary fig 2 matric potential begins a slight decreasing trend in sensor 4 on 23 may the rate at which mp declines at sensor 4 increases on 30 may the same day mp at sensors 1 and 3 also begin to decrease while mp starts decreasing in sensor 2 on 31 may these downward trends continue through the end of the first measurement period on june 12 matric potential decreases the most at sensor 1 decreasing to just below fc 34 kpa with higher pressures in sensors 2 3 and 4 15 13 and 14 kpa respectively the matric potential in 2019 remained above fc at deeper intervals with some drying observed at the shallowest interval 120 mm depth at times the rapid drying of the shallowest interval as snow melts suggests relatively little recharge contributions from snow however additional study of the rare snow accumulations is needed it is worth noting that during the multiple near consecutive days of precipitation in may 2019 the soil is above field capacity and the three deeper sensors while occasionally drying out at the shallowest interval to a minimum of 130 kpa at the time of the most intense precipitation during this wet period the soil is above field capacity at all sensors given the hydric soils at the site it is likely very few macropores are present by this time and the playa soils would be ready to pond yet the lack of ponding during this period provides further evidence that a more intense precipitation event is necessary to promote ponding 4 1 3 infiltration saturated hydraulic conductivity values obtained from the dual head infiltrometer for playa floor and interplaya are very similar table 1

table 1 this is representative of the fine textures and dominant silt components of the mapped soils at the site interplaya areas were mapped as a harney silt loam fine smectitic mesic typic argiustolls and a ulysses silt loam fine silty mixed superactive mesic torriorthentic haplustolls with silt loam and silty clay loam textures described down to 1520 and 2000 mm respectively soil survey staff 2021 the hydric ness clay which is mapped in the playa center was described as having silty clay and silty clay loam textures between 0 and 790 and 7 980 2 030 mm respectively soil survey staff 2021 4 1 4 groundwater response groundwater level measurements are available between july 2016 and august 2017 fig 2 supplementary fig 2 depths to water range from 11 48 to 11 58 m beneath the playa elevation 856 25 856 36 m amsl and 16 01 to 16 52 m elevation 855 47 857 71 m amsl beneath the interplaya all depths are reported as below ground surface unless otherwise stated groundwater

estimate the hydraulic gradient with the hydrogeoestimatorxl tool devlin and schillig 2017 groundwater at the ehmke playa site is flowing under a hydraulic gradient of 0 0016 towards north 66 east following the guidelines provided by devlin and mcelwee 2007 the hydraulic gradient error is likely 20 for the direction and 30 for the magnitude as the y x ratio is 0 25 384 m 1531 m and the area monitored is 293 990 m2 irregular but frequent variations on the order of 0 03 m are observed in the well 1 barometric pressure corrected pressure transducer record despite correcting for barometric pressure these variations are likely a reflection of strong influence of barometric pressure changes on the record adjusting for barometric efficiency to values between 0 50 and 0 75 during barometric pressure correction in the solinst levelogger software lessened but did not eliminate the fluctuations it is worth noting that variations are greatest during the ponded period increasing to as much as 0 05 m which suggests the response of the aquifer to barometric pressure change varies depending on the hydroperiod it is also possible that wind pushing on the portion of the piezometer sticking out of the ground 2 010 m results in vibrations to the mechanism and cable suspending the pressure transducer placing a larger diameter pipe e g 100 mm around the surface piezometer would dampen the effects of the wind a vented pressure transducer might be more appropriate in this location than the sealed pressure transducer and would allow further exploration of changes to barometric response and improved correction of water levels for the barometric pressure signal e g bohling et al 2011 butler et al 2011 over the course of the study a total variation in hydraulic head of 0 08 0 12 mm is observed in individual wells with an overall increasing trend observed in the period of record fig 2 supplementary table 7 the greatest increase is in well 2 which is down gradient from the playa in general the water levels in the up gradient and down gradient interplaya wells recorded similar changes the only exception is in may 2017 when water levels in the down gradient interplaya well well 2 increase at a faster rate relative to the up gradient interplaya well well 3 between 5 may and 31 may the water levels increase by 0 02 m more than in well 3 4 1 5 vadose zone water content the range of core water content is similar before and after the hydroperiod beneath the playa and beneath both the playa and interplaya although slightly higher under the playa fig 4 b supplementary tables 9 and 11 before the hydroperiod epc 1 2 the range for gravimetric water content is from 0 05 to 0 24 g g 1 compared with 0 06 to 0 24 g g 1 after the hydroperiod epc 5 this compares with the gravimetric water content in the interplaya vadose zone epc 7 which was between 0 09 and 0 28 g g 1 fig 4b volumetric water contents were similar in range in both the playa 0 06 to 0 33 and the interplaya 0 15 to 0 34 as well as before 0 06 to 0 30 and after 0 10 to 0 34 the hydroperiod under the playa despite the similar range of water content values between the pre and post hydroperiod cores for most of the overlapping depths water content is higher in the post hydroperiod core fig 4b 4 2 vadose zone and groundwater geochemistry vadose zone anion concentrations are higher in the interplaya core compared with the three playa cores fig 4c supplementary fig 3 supplementary tables 8 11 water extractable chloride concentrations range from 12 to 140 mg l 1 in the three playa cores epc 1 2 and 5 and from 301 to 3 900 mg l 1 in the interplaya epc 7 in the interplaya core chloride 3 900 mg l 1 concentrations peak at 2 m depth and decline without any increase towards the water table several peaks are present in the playa chloride profile both between and within individual cores high concentrations are present near the land surface in both epc 1 and 2 81 and 96 mg l 1 respectively but a second peak at 2 m is far more pronounced in epc 1 140 mg l 1 than epc 2 25 mg l 1 values increase slightly in all three cores near 5 m depth epc 1 60 mg l 1 epc 2 78 mg l 1 epc 5 46 mg l 1 the highest concentration in epc 5 72 mg l 1 is less than in either of the other two playa cores and is located deeper 9 m chloride concentrations in groundwater are generally similar to values observed in the base of the vadose zone fig 4c supplementary table 12 concentrations of bromide sulfate and nitrate are higher for all ions in the interplaya core epc 7 than the playa cores epc 1 2 and 5 fluoride concentrations are similar in both locations further detail on concentrations and trends for these ions are provided in the supplementary information values for 36cl are higher near the surface and generally higher in the playa core epc 5 than the interplaya core epc 7 fig 4d fig 5 supplementary table 13 in the playa core 36cl cl x10 15 in two samples at 3 5 m depth and just above the water table at 11 0 m depth were 1114 38 0 and 692 26 6 respectively it was not possible to recover sufficient chloride for analysis from other core samples collected from beneath the playa the analyses of 36cl cl x10 15 in four samples from the interplaya core range between 713 25 9 at 3 0 m depth to 514 21 0 at 16 7 m depth just above the water table 4 3 fluid flux calculations given the physical and chemical data available fluid flux is estimated and constrained using several independent methods within the playa estimates are obtained based on a back of the envelope estimate the rate of advance of the wetting front at the start of the hydroperiod and chloride peak displacement across the hydroperiod for both the playa and interplaya estimates are obtained using cmb with travel times also estimated using 36cl 4 3 1 back of the envelope infiltration estimates the ksat infiltration rates reflect saturated soil conditions in the interplaya this is only realistic during the sporadic rain events contributing very small pulses of water recharge through the playa floor can occur for longer periods due to the longer periods of saturation during hydroperiods fluid flux is estimated using a back of the envelope calculation assuming saturated flow and considering conditions observed during the hydroperiod in this study including ksat between 50 000 and 240 000 mm yr a maximum downward hydraulic gradient of 0 1 during ponding the hydraulic gradient is calculated considering the height of the water column at the playa floor 300 mm above the playa floor and the observed matric pressure conditions 10 kpa at 120 mm depth below the playa floor in these conditions it is theoretically possible for 1 d fluid flux rates to peak between 13 and 65 mm d 5 000 and 24 000 mm yr which for an average porosity of 0 3 would indicate maximum downward movement between 140 and 850 mm during the 34 43 day hydroperiod due to the large number of simplifications in this calculation these values over estimate the maximum flow due to ponding over this time period and neglect the potential for macropore flow 4 3 2 wetting front advance the wetting front advance is estimated using the time at which matric potential sensors were initially wet to field capacity and while affected by pressure fronts can provide estimates of fluid flux allison et al 1994 jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 the wetting front took 14 5 days to advance from 120 to 470 mm 10 8 hrs to move from 470 to 960 mm and 18 h to travel from 960 to 1 520 mm fig 2 and fig 3 from this the rate of downward movement representative of the soil wetting pressure front moving stored water downward during hydroperiods ranges from 8 800 to 400 000 mm yr gravimetric water contents in the upper two meters of core average 0 10 and 0 13 g g in the pre hydroperiod for epc 1 and 2 respectively compared with 0 20 g g for the post hydroperiod epc 5 suggesting ratios of the rate of movement of the infiltrating front to the pressure front of between 0 33 and 0 48 these values are comparable with those observed in other studies allison et al 1994 thus the rate of movement for the infiltrating water would range between 2 900 and 194 000 mm yr table 2 see supplementary table 14 this equates to a travel times of 21 days 0 058 yrs to 3 9 yrs through the 11 5 m vadose zone this means fluid could recharge the water table during the 43 day 0 12 yrs hydroperiod on the fast end or move downward 345 mm on the slow end there is added unquantifiable uncertainty with these estimates as it is likely the sensors were not fully equilibrated with the soil until they reached saturation and assumes the entire vadose zone is the same texture as the shallow soil zone in which the sensors are located see fig 4a these estimates are likely representative of movement through the soil during the beginning of inundation events with rates decreasing as inundation persists and or as the growing season develops on the other hand this could also be considered a conservative estimate given the issues with the matric potential sensors prior to their initial wetting no other wetting fronts were observed over the period of record 4 3 3 chloride peak displacement the displacement of the chloride peak in cores collected before epc 1 june 2016 and after epc 5 august 2017 the hydroperiod flushing event also allows estimation of fluid flux through the playa core analysis is necessarily a destructive sampling technique however the cores were collected as close to the same location as possible within 3 m of each other within the approximate error of the gps based location measurement the sedimentary profile between the cores are similar and thus it is reasonable to expect differences in pore geochemistry to result from the hydroperiod during dry periods chloride concentrates at the base of the root zone as evapotranspiration removes water leaving chloride behind scanlon and goldsmith 1997 scanlon et al 2009 chloride can then be mobilized downwards as a result of land use change increasing wet climate or as in this case a hydroperiod scanlon and goldsmith 1997 mcmahon et al 2006 gurdak et al 2007 scanlon et al 2007 scanlon et al 2008 scanlon et al 2009 chloride peaks for epc 1 and epc 5 are at 2 m and 9 m respectively fig 4 supplementary table 9 it is noted that another slight increase in chloride concentrations are observed at 5 m depth in epc 5 but the peak concentration at 9 m is almost twice the value observed at 5 m depth with a nearly continuous increase in concentrations from 4 m to 9 m thus using the peak observed at 9 m in the post hydroperiod core epc 5 the single inundation flushing event resulted in a chloride displacement of 7 m 7000 mm after only 1 17 years with a depth weighted average θvfield of 0 28 measured between 2 and 9 m in epc 5 the fluid flux is calculated across this 1 17 year interval as 1 700 mm yr 0 28 7000 mm 1 17 yr however assuming a three year gap between inundation events rather than 1 17 yr and the formation of a chloride peak at 2 m depth base of the root zone during the dry period the fluid flux is more likely slower at around 650 mm yr 0 28 7000 mm 3 00 yr the displacement of the chloride peak illustrates the importance of hydroperiods in driving the sporadic nature of infiltration and recharge in playas the chloride peak displacement fluid flux values table 2 provide an upper bound to fluid flux rate and could be used with studies of hydroperiod frequency and duration to better estimate long term recharge through the playas 4 3 4 chloride mass balance chloride mass balance fluid flux rates calculated through the vadose zone beneath the interplaya and playa are constrained using different chloride input functions wet and dry deposition only for the interplaya and wet and dry deposition plus runon r for the playa in the interplaya the only input of chloride to the system is via wet and dry deposition giving depth weighted flux rates of 3 mm yr average depth weighted fluid fluxes through the cored section and calculated for the playa at r of 5 10 and 20 of annual precipitation range from 19 to 37 mm yr 31 to 58 mm yr and 54 to 100 mm yr respectively fig 6 a supplementary table 15 the lowest fluid fluxes are observed in epc 5 cored after the hydroperiod with similar values in epc 1 and slightly higher values in epc 2 both cored before the hydroperiod fluid flux under the interplaya is considerably slower at 3 mm yr fig 6a supplementary table 15 a range of travel times to the water table are determined beneath the playa and interplaya based on chloride concentrations fig 6b table 2 supplementary table 16 depending on subsurface flux which is dependent on chloride deposition assumptions beneath the playa estimates range from 7 to 120 years compared with 5 400 years beneath the interplaya as travel time estimates are heavily reliant on the fluid flux estimate it is not surprising that the travel times are similarly one to three orders of magnitude faster beneath the playa than the interplaya with fastest movement beneath the playa during the hydroperiod this result is similar to observations in the southern high plains where recharge rates were between one and two orders of magnitude higher beneath playa compared with interplaya locations gurdak and roe 2010 4 3 5 36cl the 36cl data can help constrain the flux and travel time estimates the value of 36cl cl in precipitation in this part of kansas is 700 10 15 davis et al 2003 phillips 2000 higher 36cl cl values at 2 0 m and 3 5 m depth in the interplaya and playa cores 1114 10 15 and 927 10 15 see fig 5 and supplementary table 13 are thus evidence of contributions from bomb pulse 36cl the high chloride concentrations relative to 36cl cl in the interplaya core at this depth are indicative of chloride concentration due to evapotranspiration the next three deeper samples 3 0 m to 9 0 m in interplaya core have a consistent 36cl cl value near the expected value for precipitation indicating travel times in excess of 60 years for fluid travel to these depths thus beneath the interplaya the 36cl data indicate modern water has only infiltrated to depths 3 m samples for 36cl are not available for the playa core until just above the water table thus it can only be concluded that modern water has infiltrated to at least 3 5 m depth in the playa the deepest samples from each core may reflect influence with groundwater the deepest sample from beneath the interplaya in particular indicates contributions of pre bomb pulse 36cl that is considerably older than observed in other samples at the site as bomb pulse 36cl has traveled deeper beneath the playa even if the precise depth has yet to be determined it has traveled further than beneath the interplaya providing evidence of faster flow beneath the playa than the interplaya however using the data available assuming a 1957 peak for atmospheric 36cl synal et al 1990 and given the depths peak 36cl is observed in the interplaya and playa thus fluid fluxes of 33 mm yr 2 m 60 yr and greater than 58 mm yr 3 5 m 60 yr respectively can be estimated table 2 this would suggest travel times considering a runoff value of greater than 10 might be appropriate for the playa however additional measurements are needed particularly from beneath the playa to further evaluate the travel time estimates 4 3 6 comparison of fluxes the various methods employed to determine fluid flux rates result in a very large range in possible fluid fluxes table 2 this is due in part to assumptions and limitations within the different methods as well as the differing time scales over which the estimates are calculated the wetting front advance 2 900 192 000 mm yr and the chloride peak displacement 650 1 700 mm yr estimates represent changes as a direct result of the hydroperiod and generally ignore dry periods dry periods are inherently a part of the estimates provided by chloride mass balance and 36cl as these estimates integrate flux estimates over longer time periods although the chloride peak displacement method is an estimate across the hydroperiod because the core was not sampled directly prior to and immediately after the hydroperiod it does incorporate some of the dry period this may explain why the flux estimate from this method is lower than estimates from the wetting front advance the longer term estimates calculated by 36cl and cmb are generally in good agreement with each other but both calculations are reliant upon chloride transport and may not fully incorporate macropore flow e g wood et al 1997 it seems likely the peak 36cl activity was not captured in either the playa or interplaya likely it was shallower than 2 m in the interplaya and deeper than 3 5 m in the playa thus 36cl fluid flux estimates in the playa and interplaya are minimum and maximum values respectively finally the back of the envelope calculation is a highly simplified estimate assuming saturated conditions and should be considered as the peak infiltration rate realistically possible estimates of fluid flux from the playa studied here also compare well with data collected elsewhere in the high plains the one to three order of magnitude increase in fluid flux from the interplaya to the playa is similar to results from studies in the shp where playa fluid fluxes range from 24 to 610 mm yr with interplaya fluid fluxes from 0 1 to 32 mm yr gurdak et al 2007 gurdak and roe 2009 mcmahon et al 2006 meixner et al 2016 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood and sanford 1995 for this study at r 20 of precipitation recharge values are within the range of those observed beneath irrigated fields 39 to 138 mm yr elsewhere in the high plains e g katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 a previous study indicated cmb estimates in several playas 22 to 34 mm yr only measured the interstitial fluid flux and did not account for macropore flow accounting for macropore flow increased total fluid flux estimates considerably to 750 to 2 720 mm yr wood et al 1997 similar high inundation infiltration rates were measured in the shp through playas located in grassland 320 to 1 700 mm yr and cropland 730 to 7 200 mm yr watersheds ganesan et al 2016 the playa fluid flux estimates obtained here by the chloride peak displacement method 650 1700 mm yr compare well with the higher values from those previous studies and could reflect faster fluid movement through the macropores which were visible on the playa before and after the hydroperiod the disagreement over whether or not the cmb method represents the total system recharge matrix flux and macropore flux in areas with macropore flow such as with playas or just the matrix flux has not been settled in the literature scanlon 1999 wood 1999a wood 1999b while this study does not provide a definitive fluid flux rate representative of long term conditions or address the disagreement it is clear that fluid flux rates are at least one order of magnitude higher beneath the playa than the interplaya and possibly as much as three orders of magnitude higher 4 4 hydrus 1d results from the hydrus 1d simulations intended to provide constraints on subsurface conditions during and after the hydroperiod indicate downward water movement in the upper soil during the hydroperiod fig 7 the large playa filling precipitation event occurs on day 106 of the simulations and results in saturated flow conditions at the depth of the shallowest mp sensor 120 mm for all scenarios initial mp 60 000 mm 10 000 mm and 3 300 mm saturated flow conditions are also observed at depths similar to the next deepest mp sensor 400 mm for the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions at both depths water content increases to near saturation during the precipitation events at the end of march and for the precipitation events later in april and may wetting fronts do not reach the water table in any of the three scenarios during the hydroperiod but a wetting front is observed at the water table in the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions the peak arrives a little after 10 years in the scenario with the wettest initial conditions mp 3 300 mm but the full peak is not observed within the 45 year simulation in the scenario that is slightly drier initially mp 10 000 mm within the 45 year simulation the wetting front is observed at 5 11 m 5110 mm depth but not at 7 49 m 7 490 mm for the scenario with the driest initial conditions mp 60 000 mm downward fluid movement at different initial wetting conditions is estimated fig 8 in the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions initial mp 10 000 mm and 3 300 mm initial wetting at shallow depths occurs prior to the hydroperiod during earlier precipitation events thus the data from the shallower nodes are not useful for estimating flux rates only deeper nodes are used matric potential peaks are likewise not observed in the shallowest observation nodes in the wettest initial conditions or at below 5 11 m in the scenarios which are somewhat mp 10 000 mm and significantly drier mp 60 000 mm at the start a similar but opposite issue afflicts results from the scenario with the driest initial conditions as mps are not observed to increase at depths greater than 7 49 m 7490 mm for all scenarios fluid fluxes calculated using the initial arrival of the wetting front as marked by an increase in mp are greater than those calculated using the peak and highest in shallower regions fig 8 between scenarios fluid fluxes are greatest at wetter initial conditions and least with the driest initial conditions fluid fluxes range between 80 mm yr driest initial conditions peak arrival and 10 600 mm yr wettest initial conditions peak arrival regardless of the method used to calculate fluid flux the results illustrate the importance of antecedent moisture conditions on recharge beneath the playa higher initial moisture conditions result in higher fluid fluxes and shorter time of travel 5 summary and conclusions one hydroperiod was observed during the study in april and may of 2017 following a single day high intensity 80 mm rainfall event the hydroperiod lasted somewhere between 34 and 43 days 0 09 0 12 yr with a maximum water depth of approximately 340 mm after inundation near surface matric potentials were above field capacity from surface to the deepest sensor location 1 520 mm below the ground surface small increases in groundwater level are observed down gradient from the playa and possibly beneath the playa as well but changes to the barometric response in the aquifer beneath the playa complicate interpretations with the sensors used in the study surface infiltration rates are similar between the playa and interplaya when physical data are combined with geochemical data it seems possible from groundwater level data that the short hydroperiod did result in recharge to the aquifer although most of the methods suggested slower travel times it seems likely drainage did occur to at least 9 m as observed from changes in chloride concentrations other precipitation events did not result in ponding during the study period the intensity of the storm appears to be a significant factor in ponding although timing of the event relative to the growing season likely is also a factor while simulations with hydrus 1d suggest antecedent moisture conditions beneath the playa are an important factor in fluid flux and deep drainage high antecedent moisture did not appear to promote ponding during a lower intensity event with a higher rain total spread over a longer time period it is likely that high antecedent moisture conditions will also limit macropore flow there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting fluid flux through the playa is greater than through the interplaya all anion concentrations have a higher maximum in the interplaya than the playa indicating fluid flux through the playa is higher with longer ion residence times beneath the interplaya gravimetric water content is higher in the playa core collected after they hydroperiod than cores obtained from the playa pre hydroperiod demonstrating water movement through the profile between 2016 and 2017 resulting from the hydroperiod before the hydroperiod dissolved solutes were concentrated at 2 m depth beneath the playa and assumed at a similar depth beneath the interplaya after the hydroperiod solutes remain at 2 m depth beneath the interplaya but are flushed beyond the root zone to a depth of at least 9 m calculations of infiltration rate and fluid flux beneath the playa are fastest from physical measurements infiltrometer and matric potential 2 900 to 192 000 mm yr chemistry based fluid flux calculations provide a more constrained range beneath the playa between 19 and 1 700 mm yr additional uncertainty in the chloride mass balance estimate results from the unknown amount of runoff from the surrounding watershed increasing runoff estimates from 5 to 20 of annual precipitation increases the fluid flux estimate by a factor of almost 10 although travel times increase by a smaller amount beneath the interplaya fluid flux rates of only 3 mm yr are observed fluid fluxes from both the interplaya and playa are consistent with studies elsewhere in the high plains region in summary physical and chemical data both indicate recharge is greater beneath ehmke playa than the nearby interplaya by several orders of magnitude continued long term study will help identify the frequency of inundation events and the types of events which can individually push water to the water table despite this it is clear that with faster fluid flux rates and water infiltrating past the root zone intact playas provide significantly greater recharge than nearby rangeland interplaya at the very least recharge rates beneath the ehmke playa are also equal to those beneath irrigated cropland above the hpa in kansas but are likely greater these data confirm that the ehmke playa and likely other kansas playas behave similarly to the better studied playa systems on the shp of texas this conclusion should be confirmed through the study of playas of varying sizes in kansas and also in areas where the depth to water has increased significantly due to pumping declaration of competing interest the

3008,playa lakes have been promoted as potential point sources of recharge to the high plains aquifer but information about recharge rates is only available for the southern high plains where soils and substrate differ significantly from the central high plains the goal of this study is to determine the degree to which functioning playas contribute to recharge of the aquifer in the central high plains this is accomplished through a multifaceted study across a single 34 43 day long playa hydroperiod combining physical and geochemical evidence to measure fluid flux through the playa and geochemical evidence of fluid flux through the nearby interplaya the hydroperiod resulted in increased matric potential and decreases in chloride and other anion concentrations in the vadose zone beneath the playa and increases in groundwater levels downgradient likely indicating recharge to the aquifer over the course of the short event anion concentrations are significantly higher in the interplaya compared with the playa while fluid flux estimates are significantly higher beneath the playa the fluid fluxes determined in this study are consistent with estimates from elsewhere in the high plains region the combination of physical and geochemical data decreased the uncertainty and improved the overall conclusion that recharge rates are higher beneath the playa than the interplaya providing evidence that playas in the central high plains function similarly to those in the southern high plains keywords chloride mass balance chlorine 36 high plains aquifer matric potential recharge vadose zone data availability i have shared the data used in this paper in the supplementary file 1 introduction playas are mostly small internally drained closed basin ephemeral lakes with varying periods of inundation or hydroperiod and are the most significant surface water feature on much of the high plains numbering over 75 000 across the landscape bartuszevige 2018 irrigation withdrawals from the underlying high plains aquifer hpa account for 23 of the total groundwater use in the united states and have resulted in an over 60 reduction in the saturated thickness from pre irrigation development 1950 to 2014 2016 and water level declines exceeding 50 m in some areas maupin and barber 2005 mcguire 2017 under current pumping rates and average climatic conditions water level declines will continue likely compromising future use of the aquifer butler et al 2013 whittemore et al 2016 improved estimates of water availability and management of the hpa requires improved identification of recharge pathways and quantification of recharge rates recharge to the hpa is spatially variable due to precipitation and recharge generally increasing from the south to north and west to east and evapotranspiration generally greatest in the south crosbie et al 2013 previously published recharge estimates for kansas 5 to 54 mm yr indicate a travel time of 270 to over 1000 years for infiltrated water to travel through the 15 to 100 m thick vadose zone to the aquifer gurdak et al 2007 katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 stanton et al 2011 notwithstanding the presence of agricultural contaminants in the aquifer indicates recharge of modern water since the 1950s in some locations which is indicative of a 100 year travel time to the water table mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 the faster paths to the aquifer are likely through focused recharge and preferential flow paths including areas with ponded surface water such as ephemeral streambeds ditches shallow depressions irrigated cropland and playas fryar et al 2001 gurdak et al 2007 gurdak et al 2008 meixner et al 2016 nativ 1992 several studies of recharge through the dense system of southern high plains shp playas see playa distribution map in fig 1 concluded that recharge rates through playas 60 to 120 mm yr are higher than diffuse recharge through the surrounding landscape 0 2 to 32 mm yr gurdak et al 2007 gurdak and roe 2009 gurdak and roe 2010 meixner et al 2016 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood et al 1997 recharge rates within an individual playa are variable through time controlled by rain flux infiltration rate saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and macropore fluid flux which varies with the formation of desiccation cracks between hydroperiods and may only occur once every few years gurdak and roe 2009 gurdak and roe 2010 although playas are abundant in kansas 22 000 fig 1 the possibility for recharge through central high plains chp playas to the hpa has not been investigated bowen 2011 this is addressed herein by determining water fluxes in the chp through both a playa and interplaya identifying periods of downward fluid flux during playa inundation and quantifying travel times to the hpa 2 study site the study focuses on ehmke playa 38 4429 100 6031 located on the chp in lane county kansas fig 1 this location was selected for study because 1 the water table is relatively shallow 15 m below ground surface 2 the land surface has not been affected significantly by anthropogenic modification with rangeland surrounding the playa and less than half of the watershed cultivated agriculture without irrigation limiting agricultural influences to the playa or run on water 3 its eastward longitude within the cluster of playas in western kansas fig 1c has a relatively higher average annual precipitation increasing the probability of precipitation events sufficient to produce runoff into the playa during the period of investigation 4 the playa has accumulated little to no anthropogenically accelerated sediment so hydric soils form the surface of the playa floor and 5 because the current landowner s ancestors originally settled the land thereby providing knowledge of its use dating from the middle 1800s the ehmke playa frequently contains ponded water though these hydroperiods occur at irregular intervals due to variations in climate playa soils are mapped as the ness series fine smectitic mesic ustic epiaquerts soil survey staff 2021 with well developed hydric soil indicators in the core or center part of the playa sink and fewer indicators surrounding the core the most extensive development of desiccation cracks macropores occurs in the core area of the playa though they have been observed throughout the playa the hpa underlies the study site and consists of unconsolidated alluvial gravel sand silt and clay deposited to the east of the rocky mountains during the miocene and pliocene epoch gutentag et al 1984 ludvigson et al 2009 the ehmka playa has its primary inflow on the southwest end fig 1a the playa watershed kastens et al 2016 covers approximately 438 ha consisting of an average of 57 non irrigated cropland and 39 grass pasture wetland water during 2011 2020 according to the usda cropland data layer usda 2022 the playa has been mapped using 2 m lidar digital terrain model aerial imagery and through soil survey differences between these delineations are described in the supplementary information and displayed in fig 1a these different delineations indicate the playa surface is between 38 9 and 70 5 ha with a depth between 0 23 m and 1 54 m for a capacity between 8 140 m3 and 254 000 m3 see supplementary table 1 for a comparison of these values between the different mapping methods as discussed in the supplementary information this large range largely depends on whether features such as the delta are included and how much of the annulus sidewall is included 3 methods surface and subsurface sensors were installed in the center of the playa in june 2016 fig 1a primary above ground sensors include an automated tipping bucket rain gauge campbell cc5mpx camera and sr50a automated sonic ranging sensor water level recorder and ground target additional sensors monitor wind temperature barometric pressure and net radiation dielectric water potential sensors mps 6 decagon devices inc were used to help determine moisture flux and were emplaced at depths of 0 12 m sensor 1 0 47 m sensor 2 0 96 m sensor 3 and 1 52 m sensor 4 in a pit excavated adjacent to the power and electronics stand see supplementary fig 1 the shallowest three sensors were located in the dark colored hydric soil with sensor 3 located just above an abrupt change in soil color sensor 4 was placed below the color change in grey brown soil additional detail on sensor accuracy and limitations can be found in the supplementary information three monitoring wells were installed at the study site in june 2016 fig 1a see supplementary tables 2 and 3 for construction and location details well 1 is located in the playa center within the fenced instrumentation area well 2 is adjacent to the road in the southeastern corner of the section on the southeast side of the playa basin and at the toe of the lunette well 3 is in the southwestern corner of the section and adjacent to the southwestern corner of the playa near the inflow surface elevations were extracted from 2 m lidar digital terrain model dtm data each well was instrumented with a solinst levellogger edge pressure transducer allowing for half hourly water level measurements with a solinst barologger also placed in well 1 a total of seven soil cores were obtained from the study site with four used in the present study to determine pore water chemistry fig 1a see supplementary table 3 for locations these include epc 1 and 2 in the playa center completed with a giddings soil coring machine in june 2016 to depths of 5 4 m and 5 3 m carbonate lentils caliche impeded coring with the giddings preventing the collection of a core through the entire vadose zone in august 2017 additional soil cores were collected using an acker hollow stem auger including epc 5 in the playa center completed to a depth of 11 7 m and epc 7 in the north interplaya completed to depth of 16 8 m fig 1a this second set of borings reached the water table in both locations completely sampling the vadose zone pore water chemistry was analyzed every 1 m in epc 5 and 7 and every 0 5 m in epc 1 and 2 pore water samples and gravimetric water contents were obtained using the same methods described by katz et al 2016 and described in detail in the supplementary information after pore water extraction and filtration sample chemistry was determined a 5 ml aliquot of each pore water sample was analyzed on the ion chromatograph ic for fluoride chloride bromide nitrate and sulfate instrument quantification limit calculations are described in the supplementary information results were output from the ic in mg l 1 but converted to mg kg 1 of dry soil using the following equation 1 a n i o n e x t r a c t e d w a t e r m g l θ g

extraction the samples were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes where 80 mg of agno3 crystals and 5 ml of hno3 were added to precipitate agcl the samples were kept in the dark during precipitation centrifuged and the supernatant poured off after drying at 60 c overnight in the dark tubes were capped wrapped in aluminum foil and then sent to australian national university for further purification to remove sulfur followed by accelerator mass spectrometry analysis using the 14ud pelletron accelerator fifield et al 2010 fifield et al 2013 a decagon devices dualhead infiltrometer was used to measure the ksat of the surface soil at four locations fig 1a two measurements were collected at the playa center inf 1 and 2 near epc 1 and two measurements were collected at the interplaya inf 3 and 4 near epc 7 see supplementary table 3 for locations ksat is calculated by averaging the results from three pressure cycles additional information on instrument settings are provided in the supplementary information 3 1 fluid flux calculations fluid flux is calculated using several different methods with different assumptions which provide information about fluid flux at different temporal scales to better constrain fluid flux rates 3 1 1 back of the envelope infiltration an estimate of infiltration velocity during saturated conditions can be made using a darcy calculation darcy flux estimates combines the ksat estimates obtained from the dual head infiltrometer with the vertical hydraulic gradient and porosity in the vadose zone hydraulic conductivity and gradient are highly variable but in this simplified calculation the vertical hydraulic gradient during ponding is the maximum height of ponded water above the land surface relative to a recently wetted subsurface 3 1 2 wetting front advance monitoring the wetting front advance can provide estimates of fluid flux e g allison et al 1994 jolly et al 1989 scanlon et al 2008 warrick et al 1971 a wetting front that moves down a profile is a function of water stored in a profile that is dislodged in advance of the infiltrating water resulting in a pressure front jolly et al 1989 as this rate is generally faster than expected for the newly infiltrating water the ratio between the rate of movement of the pressure and infiltration fronts can be determined by comparing the water contents before and after the wetting events jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 to estimate the rate of advance for infiltrating water from the movement of the wetting front the time at which matric potential sensors were initially wet to field capacity is compared and multiplied by the ratio of the change in water content from prior to the hydroperiod and during the hydroperiod jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 here the average gravimetric water content from the upper two meters of pre and post hydroperiod core are used to determine the ratio this method assumes piston flow and does not account for preferential pathways jolly et al 1989 not all wetting front advances produce recharge and water flux without changes to vadose zone water content can occur sophocleous 1991 3 1 3 chloride peak displacement fluid flux was also estimated based on chloride peak displacement in the playa center where chloride vadose zone profiles were collected in consecutive years following the method of stonestrom et al 2003 3 1 4 chloride mass balance the chloride mass balance cmb method is widely used to approximate recharge rates in non marine strata by comparing the concentration of chloride in the vadose zone system with the concentration of chloride input to the surface e g allison and hughes 1978 allison et al 1994 allison and hughes 1983 phillips 1994 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 scanlon et al 2007 stonestrom et al 2007 walvoord and phillips 2004 wood and sanford 1995 this method is preferred over water balance calculations when measuring fluid recharge flux to aquifers in semiarid regions where large evapotranspiration rates and inter annual variations in precipitation result in a large error when calculating the typically small 100 mm yr recharge rates scanlon 1991 the inputs for the cmb used here are similar to those applied at a study site approximately 90 km to the n nw and described in katz et al 2016 with the following modifications described below the average 1952 2017 annual precipitation 505 mm was obtained from a national weather service monitoring station in scott city kansas located approximately 26 8 km west of the ehmke playa high plains regional climate center 2018 wet chloride deposition is monitored approximately 37 3 km northwest of the study site in scott county ks with a mean annual 1984 2017 deposition of 0 08 g m3 nadp 2021 as discussed by katz et al 2016 this volumetric value is within the error of the average wet chloride deposition value from three chp and shp monitoring sites with similar precipitation rates mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 thus although dry deposition is currently unknown for kansas as with the previous studies katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 mcmahon et al 2003 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 an average annual wet and dry chloride deposition value of 0 3 g m2 is used for the current study it should be noted the average annual wet chloride deposition is slightly lower and the average annual precipitation is slightly higher than the reference site in texas 530 km to the south to avoid underestimating the total amount of chloride deposition in the playa basin the cmb calculations beneath the playa are adjusted following wood and sanford 1995 and scanlon and goldsmith 1997 to account for the additional chloride mass contributed from run on water in the adjusted equation 3 q cl p cl p r a b cl r a f qcl is the chloride deposition flux to the land surface m l2 p is precipitation l clp is the chloride concentration in precipitation wet and dry m l3 0 6 g m3 which is determined by dividing the average annual wet and dry chloride deposition 0 3 g m2 by the average annual depth of liquid precipitation 0 5 m r is runoff l a b is the area of the watershed 14 km2 a f is the area of the playa 0 51 km2 and cl r is the concentration of chloride in the run off water m l3 cl r is assumed the same as cl p at this site or 0 6 g m3 because there are not sufficient quantities of chloride sources in surficial sediments to alter the concentration in run off water if there are additional sources of chloride and clr is greater than clp the recharge rate would be underestimated it is not likely that clr would be less than clp given the conservative nature of chloride eq 3 can be divided by the cluz or the chloride mass in the unsaturated zone to determine the chloride flux beyond the root zone values for runoff r to the studied playa are not available but in shp playas r values of between 5 and 10 of annual precipitation p have been reported scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood and sanford 1995 given the soil texture and watershed characteristics a runoff value of 10 is likely reasonable for this study area however the chp experiences substantial inter annual variations in precipitation 370 to 845 mm and higher values for r may be more representative of wetter years to constrain realistic possibilities fluid flux through the playa was estimated equation 3 with values for r of 5 25 3 mm yr 10 50 1 mm yr and 20 101 mm yr of p chloride travel time in the vadose zone is calculated in the cmb by averaging the volumetric mass of chloride cluz in a depth interval and dividing by the chloride deposition for instance qcl in eq 3 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 4 t t 0 z θ vfield c l uz d z q cl 3 2 hydrus 1d simulations the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2018 is used to simulate vadose zone fluid flux beneath the playa resulting from a single hydroperiod the purpose of this is to understand the effects of different initial wetting conditions on the subsurface system and understand whether it is possible for a wetting front to reach the water table during a single hydroperiod like the one observed during the study the upper boundary condition is derived from the precipitation measured at the site from december 2016 through june 2017 i e the atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer option was selected with no precipitation for the remainder of the simulation which extended for 45 years the maximum ponding depth allowed is set at 0 5 m the maximum observed at the site during the study time steps were allowed to vary between 1 10 5 and 20 days 2 74 10 8 to 0 0548 yr with an initial step of 0 0001 days 2 7 10 7 yr since playas are closed basins runoff outflow is not considered water content tolerance and pressure head tolerance were set to 0 01 and 10 mm respectively the lower boundary condition is free draining the soil grid is simplified from a combination of the epc 4 and 5 cores and consists of four soil textures silt silt loam sandy loam and loam in 14 discrete zones see supplementary table 5 soil hydraulic parameters for these soil textures are selected from the default values pre programmed with hydrus 1d see supplementary table 6 a van genuchten mualem single porosity model van genuchten 1980 is used without hysteresis the initial mp is set to values of 60 000 10 000 and 3 300 mm for three different simulations to understand the effects of ponding during extremely dry dry and moist antecedent soil moisture conditions to understand the effects of the initial wetting conditions on downward fluid movement the progress of the wetting front in the hydrus 1d simulations is observed at several nodes the arrival of the wetting front is determined two ways 1 using the time of the initial increase in mp and 2 the timing of peak mp the times between the arrival of the wetting front at the different observation nodes are then compared relative to their distances 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical characteristics of the hydroperiod 4 1 1 precipitation and hydroperiod playa inundation hydroperiod precipitation and mp data from four soil depths are available for a total of 354 days between december 2016 june 2017 and december 2018 june 2019 but are not available between june 2017 and november 2018 due to a programming and download error fig 2 despite the missing data spring and early summer is when a playa hydroperiod is most likely and when the one hydroperiod of the study is observed from april to may of 2017 the one hydroperiod observed during the study fig 2 began following the intense and large precipitation event on 12 april 2017 with the playa remaining wet through late may 2017 43 days prior to this the playa had not been inundated to the annulus or rim of the basin for 2 or 3 years vance and louise ehmke personal communication the first indication of ponding 20 mm depth is recorded by the depth sensor at 6 40 pm on 12 april by 13 april water reaches a peak depth of 200 mm at the weather station water levels in the playa slowly decline until two pulses of higher water levels following precipitation events between 27 april and 2 may 46 2 mm precipitation and 10 11 may 25 1 mm precipitation ponded water depths decline to 50 mm by 27 april but increase following the rain event to at least 340 mm on 4 may some spurious water depth measurements on 3 and 4 may are not considered and it is possible the peak depth was not recorded the cause of the sensor malfunction is not clear wind speeds are roughly average 400 mm s during this period and as the malfunction is observed in both day and night measurements is likely not a result of glare water levels decline to 90 mm on 10 may rising again to 140 mm on 12 may likely the result of the precipitation event on 10 11 may surface water levels then decline until 25 may when ponded water is no longer observed with the depth sensor indicating a 43 day hydroperiod this roughly corresponds with visual inspection of digital pictures from the weather station camera which indicate inundation of the playa from 13 april through 16 may 2017 or a 34 day hydroperiod this minimum estimate is affected by limitations of the camera angle as the camera points towards the east and not downward the growth of grasses and wetland plants limit the detail obtained from the camera as water levels recede compared with the depth sensor which targets a fixed metal plate the rate of decline in playa ponded water depth is consistently linear and relatively similar for all three periods after each peak surface water depth water depths decline at a rate of 13 2 mm d 4 820 mm yr r 0 992 p 0 0001 after the first peak on 12 april and 13 1 mm d 4 780 mm yr r 0 989 p 0 0001 after the peak on 4 may the decline after the final peak on 12 may is considered in two parts the first from 12 to 19 may and a second from 20 to 27 may because a small rain event on 19 may resulted in a slight pause in the water depth decline over the former period water depths decline at a rate of 13 6 mm d 4 960 mm yr r 0 993 p 0 0001 and 11 8 mm d 4 310 mm yr r 0 91 p 0 0001 over the latter the depth sensor did not record any ponding events during the 2018 2019 measurement period positive measurements between january and march 2019 record snow pack depth rather than ponding in the playa the playa is located in a very windy generally featureless and treeless environment with blowing and drifting of snow a common occurrence when snow is present as a result the snow depths recorded at the weather station may or may not be representative of total snow depths in the surrounding playa the depth sensor spike on 26 may 2019 occurs over a brief 20 minute period during which 20 mm of rain fell fig 2 as the apparent depth immediately drops back to background levels following the rain event the spike is likely a result of reflections from the rain affecting the sensor rather than an actual measurement of ponding in the playa the amount and intensity of precipitation events is used to distinguish threshold conditions that lead to playa ponding during the study across the two winter summer transitions rain fell on 60 days averaging 8 2 mm d the playa ponded only once following the heaviest 79 3 mm total and most intense single day rainfall event on 12 april 2017 both the peak 106 7 mm hr over a 10 minute period fig 3 and overall average 34 0 mm hr over the 140 minute event intensity of this precipitation event was higher than any other event the single day event with the next highest total 34 8 mm 28 march 2017 which occurs on the first day of a 2 day event with total precipitation of 53 8 mm does not result in ponding in the playa the intensity of this event was much less peaking at 10 7 mm hr over a 10 minute period and averaging 3 3 mm hr over the event over a longer period of nine days 18 26 may 2019 inclusive of two single days free of precipitation a total of 91 4 mm of precipitation is recorded the highest amount for any wet period the average overall precipitation rate 4 6 mm hr during intervals with measured precipitation is considerably less than the average during the event resulting in ponding of the playa the second highest peak precipitation rate measured 83 3 mm hr over a 10 minute period is observed at the end of this wet period 26 may 2019 on this day a total of 22 4 mm of precipitation fell over 90 min at an average intensity of 13 4 mm hr this also did not result in ponding of the playa from this limited dataset it appears that intense precipitation events are more likely to result in ponding in the playa than lower intensity multi day precipitation events however the effects of the growing season cannot be neglected as the relatively intense storm event at the end of the multi day wet period in 2019 an event that did not result in ponding occurs when the growing season was further along mid late may regardless it is suggested that more than 54 mm of precipitation but not more than 79 3 mm of precipitation in a 36 hour period is needed for ponding the average intensity of the precipitation event should be somewhere above 13 4 mm hr but does not need to exceed 34 0 mm hr as monitoring continues it is hoped this data could be applied across the thousands of unmonitored playas to improve recharge estimates further as precipitation patterns change this information will provide a means to better predict the effects of changing precipitation patterns on recharge 4 1 2 soil moisture matric potential is very negative 6000 kpa throughout all installed depths 120 470 960 and 1520 mm until the end of march 2017 possibly indicative of sensors that are still air dry and not in equilibrium with the surrounding matrix due to insufficient initial contact with the soil as a result sensor readings are not considered to provide a quantitative measure of actual mp until field capacity fc is first recorded several pressure pulses qualitatively indicate increases in soil moisture and fluid flow between february and april but the mp associated with these events are extremely low eventually all sensors record a rapid increase in pressure from 6000 kpa to 33 kpa over less than ten hours at each individual sensor with the change observed in the shallowest sensor thirteen days prior to the deeper sensors fig 2 supplementary fig 2 rain events totaling 56 9 mm between 23 march at 8 00 pm and 29 march at 11 30 am including 43 7 mm on 28 29 march preceded an increase in mp to above fc in sensor 1 on 29 march after initially peaking at 11 kpa on 30 march mp remains between 12 and 11 kpa through 9 april then declines until the large precipitation event on 12 april reaching a minimum of 14 kpa on the afternoon of 11 april fc is not observed in sensors 2 4 until after the large precipitation event on april 12 fig 3 the subsurface effects of the large precipitation event on 12 april 2017 and subsequent playa hydroperiod are eventually observed at all four sensors as the wetting front moves downwards fig 3 at sensor 1 mp increases from 14 to 11 kpa over 80 min starting at 8 50 pm just 40 min after the end of the rain event this is followed by a slower increase in mp to 10 kpa by 16 april at 4 20 pm where it remains until 30 may mp at sensor 2 quickly reaches 11 kpa by 10 40 pm on 12 april but increases more slowly to 10 kpa by 14 april where it remains until 31 may mp does not increase to above fc in sensors 3 and 4 until 13 and 14 april respectively after reaching fc the mp increase is more gradual in both of these deeper sensors reaching 10 kpa on 14 april and 22 april for sensors 3 and 4 respectively the soil then starts to dry shortly after the playa hydroperiod ends fig 2 supplementary fig 2 matric potential begins a slight decreasing trend in sensor 4 on 23 may the rate at which mp declines at sensor 4 increases on 30 may the same day mp at sensors 1 and 3 also begin to decrease while mp starts decreasing in sensor 2 on 31 may these downward trends continue through the end of the first measurement period on june 12 matric potential decreases the most at sensor 1 decreasing to just below fc 34 kpa with higher pressures in sensors 2 3 and 4 15 13 and 14 kpa respectively the matric potential in 2019 remained above fc at deeper intervals with some drying observed at the shallowest interval 120 mm depth at times the rapid drying of the shallowest interval as snow melts suggests relatively little recharge contributions from snow however additional study of the rare snow accumulations is needed it is worth noting that during the multiple near consecutive days of precipitation in may 2019 the soil is above field capacity and the three deeper sensors while occasionally drying out at the shallowest interval to a minimum of 130 kpa at the time of the most intense precipitation during this wet period the soil is above field capacity at all sensors given the hydric soils at the site it is likely very few macropores are present by this time and the playa soils would be ready to pond yet the lack of ponding during this period provides further evidence that a more intense precipitation event is necessary to promote ponding 4 1 3 infiltration saturated hydraulic conductivity values obtained from the dual head infiltrometer for playa floor and interplaya are very similar table 1

estimate the hydraulic gradient with the hydrogeoestimatorxl tool devlin and schillig 2017 groundwater at the ehmke playa site is flowing under a hydraulic gradient of 0 0016 towards north 66 east following the guidelines provided by devlin and mcelwee 2007 the hydraulic gradient error is likely 20 for the direction and 30 for the magnitude as the y x ratio is 0 25 384 m 1531 m and the area monitored is 293 990 m2 irregular but frequent variations on the order of 0 03 m are observed in the well 1 barometric pressure corrected pressure transducer record despite correcting for barometric pressure these variations are likely a reflection of strong influence of barometric pressure changes on the record adjusting for barometric efficiency to values between 0 50 and 0 75 during barometric pressure correction in the solinst levelogger software lessened but did not eliminate the fluctuations it is worth noting that variations are greatest during the ponded period increasing to as much as 0 05 m which suggests the response of the aquifer to barometric pressure change varies depending on the hydroperiod it is also possible that wind pushing on the portion of the piezometer sticking out of the ground 2 010 m results in vibrations to the mechanism and cable suspending the pressure transducer placing a larger diameter pipe e g 100 mm around the surface piezometer would dampen the effects of the wind a vented pressure transducer might be more appropriate in this location than the sealed pressure transducer and would allow further exploration of changes to barometric response and improved correction of water levels for the barometric pressure signal e g bohling et al 2011 butler et al 2011 over the course of the study a total variation in hydraulic head of 0 08 0 12 mm is observed in individual wells with an overall increasing trend observed in the period of record fig 2 supplementary table 7 the greatest increase is in well 2 which is down gradient from the playa in general the water levels in the up gradient and down gradient interplaya wells recorded similar changes the only exception is in may 2017 when water levels in the down gradient interplaya well well 2 increase at a faster rate relative to the up gradient interplaya well well 3 between 5 may and 31 may the water levels increase by 0 02 m more than in well 3 4 1 5 vadose zone water content the range of core water content is similar before and after the hydroperiod beneath the playa and beneath both the playa and interplaya although slightly higher under the playa fig 4 b supplementary tables 9 and 11 before the hydroperiod epc 1 2 the range for gravimetric water content is from 0 05 to 0 24 g g 1 compared with 0 06 to 0 24 g g 1 after the hydroperiod epc 5 this compares with the gravimetric water content in the interplaya vadose zone epc 7 which was between 0 09 and 0 28 g g 1 fig 4b volumetric water contents were similar in range in both the playa 0 06 to 0 33 and the interplaya 0 15 to 0 34 as well as before 0 06 to 0 30 and after 0 10 to 0 34 the hydroperiod under the playa despite the similar range of water content values between the pre and post hydroperiod cores for most of the overlapping depths water content is higher in the post hydroperiod core fig 4b 4 2 vadose zone and groundwater geochemistry vadose zone anion concentrations are higher in the interplaya core compared with the three playa cores fig 4c supplementary fig 3 supplementary tables 8 11 water extractable chloride concentrations range from 12 to 140 mg l 1 in the three playa cores epc 1 2 and 5 and from 301 to 3 900 mg l 1 in the interplaya epc 7 in the interplaya core chloride 3 900 mg l 1 concentrations peak at 2 m depth and decline without any increase towards the water table several peaks are present in the playa chloride profile both between and within individual cores high concentrations are present near the land surface in both epc 1 and 2 81 and 96 mg l 1 respectively but a second peak at 2 m is far more pronounced in epc 1 140 mg l 1 than epc 2 25 mg l 1 values increase slightly in all three cores near 5 m depth epc 1 60 mg l 1 epc 2 78 mg l 1 epc 5 46 mg l 1 the highest concentration in epc 5 72 mg l 1 is less than in either of the other two playa cores and is located deeper 9 m chloride concentrations in groundwater are generally similar to values observed in the base of the vadose zone fig 4c supplementary table 12 concentrations of bromide sulfate and nitrate are higher for all ions in the interplaya core epc 7 than the playa cores epc 1 2 and 5 fluoride concentrations are similar in both locations further detail on concentrations and trends for these ions are provided in the supplementary information values for 36cl are higher near the surface and generally higher in the playa core epc 5 than the interplaya core epc 7 fig 4d fig 5 supplementary table 13 in the playa core 36cl cl x10 15 in two samples at 3 5 m depth and just above the water table at 11 0 m depth were 1114 38 0 and 692 26 6 respectively it was not possible to recover sufficient chloride for analysis from other core samples collected from beneath the playa the analyses of 36cl cl x10 15 in four samples from the interplaya core range between 713 25 9 at 3 0 m depth to 514 21 0 at 16 7 m depth just above the water table 4 3 fluid flux calculations given the physical and chemical data available fluid flux is estimated and constrained using several independent methods within the playa estimates are obtained based on a back of the envelope estimate the rate of advance of the wetting front at the start of the hydroperiod and chloride peak displacement across the hydroperiod for both the playa and interplaya estimates are obtained using cmb with travel times also estimated using 36cl 4 3 1 back of the envelope infiltration estimates the ksat infiltration rates reflect saturated soil conditions in the interplaya this is only realistic during the sporadic rain events contributing very small pulses of water recharge through the playa floor can occur for longer periods due to the longer periods of saturation during hydroperiods fluid flux is estimated using a back of the envelope calculation assuming saturated flow and considering conditions observed during the hydroperiod in this study including ksat between 50 000 and 240 000 mm yr a maximum downward hydraulic gradient of 0 1 during ponding the hydraulic gradient is calculated considering the height of the water column at the playa floor 300 mm above the playa floor and the observed matric pressure conditions 10 kpa at 120 mm depth below the playa floor in these conditions it is theoretically possible for 1 d fluid flux rates to peak between 13 and 65 mm d 5 000 and 24 000 mm yr which for an average porosity of 0 3 would indicate maximum downward movement between 140 and 850 mm during the 34 43 day hydroperiod due to the large number of simplifications in this calculation these values over estimate the maximum flow due to ponding over this time period and neglect the potential for macropore flow 4 3 2 wetting front advance the wetting front advance is estimated using the time at which matric potential sensors were initially wet to field capacity and while affected by pressure fronts can provide estimates of fluid flux allison et al 1994 jolly et al 1989 warrick et al 1971 the wetting front took 14 5 days to advance from 120 to 470 mm 10 8 hrs to move from 470 to 960 mm and 18 h to travel from 960 to 1 520 mm fig 2 and fig 3 from this the rate of downward movement representative of the soil wetting pressure front moving stored water downward during hydroperiods ranges from 8 800 to 400 000 mm yr gravimetric water contents in the upper two meters of core average 0 10 and 0 13 g g in the pre hydroperiod for epc 1 and 2 respectively compared with 0 20 g g for the post hydroperiod epc 5 suggesting ratios of the rate of movement of the infiltrating front to the pressure front of between 0 33 and 0 48 these values are comparable with those observed in other studies allison et al 1994 thus the rate of movement for the infiltrating water would range between 2 900 and 194 000 mm yr table 2 see supplementary table 14 this equates to a travel times of 21 days 0 058 yrs to 3 9 yrs through the 11 5 m vadose zone this means fluid could recharge the water table during the 43 day 0 12 yrs hydroperiod on the fast end or move downward 345 mm on the slow end there is added unquantifiable uncertainty with these estimates as it is likely the sensors were not fully equilibrated with the soil until they reached saturation and assumes the entire vadose zone is the same texture as the shallow soil zone in which the sensors are located see fig 4a these estimates are likely representative of movement through the soil during the beginning of inundation events with rates decreasing as inundation persists and or as the growing season develops on the other hand this could also be considered a conservative estimate given the issues with the matric potential sensors prior to their initial wetting no other wetting fronts were observed over the period of record 4 3 3 chloride peak displacement the displacement of the chloride peak in cores collected before epc 1 june 2016 and after epc 5 august 2017 the hydroperiod flushing event also allows estimation of fluid flux through the playa core analysis is necessarily a destructive sampling technique however the cores were collected as close to the same location as possible within 3 m of each other within the approximate error of the gps based location measurement the sedimentary profile between the cores are similar and thus it is reasonable to expect differences in pore geochemistry to result from the hydroperiod during dry periods chloride concentrates at the base of the root zone as evapotranspiration removes water leaving chloride behind scanlon and goldsmith 1997 scanlon et al 2009 chloride can then be mobilized downwards as a result of land use change increasing wet climate or as in this case a hydroperiod scanlon and goldsmith 1997 mcmahon et al 2006 gurdak et al 2007 scanlon et al 2007 scanlon et al 2008 scanlon et al 2009 chloride peaks for epc 1 and epc 5 are at 2 m and 9 m respectively fig 4 supplementary table 9 it is noted that another slight increase in chloride concentrations are observed at 5 m depth in epc 5 but the peak concentration at 9 m is almost twice the value observed at 5 m depth with a nearly continuous increase in concentrations from 4 m to 9 m thus using the peak observed at 9 m in the post hydroperiod core epc 5 the single inundation flushing event resulted in a chloride displacement of 7 m 7000 mm after only 1 17 years with a depth weighted average θvfield of 0 28 measured between 2 and 9 m in epc 5 the fluid flux is calculated across this 1 17 year interval as 1 700 mm yr 0 28 7000 mm 1 17 yr however assuming a three year gap between inundation events rather than 1 17 yr and the formation of a chloride peak at 2 m depth base of the root zone during the dry period the fluid flux is more likely slower at around 650 mm yr 0 28 7000 mm 3 00 yr the displacement of the chloride peak illustrates the importance of hydroperiods in driving the sporadic nature of infiltration and recharge in playas the chloride peak displacement fluid flux values table 2 provide an upper bound to fluid flux rate and could be used with studies of hydroperiod frequency and duration to better estimate long term recharge through the playas 4 3 4 chloride mass balance chloride mass balance fluid flux rates calculated through the vadose zone beneath the interplaya and playa are constrained using different chloride input functions wet and dry deposition only for the interplaya and wet and dry deposition plus runon r for the playa in the interplaya the only input of chloride to the system is via wet and dry deposition giving depth weighted flux rates of 3 mm yr average depth weighted fluid fluxes through the cored section and calculated for the playa at r of 5 10 and 20 of annual precipitation range from 19 to 37 mm yr 31 to 58 mm yr and 54 to 100 mm yr respectively fig 6 a supplementary table 15 the lowest fluid fluxes are observed in epc 5 cored after the hydroperiod with similar values in epc 1 and slightly higher values in epc 2 both cored before the hydroperiod fluid flux under the interplaya is considerably slower at 3 mm yr fig 6a supplementary table 15 a range of travel times to the water table are determined beneath the playa and interplaya based on chloride concentrations fig 6b table 2 supplementary table 16 depending on subsurface flux which is dependent on chloride deposition assumptions beneath the playa estimates range from 7 to 120 years compared with 5 400 years beneath the interplaya as travel time estimates are heavily reliant on the fluid flux estimate it is not surprising that the travel times are similarly one to three orders of magnitude faster beneath the playa than the interplaya with fastest movement beneath the playa during the hydroperiod this result is similar to observations in the southern high plains where recharge rates were between one and two orders of magnitude higher beneath playa compared with interplaya locations gurdak and roe 2010 4 3 5 36cl the 36cl data can help constrain the flux and travel time estimates the value of 36cl cl in precipitation in this part of kansas is 700 10 15 davis et al 2003 phillips 2000 higher 36cl cl values at 2 0 m and 3 5 m depth in the interplaya and playa cores 1114 10 15 and 927 10 15 see fig 5 and supplementary table 13 are thus evidence of contributions from bomb pulse 36cl the high chloride concentrations relative to 36cl cl in the interplaya core at this depth are indicative of chloride concentration due to evapotranspiration the next three deeper samples 3 0 m to 9 0 m in interplaya core have a consistent 36cl cl value near the expected value for precipitation indicating travel times in excess of 60 years for fluid travel to these depths thus beneath the interplaya the 36cl data indicate modern water has only infiltrated to depths 3 m samples for 36cl are not available for the playa core until just above the water table thus it can only be concluded that modern water has infiltrated to at least 3 5 m depth in the playa the deepest samples from each core may reflect influence with groundwater the deepest sample from beneath the interplaya in particular indicates contributions of pre bomb pulse 36cl that is considerably older than observed in other samples at the site as bomb pulse 36cl has traveled deeper beneath the playa even if the precise depth has yet to be determined it has traveled further than beneath the interplaya providing evidence of faster flow beneath the playa than the interplaya however using the data available assuming a 1957 peak for atmospheric 36cl synal et al 1990 and given the depths peak 36cl is observed in the interplaya and playa thus fluid fluxes of 33 mm yr 2 m 60 yr and greater than 58 mm yr 3 5 m 60 yr respectively can be estimated table 2 this would suggest travel times considering a runoff value of greater than 10 might be appropriate for the playa however additional measurements are needed particularly from beneath the playa to further evaluate the travel time estimates 4 3 6 comparison of fluxes the various methods employed to determine fluid flux rates result in a very large range in possible fluid fluxes table 2 this is due in part to assumptions and limitations within the different methods as well as the differing time scales over which the estimates are calculated the wetting front advance 2 900 192 000 mm yr and the chloride peak displacement 650 1 700 mm yr estimates represent changes as a direct result of the hydroperiod and generally ignore dry periods dry periods are inherently a part of the estimates provided by chloride mass balance and 36cl as these estimates integrate flux estimates over longer time periods although the chloride peak displacement method is an estimate across the hydroperiod because the core was not sampled directly prior to and immediately after the hydroperiod it does incorporate some of the dry period this may explain why the flux estimate from this method is lower than estimates from the wetting front advance the longer term estimates calculated by 36cl and cmb are generally in good agreement with each other but both calculations are reliant upon chloride transport and may not fully incorporate macropore flow e g wood et al 1997 it seems likely the peak 36cl activity was not captured in either the playa or interplaya likely it was shallower than 2 m in the interplaya and deeper than 3 5 m in the playa thus 36cl fluid flux estimates in the playa and interplaya are minimum and maximum values respectively finally the back of the envelope calculation is a highly simplified estimate assuming saturated conditions and should be considered as the peak infiltration rate realistically possible estimates of fluid flux from the playa studied here also compare well with data collected elsewhere in the high plains the one to three order of magnitude increase in fluid flux from the interplaya to the playa is similar to results from studies in the shp where playa fluid fluxes range from 24 to 610 mm yr with interplaya fluid fluxes from 0 1 to 32 mm yr gurdak et al 2007 gurdak and roe 2009 mcmahon et al 2006 meixner et al 2016 scanlon and goldsmith 1997 wood and sanford 1995 for this study at r 20 of precipitation recharge values are within the range of those observed beneath irrigated fields 39 to 138 mm yr elsewhere in the high plains e g katz et al 2016 mcmahon et al 2006 a previous study indicated cmb estimates in several playas 22 to 34 mm yr only measured the interstitial fluid flux and did not account for macropore flow accounting for macropore flow increased total fluid flux estimates considerably to 750 to 2 720 mm yr wood et al 1997 similar high inundation infiltration rates were measured in the shp through playas located in grassland 320 to 1 700 mm yr and cropland 730 to 7 200 mm yr watersheds ganesan et al 2016 the playa fluid flux estimates obtained here by the chloride peak displacement method 650 1700 mm yr compare well with the higher values from those previous studies and could reflect faster fluid movement through the macropores which were visible on the playa before and after the hydroperiod the disagreement over whether or not the cmb method represents the total system recharge matrix flux and macropore flux in areas with macropore flow such as with playas or just the matrix flux has not been settled in the literature scanlon 1999 wood 1999a wood 1999b while this study does not provide a definitive fluid flux rate representative of long term conditions or address the disagreement it is clear that fluid flux rates are at least one order of magnitude higher beneath the playa than the interplaya and possibly as much as three orders of magnitude higher 4 4 hydrus 1d results from the hydrus 1d simulations intended to provide constraints on subsurface conditions during and after the hydroperiod indicate downward water movement in the upper soil during the hydroperiod fig 7 the large playa filling precipitation event occurs on day 106 of the simulations and results in saturated flow conditions at the depth of the shallowest mp sensor 120 mm for all scenarios initial mp 60 000 mm 10 000 mm and 3 300 mm saturated flow conditions are also observed at depths similar to the next deepest mp sensor 400 mm for the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions at both depths water content increases to near saturation during the precipitation events at the end of march and for the precipitation events later in april and may wetting fronts do not reach the water table in any of the three scenarios during the hydroperiod but a wetting front is observed at the water table in the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions the peak arrives a little after 10 years in the scenario with the wettest initial conditions mp 3 300 mm but the full peak is not observed within the 45 year simulation in the scenario that is slightly drier initially mp 10 000 mm within the 45 year simulation the wetting front is observed at 5 11 m 5110 mm depth but not at 7 49 m 7 490 mm for the scenario with the driest initial conditions mp 60 000 mm downward fluid movement at different initial wetting conditions is estimated fig 8 in the two scenarios with wetter initial conditions initial mp 10 000 mm and 3 300 mm initial wetting at shallow depths occurs prior to the hydroperiod during earlier precipitation events thus the data from the shallower nodes are not useful for estimating flux rates only deeper nodes are used matric potential peaks are likewise not observed in the shallowest observation nodes in the wettest initial conditions or at below 5 11 m in the scenarios which are somewhat mp 10 000 mm and significantly drier mp 60 000 mm at the start a similar but opposite issue afflicts results from the scenario with the driest initial conditions as mps are not observed to increase at depths greater than 7 49 m 7490 mm for all scenarios fluid fluxes calculated using the initial arrival of the wetting front as marked by an increase in mp are greater than those calculated using the peak and highest in shallower regions fig 8 between scenarios fluid fluxes are greatest at wetter initial conditions and least with the driest initial conditions fluid fluxes range between 80 mm yr driest initial conditions peak arrival and 10 600 mm yr wettest initial conditions peak arrival regardless of the method used to calculate fluid flux the results illustrate the importance of antecedent moisture conditions on recharge beneath the playa higher initial moisture conditions result in higher fluid fluxes and shorter time of travel 5 summary and conclusions one hydroperiod was observed during the study in april and may of 2017 following a single day high intensity 80 mm rainfall event the hydroperiod lasted somewhere between 34 and 43 days 0 09 0 12 yr with a maximum water depth of approximately 340 mm after inundation near surface matric potentials were above field capacity from surface to the deepest sensor location 1 520 mm below the ground surface small increases in groundwater level are observed down gradient from the playa and possibly beneath the playa as well but changes to the barometric response in the aquifer beneath the playa complicate interpretations with the sensors used in the study surface infiltration rates are similar between the playa and interplaya when physical data are combined with geochemical data it seems possible from groundwater level data that the short hydroperiod did result in recharge to the aquifer although most of the methods suggested slower travel times it seems likely drainage did occur to at least 9 m as observed from changes in chloride concentrations other precipitation events did not result in ponding during the study period the intensity of the storm appears to be a significant factor in ponding although timing of the event relative to the growing season likely is also a factor while simulations with hydrus 1d suggest antecedent moisture conditions beneath the playa are an important factor in fluid flux and deep drainage high antecedent moisture did not appear to promote ponding during a lower intensity event with a higher rain total spread over a longer time period it is likely that high antecedent moisture conditions will also limit macropore flow there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting fluid flux through the playa is greater than through the interplaya all anion concentrations have a higher maximum in the interplaya than the playa indicating fluid flux through the playa is higher with longer ion residence times beneath the interplaya gravimetric water content is higher in the playa core collected after they hydroperiod than cores obtained from the playa pre hydroperiod demonstrating water movement through the profile between 2016 and 2017 resulting from the hydroperiod before the hydroperiod dissolved solutes were concentrated at 2 m depth beneath the playa and assumed at a similar depth beneath the interplaya after the hydroperiod solutes remain at 2 m depth beneath the interplaya but are flushed beyond the root zone to a depth of at least 9 m calculations of infiltration rate and fluid flux beneath the playa are fastest from physical measurements infiltrometer and matric potential 2 900 to 192 000 mm yr chemistry based fluid flux calculations provide a more constrained range beneath the playa between 19 and 1 700 mm yr additional uncertainty in the chloride mass balance estimate results from the unknown amount of runoff from the surrounding watershed increasing runoff estimates from 5 to 20 of annual precipitation increases the fluid flux estimate by a factor of almost 10 although travel times increase by a smaller amount beneath the interplaya fluid flux rates of only 3 mm yr are observed fluid fluxes from both the interplaya and playa are consistent with studies elsewhere in the high plains region in summary physical and chemical data both indicate recharge is greater beneath ehmke playa than the nearby interplaya by several orders of magnitude continued long term study will help identify the frequency of inundation events and the types of events which can individually push water to the water table despite this it is clear that with faster fluid flux rates and water infiltrating past the root zone intact playas provide significantly greater recharge than nearby rangeland interplaya at the very least recharge rates beneath the ehmke playa are also equal to those beneath irrigated cropland above the hpa in kansas but are likely greater these data confirm that the ehmke playa and likely other kansas playas behave similarly to the better studied playa systems on the shp of texas this conclusion should be confirmed through the study of playas of varying sizes in kansas and also in areas where the depth to water has increased significantly due to pumping declaration of competing interest the

3009,implementation of numerous ecological restoration programs over the last two decades has significantly increased vegetation coverage in china however the response of the coupled carbon and water cycles to the large scale vegetation restoration and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of regional gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue in china using the two leaf light use efficiency tl lue and the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl models during the 2000 2017 period the influencing mechanisms of anthropogenic re vegetation and climatic factors on regional wue were also analyzed results indicate that 1 both the gpp and wue showed a significant increasing tendency with inter annual change rates of 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 and 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively while the inter annual change rate of annual et was 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 2 spatially the regional gpp

much more than the climatic factors over during the study period at the regional scale human driven vegetation greening also dominated the increasing wue at regional scale these findings provide important information to support large scale ecological restoration policy decision making to improve ecosystem services in china keywords water use efficiency wue gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et vegetation restoration projects climatic factors data availability i have shared the link to my data at the at manuscript 1 introduction vegetation restoration an effective intervention to combat environmental crises and facilitate sustainability has been widely practiced around the world benayas et al 2009 since 1980s chinese government has implemented a variety of vegetation restoration programs zhang et al 2018 including the world s largest vegetation restoration project named grain for green program gfgp which spanned across 25 provinces in china chen et al 2015 liang et al 2018 subsequently a series of multi provincial and national ecological restoration projects have also been conducted robinson et al 2017 to date these programs have improved ecosystem services remarkably and vegetation coverage in china has increased by more than 25 over past two decades shi et al 2020a meantime the trade off between carbon sequestration and water loss ware altered virtually along with vegetation restoration lan et al 2021 water use efficiency wue an important integrated physiological variable that is expressed as the relationship between carbon gain and water loss plays crucial roles in linking the carbon and water cycles in the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration beer et al 2009 keenan et al 2013 yu et al 2008 at the ecosystem scale wue is usually estimated as the ratio of gross primary production gpp and evapotranspiration et to quantify the amount of water that an ecosystem used relative to the obtained carbon huang et al 2015 therefore monitoring the variation of wue provides a comprehensive understanding of the changes in ecosystem carbon and water and aids science based regional vegetation restoration projects recently with the rapid development of remote sensing technology various remote sensing based models provide an effective way to monitor the carbon and water fluxes at regional and global scales kulmala et al 2014 tian et al 2020 for example the light use efficiency lue model haxeltine et al 1996 was widely used to simulate gpp which was based on the plant biophysical process of the light absorption and conversion gitelson and gamon 2015 in addition the lue model was so called as the big leaf model because it assumed that the absorption radiation pattern of direct and diffuse was the same at the leaf scale goetz and prince 1999 however the distribution of absorbed irradiance tends to be variable due to the complexity of the canopy structure sprintsin et al 2012 to remedy the weakness of the big leaf lue model he et al 2013 developed the two leaf light use efficiency model tl lue by separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaves and taking the effect of diffuse radiation into consideration for et due to the inaccessibility and sensitivity of the parameters the application of these models were complex such as the surface energy balance model sebs su 2002 and the penman monteith methods pm monteith 1973 owing to the lower dependence on observed variables and plant transpiration niu et al 2019 the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl shows the relative good performance in most ecosystem types fisher et al 2008 ren et al 2019 therefore the tl lue and pt jpl have the advantages with the more solid physical foundation few data inputs and a high efficiency model structure and have been widely used to estimate gpp and et further providing data basis for regional wue simulation research feng et al 2010 shi et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 previous research showed that the factors influencing the wue variation mainly included climate factors temperature tem precipitation pre solar radiation rad surface wind speed sws and biological factors leaf area index lai canopy conductance tree community structure at a regional scale zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 due to the combined influence by topography and plant types the effects of climatic factors on wue have obvious spatial heterogeneity in general it can be roughly summarized that the tem shows significant and positive effect on wue in high latitudes and negative effect across wet prone area which is caused by the faster increase of gpp compared to et huang et al 2015 li and qu 2018 on the contrary pre was negatively correlated with wue in most parts of the high latitudes and water surplus area and showed positive effect on wue in the water deficit area nemani et al 2003 niu et al 2011 sun et al 2016 in addition the relationship between wue and water availability varied over time with increasing wue during drought and decreasing wue in wet years campos et al 2013 rad had an obvious latitudinal and zonal effect on wue as rad increased especially in mid and low latitudes the increase of et more than the increase of gpp could result in the decrease of wue however in relatively high latitudes the increase of gpp than et eventually led to an enhanced wue the influence of sws on wue was lack of regular understanding in the cold climate zone and wetland areas hao et al 2022 found that sws generated strong positive correlation with et and liu et al 2021 also suggested that the increase of sws promoted the rise of et and gpp in tibetan plateau for biological factors puma et al 2013 and li et al 2018 indicated that the increased lai could facilitate the absorbance of photosynthetically active radiation thus resulting in a positive effect on gpp and an increased wue especially in the biomes with a low to moderate lai while in biomes with the higher lai the positive effect will be weakened by the canopy self shading of leaves and even generating a negative influence on gpp and the decreased wue in addition liu et al 2020 revealed that lai was positively correlated with wue mainly in dryland regions and negative correlations were observed in rainforests although a large number of studies have been done to reveal the positive or negative effects of influencing factors on wue the degree of influencing factors on wue has rarely been considered besides human activity also have effects on wue guo et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the human activities influenced wue from the following two aspects on one hand it directly and mainly affected wue by changing the composition and cover of vegetation involved in transpiration and photosynthesis on the other hand it showed indirect effects on photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance of plants by increasing concentration of carbon dioxide through greenhouse gas emissions wang et al 2020 therefore the impact of human activities on wue can be effectively quantified by separating the impacts of climate factors and human activities on vegetation change however distinguishing the influence of human activities and climatic factors on vegetation was always a challenge in the field of remote sensing and ecological researches zhang and ye 2021 several methods have been developed in which the manipulative experiment method mainly depends on the observation experiments li et al 2017 the traditional statistical analyses dependsonexperiential equations liu et al 2019 and residual method depends on the regression equation established between vegetation and climate cai et al 2015 as a modelling approach based on remote sensing datasets the residual method assumed that vegetation variation was only affected by climate that was according to the principle of multiple linear regression and significance tests to simulate the variation of vegetation driven by climate jiang et al 2020 although this method was not perfect it could reveal the impacts of climatic factors and human activities on vegetation change to a certain extent on the premise that human activities are difficult to be accurately quantified qi et al 2019 xue et al 2018 therefore the residual method has been widely used to separate the impacts of climate and anthropogenic activities in recent decades china s ecological environment has changed significantly due to climate change and vegetation restoration driven by human activities previous studies aimed to reveal the spatiotemporal variation impact relationship and regional differences of the wue variation along with vegetation factors daeun et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 however the mechanisms of the ecosystem restoration effects on wue are still unclear at the national scale therefore it is urgent to clarify and highlight the importance of anthropogenic vegetation modification on wue across china this study aims to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the wue in china and to reveal the mechanisms of anthropogenic modified vegetation activities and hydro meteorological factors on the wue through gpp and et the objectives are to 1 analyze the variations of the gpp et and wue across china 2 identify the wue variation patterns driven by the gpp and et 3 and reveal the mechanisms of climatic and anthropogenic modified vegetation factors on wue findings from this research can help us to better understand the response and adaptation of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and support ecological restoration and ecosystem services 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources multiple datasets including remote sensing and meteorological data were used to drive the tl lue and pt jpl models in the study meteorological data including tem pre rad sws pressure pres and specific humidity shum were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd https www tpdc ac cn zh hans data the cmfd provides nationwide meteorological data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 and a temporal resolution of 3 h from 1979 to 2018 which is widely used in model driven and data analytical researches yang and he 2019 the remote sensing datasets including leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo were from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms dataset obtained from the national earth system science data center website https www geodata cn thematicview glass html the gimms dataset spanned 16 days with a 0 05 spatial resolution from 2000 to 2017 since 2000 the gimms products have been derived from the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer dataset monthly ndvi and lai were calculated using the maximum value composite mvc method sun et al 2013 monthly albedo in our study used blue sky albedo which was calculated based on the white sky and black sky albedo in the visible band cao et al 2016 furthermore the yearly land cover type data that spanned from 2001 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the modis product named as mcd12q1 https lpdaac usgs gov products mcd12q1v006 the mcd12q1 classes were defined based on the international geosphere biosphere project igbp land cover system mainly including 17 land use types therefore owing to the lack of model parameters the land cover types of water urban and built up snow and ice and barren land were not used in the calculations in the model notably since the coverage time of land use dataset was from 2001 to 2017 in order to make up for the vacancy data of 2000 the land use cover data in 2001 were used to replace those in 2000 in addition china s administrative boundary was obtained from the resources and environmental sciences and data center https www resdc cn eddy covariance ec data including net ecosystem exchange nee and latent heat le data were obtained from chinaflux in the national science and technology infrastructure https www cnern org cn index jsp and the observation period was from 2003 2004 to 2010 in different sites and in our study the observation period from 2004 to 2010 of the seven selected flux sites was used to calibrate and optimize the model performance the seven flux sites covered major land cover types in china including forests grasslands shrublands and croplands and the details of the selected flux sites were shown in table 1 the monthly gpp and et data were obtained by summing the daily gpp and et data by the lloyd and taylor method and proportionality parameter respectively velpuri et al 2013 yang et al 2019 considering the consistency of grid scale for model operation and dataset period the remote sensing dataset and gridded meteorological dataset were resampled to 0 1 using the bilinear interpolation method in arcgis10 3 and the study period was selected during 2000 2017 in addition due to the sparse vegetation distribute in desert area we only regard the chinese mainland non desert area as the research area fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 tl lue model a two leaf light use efficiency model tl lue developed by he et al 2013 which separated the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups was

previous studies have shown that ε msu and ε msh of the tl lue model zhou et al 2016 and b1 and b2 of the pt jpl model are the most sensitive variables across various ecosystems peters et al 2018 based on the in situ observation datasets in each station the parameters of the models were optimized to improve the simulation accuracy and the optimized model parameters were shown in table 2 in this study three indexes including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency model nse were used to validate the model values calculated by the tl lue and pt jpl models sowah et al 2020 the r2 is the most frequently used measurement of goodness of fit for linear regression models the closer the r2 value approaches to 1 the better the fitting degree of the model piepho 2019 the nse normalizes model performance into a single number to explain the similarity between observed and simulated values and can also be understood as a comparative performance of a model with a baseline model zeybek 2018 in addition the rmse has been as a standard metric to measure the deviation between the observed value and the simulated value in the field of meteorology hydrological and climate research studies chai and draxler 2014 generally the r2 nse and rmse were widely used in measuring model performance in field of geosciences foolad et al 2017 sun et al 2022 then the r2 nse and rmse are defined as 23 r 2 i 1 t x i obs x i obs x i sim x i sim i 1 t x i obs x i obs 2 i 1 t x i sim x i sim 2 2 24 nse 1 i 1 t x i obs x i sim 2 i 1 t x i obs x i obs

values and t is the sample size 2 2 4 statistical analysis the linear regression analysis method was used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of wue that was the regression equation was established through the signal data of time series and the trend coefficients calculated by a significance test p 0 05 were the trend values xu et al 2020 26 slope n t 1 n t x t t 1 n t t 1 n x t n t 1 n t 2 t 1 n t 2 where was the sample xt was the data sample in year t and n was the sample size slope was the trend of n years when slope greater than 0 it presented an increasing trend and when slope 0 it represented a declining trend according to the trend analysis the significant trend values of the gpp et and wue were divided into two categories namely increased and decreased furthermore through superimposing the reclassification results of the gpp et and wue the wue variation trends were further classified into eight subtypes including iii increased gpp increased et and increased wue iid increased gpp increased et and decreased wue idi increased gpp decreased et and increased wue idd increased gpp decreased et and decreased wue did decreased gpp increased et and decreased wue dii decreased gpp increased et and increased wue ddi decreased gpp decreased et and increased wue and ddd decreased gpp decreased et and decreased wue types zou et al 2020 to quantify the impact of vegetation variation driven by anthropogenic on wue the residual trend method was adopted in this study to separate the effects of climate and human activities radda et al 2021 consequently the vegetation factors of the lai were divided into three parts according to its dominant factors laic induced by the climatic factors tem pre rad and sws laih induced by human activities and laiu induced by the hidden or unknown environmental factors however the laiu was not considered in this study due to its negligible influence on lai shi et al 2020b thus the climatic factors were removed and the influence factors induced by human activities were retained laih lai laic peng et al 2021 in addition partial correlation analysis was used to describe the relationship between the gpp et wue with climatic and vegetation factors a et al 2016 among which positive or negative correlation values indicated the positive or negative effects on the gpp et and wue respectively furthermore the lindeman merenda gold lmg method was applied to evaluate the contribution of the climatic and vegetation factors to the gpp and et as well as the gpp and et to the wue tang et al 2020 based on the lmg method the relaimpo package in r was used to calculate the average r2 of each variable at all possible orderings in the multivariate regression model to determine the contribution of each variable to the whole moreover as the most recommended method of relaimpo package the lgm is calculated based on the covariance matrix which saves substantial computing time comparison to regressions method gromping 2015 considering both the direct and indirect effects of independent variables to dependent variables the larger r2 value meant the greater influence of the factors charles et al 2014 the function of lmg can be written as follows gromping 2006 27 l m g x k 1 n r p r e m u t a t i o n s e q r 2 x k r in model n is the factorial of the number of variables the variables are arranged in order of χ 1 χ p and is denoted by the tuple of indices r r 1 r p r 2 is the goodness of regression model seq r 2 χ k r is the increase of r 2 when adding the variable χ k into the model by the order r through coupling the results of the partial correlation and contribution rate the positive and negative effects of the contribution rate of the climatic and vegetation factors at the grid scale were further obtained 3 results 3 1 validation of the simulated gpp and et the simulated gpp and et values by the tl lue and pt jpl models were validated against the observed eddy covariance data from seven in situ flux observation sites and 84 monthly flux towers fig 2 verification results revealed that both the model of tl lue and pt jpl have good performance to simulate gpp and et for instance the simulated monthly gpp using the tl lue model was 36 15 g c m 2 month 1 with the r2 value of 0 89 and the nse of 1 compared with the observed gpp in individual vegetation types the rmse and r2 value among the three forest sites cbs qyz and dhs were 31 63 g c m 2 month 1 and 0 88 respectively and the cbs site had the best simulation effects at the two grassland sites nmg and dx the simulated rmse was 16 63 g c m 2 month 1 with the r2 value of 0 86 in addition both shrublands hbgc and croplands yc also presented good performance in the simulation furthermore in contrast to the observed et the pt jpl model showed a good simulation ability and the rmse r2 and nse were 20 43 kg h2o m 2 month 1 0 73 and 0 66 respectively fig 2 among the four land cover types shrublands showed the best performance rmse 12 60 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 91 and nse 0 88 followed by the forest and grasslands sites with the separate rmse of 20 05 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 80 and nse 0 59 and 20 92 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 63 and nse 0 68 and the croplands site presented the worst simulation whose rmse was 26 13 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 67 and nse 0 56 in addition the simulated and observed values of wue were further compared although the accuracy of wue was not as good as that of gpp and et due to the cumulative errors of gpp and et wue still presented a good consistency r2 0 61 and nse 0 61 rmse 0 58 g c m 2 month 1 except for 2006 and 2009 fig 3 generally all of the three evaluating indicators confirmed that the simulated results of the tl lue and pt jpl models showed good agreement with the observed measurements of the flux sites and supported the further analysis of this study 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of the gpp et and wue fig 4 demonstrated that the spatial and temporal distributions of the annual gpp et and wue had obvious changes at the national scale during the 2000 2017 period according to the trend analysis both the gpp and wue showed a significant upward tendency p 0 05 the annual gpp had the fastest growth rates up to 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 during study period and gpp increased more than 200 g c m 2 the annual wue increased by 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 nevertheless compared with the gpp and wue the annual et fluctuated with a rate of 280 11 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 with the peak value occurring in 2016 503 15 kg h2o m 2 and the lowest in 2008 447 27 kg h2o m 2 and the interannual change rate was approximately 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 spatially the annual gpp et and wue presented regional differences and areas with sharply increasing values were concentrated in the middle of the study region for the gpp approximately 83 22 of the study area showed significant changes p 0 05 where 69 80 displayed a visible increasing tendency 15 31 g c m 2 yr 1 especially on the loess plateau and 13 42 showed the opposite trend 12 37 g c m 2 yr 1 scattering throughout the entire region in terms of the et more than 75 23 of the entire area demonstrated significant changes where an upward tendency occupied over 49 71 of the area mainly located in northwestern central and southwestern china and a downward trend appeared in the western part of the study area 25 52 such as on the tibetan plateau the wue had the same spatial patterns as the gpp especially on the loess plateau with an increasing rate of more than 0 5c kg 2 h2o yr 1 in contrast especially in southern china the wue generally presented a decreasing trend based on the significance test more than 52 03 of the study area had significant variation in the gpp et and wue according to the classification patterns the areas of the significant variation were reclassified into six types out of the eight categories shown in the study area idd and dii were not found in the study area fig 4d in general the areas with the increased wue driven by the gpp accounted for 74 26 of the entire significant region including types iii and idi type iii occupied more than 40 38 of significant region mainly distributed in the northeastern and central parts of the study area the type idi occupied 33 87 of the significant region mainly concentrated in the northern region of the inner mongolia plateau and middle eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau on the other hand the regions with the decreased wue caused by the increased et including iid and did types accounted for approximately 20 80 of the significant region and were more common in southern china furthermore the wue variation caused by the mutually decreased gpp and et e g ddi and ddd occupied about 10 66 of the significantly regions 3 3 effects of climate and vegetation on the gpp et and wue trends 3 3 1 variation characteristics of the climatic factors according to the linear trend analysis the spatial temporal variation trends of the annual tem pre rad and sws for the 2000 2017 period across china were shown in fig 5 generally the tem pre and sws gradually increased in the entire terrestrial area of china with annual variation rates of 0 03 yr 1 2 29 mm yr 1 and 0 03 m s 1 yr 1 respectively fig 5a b and d however rad showed an obvious decreasing tendency and the annual variation rate was 3 54 mj m 2 yr 1 fig 5c in addition among the six classified types the variation rate of each climatic factors was significantly different from each other fig 5 in terms of tem all types except the iid type had an upward rate especially in the idi type which showed the fastest increasing rate with an annual variation rate of 0 06 yr 1 almost twice that of the iii type fig 5a for pre the increasing rates for the six types were all higher than the national average the iid type reached the highest value and the iii type was 1 72 times more than the idi type for rad in addition to the did and iid types these types showed a declined tendency and the ddi and iid types had the highest and lowest variation rates respectively for sws except for the ddd type the variation rates of the other five types were higher than 0 01 m s 1 yr 1 3 3 2 variation characteristics of the vegetation during 2000 2017 the actual lai and climate driven laic in the study area presented a significantly increasing trend with a trend of 0 01 m3 m3 yr 1 p 0 001 fig 6 in addition the average change rate of laih driven by human activities was 0 02 m3 m3 yr 1 p 0 001 with an increasing tendency from negative to positive at a turning point in 2008 fig 6b spatially laih generally increased from the northwest to southeast fig 6c among the six types the iii and iid types had the highest increase rate of approximately 0 02 m3 m3 yr 1 while the ddd and did types showed a decreasing trend with variation rates of 0 01 m3 m3 yr 1 and 0 001 m3 m3 yr 1 respectively fig 6d 3 3 3 partial correlation of climate and vegetation factors with gpp et and wue the correlations between the gpp et and wue with climatic tem pre rad and sws and vegetation factors laih were shown in fig 7 the results showed that laih had a stronger correlation than the climatic factors with the gpp and wue over the 18 year s research period and more than 92 61 and 86 47 of the study area presented a positive correlation with a strong correlation value of more than 0 8 which were mostly distributed in the northeastern and central parts of china in addition the et was positively correlated with the laih in 51 84 of the study area which were mainly distributed in northern and northeastern china and the et was negatively correlated with laih in only 14 11 of the study area in addition the influence of the climatic factors on the gpp et and wue displayed obvious zonal distribution patterns fig 7 in terms of the gpp approximately 61 89 of the study area presented a strong positive relationship with rad mainly located in southern china fig 7c while approximately 50 92 of the study area showed a positive correlation with tem which were mainly concentrated on the qinghai tibet plateau fig 7a and the gpp was positively correlated with pre in 41 16 of the study area largely located on the inner mongolia plateau fig 7b in light of the et the correlation with rad presented a strong positive effect in more than 79 38 of the study areas and only 4 85 of the study area showed a negative effect which was distributed in the inner mongolia plateau about half of the study area the et showed a significant positive correlation with pre and a stronger correlation region was also found in the inner mongolia plateau the wue was highly correlated with the rad and tem of which approximately 47 08 of the study area were positively correlated with the rad and 44 56 were negatively correlated with the tem in addition sws was correlated with the gpp et and wue and 30 of the regions dominated by both positive and negative effects without obvious regional pattern fig 7d n and i among the six types the gpp et and wue in type iii had the highest correlation with the laih in the ddd type laih showed a higher correlation with the gpp and wue but the lowest correlation with the et was the lowest fig 8 the did and iid types were strongly affected by rad which was positively correlated with the gpp and et and negatively correlated with the wue in the idi type both the laih and tem had strong effects on the gpp and wue while in the ddi type gpp and wue were negatively correlated with sws 3 4 contributions of climatic and vegetation factors to the wue 3 4 1 contributions of the gpp and et to the wue based on the lmg method analysis the contribution rates of the gpp and et to the wue were calculated fig 9 the results revealed a strong contribution rate of the gpp variation to the wue accounting for almost 68 48 and the contribution rate in more than 79 51 of the study area exceeded 50 among which the inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau had the highest contribution rates totally reaching more than 80 fig 9a compared with the gpp the et presented a lower coupling strength to the wue variations and the average contribution rate less than half of gpp about 31 52 a small proportion 20 of the total study area primarily located in northeastern and central china showed that et accounted for more than 50 of the contribution rate to the wue variation fig 9b 3 4 2 contributions of climatic and vegetation factors to wue the positive and negative effects of climatic and vegetation factors on wue and the influence path are shown in fig 10 in general among the five factors laih contributed the most to the wue accounting for more than 35 27 of the wue variation in the study area thereinto about 30 62 and 4 65 of the contributions were from the gpp and et driven by laih respectively rad as the second crucial factor and the most important climatic factor contributed approximately 23 24 of the wue variation of which the positive contribution was 16 53 the tem pre and sws showed broadly similar contribution rate about 15 in comparison the tem and sws performed the highest positive 6 72 and negative 5 39 contribution rate among the three factors respectively within the six subtypes the wue in types ddd did idi and iii was highly dominated by gpp variations in which except for type did laih contributed more than 30 of the positive contribution to the wue especially for type iii for types ddi and iid the contribution rates of the gpp and et to wue were approximately equal to 50 and the maximum positive contribution rate of rad to wue was more than 20 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation greenness drives the wue change in china the wue of china terrestrial ecosystems experienced a significant increase during 2000 2017 period by analyzing the effects of the gpp and et on wue variation the results showed that the gpp increased sharply and contributed more than two thirds to wue variation while et only contributed one thirds spatially over 74 26 of the study area s wue variation were mainly dominated by the increased gpp the above results indicated that wue was positively correlated with the gpp yuan et al 2020 through further examination of the influencing factors the results revealed that vegetation was the main force driving the gpp variation rather than the climate factors based on the residual method the vegetation changed by ecological restoration was quantified and results showed that the laih driven by anthropogenic activities generally presented an upward trend from negative to positive spatially the laih increased from the northwest to southeast corresponding to the transition zone of grassland to forest land in china especially in the loess plateau which were consistent with the results of wang et al 2018 and qu et al 2015 previous studies clearly stated that the alteration of lai controlled the structural components of fractional photosynthetically active radiation fpar thus altering the absorbance of photosynthetically active radiation and the partition of net radiation between zonal sensible and latent heat fluxes which in turn directly affected gpp li et al 2018 however et was affected by the combined effects of water supply atmospheric evaporation water demand and physiological properties of vegetation zeng et al 2018 although the increased lai could enhance plant transpiration due to the increased vegetation coverage it may also weaken sunlight penetration or be limited by water shortage further inhibiting plant transpiration cao et al 2020 lu et al 2017 thus in the area with low coverage vegetation mainly covered by grassland in northern china the gpp showed a higher contribution rate to the wue variation than that with higher vegetation coverage covered by forest in southern china fig 7j therefore in our study the gpp dominated by vegetation greening mainly drives the wue variation in china 4 2 driving mechanisms of variation in wue types based on the trend analysis of the gpp et and wue the study area could be classified into six sub regions and the reasons for the spatial patterns of these sub regions were further analyzed among these sub types type iii covered the largest area mainly distributed in the arid and semi arid areas such as liaohe plain and loess plateau as the core region of the gfgp both the gpp and et significantly increased due to the intensive vegetation restoration liang et al 2019 xiao 2014 xu et al 2020 which has resulted in the highest contribution rate of vegetation to the wue variation fig 10 and the fastest increase of the laih fig 6d in addition this region is also sensitive to climate change and has a high correlation with climate factors previous studies have indicated sws was the major controlling factors of et in arid and semi arid northern china and the sensitivity will decrease from arid to humid regions gao et al 2006 tabari et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 zheng and wang 2014 our results has also confirmed this view as tem increased the response of photosynthesis to tem showed a parabolic curve relationship when the tem was higher than the optimum temperature for plant photosynthesis the photosynthesis will inhibited and vegetation growth will be declined berry and bjorkman 2003 li et al 2018 therefore wue was negatively correlated with tem in some areas of type iii pre is the main source of water in arid and semi arid areas dominating the vegetation variation and the increased pre can effectively alleviate the water demand of vegetation growth and surface evapotranspiration the type idi occupied the second largest coverage area which was mainly distributed in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau in addition as the third pole of the world vegetation variation were sensitively limited by the tem variation on the qinghai tibet plateau ci et al 2018 with the implementation of the large scale ecological restoration programs and global warming tem has significantly increased in this area hence the laih together with tem contributed more to the regional gpp however due to the decreased rad and little increased pre et in this region decreased significantly further resulting in an increased wue similar findings have also confirmed this by other researchers ma et al 2017 in southern china types did together with iid contributed to 20 8 of the study area with significant variation this areas are dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate with high temperature and sufficient precipitant rad is the most important factor limiting gpp and et wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 thus the rad has strong correlation with gpp and et within the iid type the significantly increased rad and pre provided the required energy and water for the carbon water cycles the gpp and et increased significantly in this region however due to the difference in the variation rate the wue generally showed a downward trend in the did type the decreased laih explained about 28 of the decrease in gpp meanwhile the increased pre and rad promoted the increase in et thus leading to the decrease in wue 4 3 policy implications the purpose of revegetation programs is to control soil erosion improve carbon sequestration and curbe the degraded ecological environment feng et al 2016 with the implementation of ecological restoration project large areas of croplands and barelands were transformed into forestland and grasslands ecological environment has been significantly improved and on the other hand the water consumption has also increased due to the long period active transpiration periods annually and the deeper rooting depth to absorb water from the soil forest ecosystem contributed more transpiration than cropland and grassland ecosystems shao et al 2019 however water shortage is the key factor that restricts the social and economic development and ecological environment construction in more than half areas of china and the sustainability of regional ecosystems could also be of great concern yin et al 2019 according to the climate simulations pre will be increased to a certain extent in northwestern and southern china but decrease in northern china especially in arid and semi arid areas huang et al 2017 huang et al 2016 therefore in northwestern and southern china intensive cropland production developing agricultural and forest industry and optimizing the installment of the water resources should be encouraged to excavate the economic benefits of the ecological environment promoting the sustainable evolution of ecological environment nevertheless in northern china in order to crop under the climate with rare precipitation in the future it is necessary to reduce the consumption of water resources by promoting water saving irrigation systems and limiting aimlessly afforestation consequently facing the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems nature based vegetation restoration strategies with suitable and water saving local vegetation species are effective solutions to solve the current environmental problems especially in water scarce regions 4 4 uncertainties and limitations of this study in this study both the tl lue and pt jpl models were applied to calculate the gpp and et at a national scale combining the empirical approaches with remote sensing both validation data and model input data have influence on the simulation results first although the tl lue and pt jpl models were calibrated and validated using ec observations from seven in situ flux sites and 84 monthly flux towers and the simulation results were consistent with the observed data the lack of the observational data sets would affect the accuracy and may increase the uncertainty of the model simulations to some extent second par and rn played important roles in the gpp and et simulations that were calculated based on rad from the meteorological reanalysis datasets however previous studies showed that rad was often overestimated in the reanalysis process of meteorological data which leaded to the overestimation of the gpp and et in a way cai et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 finally in order to be matched with the meteorological data all input data in our study were re sampled to a 0 1 resolution nonetheless the mismatch between the spatial resolution of the input data and the footprints of the flux towers may also increase the uncertainty of the gpp and et simulation results zhou et al 2016 therefore in future studies more flux observation sites as well as high resolution and long term input data should be used to minimize the uncertainty of the gpp and et estimation 5 conclusions in this study both the tl lue and pt jpl models were applied to calculate the regional gpp et and wue ratio of the gpp to et in china during 2000 2017 and the variation and their relationships with biotic i e lai laic and laih and abiotic i e tem pre rad and sws factors were further investigated the results indicated that the gpp and wue showed a significant upward tendency interannual change rates of gpp and et were 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 and 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively and the interannual change rate of the annual et was approximately 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 p 0 124 spatially more than 79 51 of the study area showed a wue variation and the change of gpp was the leading factor in driving wue variations furthermore partial correlation analysis and the lindeman merenda gold lmg method revealed that the human dominated vegetation greening laih was the main driving factor of wue and its contribution to wue was greater than tem pre rad and sws therefore our findings suggest that the vegetation greening has resulted in an increased wue at the regional scale future ecological restoration programs must consider wue variations and nature based solutions with suitable and lower water consumption vegetation species

3009,implementation of numerous ecological restoration programs over the last two decades has significantly increased vegetation coverage in china however the response of the coupled carbon and water cycles to the large scale vegetation restoration and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of regional gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue in china using the two leaf light use efficiency tl lue and the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl models during the 2000 2017 period the influencing mechanisms of anthropogenic re vegetation and climatic factors on regional wue were also analyzed results indicate that 1 both the gpp and wue showed a significant increasing tendency with inter annual change rates of 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 and 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively while the inter annual change rate of annual et was 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 2 spatially the regional gpp dominated wue variation of more than 79 51 of the total area 3 among the influencing factors the greening of vegetation driven by human activities laih explained 35 27 of the wue variation in china much more than the climatic factors over during the study period at the regional scale human driven vegetation greening also dominated the increasing wue at regional scale these findings provide important information to support large scale ecological restoration policy decision making to improve ecosystem services in china keywords water use efficiency wue gross primary productivity gpp evapotranspiration et vegetation restoration projects climatic factors data availability i have shared the link to my data at the at manuscript 1 introduction vegetation restoration an effective intervention to combat environmental crises and facilitate sustainability has been widely practiced around the world benayas et al 2009 since 1980s chinese government has implemented a variety of vegetation restoration programs zhang et al 2018 including the world s largest vegetation restoration project named grain for green program gfgp which spanned across 25 provinces in china chen et al 2015 liang et al 2018 subsequently a series of multi provincial and national ecological restoration projects have also been conducted robinson et al 2017 to date these programs have improved ecosystem services remarkably and vegetation coverage in china has increased by more than 25 over past two decades shi et al 2020a meantime the trade off between carbon sequestration and water loss ware altered virtually along with vegetation restoration lan et al 2021 water use efficiency wue an important integrated physiological variable that is expressed as the relationship between carbon gain and water loss plays crucial roles in linking the carbon and water cycles in the processes of photosynthesis and transpiration beer et al 2009 keenan et al 2013 yu et al 2008 at the ecosystem scale wue is usually estimated as the ratio of gross primary production gpp and evapotranspiration et to quantify the amount of water that an ecosystem used relative to the obtained carbon huang et al 2015 therefore monitoring the variation of wue provides a comprehensive understanding of the changes in ecosystem carbon and water and aids science based regional vegetation restoration projects recently with the rapid development of remote sensing technology various remote sensing based models provide an effective way to monitor the carbon and water fluxes at regional and global scales kulmala et al 2014 tian et al 2020 for example the light use efficiency lue model haxeltine et al 1996 was widely used to simulate gpp which was based on the plant biophysical process of the light absorption and conversion gitelson and gamon 2015 in addition the lue model was so called as the big leaf model because it assumed that the absorption radiation pattern of direct and diffuse was the same at the leaf scale goetz and prince 1999 however the distribution of absorbed irradiance tends to be variable due to the complexity of the canopy structure sprintsin et al 2012 to remedy the weakness of the big leaf lue model he et al 2013 developed the two leaf light use efficiency model tl lue by separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaves and taking the effect of diffuse radiation into consideration for et due to the inaccessibility and sensitivity of the parameters the application of these models were complex such as the surface energy balance model sebs su 2002 and the penman monteith methods pm monteith 1973 owing to the lower dependence on observed variables and plant transpiration niu et al 2019 the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl shows the relative good performance in most ecosystem types fisher et al 2008 ren et al 2019 therefore the tl lue and pt jpl have the advantages with the more solid physical foundation few data inputs and a high efficiency model structure and have been widely used to estimate gpp and et further providing data basis for regional wue simulation research feng et al 2010 shi et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 previous research showed that the factors influencing the wue variation mainly included climate factors temperature tem precipitation pre solar radiation rad surface wind speed sws and biological factors leaf area index lai canopy conductance tree community structure at a regional scale zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 due to the combined influence by topography and plant types the effects of climatic factors on wue have obvious spatial heterogeneity in general it can be roughly summarized that the tem shows significant and positive effect on wue in high latitudes and negative effect across wet prone area which is caused by the faster increase of gpp compared to et huang et al 2015 li and qu 2018 on the contrary pre was negatively correlated with wue in most parts of the high latitudes and water surplus area and showed positive effect on wue in the water deficit area nemani et al 2003 niu et al 2011 sun et al 2016 in addition the relationship between wue and water availability varied over time with increasing wue during drought and decreasing wue in wet years campos et al 2013 rad had an obvious latitudinal and zonal effect on wue as rad increased especially in mid and low latitudes the increase of et more than the increase of gpp could result in the decrease of wue however in relatively high latitudes the increase of gpp than et eventually led to an enhanced wue the influence of sws on wue was lack of regular understanding in the cold climate zone and wetland areas hao et al 2022 found that sws generated strong positive correlation with et and liu et al 2021 also suggested that the increase of sws promoted the rise of et and gpp in tibetan plateau for biological factors puma et al 2013 and li et al 2018 indicated that the increased lai could facilitate the absorbance of photosynthetically active radiation thus resulting in a positive effect on gpp and an increased wue especially in the biomes with a low to moderate lai while in biomes with the higher lai the positive effect will be weakened by the canopy self shading of leaves and even generating a negative influence on gpp and the decreased wue in addition liu et al 2020 revealed that lai was positively correlated with wue mainly in dryland regions and negative correlations were observed in rainforests although a large number of studies have been done to reveal the positive or negative effects of influencing factors on wue the degree of influencing factors on wue has rarely been considered besides human activity also have effects on wue guo et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the human activities influenced wue from the following two aspects on one hand it directly and mainly affected wue by changing the composition and cover of vegetation involved in transpiration and photosynthesis on the other hand it showed indirect effects on photosynthesis rate and stomatal conductance of plants by increasing concentration of carbon dioxide through greenhouse gas emissions wang et al 2020 therefore the impact of human activities on wue can be effectively quantified by separating the impacts of climate factors and human activities on vegetation change however distinguishing the influence of human activities and climatic factors on vegetation was always a challenge in the field of remote sensing and ecological researches zhang and ye 2021 several methods have been developed in which the manipulative experiment method mainly depends on the observation experiments li et al 2017 the traditional statistical analyses dependsonexperiential equations liu et al 2019 and residual method depends on the regression equation established between vegetation and climate cai et al 2015 as a modelling approach based on remote sensing datasets the residual method assumed that vegetation variation was only affected by climate that was according to the principle of multiple linear regression and significance tests to simulate the variation of vegetation driven by climate jiang et al 2020 although this method was not perfect it could reveal the impacts of climatic factors and human activities on vegetation change to a certain extent on the premise that human activities are difficult to be accurately quantified qi et al 2019 xue et al 2018 therefore the residual method has been widely used to separate the impacts of climate and anthropogenic activities in recent decades china s ecological environment has changed significantly due to climate change and vegetation restoration driven by human activities previous studies aimed to reveal the spatiotemporal variation impact relationship and regional differences of the wue variation along with vegetation factors daeun et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 however the mechanisms of the ecosystem restoration effects on wue are still unclear at the national scale therefore it is urgent to clarify and highlight the importance of anthropogenic vegetation modification on wue across china this study aims to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of the wue in china and to reveal the mechanisms of anthropogenic modified vegetation activities and hydro meteorological factors on the wue through gpp and et the objectives are to 1 analyze the variations of the gpp et and wue across china 2 identify the wue variation patterns driven by the gpp and et 3 and reveal the mechanisms of climatic and anthropogenic modified vegetation factors on wue findings from this research can help us to better understand the response and adaptation of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change and support ecological restoration and ecosystem services 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources multiple datasets including remote sensing and meteorological data were used to drive the tl lue and pt jpl models in the study meteorological data including tem pre rad sws pressure pres and specific humidity shum were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd https www tpdc ac cn zh hans data the cmfd

he 2019 the remote sensing datasets including leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo were from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms dataset obtained from the national earth system science data center website https www geodata cn thematicview glass html the gimms dataset spanned 16 days with a 0 05 spatial resolution from 2000 to 2017 since 2000 the gimms products have been derived from the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer dataset monthly ndvi and lai were calculated using the maximum value composite mvc method sun et al 2013 monthly albedo in our study used blue sky albedo which was calculated based on the white sky and black sky albedo in the visible band cao et al 2016 furthermore the yearly land cover type data that spanned from 2001 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 were obtained from the modis product named as mcd12q1 https lpdaac usgs gov products mcd12q1v006 the mcd12q1 classes were defined based on the international geosphere biosphere project igbp land cover system mainly including 17 land use types therefore owing to the lack of model parameters the land cover types of water urban and built up snow and ice and barren land were not used in the calculations in the model notably since the coverage time of land use dataset was from 2001 to 2017 in order to make up for the vacancy data of 2000 the land use cover data in 2001 were used to replace those in 2000 in addition china s administrative boundary was obtained from the resources and environmental sciences and data center https www resdc cn eddy covariance ec data including net ecosystem exchange nee and latent heat le data were obtained from chinaflux in the national science and technology infrastructure https www cnern org cn index jsp and the observation period was from 2003 2004 to 2010 in different sites and in our study the observation period from 2004 to 2010 of the seven selected flux sites was used to calibrate and optimize the model performance the seven flux sites covered major land cover types in china including forests grasslands shrublands and croplands and the details of the selected flux sites were shown in table 1 the monthly gpp and et data were obtained by summing the daily gpp and et data by the lloyd and taylor method and proportionality parameter respectively velpuri et al 2013 yang et al 2019 considering the consistency of grid scale for model operation and dataset period the remote sensing dataset and gridded meteorological dataset were resampled to 0 1 using the bilinear interpolation method in arcgis10 3 and the study period was selected during 2000 2017 in addition due to the sparse vegetation distribute in desert area we only regard the chinese mainland non desert area as the research area fig 1 2 2 methods 2 2 1 tl lue model a two leaf light use efficiency model tl lue developed by he et al 2013 which separated the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups was

previous studies have shown that ε msu and ε msh of the tl lue model zhou et al 2016 and b1 and b2 of the pt jpl model are the most sensitive variables across various ecosystems peters et al 2018 based on the in situ observation datasets in each station the parameters of the models were optimized to improve the simulation accuracy and the optimized model parameters were shown in table 2 in this study three indexes including the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency model nse were used to validate the model values calculated by the tl lue and pt jpl models sowah et al 2020 the r2 is the most frequently used measurement of goodness of fit for linear regression models the closer the r2 value approaches to 1 the better the fitting degree of the model piepho 2019 the nse normalizes model performance into a single number to explain the similarity between observed and simulated values and can also be understood as a comparative performance of a model with a baseline model zeybek 2018 in addition the rmse has been as a standard metric to measure the deviation between the observed value and the simulated value in the field of meteorology hydrological and climate research studies chai and draxler 2014 generally the r2 nse and rmse were widely used in measuring model performance in field of geosciences foolad et al 2017 sun

established through the signal data of time series and the trend coefficients calculated by a significance test p 0 05 were the trend values xu et al 2020 26 slope n t 1 n t x t t 1 n t t 1 n x t n t 1 n t 2 t 1 n t 2 where was the sample xt was the data sample in year t and n was the sample size slope was the trend of n years when slope greater than 0 it presented an increasing trend and when slope 0 it represented a declining trend according to the trend analysis the significant trend values of the gpp et and wue were divided into two categories namely increased and decreased furthermore through superimposing the reclassification results of the gpp et and wue the wue variation trends were further classified into eight subtypes including iii increased gpp increased et and increased wue iid increased gpp increased et and decreased wue idi increased gpp decreased et and increased wue idd increased gpp decreased et and decreased wue did decreased gpp increased et and decreased wue dii decreased gpp increased et and increased wue ddi decreased gpp decreased et and increased wue and ddd decreased gpp decreased et and decreased wue types zou et al 2020 to quantify the impact of vegetation variation driven by anthropogenic on wue the residual trend method was adopted in this study to separate the effects of climate and human activities radda et al 2021 consequently the vegetation factors of the lai were divided into three parts according to its dominant factors laic induced by the climatic factors tem pre rad and sws laih induced by human activities and laiu induced by the hidden or unknown environmental factors however the laiu was not considered in this study due to its negligible influence on lai shi et al 2020b thus the climatic factors were removed and the influence factors induced by human activities were retained laih lai laic peng et al 2021 in addition partial correlation analysis was used to describe the relationship between the gpp et wue with climatic and vegetation factors a et al 2016 among which positive or negative correlation values indicated the positive or negative effects on the gpp et and wue respectively furthermore the lindeman merenda gold lmg method was applied to evaluate the contribution of the climatic and vegetation factors to the gpp and et as well as the gpp and et to the wue tang et al 2020 based on the lmg method the relaimpo package in r was used to calculate the average r2 of each variable at all possible orderings in the multivariate regression model to determine the contribution of each variable to the whole moreover as the most recommended method of relaimpo package the lgm is calculated based on the covariance matrix which saves substantial computing time comparison to regressions method gromping 2015 considering both the direct and indirect effects of independent variables to dependent variables the larger r2 value meant the greater influence of the factors charles et al 2014 the function of lmg can be written as follows gromping 2006 27 l m g x k 1 n r p r e m u t a t i o n s e q r 2 x k r in model n is the factorial of the number of variables the variables are arranged in order of χ 1 χ p and is denoted by the tuple of indices r r 1 r p r 2 is the goodness of regression model seq r 2 χ k r is the increase of r 2 when adding the variable χ k into the model by the order r through coupling the results of the partial correlation and contribution rate the positive and negative effects of the contribution rate of the climatic and vegetation factors at the grid scale were further obtained 3 results 3 1 validation of the simulated gpp and et the simulated gpp and et values by the tl lue and pt jpl models were validated against the observed eddy covariance data from seven in situ flux observation sites and 84 monthly flux towers fig 2 verification results revealed that both the model of tl lue and pt jpl have good performance to simulate gpp and et for instance the simulated monthly gpp using the tl lue model was 36 15 g c m 2 month 1 with the r2 value of 0 89 and the nse of 1 compared with the observed gpp in individual vegetation types the rmse and r2 value among the three forest sites cbs qyz and dhs were 31 63 g c m 2 month 1 and 0 88 respectively and the cbs site had the best simulation effects at the two grassland sites nmg and dx the simulated rmse was 16 63 g c m 2 month 1 with the r2 value of 0 86 in addition both shrublands hbgc and croplands yc also presented good performance in the simulation furthermore in contrast to the observed et the pt jpl model showed a good simulation ability and the rmse r2 and nse were 20 43 kg h2o m 2 month 1 0 73 and 0 66 respectively fig 2 among the four land cover types shrublands showed the best performance rmse 12 60 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 91 and nse 0 88 followed by the forest and grasslands sites with the separate rmse of 20 05 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 80 and nse 0 59 and 20 92 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 63 and nse 0 68 and the croplands site presented the worst simulation whose rmse was 26 13 kg h2o m 2 month 1 r2 0 67 and nse 0 56 in addition the simulated and observed values of wue were further compared although the accuracy of wue was not as good as that of gpp and et due to the cumulative errors of gpp and et wue still presented a good consistency r2 0 61 and nse 0 61 rmse 0 58 g c m 2 month 1 except for 2006 and 2009 fig 3 generally all of the three evaluating indicators confirmed that the simulated results of the tl lue and pt jpl models showed good agreement with the observed measurements of the flux sites and supported the further analysis of this study 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of the gpp et and wue fig 4 demonstrated that the spatial and temporal distributions of the annual gpp et and wue had obvious changes at the national scale during the 2000 2017 period according to the trend analysis both the gpp and wue showed a significant upward tendency p 0 05 the annual gpp had the fastest growth rates up to 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 during study period and gpp increased more than 200 g c m 2 the annual wue increased by 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 nevertheless compared with the gpp and wue the annual et fluctuated with a rate of 280 11 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 with the peak value occurring in 2016 503 15 kg h2o m 2 and the lowest in 2008 447 27 kg h2o m 2 and the interannual change rate was approximately 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 spatially the annual gpp et and wue presented regional differences and areas with sharply increasing values were concentrated in the middle of the study region for the gpp approximately 83 22 of the study area showed significant changes p 0 05 where 69 80 displayed a visible increasing tendency 15 31 g c m 2 yr 1 especially on the loess plateau and 13 42 showed the opposite trend 12 37 g c m 2 yr 1 scattering throughout the entire region in terms of the et more than 75 23 of the entire area demonstrated significant changes where an upward tendency occupied over 49 71 of the area mainly located in northwestern central and southwestern china and a downward trend appeared in the western part of the study area 25 52 such as on the tibetan plateau the wue had the same spatial patterns as the gpp especially on the loess plateau with an increasing rate of more than 0 5c kg 2 h2o yr 1 in contrast especially in southern china the wue generally presented a decreasing trend based on the significance test more than 52 03 of the study area had significant variation in the gpp et and wue according to the classification patterns the areas of the significant variation were reclassified into six types out of the eight categories shown in the study area idd and dii were not found in the study area fig 4d in general the areas with the increased wue driven by the gpp accounted for 74 26 of the entire significant region including types iii and idi type iii occupied more than 40 38 of significant region mainly distributed in the northeastern and central parts of the study area the type idi occupied 33 87 of the significant region mainly concentrated in the northern region of the inner mongolia plateau and middle eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau on the other hand the regions with the decreased wue caused by the increased et including iid and did types accounted for approximately 20 80 of the significant region and were more common in southern china furthermore the wue variation caused by the mutually decreased gpp and et e g ddi and ddd occupied about 10 66 of the significantly regions 3 3 effects of climate and vegetation on the gpp et and wue trends 3 3 1 variation characteristics of the climatic factors according to the linear trend analysis the spatial temporal variation trends of the annual tem pre rad and sws for the 2000 2017 period across china were shown in fig 5 generally the tem pre and sws gradually increased in the entire terrestrial area of china with annual variation rates of 0 03 yr 1 2 29 mm yr 1 and 0 03 m s 1 yr 1 respectively fig 5a b and d however rad showed an obvious decreasing tendency and the annual variation rate was 3 54 mj m 2 yr 1 fig 5c in addition among the six classified types the variation rate of each climatic factors was significantly different from each other fig 5 in terms of tem all types except the iid type had an upward rate especially in the idi type which showed the fastest increasing rate with an annual variation rate of 0 06 yr 1 almost twice that of the iii type fig 5a for pre the increasing rates for the six types were all higher than the national average the iid type reached the highest value and the iii type was 1 72 times more than the idi type for rad in addition to the did and iid types these types showed a declined tendency and the ddi and iid types had the highest and lowest variation rates respectively for sws except for the ddd type the variation rates of the other five types were higher than 0 01 m s 1 yr 1 3 3 2 variation characteristics of the vegetation during 2000 2017 the actual lai and climate driven laic in the study area presented a significantly increasing trend with a trend of 0 01 m3 m3 yr 1 p 0 001 fig 6 in addition the average change rate of laih driven by human activities was 0 02 m3 m3 yr 1 p 0 001 with an increasing tendency from negative to positive at a turning point in 2008 fig 6b spatially laih generally increased from the northwest to southeast fig 6c among the six types the iii and iid types had the highest increase rate of approximately 0 02 m3 m3 yr 1 while the ddd and did types showed a decreasing trend with variation rates of 0 01 m3 m3 yr 1 and 0 001 m3 m3 yr 1 respectively fig 6d 3 3 3 partial correlation of climate and vegetation factors with gpp et and wue the correlations between the gpp et and wue with climatic tem pre rad and sws and vegetation factors laih were shown in fig 7 the results showed that laih had a stronger correlation than the climatic factors with the gpp and wue over the 18 year s research period and more than 92 61 and 86 47 of the study area presented a positive correlation with a strong correlation value of more than 0 8 which were mostly distributed in the northeastern and central parts of china in addition the et was positively correlated with the laih in 51 84 of the study area which were mainly distributed in northern and northeastern china and the et was negatively correlated with laih in only 14 11 of the study area in addition the influence of the climatic factors on the gpp et and wue displayed obvious zonal distribution patterns fig 7 in terms of the gpp approximately 61 89 of the study area presented a strong positive relationship with rad mainly located in southern china fig 7c while approximately 50 92 of the study area showed a positive correlation with tem which were mainly concentrated on the qinghai tibet plateau fig 7a and the gpp was positively correlated with pre in 41 16 of the study area largely located on the inner mongolia plateau fig 7b in light of the et the correlation with rad presented a strong positive effect in more than 79 38 of the study areas and only 4 85 of the study area showed a negative effect which was distributed in the inner mongolia plateau about half of the study area the et showed a significant positive correlation with pre and a stronger correlation region was also found in the inner mongolia plateau the wue was highly correlated with the rad and tem of which approximately 47 08 of the study area were positively correlated with the rad and 44 56 were negatively correlated with the tem in addition sws was correlated with the gpp et and wue and 30 of the regions dominated by both positive and negative effects without obvious regional pattern fig 7d n and i among the six types the gpp et and wue in type iii had the highest correlation with the laih in the ddd type laih showed a higher correlation with the gpp and wue but the lowest correlation with the et was the lowest fig 8 the did and iid types were strongly affected by rad which was positively correlated with the gpp and et and negatively correlated with the wue in the idi type both the laih and tem had strong effects on the gpp and wue while in the ddi type gpp and wue were negatively correlated with sws 3 4 contributions of climatic and vegetation factors to the wue 3 4 1 contributions of the gpp and et to the wue based on the lmg method analysis the contribution rates of the gpp and et to the wue were calculated fig 9 the results revealed a strong contribution rate of the gpp variation to the wue accounting for almost 68 48 and the contribution rate in more than 79 51 of the study area exceeded 50 among which the inner mongolia plateau loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau had the highest contribution rates totally reaching more than 80 fig 9a compared with the gpp the et presented a lower coupling strength to the wue variations and the average contribution rate less than half of gpp about 31 52 a small proportion 20 of the total study area primarily located in northeastern and central china showed that et accounted for more than 50 of the contribution rate to the wue variation fig 9b 3 4 2 contributions of climatic and vegetation factors to wue the positive and negative effects of climatic and vegetation factors on wue and the influence path are shown in fig 10 in general among the five factors laih contributed the most to the wue accounting for more than 35 27 of the wue variation in the study area thereinto about 30 62 and 4 65 of the contributions were from the gpp and et driven by laih respectively rad as the second crucial factor and the most important climatic factor contributed approximately 23 24 of the wue variation of which the positive contribution was 16 53 the tem pre and sws showed broadly similar contribution rate about 15 in comparison the tem and sws performed the highest positive 6 72 and negative 5 39 contribution rate among the three factors respectively within the six subtypes the wue in types ddd did idi and iii was highly dominated by gpp variations in which except for type did laih contributed more than 30 of the positive contribution to the wue especially for type iii for types ddi and iid the contribution rates of the gpp and et to wue were approximately equal to 50 and the maximum positive contribution rate of rad to wue was more than 20 4 discussion 4 1 vegetation greenness drives the wue change in china the wue of china terrestrial ecosystems experienced a significant increase during 2000 2017 period by analyzing the effects of the gpp and et on wue variation the results showed that the gpp increased sharply and contributed more than two thirds to wue variation while et only contributed one thirds spatially over 74 26 of the study area s wue variation were mainly dominated by the increased gpp the above results indicated that wue was positively correlated with the gpp yuan et al 2020 through further examination of the influencing factors the results revealed that vegetation was the main force driving the gpp variation rather than the climate factors based on the residual method the vegetation changed by ecological restoration was quantified and results showed that the laih driven by anthropogenic activities generally presented an upward trend from negative to positive spatially the laih increased from the northwest to southeast corresponding to the transition zone of grassland to forest land in china especially in the loess plateau which were consistent with the results of wang et al 2018 and qu et al 2015 previous studies clearly stated that the alteration of lai controlled the structural components of fractional photosynthetically active radiation fpar thus altering the absorbance of photosynthetically active radiation and the partition of net radiation between zonal sensible and latent heat fluxes which in turn directly affected gpp li et al 2018 however et was affected by the combined effects of water supply atmospheric evaporation water demand and physiological properties of vegetation zeng et al 2018 although the increased lai could enhance plant transpiration due to the increased vegetation coverage it may also weaken sunlight penetration or be limited by water shortage further inhibiting plant transpiration cao et al 2020 lu et al 2017 thus in the area with low coverage vegetation mainly covered by grassland in northern china the gpp showed a higher contribution rate to the wue variation than that with higher vegetation coverage covered by forest in southern china fig 7j therefore in our study the gpp dominated by vegetation greening mainly drives the wue variation in china 4 2 driving mechanisms of variation in wue types based on the trend analysis of the gpp et and wue the study area could be classified into six sub regions and the reasons for the spatial patterns of these sub regions were further analyzed among these sub types type iii covered the largest area mainly distributed in the arid and semi arid areas such as liaohe plain and loess plateau as the core region of the gfgp both the gpp and et significantly increased due to the intensive vegetation restoration liang et al 2019 xiao 2014 xu et al 2020 which has resulted in the highest contribution rate of vegetation to the wue variation fig 10 and the fastest increase of the laih fig 6d in addition this region is also sensitive to climate change and has a high correlation with climate factors previous studies have indicated sws was the major controlling factors of et in arid and semi arid northern china and the sensitivity will decrease from arid to humid regions gao et al 2006 tabari et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 zheng and wang 2014 our results has also confirmed this view as tem increased the response of photosynthesis to tem showed a parabolic curve relationship when the tem was higher than the optimum temperature for plant photosynthesis the photosynthesis will inhibited and vegetation growth will be declined berry and bjorkman 2003 li et al 2018 therefore wue was negatively correlated with tem in some areas of type iii pre is the main source of water in arid and semi arid areas dominating the vegetation variation and the increased pre can effectively alleviate the water demand of vegetation growth and surface evapotranspiration the type idi occupied the second largest coverage area which was mainly distributed in the eastern part of the qinghai tibet plateau in addition as the third pole of the world vegetation variation were sensitively limited by the tem variation on the qinghai tibet plateau ci et al 2018 with the implementation of the large scale ecological restoration programs and global warming tem has significantly increased in this area hence the laih together with tem contributed more to the regional gpp however due to the decreased rad and little increased pre et in this region decreased significantly further resulting in an increased wue similar findings have also confirmed this by other researchers ma et al 2017 in southern china types did together with iid contributed to 20 8 of the study area with significant variation this areas are dominated by the subtropical monsoon climate with high temperature and sufficient precipitant rad is the most important factor limiting gpp and et wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 thus the rad has strong correlation with gpp and et within the iid type the significantly increased rad and pre provided the required energy and water for the carbon water cycles the gpp and et increased significantly in this region however due to the difference in the variation rate the wue generally showed a downward trend in the did type the decreased laih explained about 28 of the decrease in gpp meanwhile the increased pre and rad promoted the increase in et thus leading to the decrease in wue 4 3 policy implications the purpose of revegetation programs is to control soil erosion improve carbon sequestration and curbe the degraded ecological environment feng et al 2016 with the implementation of ecological restoration project large areas of croplands and barelands were transformed into forestland and grasslands ecological environment has been significantly improved and on the other hand the water consumption has also increased due to the long period active transpiration periods annually and the deeper rooting depth to absorb water from the soil forest ecosystem contributed more transpiration than cropland and grassland ecosystems shao et al 2019 however water shortage is the key factor that restricts the social and economic development and ecological environment construction in more than half areas of china and the sustainability of regional ecosystems could also be of great concern yin et al 2019 according to the climate simulations pre will be increased to a certain extent in northwestern and southern china but decrease in northern china especially in arid and semi arid areas huang et al 2017 huang et al 2016 therefore in northwestern and southern china intensive cropland production developing agricultural and forest industry and optimizing the installment of the water resources should be encouraged to excavate the economic benefits of the ecological environment promoting the sustainable evolution of ecological environment nevertheless in northern china in order to crop under the climate with rare precipitation in the future it is necessary to reduce the consumption of water resources by promoting water saving irrigation systems and limiting aimlessly afforestation consequently facing the sustainable development of terrestrial ecosystems nature based vegetation restoration strategies with suitable and water saving local vegetation species are effective solutions to solve the current environmental problems especially in water scarce regions 4 4 uncertainties and limitations of this study in this study both the tl lue and pt jpl models were applied to calculate the gpp and et at a national scale combining the empirical approaches with remote sensing both validation data and model input data have influence on the simulation results first although the tl lue and pt jpl models were calibrated and validated using ec observations from seven in situ flux sites and 84 monthly flux towers and the simulation results were consistent with the observed data the lack of the observational data sets would affect the accuracy and may increase the uncertainty of the model simulations to some extent second par and rn played important roles in the gpp and et simulations that were calculated based on rad from the meteorological reanalysis datasets however previous studies showed that rad was often overestimated in the reanalysis process of meteorological data which leaded to the overestimation of the gpp and et in a way cai et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 finally in order to be matched with the meteorological data all input data in our study were re sampled to a 0 1 resolution nonetheless the mismatch between the spatial resolution of the input data and the footprints of the flux towers may also increase the uncertainty of the gpp and et simulation results zhou et al 2016 therefore in future studies more flux observation sites as well as high resolution and long term input data should be used to minimize the uncertainty of the gpp and et estimation 5 conclusions in this study both the tl lue and pt jpl models were applied to calculate the regional gpp et and wue ratio of the gpp to et in china during 2000 2017 and the variation and their relationships with biotic i e lai laic and laih and abiotic i e tem pre rad and sws factors were further investigated the results indicated that the gpp and wue showed a significant upward tendency interannual change rates of gpp and et were 10 53 g c m 2 yr 1 and 0 01 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 respectively and the interannual change rate of the annual et was approximately 1 43 kg h2o m 2 yr 1 p 0 124 spatially more than 79 51 of the study area showed a wue variation and the change of gpp was the leading factor in driving wue variations furthermore partial correlation analysis and the lindeman merenda gold lmg method revealed that the human dominated vegetation greening laih was the main driving factor of wue and its contribution to wue was greater than tem pre rad and sws therefore our findings suggest that the vegetation greening has resulted in an increased wue at the regional scale future ecological restoration programs must consider wue variations and nature based solutions with suitable and lower water consumption vegetation species
