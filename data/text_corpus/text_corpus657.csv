3285,flow through porous media takes place in diverse geological settings the fluid motion through pores follows darcy s law linear rate law in many cases but at high flows the forchheimer nonlinear flow regime emerges where fluid flux and the hydraulic gradient are no longer linearly related the transition to the nonlinear flow regime has many possible causes making the prediction of its onset nearly impossible the reynolds number has been used for identifying the onset of nonlinear flow but its values span across a few orders of magnitude suggesting it might be an inappropriate or inadequate metric through the analysis and synthesis of 2852 single phase flow experiments in different porous media and supporting numerical pore scale flow simulations we observed that the critical hydraulic gradient i c which determines the onset of forchheimer flow scales with permeability k via a power law for high k media k 10 12 10 6 m2 however when k is smaller 1 10 12 1 10 18 m2 the forchheimer flow regime emerges at an i c that is orders of magnitude smaller than expected which is possibly caused by the slippery solid surfaces other flow processes such as flow separation and recirculation might explain the uncertainties in the power law relationship here and these merit future investigations keywords nonlinear flow porous media slip surface forchheimer equation darcy s law physical and numerical experimentation 1 introduction the motion of fluids in porous media is a ubiquitous phenomenon it is important for understanding natural processes and diverse engineering applications some examples include groundwater flow in aquifers the flow of magma through earth s crust air and water flow inside ice sheets and snowpacks the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from petroleum reservoirs blood flow through living tissue water uptake by plants and the design of fuel cells and diapers fan et al 2013 manga et al 2018 qin and hassanizadeh 2014 this fluid flow is normally described by the linear rate law i e darcy s law q ρgk μ i where the specific fluid flux q m s is linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient i multiplied by a proportionality coefficient representing the intrinsic permeability k m2 of the porous medium bear 1972 and the fluid properties fluid density ρ kg m3 and dynamic viscosity μ pa s g m s2 is gravitational acceleration despite its universal usage there are many situations where darcy s law does not work well when flow is relatively very slow i e i is miniscule or when flow is quite fast due to very high i bear 1972 bear and cheng 2010 many engineering applications represent and belong to high i settings some examples include a pumping and injection of fluids e g water oil and gas such as co2 into and out of subsurface reservoirs that might induce fracturing and seismicity mcgarr et al 2015 szulczewski et al 2012 b construction of dams reservoirs and deep tunnels that might trigger earthquakes kerr and stone 2010 and c the design of bed reactors for absorption and separation processes and catalytic reactions al dahhan et al 1997 in all these situations the nonlinear flow regime may prevail where q increases less than a proportional increase in i fig 1 i e forchheimer flow occurs bear 1972 knowledge of when forchheimer flow emerges is thus crucial for the success of many porous media applications and for the assessment of many engineering and natural hazards extensive research has interrogated the forchheimer flow problem experimentally and computationally over the last few decades muljadi et al 2016 sivanesapillai et al 2014 studies show that the inertial force gradually increases with i causing fluid flow to deviate from the darcy flow regime zhou et al 2019 this is because darcy s law applies only to situations where inertial effects are negligible recent discoveries regarding inertial flows inside pores have been made possible with the aid of high performance computing and high resolution imaging in particular recirculation zones within pores have been mapped and modeled chaudhary et al 2011 lee et al 2014 the expansion of these recirculation zones with increasing inertia constricts the main flow stream leading to forchheimer flow phenomena chaudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2020 furthermore it is widely acknowledged that the onset of the forchheimer flow regime depends on the geometric properties of the pores and solid surfaces that alter the flow field and inertial forces these properties include porosity tortuosity connectivity and surface roughness muljadi et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 for example extensive studies found that the onset of forchheimer flow depends on the medium s internal or microscale heterogeneity bear 1972 muljadi et al 2016 saif et al 2019 due to the complexity of and interactions between the above factors a wide broad range of critical reynolds number rec indicating the onset has been reported that is rec ranges from 0 01 to 1000 muljadi et al 2016 this suggests that the rec might be an inappropriate or incomplete metric for identifying the occurrence of forchheimer flow in this study we alternatively resort to using the critical i ic instead of rec to assess the emergence of the forchheimer flow this is advantageous because i can be easily directly measured during experiments or in field settings to our knowledge based on most previous studies focused on quantifying rec it is not clearly known what are the typical values of ic and what are the factors which determine it without the knowledge of ic or accurate prediction of rec the application of the forchheimer equation will remain circular where it is first necessary to observe forchheimer flow before the equation can actually be used for flow calculation a broad assessment of under what conditions the forchheimer flow prevails for most if not all possible situations is necessary for establishing a widely applicable predictive model our study explored whether there is such a predictive model for identifying the onset of forchheimer flow via ic 2 materials and methods previous studies have revealed that rec is related to pore scale geometric properties muljadi et al 2016 similarly we hypothesized that ic is a function of k because k strongly depends on and encapsulates the pore scale geometric properties to support our hypothesis we first theoretically derived a power law function between ic and k based on the forchheimer equation and darcy s law the power law function was further supported by analyzing thousands of single phase physical and numerical experiments more details can be found below 2 1 theoretical development of power law function between ic and k the flow transition from linear darcy to nonlinear forchheimer flow regimes fig 1 can be described by the forchheimer equation with a quadratic term forchheimer 1901 whitaker 1996 1 dp ds μ k q ρ k i q 2 where p pa is pressure s m is domain length k m2 is viscous or intrinsic permeability representing the energy dissipation by viscous force ki m is inertial permeability representing energy dissipation by inertial force μ pa s is fluid viscosity ρ kg m3 is fluid density q m s is specific fluid flux or darcy flux zhou et al 2019 many studies have proposed that the forchheimer flow regime emerges when the deviation α defined as the ratio of the nonlinear pressure drop to the overall pressure drop amounts to a specific value zeng and grigg 2006 that is α is defined as 2 α ρ k i q 2 μ k q ρ k i q 2 rearranging eq 2 gives q as 3 q α 1 α μ ρ k i k note that eq 3 requires that α 1 because the equation will be undefined otherwise furthermore α 1 also implies that k 0 following eq 2 thus while α can be any chosen value it is set as a small number here α 0 1 following zeng and grigg 2006 determining the critical hydraulic gradient ic for identifying the onset of the forchheimer flow regime implies that the q i relationship should initially follow darcy s law until the threshold is met bear 1972 that is the following equation is valid 4 q k i c ρ g k μ i c where k is hydraulic conductivity and g 9 8 m s2 is gravitational acceleration equating eq 3 to eq 4 yields an expression for ic 5 i c α 1 α μ 2 ρ 2 g k i k 2 considering that ki and k are related geertsma 1974 zhou et al 2019 here we used the power law relationship between ki and k zhou et al 2019 6 k i ω k β where ω m 1 2 β is a bounded coefficient and β is a yet to be determined exponent substitution of eq 6 into eq 5 yields 7 i c α 1 α μ 2 ρ 2 g ω k β 2 therefore ic should scale as a power law function of k if the linear and nonlinear flow regimes respectively follow darcy s law and the forchheimer equation regardless of what relatively small threshold value for the deviation from linearity is chosen i e α note that darcy s law and the forchheimer equation assume no slip zero velocity at the solid grain surfaces bear and cheng 2010 whitaker 1996 thereby the power law form of the theoretically derived predictive model for estimating ic based on k with a constant exponent β 2 is only valid for porous media with no slip solid surfaces the power law conjecture is further supported by physical and numerical experiments as explained below 2 2 compilation and analysis of 2852 suits of single phase flow experiments for calculating water equivalent ic with the objective of analyzing flow experiments transitioning from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes considering a wide range of k we searched publicly accessible literature on the movement of fluids in porous media unfortunately we found that the vast majority of experiments were done with a relatively small reynolds number re when nonlinear forchheimer flow hardly happens in total 2852 suits of single phase flow experiments were collected and used these experiments were conducted across a wide array of porous media types in natural and engineered environments including porous rocks granular materials refractory castables foams magmas basic pore geometric configurations e g cubic packed porous media gas diffusion layers geosynthetic materials screens and woodchips figs 2 and 3 all datasets with associated references are provided in data s1 s3 in the supplementary materials broadly two formats of datasets were collected from previous studies the first format directly reported the k and the ki and such datasets did not require much further analysis of the experimental results with varying fluid properties the second format reported pressure flux curves in tables or figures for curves in figures we digitalized them using getdata graph digitizer http getdata graph digitizer com index php when some datasets in figures were too dense or cluttered to be identified we obtained the data via email communication with the authors the datasets following the second format were analyzed to estimate k and ki by fitting eq 1 differing fluid types were considered in the analysis of the pressure flux curves because the compiled single phase flow experiments were conducted either using gas e g air dey et al 2013 gostick et al 2006 nitrogen li et al 2001 najmi et al 2016 helium jones 1987 oxygen pant et al 2011 2012 oil venkataraman and rao 2000 or water bordier and zimmer 2000 considering that gas is compressible and assuming that water and oil are incompressible two forms of the forchheimer equation were used to estimate k and ki 8 p in p out l μ k q ρ k i q 2 f o r i n c o m p r e s s i b l e f l u i d s p in 2 p out 2 2 p 0 l μ k q ρ k i q 2 f o r c o m p r e s s i b l e f

measured note that the compressible flow equation is modified from the incompressible counterpart to account for fluid compressibility following standard procedures american society for testing and materials international 2001 in total 96 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids for materials with k 10 12 m2 and 30 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids for materials with k 10 12 m2 figs 2 3 the rest of the experiments mostly used water except for a few that used oil as testing fluids the appropriate testing fluid density and viscosity were considered in the analysis the details of the data sources and corresponding flow experimental results i e k and ki values can be found in data s1 s3 similar to results of numerous studies sidiropoulou et al 2007 tamer et al 2016 we found that the forchheimer equation is able to robustly fit the flow nonlinearity observed in experiments for both compressible and incompressible fluids zhou et al 2019 the above mentioned procedures for calculating k ki paired values had been reported in our previous study zhou et al 2019 in total 2852 pairs of k ki were obtained data s2 the datasets of k ki were further used to estimate the water equivalent ic based on eq 5 by using physical properties of water at room temperature conditions i e ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 0 001 pa s this approach eliminates the effects of different fluid types with varying density and viscosity more importantly it makes ic comparable across a variety of porous media representing the full range of k from 10 18 to 10 6 m2 fig 3 and data s3 and allows for pressure gradient estimation based on ic 2 3 simulating single phase fluid flow in porous media for obtaining numerical model derived k ic pairs to further support the power law idea and explain the power law relationships observed in physical experiments we implemented computational fluid dynamics in porous media considering pore geometries and fluid solid boundary interactions indeed analyzing the movement of fluids through pores via numerical simulations provides opportunities to comprehensively diagnose flow fields and the factors which affect the flow this has become a common approach with the advancement of high performance computing ability and availability of numerous commercial and open source numerical modeling codes these models simulate fluid flow by numerically solving the navier stokes equations along with the continuity equation chaudhary et al 2011 singh 2020 wang et al 2020 9 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u u v w is the velocity vector we conducted pore scale simulations which directly solve eq 9 the simulations were conducted with comsol multiphysics a commercial finite element modeling software more details of the numerical simulations for identifying many potential factors i e geometric patterns solid surface boundary conditions fluid properties and compressibility on ic are discussed below the idea behind these simulations is to test some ideas for mechanistic explanation rather than specifically focus on very complex and large domains spanning hundreds to thousands of pores hence these numerical modeling exercises are on relatively simple small and simple geometric scenarios that allows for tractability and computational efficiency nonetheless a diversity of cases was considered 2 3 1 numerical simulations of diverse pore geometric patterns the pore geometry and patterns porosity and two or three dimensionality of the flow all play an important role in controlling the movement of fluids as well as the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes through porous media chaudhary et al 2013 fourar et al 2004 sivanesapillai et al 2014 to be able to produce results covering the wide range of k as observed in and represented by the experiments figs 2 3 and to capture the above mentioned factors which affect the flow fields 11 different base cases were purposely implemented although they might be not typical of real rocks fig 4 d among them cases 1 5 are synthetic 2d pore geometries which were previously employed to examine the effects of porosity and geometric patterns on k and ki zhou et al 2019 cases 6 8 are representative 2d pore networks in real rocks case 6 was extracted from the comsol multiphysics library representing a fine grained sandstone sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 resolved by an optical microscope case 7 was taken from an image of a thin section of the berea sandstone boek and venturoli 2010 case 8 is a fractional wet medium mohammadmoradi and kantzas 2016 which is posted publicly in a digital rocks repository https www digitalrocksportal org projects 70 cases 9 11 were artificially created for this study to represent a typical 3d porous media with varying degree of porosity specifically cases 9 10 represent intra pores in between spheres connected by thin vertical cylinders and case 11 represents cubic packed porous media fig 4d the length and width of the pores ranged on the order of a millimeter for the 11 base cases with grain diameter ranging from 30 μm to 200 μm table 1 however it was challenging to produce media with the same range of k represented by the physical experiments to achieve this the entire domain of a base case was uniformly shrunk or expanded as exemplified in fig 4c yielding pore networks with pore sizes representing several orders of magnitude i e from 10 nm to 1 mm and with a wide change of k ic paired values fig 4b this made the simulation results represent and match the broad spectrum of k observed in the physical experiments the numerical results of each base geometry of the 11 cases and their rescaled versions are denoted by similar shapes symbols in figs 2 3 the numerical modeling experiments with varying pore geometries described above shed light on the variations of ic by scaling k to specifically examine the degree of variations of ic for a given k we additionally designed a set of single pores fig 5 a following chaudhary et al 2013 and a set of pore networks fig 5b following zhou et al 2019 that had the same k 7 80 10 11 m2 by adjusting their domain sizes the numerical simulation results shown in fig 2c 2d 3 and 5 considered water as testing fluids with ρ 1000 kg m3 and μ 0 001 pa s note that using other fluids with the no slip boundary condition would expectedly yield the same resultant k ic pair see following section 3 3 we applied a pressure gradient across the domain fig 4a and 5 by prescribing pressures at an inlet bottom and outlet top the free tetrahedral and triangular mesh schemes were employed for 3d and 2d domains respectively in comsol where a finer mesh size was used with 2 to 4 boundary layers at the domain boundaries the mesh size was refined until the flux was insensitive to the mesh configuration the meshing strategy resulted in the models having 2 5 million elements and 70 000 elements for 3d and 2d domains respectively initially the left and right walls as well as grain surfaces were considered as no slip boundaries the p q curves were generated by gradually increasing the pressure gradient until inertial effects were non negligible and flow nonlinearity was discernible fig 4b consistent with a previous study of flow through fractures wang et al 2020 the numerical solutions strictly followed laminar flow such that turbulent effects were avoided but the flow regime still transitioned from darcy to forchheimer flow fig 4b and 6 2 3 2 using numerical simulations for diagnosing the effects of solid surface boundary conditions to unravel the flow complexity induced by the boundary condition of solid grain surfaces we directly compared results by either specifying no slip fig 6 a or slippery boundary conditions fig 6b with a slip length ls ls is a fictitious location within and across the solid boundary where velocity reaches zero fig 7 note that the fluid properties are unchanged i e water ρ and μ are used to isolate the effects of boundary conditions the inclusion of a slip boundary is a reasonable and acceptable approach for calculations with the nse for simulating water flow through porous media if the following conditions are met a the knudsen number kn is 0 001 kn 0 1 rapp 2017 and b the flow domain is far larger than the molecular diameter of water ideally at least 10 times the diameter travis et al 1997 the simulations in this study have kn 0 031 for the smallest scale cases and given that the water molecular free path is about 0 31 nm the flow channel is far larger than this it is thus reasonable to implement slip boundary conditions for the nse in our direct numerical simulations of pore scale flow the slippery effects were implemented in comsol multiphysics by using the slip velocity boundary condition with a given ls consequently the effects of ls on the emergence of forchheimer flow can be carefully scrutinized by systematically varying it from an initially miniscule value to one that significantly changes the k ic pattern dashed lines with diamonds in fig 2d and 3 convergence issues arise with the numerical simulations with slippery bc for the forchheimer flow regime when ls was too large thus we could only increase ls so much nonetheless the ratio of ls to the diameter of solid grains reasonably ranged from 0 1 to 10 for the simulations the suits of simulations with increasing ls are denoted by the enlarged size of the red symbols in fig 2d and fig 3 in fact ls can vary largely depending on many factors including wettability voronov et al 2007 surface roughness kucala et al 2017 and shear rate craig et al 2001 we did not investigate the individual contributions of the above factors to the variation of ls and their effects on fluid flow but simply used a reasonable value that lies within the range of reported values joseph and tabeling 2005 singh 2020 tretheway and meinhart 2002 2 3 3 using numerical simulations for constraining the effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility regarding the impacts of fluid type on fluid flow in porous media we diagnosed the sole effect of fluid solid interactions i e slippery boundaries on the k ic relationship as mentioned above however fluid density viscosity and compressibility are also potential impacting factors that might change the power law relationship between k ic to partly tease out these effects we further compared pore scale numerical simulation results for compressible and incompressible ideal gas flows with diverse fluid properties density and viscosity respectively and incompressible liquid fluid flows in porous media where solid surface boundary conditions were unchanged i e no slip wall was used the gas compressibility with changing density follows the ideal gas law 10 pv n r t where p is pressure v is volume n is the amount of substance t k is temperature r 8 314 j k mol is the ideal gas constant we have additionally done simulations assuming that the gas is incompressible with constant density at the room temperature and pressure for comparison purpose we used case 4 fig 4d as a representative pore geometry for demonstration for gas flow numerical simulations we considered air nitrogen helium and argon as testing fluids where initial values of gas densities and dynamic viscosities are broadly diverse and estimated at room temperature and pressure table 2 for liquid fluid flow simulations we considered water mercury and oil that cover a broad range of density and viscosity table 2 to isolate the effects of fluid properties and compressibility on the k ic relationship from that of solid fluid interactions i e slippery boundary all numerical simulations used no slip boundary conditions i e ls 0 similar to the flow simulations mentioned in section 2 3 1 we incrementally increased the pressure gradient along the vertical domain of case 4 figs 4 and 6 until inertial effects were non negligible as the nonlinear flow behavior manifested the pressure flux curves data s4 were used to obtain k and ki table 2 we further estimated ic through eq 5 based on the knowledge of k and ki where water density and viscosity were used such that ic was comparable for diverse fluids table 2 3 results and discussions of power law relationship between ic and k 3 1 experimentally derived power law function between ic and k based on the complied 2852 sets of flow experiments we find that ic fairly depends on k via the power law functions that directly supports our proposed power law function following eq 11 figs 2 3 interestingly the exponents of the power law function vary for low k and high k porous media specifically for porous media with a relatively high k spanning from 10 12 to 10 6 m2 we empirically found a predictive model where ic scales as a power law function with k black line in fig 3 which aligns with our proposed theory analysis of these low permeability materials showed that ic still scales with k following a power law but its exponent is significantly different with reduced ic values fig 3 that is the forchheimer flow regime emerges at a much lower ic than expected from the initial predictive model fig 3 when k is below 10 12 m2 note that for the low k regime k 10 12 m2 96 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids the above mentioned two scaling regimes are mathematically described by the following fitted power laws 11 l o g 10 i c 1 48 l o g 10 k 13 18 f o r 1 10 18 m 2 k 1 10 12 m 2 l o g 10 i c 1 00 l o g 10 k 8 79 f o r 1 10 12 m 2 k 1 10 5 m 2 where the cutoff between two regimes k 10 12 m2 was chosen based on visual inspection and because ls imposed negligible effects on changing the ic k trend with a further increase in k as discussed in section 3 5 there are some uncertainties for the fitted power laws which are quantified by the 95 confidence interval of ic this interval spans about four orders of magnitude when k 1 10 12 m2 and spans about two orders of magnitude when k 1 10 12 m2 fig 3 based on flow experiments since k can be easily obtained under normal pressure and temperature conditions within the darcy flow regime the eq 11 for estimating ic circumvents the difficulty of having to run precise flow experiments at high pressure conditions note that the predicted ic is readily converted to the pressure gradient by multiplying by water properties ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 0 001 pa s the simulations results were further used to develop insight on the occurrence of two scaling power law regimes and the causes of uncertainties in estimating ic via k at the mechanistic level 3 2 numerically derived power law function between ic and k with no slip boundaries we initially conducted flow simulations assuming no slip boundary conditions i e zero velocity on the solid surfaces following previous studies bear 1972 whitaker 1996 the simulations were implemented in diverse pore geometries but with a relatively high permeability k 10 12 m2 the pressure gradient flux was used to estimate ic and k fig 4a 4b where inertial effects were significant the results of these simulations in 11 geometries light blue hollow symbols in fig 2c and 3 overlapped with the experimental results further supporting the validity of power law function between ic and k however we found that the power law trend is unable to describe the low permeability media k 10 12 m2 representing materials such as tight reservoir rocks and cellular ceramics data s2 s3 where the established function based on high k regime overestimate ic for low k regime note that the results from three dimensional simulations with strong flow channeling effects were not discernibly different from 2d cases fig 2c and 3 implying that flow channeling effects on altering ic were not significant the reasons of having a different exponent for the low k regime with relatively reduced ic values remain unclear to address this question we further tested if this different ic k scaling regime for low k materials can be reproduced in flow simulations by artificially reducing the permeability of 11 geometries through geometrically shrinking the modeled domains example is demonstrated in fig 4c the results of these simulations light blue hollow symbols in fig 2c and 3 remained consistent with and continued the same power law scaling regime shown by the high permeability flow modeling and physical experiments thus there must be another reason for the lower ic beyond just a lower k we attempted to answer this question by further exploring other factors including fluids properties pore geometries and fluid solid interactions i e wettability this was achieved by numerical simulations 3 3 negligible effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility on k ic relationship numerical results we found negligible effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility on the k ic relationship based on numerical simulations table 2 and data s4 in the supplementary materials note that in these cases the change of fluid properties had nothing to do with fluid solid interactions i e wettability remained unchanged compared to the scenarios when water was used as the testing fluid k and ki hardly changed even though different fluid properties and compressibility were considered table 2 for gaseous fluids including air nitrogen helium and argon consequently ic stayed within the same order of magnitude the maximum difference in ic was 3 89 covering all gaseous and liquid fluids studied here compressible and incompressible gas flow cases had a maximum value of 1 84 difference for ic i e for nitrogen considering that our synthesis of ic based on physical experiments covers 15 orders of magnitude the comparison of ic from numerical simulations suggests that fluid properties and compressibility have some effects on the k ic relationship but in the broad scheme this effect is negligible this is somewhat surprising because we thought fluid properties might play a significant role in changing k ic relationship because 96 experiments used gaseous fluids when k 10 12 m2 and gas flow derived ic values were several orders of magnitude smaller than the power law predictions fig 3 however we found the opposite that the effects of fluid properties are negligible we cannot rule out larger effects on ic if the fluid properties are starkly different compared to cases we analyzed particularly including supercritical fluids e g supercritical co2 in any case fluid properties and compressibility cannot explain the decrease in ic in low k regime and the uncertainties in ic other potential factors are explored as shown below 3 4 diverse pore geometries explain the uncertainties in k ic relationship numerical results although a consistent power law function between ic and k with no slip boundaries was found light blue line in fig 2c and 3 focusing on individual sets of experiments or simulations showed that the power law exponents can be somewhat variable figs 2 3 note that the analysis included the series of flow simulations based on 11 cases with real and synthetic media representing a variety of flow dimensionality two dimensional 2d versus three dimensional 3d flows pore space geometric patterns and porosity fig 4 the difference in exponents might thus be due to pore geometric patterns whereas fluid viscosity density and compressibility are modest contributing factors if at all as discussed above clearly the diversity in pore geometries cannot explain the reduced ic in low k regime but it can reasonably explain the uncertainties in estimating ic with a given k particularly we found that there were up to two orders of magnitude difference in ic around the fitted power law curve based on numerical flow simulations fig 3 consistent with a previous study which analyzed a few scenarios muljadi et al 2016 to further support this argument we artificially designed numerical simulations purple squares in fig 2c and 3 in different pore geometries and pore networks with the same k fig 5 we observed that ic can change by three orders of magnitude considering different geometric patterns given the same k suggesting that pore geometric patterns can possibly contribute to the variations of ic as observed in the experiments fig 2a 2b and fig 3 which helps explain the uncertainties in any fitted power law function in other words the variations of ic can be a few orders of magnitude for the same material and permeability however the relatively reduced ic in the low k regime remains unexplained a potential explanation for this is presented below 3 5 the effects of slip walls on reducing ic in low k porous media numerical results almost all 96 of the low k experiments were done using gas as testing fluids figs 2 3 gases are normally regarded as non wetting fluids with klinkenberg slippery effects klinkenberg 1941 we thus hypothesized that the low permeability ic k scaling regime is due to slip on solid surfaces in these cases the solid surfaces should be represented with slippery boundary conditions bcs with a slip length ls at the surface sendner et al 2009 to test the hypothesis that slip along solid surfaces is responsible for the different observed ic k scaling regime in low permeability media we further conducted flow simulations which considered the solid walls as a slippery bc using the same geometric patterns fig 2d 3 and 6 the ls could be orders of magnitude larger than the pore size depending on wettability surface roughness and shear rate singh 2020 by incrementally increasing ls for a given pore geometry the ic k pair gradually deviated from the results assuming no slip bc which deviated further from the experimental results as permeability decreased to overlapping with the experiments red dashed line in fig 2d and 3 when k 10 12 m2 this observation implies two things first slip affects the onset of forchheimer flow for low permeability materials second ic appears sensitive to ls because a larger ls is necessary in order for the flow simulation results to fall within the same ic k regime as the experiments the effects of ls on reducing ic diminished for higher k cases fig 2d and 3 about 30 of the experiments with k 10 12 m2 used gas as testing fluids where slippery bc effects is supposed to be present we also applied up to a fairly large ls in the numerical flow simulations fig 3 even so the differences between cases with slippery and no slip bcs were much smaller or even negligible for the high permeability cases than those for the low permeability cases this is because in general the slip effects gradually become negligible as pore size and thus k increases when k is high and pore spaces are relatively large realistic values for ls are insufficient to have significant effects on the velocity distribution within the pores nonetheless ls can still appreciably enhance the magnitude of k and thus slip moves the ic k pair along the power law scaling regime towards the higher k zone red dashed line in fig 3 when k 10 12 m2 our simulations had trouble in solving the nse with a large ls particularly when ls is ten times larger than the diameter of solid grains the difficulty of using even larger ls partly explains why our simulation results mostly lied at the upper part of 95 uncertainty range compared with experiments fig 3 our results suggested that imposing larger ls would shift the numerical simulation results further downwards and towards the experimental k ic space that is ic depends on the degree of fluid solid surface interactions especially for the low permeable porous media fig 3 where ic might be reduced by several orders of magnitude given the same k the results presented above suggest that in addition to the pore geometric patterns the uncertainties in ic for low k porous media could be also explained by the magnitude of slip that is ls 3 6 implications and limitations of using ic for identifying the onset of forchheimer flow the reynolds number re has been used widely as a metric to identify the flow regime transition from darcy to forchheimer bear and cheng 2010 however previous research has reported a very wide range for rec 0 1 1000 suggesting that re might not be an appropriate metric to assess the onset of forchheimer flow particularly in heterogeneous porous media muljadi et al 2016 here we used and focused on ic instead of re because of two issues associated with using the re first the characteristic length applied in the calculation of the re can be ambiguous and inconsistent among previous studies this has resulted in incomparable re threshold for identifying the onset of the forchheimer flow regime muljadi et al 2016 second a pore scale re may not be directly measurable on the other hand hydraulic head or pressure gradient is easily measurable and thus commonly reported following this reasoning a model for the onset of single phase forchheimer flow based on ic could prove more broadly useful there are some uncertainties in estimating ic that can be explained by the pore geometries and the magnitude of ls there are however other unexplored flow processes that cause the uncertainties and the reduction of ic in the low k regime some flow processes might play a significant role that include but are not limited to flow separation recirculation sheltering and so on chaudhary et al 2011 qian et al 2012 these processes are not included in this study but merits future efforts for example our results with pore networks showed that the entire flow field remained almost unchanged with seemingly absent recirculation zones fig 6 which was different from studies of single pores where recirculation zones were prominently present and grew when flow transitions from darcy to forchheimer flows chaudhary et al 2011 4 potential for broader application of the forchheimer equation in porous media we have established a model which may be broadly applicable for constraining the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow the forchheimer equation with a quadratic velocity term represents the forchheimer flow regime and it is widely used for nonlinear flow calculation with non negligible inertial effects mijic et al 2014 there are at least two major obstacles to the broad application of the forchheimer equation or even a combination of darcy s law and the forchheimer equation the first is that it has been difficult to predict the flow transition this study s results partly address this first problem but with some uncertainty the second challenge had been determining a key parameter ki in the forchheimer equation which is different from the viscous intrinsic permeability k in darcy s law however a recent study showed that for geologic materials ki can also be predicted from k zhou et al 2019 but also with uncertainty the application of the forchheimer equation had been circular in the past and this has been severely limiting difficult tests had to be conducted at field sites or on samples to determine if and when a flow regime transition is to be expected the ki is also determined through such tests by fitting the forchheimer equation even in situations when such tests are feasible because of the practical difficulty of these tests spatial mapping of the relevant forchheimer flow factors and properties is simply not feasible thus the forchheimer equation has mostly been applied to situations wherein it has been established a priori that forchheimer flow is present and what the associated flow coefficients are our results break this limiting circular situation the combined ability to predict the flow regime transition ic and ki from k opens up the possibility of broad application of the forchheimer equation there are no longer any unknown parameters associated with the forchheimer equation within and acknowledging the bounds of uncertainty of our analysis due to the intricate dependence of any specific ic k pair on pore geometric patterns and slippery surfaces simple predictions and maps of k and knowledge of i can be used to map where and when flow transitions may happen in these locations or moments the appropriate equation governing flow darcy s law versus the forchheimer equation can be chosen a continuum of single phase porous media flows can possibly be modeled with only the usual knowledge of k 5 summary conclusions and recommendations we developed a power law function relating the critical hydraulic gradient ic with the intrinsic permeability k of porous media where ic indicates the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes the results of a synthesis of 2852 sets of single phase flow experiments and direct simulations in diverse pore geometries support the power law functions with some uncertainty moreover experimental results demonstrate that the exponents of the power law function vary for the high k 10 12 m2 k 10 5 m2 and low k 10 18 m2 k 10 12 m2 regimes a series of direct numerical simulations of pore scale flow further explain the observed ic k relationship we find that pore geometries with different porosity and geometric patterns can lead to variations in ic of up to three orders of magnitude for a given k moreover the reduction of ic orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the power law in low permeability media can be attributed to the effects of slippery solid surfaces thus the power law functions we determined can be used to predict ic in situations with and without slip on solid surfaces but still with modest uncertainty to reduce the uncertainty and gain further insight future studies should focus on the effects of other unresolved flow processes including flow recirculation separation and sheltering on the power law function between ic and k credit authorship contribution

3285,flow through porous media takes place in diverse geological settings the fluid motion through pores follows darcy s law linear rate law in many cases but at high flows the forchheimer nonlinear flow regime emerges where fluid flux and the hydraulic gradient are no longer linearly related the transition to the nonlinear flow regime has many possible causes making the prediction of its onset nearly impossible the reynolds number has been used for identifying the onset of nonlinear flow but its values span across a few orders of magnitude suggesting it might be an inappropriate or inadequate metric through the analysis and synthesis of 2852 single phase flow experiments in different porous media and supporting numerical pore scale flow simulations we observed that the critical hydraulic gradient i c which determines the onset of forchheimer flow scales with permeability k via a power law for high k media k 10 12 10 6 m2 however when k is smaller 1 10 12 1 10 18 m2 the forchheimer flow regime emerges at an i c that is orders of magnitude smaller than expected which is possibly caused by the slippery solid surfaces other flow processes such as flow separation and recirculation might explain the uncertainties in the power law relationship here and these merit future investigations keywords nonlinear flow porous media slip surface forchheimer equation darcy s law physical and numerical experimentation 1 introduction the motion of fluids in porous media is a ubiquitous phenomenon it is important for understanding natural processes and diverse engineering applications some examples include groundwater flow in aquifers the flow of magma through earth s crust air and water flow inside ice sheets and snowpacks the extraction of hydrocarbon resources from petroleum reservoirs blood flow through living tissue water uptake by plants and the design of fuel cells and diapers fan et al 2013 manga et al 2018 qin and hassanizadeh 2014 this fluid flow is normally described by the linear rate law i e darcy s law q ρgk μ i where the specific fluid flux q m s is linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient i multiplied by a proportionality coefficient representing the intrinsic permeability k m2 of the porous medium bear 1972 and the fluid properties fluid density ρ kg m3 and dynamic viscosity μ pa s g m s2 is gravitational acceleration despite its universal usage there are many situations where darcy s law does not work well when flow is relatively very slow i e i is miniscule or when flow is quite fast due to very high i bear 1972 bear and cheng 2010 many engineering applications represent and belong to high i settings some examples include a pumping and injection of fluids e g water oil and gas such as co2 into and out of subsurface reservoirs that might induce fracturing and seismicity mcgarr et al 2015 szulczewski et al 2012 b construction of dams reservoirs and deep tunnels that might trigger earthquakes kerr and stone 2010 and c the design of bed reactors for absorption and separation processes and catalytic reactions al dahhan et al 1997 in all these situations the nonlinear flow regime may prevail where q increases less than a proportional increase in i fig 1 i e forchheimer flow occurs bear 1972 knowledge of when forchheimer flow emerges is thus crucial for the success of many porous media applications and for the assessment of many engineering and natural hazards extensive research has interrogated the forchheimer flow problem experimentally and computationally over the last few decades muljadi et al 2016 sivanesapillai et al 2014 studies show that the inertial force gradually increases with i causing fluid flow to deviate from the darcy flow regime zhou et al 2019 this is because darcy s law applies only to situations where inertial effects are negligible recent discoveries regarding inertial flows inside pores have been made possible with the aid of high performance computing and high resolution imaging in particular recirculation zones within pores have been mapped and modeled chaudhary et al 2011 lee et al 2014 the expansion of these recirculation zones with increasing inertia constricts the main flow stream leading to forchheimer flow phenomena chaudhary et al 2011 wang et al 2020 furthermore it is widely acknowledged that the onset of the forchheimer flow regime depends on the geometric properties of the pores and solid surfaces that alter the flow field and inertial forces these properties include porosity tortuosity connectivity and surface roughness muljadi et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 for example extensive studies found that the onset of forchheimer flow depends on the medium s internal or microscale heterogeneity bear 1972 muljadi et al 2016 saif et al 2019 due to the complexity of and interactions between the above factors a wide broad range of critical reynolds number rec indicating the onset has been reported that is rec ranges from 0 01 to 1000 muljadi et al 2016 this suggests that the rec might be an inappropriate or incomplete metric for identifying the occurrence of forchheimer flow in this study we alternatively resort to using the critical i ic instead of rec to assess the emergence of the forchheimer flow this is advantageous because i can be easily directly measured during experiments or in field settings to our knowledge based on most previous studies focused on quantifying rec it is not clearly known what are the typical values of ic and what are the factors which determine it without the knowledge of ic or accurate prediction of rec the application of the forchheimer equation will remain circular where it is first necessary to observe forchheimer flow before the equation can actually be used for flow calculation a broad assessment of under what conditions the forchheimer flow prevails for most if not all possible situations is necessary for establishing a widely applicable predictive model our study explored whether there is such a predictive model for identifying the onset of forchheimer flow via ic 2 materials and methods previous studies have revealed that rec is related to pore scale geometric properties muljadi et al 2016 similarly we hypothesized that ic is a function of k because k strongly depends on and encapsulates the pore scale geometric properties to support our hypothesis we first theoretically derived a power law function between ic and k based on the forchheimer equation and darcy s law the power law function was further supported by analyzing thousands of single phase physical and numerical experiments more details can be found below 2 1 theoretical development of power law function between ic and k the flow transition from linear darcy to nonlinear forchheimer flow regimes fig 1 can be described by the forchheimer equation with a quadratic term forchheimer 1901 whitaker 1996 1 dp ds μ k q ρ k i q 2 where p pa is pressure s m is domain length k m2 is viscous or intrinsic permeability representing the energy dissipation by viscous force ki m is inertial permeability representing energy dissipation by inertial force μ pa s is fluid viscosity ρ kg m3 is fluid density q m s is specific fluid flux or darcy flux zhou et al 2019 many studies have proposed that the forchheimer flow regime emerges when the deviation α defined as the ratio of the nonlinear pressure drop to the overall pressure drop amounts to a specific value zeng and grigg 2006 that is α is defined as 2 α ρ k i q 2 μ k q ρ k i q 2 rearranging eq 2 gives q as 3 q α 1 α μ ρ k i k note that eq 3 requires that α 1 because the equation will be undefined otherwise furthermore α 1 also implies that k 0 following eq 2 thus while α can be any chosen value it is set as a small number here α 0 1 following zeng and grigg 2006 determining the critical hydraulic gradient ic for identifying the onset of the forchheimer flow regime implies that the q i relationship should initially follow darcy s law until the threshold is met bear 1972 that is the following equation is valid 4 q k i c ρ g k μ i c where k is hydraulic conductivity and g 9 8 m s2 is gravitational acceleration equating eq 3 to eq 4 yields an expression for ic 5 i c α 1 α μ 2 ρ 2 g k i k 2 considering that ki and k are related geertsma 1974 zhou et al 2019 here we used the power law relationship between ki and k zhou et al 2019 6 k i ω k β where ω m 1 2 β is a bounded coefficient and β is a yet to be determined exponent substitution of eq 6 into eq 5 yields 7 i c α 1 α μ 2 ρ 2 g ω k β 2 therefore ic should scale as a power law function of k if the linear and nonlinear flow regimes respectively follow darcy s law and the forchheimer equation regardless of what relatively small threshold value for the deviation from linearity is chosen i e α note that darcy s law and the forchheimer equation assume no slip zero velocity at the solid grain surfaces bear and cheng 2010 whitaker 1996 thereby the power law form of the theoretically derived predictive model for estimating ic based on k with a constant exponent β 2 is only valid for porous media with no slip solid surfaces the power law conjecture is further supported by physical and numerical experiments as explained below 2 2 compilation and analysis of 2852 suits of single phase flow experiments for calculating water equivalent ic with the objective of analyzing flow experiments transitioning from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes considering a wide range of k we searched publicly accessible literature on the movement of fluids in porous media unfortunately we found that the vast majority of experiments were done with a relatively small reynolds number re when nonlinear forchheimer flow hardly happens in total 2852 suits of single phase flow experiments were collected and used these experiments were conducted across a wide array of porous media types in natural and engineered environments including porous rocks granular materials refractory castables foams magmas basic pore geometric configurations e g cubic packed porous media gas diffusion layers geosynthetic materials screens and woodchips figs 2 and 3 all datasets with associated references are provided in data s1 s3 in the supplementary materials broadly two formats of datasets were collected from previous studies the first format directly reported the k and the ki and such datasets did not require much further analysis of the experimental results with varying fluid properties the second format reported pressure flux curves in tables or figures for curves in figures we digitalized them using getdata graph digitizer http getdata graph digitizer com index php when some datasets in figures were too dense or cluttered to be identified we obtained the data via email communication with the authors the datasets following the second format were analyzed to estimate k and ki by fitting eq 1 differing fluid types were considered in the analysis of the pressure flux curves because the compiled single phase flow experiments were conducted either using gas e g air dey et al 2013 gostick et al 2006 nitrogen li et al 2001 najmi et al 2016 helium jones 1987 oxygen pant et al 2011 2012 oil venkataraman and rao 2000 or water bordier and zimmer 2000 considering that gas is compressible and assuming that water and oil are incompressible two forms of the forchheimer equation were used to estimate k and ki 8 p in p out l μ k q ρ k i q 2 f o r i n c o m p r e s s i b l e f l u i d s p in 2 p out 2 2 p 0 l μ k q ρ k i q 2 f o r c o m p r e s s i b l e f l u i d s where pin and pout are pressures at the inlet and outlet of experiments respectively l is the experimental length along the flow direction p 0 is the pressure at which the fluid rate is measured note that the compressible flow equation is modified from the incompressible counterpart to account for fluid compressibility following standard procedures american society for testing and materials international 2001 in total 96 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids for materials with k 10 12 m2 and 30 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids for materials with k 10 12 m2 figs 2 3 the rest of the experiments mostly used water except for a few that used oil as testing fluids the appropriate testing fluid density and viscosity were considered in the analysis the details of the data sources and corresponding flow experimental results i e k and ki values can be found in data s1 s3 similar to results of numerous studies sidiropoulou et al 2007 tamer et al 2016 we found that the forchheimer equation is able to robustly fit the flow nonlinearity observed in experiments for both compressible and incompressible fluids zhou et al 2019 the above mentioned procedures for calculating k ki paired values had been reported in our previous study zhou et al 2019 in total 2852 pairs of k ki were obtained data s2 the datasets of k ki were further used to estimate the water equivalent ic based on eq 5 by using physical properties of water at room temperature conditions i e ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 0 001 pa s this approach eliminates the effects of different fluid types with varying density and viscosity more importantly it makes ic comparable across a variety of porous media representing the full range of k from 10 18 to 10 6 m2 fig 3 and data s3 and allows for pressure gradient estimation based on ic 2 3 simulating single phase fluid flow in porous media for obtaining numerical model derived k ic pairs to further support the power law idea and explain the power law relationships observed in physical experiments we implemented computational fluid dynamics in porous media considering pore geometries and fluid solid boundary interactions indeed analyzing the movement of fluids through pores via numerical simulations provides opportunities to comprehensively diagnose flow fields and the factors which affect the flow this has become a common approach with the advancement of high performance computing ability and availability of numerous commercial and open source numerical modeling codes these models simulate fluid flow by numerically solving the navier stokes equations along with the continuity equation chaudhary et al 2011 singh 2020 wang et al 2020 9 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u u v w is the velocity vector we conducted pore scale simulations which directly solve eq 9 the simulations were conducted with comsol multiphysics a commercial finite element modeling software more details of the numerical simulations for identifying many potential factors i e geometric patterns solid surface boundary conditions fluid properties and compressibility on ic are discussed below the idea behind these simulations is to test some ideas for mechanistic explanation rather than specifically focus on very complex and large domains spanning hundreds to thousands of pores hence these numerical modeling exercises are on relatively simple small and simple geometric scenarios that allows for tractability and computational efficiency nonetheless a diversity of cases was considered 2 3 1 numerical simulations of diverse pore geometric patterns the pore geometry and patterns porosity and two or three dimensionality of the flow all play an important role in controlling the movement of fluids as well as the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes through porous media chaudhary et al 2013 fourar et al 2004 sivanesapillai et al 2014 to be able to produce results covering the wide range of k as observed in and represented by the experiments figs 2 3 and to capture the above mentioned factors which affect the flow fields 11 different base cases were purposely implemented although they might be not typical of real rocks fig 4 d among them cases 1 5 are synthetic 2d pore geometries which were previously employed to examine the effects of porosity and geometric patterns on k and ki zhou et al 2019 cases 6 8 are representative 2d pore networks in real rocks case 6 was extracted from the comsol multiphysics library representing a fine grained sandstone sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 resolved by an optical microscope case 7 was taken from an image of a thin section of the berea sandstone boek and venturoli 2010 case 8 is a fractional wet medium mohammadmoradi and kantzas 2016 which is posted publicly in a digital rocks repository https www digitalrocksportal org projects 70 cases 9 11 were artificially created for this study to represent a typical 3d porous media with varying degree of porosity specifically cases 9 10 represent intra pores in between spheres connected by thin vertical cylinders and case 11 represents cubic packed porous media fig 4d the length and width of the pores ranged on the order of a millimeter for the 11 base cases with grain diameter ranging from 30 μm to 200 μm table 1 however it was challenging to produce media with the same range of k represented by the physical experiments to achieve this the entire domain of a base case was uniformly shrunk or expanded as exemplified in fig 4c yielding pore networks with pore sizes representing several orders of magnitude i e from 10 nm to 1 mm and with a wide change of k ic paired values fig 4b this made the simulation results represent and match the broad spectrum of k observed in the physical experiments the numerical results of each base geometry of the 11 cases and their rescaled versions are denoted by similar shapes symbols in figs 2 3 the numerical modeling experiments with varying pore geometries described above shed light on the variations of ic by scaling k to specifically examine the degree of variations of ic for a given k we additionally designed a set of single pores fig 5 a following chaudhary et al 2013 and a set of pore networks fig 5b following zhou et al 2019 that had the same k 7 80 10 11 m2 by adjusting their domain sizes the numerical simulation results shown in fig 2c 2d 3 and 5 considered water as testing fluids with ρ 1000 kg m3 and μ 0 001 pa s note that using other fluids with the no slip boundary condition would expectedly yield the same resultant k ic pair see following section 3 3 we applied a pressure gradient across the domain fig 4a and 5 by prescribing pressures at an inlet bottom and outlet top the free tetrahedral and triangular mesh schemes were employed for 3d and 2d domains respectively in comsol where a finer mesh size was used with 2 to 4 boundary layers at the domain boundaries the mesh size was refined until the flux was insensitive to the mesh configuration the meshing strategy resulted in the models having 2 5 million elements and 70 000 elements for 3d and 2d domains respectively initially the left and right walls as well as grain surfaces were considered as no slip boundaries the p q curves were generated by gradually increasing the pressure gradient until inertial effects were non negligible and flow nonlinearity was discernible fig 4b consistent with a previous study of flow through fractures wang et al 2020 the numerical solutions strictly followed laminar flow such that turbulent effects were avoided but the flow regime still transitioned from darcy to forchheimer flow fig 4b and 6 2 3 2 using numerical simulations for diagnosing the effects of solid surface boundary conditions to unravel the flow complexity induced by the boundary condition of solid grain surfaces we directly compared results by either specifying no slip fig 6 a or slippery boundary conditions fig 6b with a slip length ls ls is a fictitious location within and across the solid boundary where velocity reaches zero fig 7 note that the fluid properties are unchanged i e water ρ and μ are used to isolate the effects of boundary conditions the inclusion of a slip boundary is a reasonable and acceptable approach for calculations with the nse for simulating water flow through porous media if the following conditions are met a the knudsen number kn is 0 001 kn 0 1 rapp 2017 and b the flow domain is far larger than the molecular diameter of water ideally at least 10 times the diameter travis et al 1997 the simulations in this study have kn 0 031 for the smallest scale cases and given that the water molecular free path is about 0 31 nm the flow channel is far larger than this it is thus reasonable to implement slip boundary conditions for the nse in our direct numerical simulations of pore scale flow the slippery effects were implemented in comsol multiphysics by using the slip velocity boundary condition with a given ls consequently the effects of ls on the emergence of forchheimer flow can be carefully scrutinized by systematically varying it from an initially miniscule value to one that significantly changes the k ic pattern dashed lines with diamonds in fig 2d and 3 convergence issues arise with the numerical simulations with slippery bc for the forchheimer flow regime when ls was too large thus we could only increase ls so much nonetheless the ratio of ls to the diameter of solid grains reasonably ranged from 0 1 to 10 for the simulations the suits of simulations with increasing ls are denoted by the enlarged size of the red symbols in fig 2d and fig 3 in fact ls can vary largely depending on many factors including wettability voronov et al 2007 surface roughness kucala et al 2017 and shear rate craig et al 2001 we did not investigate the individual contributions of the above factors to the variation of ls and their effects on fluid flow but simply used a reasonable value that lies within the range of reported values joseph and tabeling 2005 singh 2020 tretheway and meinhart 2002 2 3 3 using numerical simulations for constraining the effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility regarding the impacts of fluid type on fluid flow in porous media we diagnosed the sole effect of fluid solid interactions i e slippery boundaries on the k ic relationship as mentioned above however fluid density viscosity and compressibility are also potential impacting factors that might change the power law relationship between k ic to partly tease out these effects we further compared pore scale numerical simulation results for compressible and incompressible ideal gas flows with diverse fluid properties density and viscosity respectively and incompressible liquid fluid flows in porous media where solid surface boundary conditions were unchanged i e no slip wall was used the gas compressibility with changing density follows the ideal gas law 10 pv n r t where p is pressure v is volume n is the amount of substance t k is temperature r 8 314 j k mol is the ideal gas constant we have additionally done simulations assuming that the gas is incompressible with constant density at the room temperature and pressure for comparison purpose we used case 4 fig 4d as a representative pore geometry for demonstration for gas flow numerical simulations we considered air nitrogen helium and argon as testing fluids where initial values of gas densities and dynamic viscosities are broadly diverse and estimated at room temperature and pressure table 2 for liquid fluid flow simulations we considered water mercury and oil that cover a broad range of density and viscosity table 2 to isolate the effects of fluid properties and compressibility on the k ic relationship from that of solid fluid interactions i e slippery boundary all numerical simulations used no slip boundary conditions i e ls 0 similar to the flow simulations mentioned in section 2 3 1 we incrementally increased the pressure gradient along the vertical domain of case 4 figs 4 and 6 until inertial effects were non negligible as the nonlinear flow behavior manifested the pressure flux curves data s4 were used to obtain k and ki table 2 we further estimated ic through eq 5 based on the knowledge of k and ki where water density and viscosity were used such that ic was comparable for diverse fluids table 2 3 results and discussions of power law relationship between ic and k 3 1 experimentally derived power law function between ic and k based on the complied 2852 sets of flow experiments we find that ic fairly depends on k via the power law functions that directly supports our proposed power law function following eq 11 figs 2 3 interestingly the exponents of the power law function vary for low k and high k porous media specifically for porous media with a relatively high k spanning from 10 12 to 10 6 m2 we empirically found a predictive model where ic scales as a power law function with k black line in fig 3 which aligns with our proposed theory analysis of these low permeability materials showed that ic still scales with k following a power law but its exponent is significantly different with reduced ic values fig 3 that is the forchheimer flow regime emerges at a much lower ic than expected from the initial predictive model fig 3 when k is below 10 12 m2 note that for the low k regime k 10 12 m2 96 of the experiments used gas as testing fluids the above mentioned two scaling regimes are mathematically described by the following fitted power laws 11 l o g 10 i c 1 48 l o g 10 k 13 18 f o r 1 10 18 m 2 k 1 10 12 m 2 l o g 10 i c 1 00 l o g 10 k 8 79 f o r 1 10 12 m 2 k 1 10 5 m 2 where the cutoff between two regimes k 10 12 m2 was chosen based on visual inspection and because ls imposed negligible effects on changing the ic k trend with a further increase in k as discussed in section 3 5 there are some uncertainties for the fitted power laws which are quantified by the 95 confidence interval of ic this interval spans about four orders of magnitude when k 1 10 12 m2 and spans about two orders of magnitude when k 1 10 12 m2 fig 3 based on flow experiments since k can be easily obtained under normal pressure and temperature conditions within the darcy flow regime the eq 11 for estimating ic circumvents the difficulty of having to run precise flow experiments at high pressure conditions note that the predicted ic is readily converted to the pressure gradient by multiplying by water properties ρ 1000 kg m3 μ 0 001 pa s the simulations results were further used to develop insight on the occurrence of two scaling power law regimes and the causes of uncertainties in estimating ic via k at the mechanistic level 3 2 numerically derived power law function between ic and k with no slip boundaries we initially conducted flow simulations assuming no slip boundary conditions i e zero velocity on the solid surfaces following previous studies bear 1972 whitaker 1996 the simulations were implemented in diverse pore geometries but with a relatively high permeability k 10 12 m2 the pressure gradient flux was used to estimate ic and k fig 4a 4b where inertial effects were significant the results of these simulations in 11 geometries light blue hollow symbols in fig 2c and 3 overlapped with the experimental results further supporting the validity of power law function between ic and k however we found that the power law trend is unable to describe the low permeability media k 10 12 m2 representing materials such as tight reservoir rocks and cellular ceramics data s2 s3 where the established function based on high k regime overestimate ic for low k regime note that the results from three dimensional simulations with strong flow channeling effects were not discernibly different from 2d cases fig 2c and 3 implying that flow channeling effects on altering ic were not significant the reasons of having a different exponent for the low k regime with relatively reduced ic values remain unclear to address this question we further tested if this different ic k scaling regime for low k materials can be reproduced in flow simulations by artificially reducing the permeability of 11 geometries through geometrically shrinking the modeled domains example is demonstrated in fig 4c the results of these simulations light blue hollow symbols in fig 2c and 3 remained consistent with and continued the same power law scaling regime shown by the high permeability flow modeling and physical experiments thus there must be another reason for the lower ic beyond just a lower k we attempted to answer this question by further exploring other factors including fluids properties pore geometries and fluid solid interactions i e wettability this was achieved by numerical simulations 3 3 negligible effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility on k ic relationship numerical results we found negligible effects of fluid density viscosity and compressibility on the k ic relationship based on numerical simulations table 2 and data s4 in the supplementary materials note that in these cases the change of fluid properties had nothing to do with fluid solid interactions i e wettability remained unchanged compared to the scenarios when water was used as the testing fluid k and ki hardly changed even though different fluid properties and compressibility were considered table 2 for gaseous fluids including air nitrogen helium and argon consequently ic stayed within the same order of magnitude the maximum difference in ic was 3 89 covering all gaseous and liquid fluids studied here compressible and incompressible gas flow cases had a maximum value of 1 84 difference for ic i e for nitrogen considering that our synthesis of ic based on physical experiments covers 15 orders of magnitude the comparison of ic from numerical simulations suggests that fluid properties and compressibility have some effects on the k ic relationship but in the broad scheme this effect is negligible this is somewhat surprising because we thought fluid properties might play a significant role in changing k ic relationship because 96 experiments used gaseous fluids when k 10 12 m2 and gas flow derived ic values were several orders of magnitude smaller than the power law predictions fig 3 however we found the opposite that the effects of fluid properties are negligible we cannot rule out larger effects on ic if the fluid properties are starkly different compared to cases we analyzed particularly including supercritical fluids e g supercritical co2 in any case fluid properties and compressibility cannot explain the decrease in ic in low k regime and the uncertainties in ic other potential factors are explored as shown below 3 4 diverse pore geometries explain the uncertainties in k ic relationship numerical results although a consistent power law function between ic and k with no slip boundaries was found light blue line in fig 2c and 3 focusing on individual sets of experiments or simulations showed that the power law exponents can be somewhat variable figs 2 3 note that the analysis included the series of flow simulations based on 11 cases with real and synthetic media representing a variety of flow dimensionality two dimensional 2d versus three dimensional 3d flows pore space geometric patterns and porosity fig 4 the difference in exponents might thus be due to pore geometric patterns whereas fluid viscosity density and compressibility are modest contributing factors if at all as discussed above clearly the diversity in pore geometries cannot explain the reduced ic in low k regime but it can reasonably explain the uncertainties in estimating ic with a given k particularly we found that there were up to two orders of magnitude difference in ic around the fitted power law curve based on numerical flow simulations fig 3 consistent with a previous study which analyzed a few scenarios muljadi et al 2016 to further support this argument we artificially designed numerical simulations purple squares in fig 2c and 3 in different pore geometries and pore networks with the same k fig 5 we observed that ic can change by three orders of magnitude considering different geometric patterns given the same k suggesting that pore geometric patterns can possibly contribute to the variations of ic as observed in the experiments fig 2a 2b and fig 3 which helps explain the uncertainties in any fitted power law function in other words the variations of ic can be a few orders of magnitude for the same material and permeability however the relatively reduced ic in the low k regime remains unexplained a potential explanation for this is presented below 3 5 the effects of slip walls on reducing ic in low k porous media numerical results almost all 96 of the low k experiments were done using gas as testing fluids figs 2 3 gases are normally regarded as non wetting fluids with klinkenberg slippery effects klinkenberg 1941 we thus hypothesized that the low permeability ic k scaling regime is due to slip on solid surfaces in these cases the solid surfaces should be represented with slippery boundary conditions bcs with a slip length ls at the surface sendner et al 2009 to test the hypothesis that slip along solid surfaces is responsible for the different observed ic k scaling regime in low permeability media we further conducted flow simulations which considered the solid walls as a slippery bc using the same geometric patterns fig 2d 3 and 6 the ls could be orders of magnitude larger than the pore size depending on wettability surface roughness and shear rate singh 2020 by incrementally increasing ls for a given pore geometry the ic k pair gradually deviated from the results assuming no slip bc which deviated further from the experimental results as permeability decreased to overlapping with the experiments red dashed line in fig 2d and 3 when k 10 12 m2 this observation implies two things first slip affects the onset of forchheimer flow for low permeability materials second ic appears sensitive to ls because a larger ls is necessary in order for the flow simulation results to fall within the same ic k regime as the experiments the effects of ls on reducing ic diminished for higher k cases fig 2d and 3 about 30 of the experiments with k 10 12 m2 used gas as testing fluids where slippery bc effects is supposed to be present we also applied up to a fairly large ls in the numerical flow simulations fig 3 even so the differences between cases with slippery and no slip bcs were much smaller or even negligible for the high permeability cases than those for the low permeability cases this is because in general the slip effects gradually become negligible as pore size and thus k increases when k is high and pore spaces are relatively large realistic values for ls are insufficient to have significant effects on the velocity distribution within the pores nonetheless ls can still appreciably enhance the magnitude of k and thus slip moves the ic k pair along the power law scaling regime towards the higher k zone red dashed line in fig 3 when k 10 12 m2 our simulations had trouble in solving the nse with a large ls particularly when ls is ten times larger than the diameter of solid grains the difficulty of using even larger ls partly explains why our simulation results mostly lied at the upper part of 95 uncertainty range compared with experiments fig 3 our results suggested that imposing larger ls would shift the numerical simulation results further downwards and towards the experimental k ic space that is ic depends on the degree of fluid solid surface interactions especially for the low permeable porous media fig 3 where ic might be reduced by several orders of magnitude given the same k the results presented above suggest that in addition to the pore geometric patterns the uncertainties in ic for low k porous media could be also explained by the magnitude of slip that is ls 3 6 implications and limitations of using ic for identifying the onset of forchheimer flow the reynolds number re has been used widely as a metric to identify the flow regime transition from darcy to forchheimer bear and cheng 2010 however previous research has reported a very wide range for rec 0 1 1000 suggesting that re might not be an appropriate metric to assess the onset of forchheimer flow particularly in heterogeneous porous media muljadi et al 2016 here we used and focused on ic instead of re because of two issues associated with using the re first the characteristic length applied in the calculation of the re can be ambiguous and inconsistent among previous studies this has resulted in incomparable re threshold for identifying the onset of the forchheimer flow regime muljadi et al 2016 second a pore scale re may not be directly measurable on the other hand hydraulic head or pressure gradient is easily measurable and thus commonly reported following this reasoning a model for the onset of single phase forchheimer flow based on ic could prove more broadly useful there are some uncertainties in estimating ic that can be explained by the pore geometries and the magnitude of ls there are however other unexplored flow processes that cause the uncertainties and the reduction of ic in the low k regime some flow processes might play a significant role that include but are not limited to flow separation recirculation sheltering and so on chaudhary et al 2011 qian et al 2012 these processes are not included in this study but merits future efforts for example our results with pore networks showed that the entire flow field remained almost unchanged with seemingly absent recirculation zones fig 6 which was different from studies of single pores where recirculation zones were prominently present and grew when flow transitions from darcy to forchheimer flows chaudhary et al 2011 4 potential for broader application of the forchheimer equation in porous media we have established a model which may be broadly applicable for constraining the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow the forchheimer equation with a quadratic velocity term represents the forchheimer flow regime and it is widely used for nonlinear flow calculation with non negligible inertial effects mijic et al 2014 there are at least two major obstacles to the broad application of the forchheimer equation or even a combination of darcy s law and the forchheimer equation the first is that it has been difficult to predict the flow transition this study s results partly address this first problem but with some uncertainty the second challenge had been determining a key parameter ki in the forchheimer equation which is different from the viscous intrinsic permeability k in darcy s law however a recent study showed that for geologic materials ki can also be predicted from k zhou et al 2019 but also with uncertainty the application of the forchheimer equation had been circular in the past and this has been severely limiting difficult tests had to be conducted at field sites or on samples to determine if and when a flow regime transition is to be expected the ki is also determined through such tests by fitting the forchheimer equation even in situations when such tests are feasible because of the practical difficulty of these tests spatial mapping of the relevant forchheimer flow factors and properties is simply not feasible thus the forchheimer equation has mostly been applied to situations wherein it has been established a priori that forchheimer flow is present and what the associated flow coefficients are our results break this limiting circular situation the combined ability to predict the flow regime transition ic and ki from k opens up the possibility of broad application of the forchheimer equation there are no longer any unknown parameters associated with the forchheimer equation within and acknowledging the bounds of uncertainty of our analysis due to the intricate dependence of any specific ic k pair on pore geometric patterns and slippery surfaces simple predictions and maps of k and knowledge of i can be used to map where and when flow transitions may happen in these locations or moments the appropriate equation governing flow darcy s law versus the forchheimer equation can be chosen a continuum of single phase porous media flows can possibly be modeled with only the usual knowledge of k 5 summary conclusions and recommendations we developed a power law function relating the critical hydraulic gradient ic with the intrinsic permeability k of porous media where ic indicates the transition from darcy to forchheimer flow regimes the results of a synthesis of 2852 sets of single phase flow experiments and direct simulations in diverse pore geometries support the power law functions with some uncertainty moreover experimental results demonstrate that the exponents of the power law function vary for the high k 10 12 m2 k 10 5 m2 and low k 10 18 m2 k 10 12 m2 regimes a series of direct numerical simulations of pore scale flow further explain the observed ic k relationship we find that pore geometries with different porosity and geometric patterns can lead to variations in ic of up to three orders of magnitude for a given k moreover the reduction of ic orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by the power law in low permeability media can be attributed to the effects of slippery solid surfaces thus the power law functions we determined can be used to predict ic in situations with and without slip on solid surfaces but still with modest uncertainty to reduce the uncertainty and gain further insight future studies should focus on the effects of other unresolved flow processes including flow recirculation separation and sheltering on the power law function between ic and k credit authorship contribution

3286,pores in the subsurface form during the earth forming process e g sedimentation and diagenesis which evolve over the geologic time scale pores serve as the needed room for the storage of natural resources and for transporting various fluids therefore quantifying the volume of pores i e the pore volume is central to many geophysical and engineering problems however an accurate determination of subsurface pore volume has remained a challenge primarily related to the spatial heterogeneity found at multiple length scales here we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the effective pore volume of a multiscale heterogeneous porous matrix and preferential fracture flow system by evaluating groundwater age or residence time of an inert tracer the robustness of the proposed theoretical model is tested against numerical solutions from a typical fracture network matrix flow system with heterogeneous pore space distribution we find that although there are some uncertainties for the application of theory by measuring groundwater age or solute breakthrough curves our proposed theoretical model is overall robust and insensitive to the length scales with relative errors of less than

8413 σt standard deviation of time scales 1 introduction subsurface void spaces i e pores are ubiquitous in soft and hard rocks of earth and other planets michalski et al 2013 cumulative pore spaces known as pore volume is crucial for determining volumetrics for either storing or recovering many precious and economic resources including oil and gas gautier et al 2009 natural gas hydrate sloan 2003 groundwater gleeson et al 2016 and thermal energy jiang et al 2016 the hydraulically connected pores which constitute the effective pore volume control permeability providing conductive flow paths for transmitting mass and energy that underpins the dynamic nature of earth s water and life cycles alley et al 2002 hoehler and jørgensen 2013 mcgarr et al 2015 parnell and mcmahon 2016 however accurate predictions of the amount of natural resources and likewise prediction of mass and energy fluxes are limited due to the lack of proper determination of the subsurface effective pore volume bust et al 2011 miller and shanley 2010 this is mainly attributed to the presence of complex heterogeneity of subsurface formations due to differences in depositional environments diagenesis and tectonic processes gleeson and ingebritsen 2012 in practice there are sophisticated procedures for estimating effective pore volume or porosity of subsurface formations first one would use geophysical methods to roughly estimate effective pore space at field scales including ground penetrating radar bradford et al 2009 seismic wave chatterjee et al 2016 feng et al 2020 electrical conductivity and electromagnetic surveys ley cooper et al 2008 however the accuracy and uncertainties of geophysical methods are closely dependent on the resolution of the selected measurement bradford et al 2009 to improve the estimation accuracy the in situ wireline logs e g neutron porosity log and density porosity log are further used to obtain high fidelity results still the measurements are only robust for the local wellbore settings fischetti and andrade 2002 moreover there are a variety of laboratory methods for estimating porosity such as gas sorption liquid intrusion x ray ct scanning chaudhary et al 2013 fredrich et al 2006 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 fib sem imaging bera et al 2011 singh 2019 and neutron scattering anovitz and cole 2015 daigle and screaton 2015 espinal 2012 although these methods are theoretically different and reliable in measuring pore volume they are all costly since they require taking core samples out from a field site more importantly results derived from wireline logs porosity from laboratory experiments are too local to capture the large scale subsurface heterogeneity anovitz and cole 2015 and estimate the effective pore volume i e the connected porosity that contribute to conductive flow paths for the transport of mass and energy consequently given the best knowledge and state of the art technology accurate quantification of effective pore volume at large length scales remains challenging due to the following facts a subsurface formations are spatially heterogeneous and b the current methods of estimating effective pore volume are either constrained at the local scale or limited by the spatial resolution at the field scale ley cooper et al 2008 to address the above challenges we propose that the effective pore volume can be estimated based on the evaluation of groundwater age or residence time of an inert tracer since the age transport process inherently carries the information of connected pore spaces with collective contributions from the preferential flow path and the stagnant zones i e porous matrix haggerty and gorelick 1995 jiang et al 2010b wang et al 2020 groundwater age can be obtained at a large field scale based on inert tracer experiments or age dating techniques sudicky and frind 1981 the inert solute hereafter simply called solute is particularly referenced since the chemical processes including sorption desorption are excluded in this study in this study we attempt to use groundwater age mass which is the product of age and mass to estimate effective pore volume in fracture porous matrix systems although a previous study doyon and molson 2012 have solved the age mass distribution for the simplified fracture matrix system the geometry is a regular shape with homogeneous matrix porosity the direct connection between age mass and total pore volume of the surrounding matrix is not fully resolved particularly when the surrounding porous matrix is naturally irregular and heterogeneous here we develop a theoretical framework for determining the effective pore volume of the heterogeneous porous matrix that surrounds fractures by analyzing solute mean residence time or groundwater age mass note that the solute s mean residence time is equivalent to groundwater age mass at the outbound monsen et al 2002 hereafter we only use and analyze mean groundwater age mass for simplicity we validated our theoretical framework by testing it against numerical solutions from two distinct cases as a measure of the robustness of the proposed theoretical framework the newly established theoretical framework can partly decipher the mysteries of encrypted effective pore volume information coded in the transport process which sheds light on interpreting many geophysical processes and guiding engineering applications for example based on our proposed framework one might be able to assess the spatial extent of the mineralization zone for sequestrating co2 in the subsurface moreover the breakthrough curves measured in the riverine system can be useful to determine the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone that is critical for sustaining riverine ecosystems 2 theoretical framework to determine subsurface effective pore volume our proposed framework is inspired by the solute transport process where the solute can eventually sample the entire subsurface domain given enough time that is with time the solute will migrate to all connected pore spaces via advection and hydrodynamic dispersion in flow conductive preferential flow zones and via diffusion in less permeable or stagnant zones roubinet et al 2012 thus we propose that the information of pore volume of the surrounding porous matrix is encrypted in and can be resolved by solute s breakthrough curves becker and shapiro 2000 or residence time distributions cardenas 2008 or groundwater age mass gleeson et al 2016 jiang et al 2010a here we rigorously derived an analytical solution that connects the unknown effective pore volume of heterogeneous formations to the measurable groundwater age mass in a preferential fracture flow system at the field scale following are the descriptions of the conceptual and mathematical framework 2 1 groundwater age mass transport in the preferential fracture flow domain the transport of mean groundwater age mass τ through a fracture surrounded by a porous matrix fig 1 can be conceptualized and simplified into one dimensional 1 d transport with advection and longitudinal dispersion in the fracture along with transverse diffusion into and out of the surrounding matrix for a steady state flow field τ satisfies advection dispersion equation in the fracture with a dirichlet boundary at the inlet i e τ 0 and a neuman boundary i e dispersive flux 0 at the outlet following bethke and johnson 2008 ginn et al 2009 goode 1996 1 u d τ dx d d 2 τ d x 2 1 f x h f θ f 2 τ x 0 0 3 τ x x l 0 where τ s is a conservative property subjected to mixing and spreading processes x m is the longitudinal direction θ f is fracture porosity θ f 1 h f m is fracture aperture u m s is mean advective velocity in fracture d m2 s is hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient beyond the asymptotic length scale koch and brady 1987 wang et al 2012 in fracture l m is domain length and f x m is a sink source term representing the age mass exchange flux between fracture and matrix due to diffusion process in the transverse direction i e linear diffusion more information about f x can be found in section 2 2 note that the governing eq 1 holds as long as the following assumptions are valid a the fracture aperture is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the surrounding matrix which oftentimes is true in nature so the transport process in the fracture can be treated as a 1 d problem in the longitudinal direction fig 1 b the solute only diffuses into and out of the matrix in the transverse direction i e z direction in fig 1 which is widely accepted for the fracture matrix system roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 therefore the transport process in the matrix can also be treated as a 1 d problem but in the transverse direction and c the flow field is steady state with invariable fracture aperture which stands fairly valid considering the aperture is comparably small 2 2 determination of age mass exchange flux per unit length of fracture f x since only transverse diffusion is present in the matrix for the fracture matrix system the age mass transport governing equation is consequently governed by the 1 d diffusion equation in the z direction which is similar to the aquifer aquitard system bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 goode 1996 take the overlaying matrix for example fig 1 the governing equation for τ in eq 1 can be simplified to 4 θ om d m τ z z θ om 0 where τ is the age mass in the overlaying matrix dm m2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient θom is the effective porosity of overlaying matrix that can be varied in the transverse direction suggesting that the surrounding porous matrix is heterogeneous due to for example mechanical compaction process the inclusion of effective porosity in eq 4 indicates the porosity serving as a source term that elongates τ as water flows through the system integrating eq 4 by parts over the thickness of overlaying matrix hom m fig 1 yields 5 θ om d m τ z z h om θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z 0 since no flux is assumed at the upper symmetric boundary condition i e θ om d m τ z z h om 0 this simplifies eq 5 into 6 θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z eq 6 implies that the age mass exchange flux per unit length of fracture in eq 1 from the overlaying matrix amounts to the effective pore volumes of overlaying column i e f x θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z similarly f x from the underlying matrix column can be determined by integrating porosity over its entire thickness hum fig 1 summing up all source terms at a given location x from both underlaying and overlaying columns yields the total f x 7 f x 0 h om θ om d z 0 h um θ um d z p v x in summary f x in eq 1 represents the effective pore volume pv per unit length of fracture for the overlying and underlying columns at any given x location fig 1 this is consistent with the previous findings for the aquifer aquitard system where homogeneous porosity is assumed bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 here we further confirm that the finding the age mass exchange flux is equivalent to the pore volume of the surrounding matrix column is also applicable to the heterogeneous systems consequently eq 1 can be rewritten as 8 u d τ dx d d 2 τ d x 2 1 pv x h f θ f note that θf 1 for fracture the second term on the right hand of eq 8 suggests that the effects of source term pv x are expected to attenuate over fracture aperture 2 3 quantification of pore volume based on analytical solution of groundwater age considering the boundary conditions eqs 2 3 the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with a source term i e eq 8 can be solved analytically following the method provided by van genuchten and alves 1982 the solution to τ at the location x l is given as 9 τ λ l u λ d u 2 e u l d 1 where λ is a to be determined coefficient depending on the average value of pv x m along the longitudinal direction i e pv x the mean pore volume per unit length of fracture where pv x varies due to irregular geometry of heterogeneous matrix fig 1 note that λ is described as 10 λ pv x θ f h f 1 θ f since λ can be estimated based on measurable τ in eq 9 the estimated λ can be further used to quantify pv x using eq 10 11 pv x θ f λ 1 h f in summary the measurable τ or solute residence time at location l can be used to estimate λ with the aid of eq 9 which is further employed to approximate pv x given that h f is known according to eq 11 ultimately the total effective pore volume i e pvt m2 of the entire surrounding matrix is the product of pv x and l 12 pv t pv x l 3 methods for validating proposed theoretical framework to quantify effective pore volume to validate the newly proposed theoretical framework for quantifying effective pore volume in the surrounding heterogeneous matrix based on mean groundwater age or the solute residence time we first conduct forward modeling by solving the age mass transport process in a single fracture matrix preferential flow system namely case a fig 2 a next we solve the solute transport process in a fracture network matrix system namely case b fig 2b where the breakthrough curve btc is used to approximate the mean age mass i e residence time note that the effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix serves as an input variable in the numerical simulation domains the numerically computed mean age mass is employed to estimate pvt based on eqs 9 12 the robustness of the theoretical framework is supported by the nuance between numerically derived pvt and input value in the numerical models 3 1 preferential flow case a age mass transport in single fracture matrix system fractures are ubiquitous in the subsurface candela et al 2012 that often serve as preferential flow paths since they are more permeable or conductive compared to the surrounding porous matrix becker and tsoflias 2010 berkowitz 2002 to assess the validity and generality of the proposed theoretical framework we design a two dimensional 2 d age mass transport simulation for a fracture matrix system with an irregular shaped domain where a parallel plate a classical fracture model with h f 1 mm is surrounded by irregular geometries with no flux walls following various sinusoidal functions fig 2a the magnitude of sinusoidal functions is 0 8 m and 1 m and wavelengths of 15 m and 10 m for overlaying matrix and underlaying matrix respectively the sinusoidal functions are used here for demonstrating the flexibility of the proposed framework to estimate the effective pore volume of domains with complex boundaries such as the undulations found in aquifers and aquitards due to tectonic deformation to further test the applicability of the framework for the heterogeneous system we synthetically specify an exponential decay function of θ for representing heterogeneous matrix where θ ranges from 0 15 to 0 26 fig 2a note that for the benchmark case the total domain length l 30 m fig 2a and table 1 the flow in the fracture is driven from left to right by a constant pressure gradient of 10 pa m with a mean velocity u of 72 m d table 1 calculated following the cubic law wang et al 2015 witherspoon et al 1980 here reynolds number re ρuh f μ is 0 83 in which ρ is fluid density 1000 kg m3 and μ is fluid viscosity 0 001 pa s note that there is no flow in the surrounding matrix following assumptions used by many previous studies roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 therefore only diffusion occurs in the porous matrix regarding boundary conditions for age mass transport we used the dirichlet boundary at the inlet τ 0 and neumann boundary at the outlet fig 2a by doing so the age accumulates from inlet to outlet along with advection diffusion dispersion processes the dispersion coefficient d is calculated assuming an asymptotic dispersion i e d uh f 2 210d m following previous studies dentz and carrera 2007 wang et al 2012 for spatial discretization we adopt a very fine mesh size i e 0 1h f in fracture and relatively coarse mesh size i e 100h f approaching the edge of the surrounding matrix in total we have around 2 million triangular elements fig 3 a numerical solutions are insensitive to the further refinement of the mesh size the simulation of 2 d advection dispersion diffusion processes for age mass transport in a steady state flow field is implemented using comsol multiphysics a finite element based commercial software the simulations can complete in just a few minutes of the wall clock in a memory shared multi core workstation with 256 gb memory after solving age mass for the fracture matrix system fig 3b we calculate flux weighted age mass at the outlet that is used to determine the pore volume of the surrounding matrix following eqs 9 12 we use the relative error epv for assessing the goodness of the theoretical framework in estimating effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix which is defined as 13 e pv pv t pv input pv input where pvinput stands for the model s input value of pore volume 3 2 preferential flow case b solute transport in fracture network matrix system single fractures are hydraulically connected in space forming a fracture network frampton et al 2019 hyman et al 2021 which becomes an idealized complex setting for validating our proposed framework in natural settings the location length direction aperture and density of single fractures in the subsurface approximately follow the law of large numbers of mathematical statistics berrone et al 2018 dong et al 2018 therefore the discrete fracture network can be generated with the monte carlo method where different geometric parameters can be specified that follow diverse mathematical distributions including lognormal distribution poisson distribution negative exponential distribution etc li et al 2017 o malley et al 2018 in this study two groups of fractures in a 2 d domain with a size of 5 m 5 m are tested fig 2b where fracture length follows a lognormal distribution and the orientation angle of strike follows a normal distribution specifically for the horizontally extended group the mean value and standard deviation of fracture length are respectively 4 95 m and 0 59 m and the mean value and standard deviation of orientation angle are 0 and 1 respectively for the vertically extended group the mean value and standard deviation of length are 0 79 m and 0 01 m and the mean value and standard deviation of orientation angle are 90 and 1 respectively all single fractures have a uniform aperture of 1 mm to particularly investigate the sole effects of fracture network structure on solute transport rather than the fracture roughness whereas the matrix has a porosity of 0 25 we conduct solute transport simulation in the above mentioned fracture network matrix system like age mass transport through the single fracture matrix system flow only occurs in the preferential flow path i e the discrete fracture network which is obtained by solving the navier stokes and continuity equations 14 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u m s is the velocity vector fluid flows from bottom to top driven by a prescribed pressure gradient p pa m with the dirichlet boundary condition fig 2b where the shortest tortuous flow length l 13 03 m based on the spatial structure of fracture network the mean velocity u 16 45 m d following the cubic law and re 0 19 table 1 in other words both advection and diffusion dispersion are considered in the fracture network but only diffusion is present in the surrounding matrix fig 2b the solute is transmitted from the bottom with a given dimensionless concentration c 1 to the top where diffusive dispersive flux is zero all other boundaries are set as no flux boundary conditions the strategy of meshing the domain is similar to the single fracture matrix system where a finer mesh is used for the fracture and a coarser mesh for the matrix with a total number of triangular elements amounting to 10 million beyond which the numerical result becomes insensitive to further refinement of the mesh size this simulation is also implemented using comsol multiphysics we finally evaluate the flux weighted concentration at the outlet to obtain the breakthrough curve fig 4 which can be further used to estimate the dispersion coefficient and mean residence time as described below for demonstration purposes we plot the solute transport process over time as insets in fig 4 considering the complex fracture matrix interactions along the fracture network flow paths and the applied continuous concentration boundary condition the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d 3 98 10 4 m2 s is calculated following the second moment method based on the breakthrough curve yeo 2001 15 d σ t 2 u s 2 2 t 0 5 where the standard deviation σt s is 16 σ t t 0 84 t 0 16 2 us m s is the apparent solute transport velocity us l t 0 5 t 0 16 t 0 5 t 0 84 are the time when normalized concentration amounts to 0 1587 0 5 and 0 8413 respectively moreover we calculate the flux weighted mean residence time or age mass at the outlet based on the breakthrough curves 17 τ 0 1 c d t where c is the flux weighted normalized concentration that is the ratio of effluent solute mass to the total injected solute mass the estimated τ is further used to estimate epv for assessing the applicability of framework as discussed in eq 13 4 results 4 1 applicability of framework for preferential flow case a the calculated age mass τ 737 99 day is evaluated at the outlet based on the numerical simulation of case a which is further used to determine the effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix following eqs 9 12 we find that the numerically calculated pvt 53 108 m2 based on τ matches well with the model s input value pvinput 53 107 m2 where epv 0 003 demonstrates the robustness of our proposed theoretical framework to estimate pvt for the single fracture matrix preferential flow system considering a significant heterogeneous matrix 4 2 applicability of framework for preferential flow case b we estimate τ 174 21 days for the solute transport case in fracture network matrix system for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed theoretical framework using eqs 9 12 based on τ yield numerically derived pvt 6 79 m2 which matches the input value pvinput 6 23 m2 with epv 9 04 once again the goodness of matching pvt suggests that the proposed theoretical framework derived based on the local fracture system is viable to estimate surrounding pvt for the global fracture network system where tortuous flow paths are present with complex interactions between fracture and matrix 5 discussion and limitations of theoretical framework for determining effective pore volume in heterogeneous formations 5 1 scale sensitivity analysis of theoretical framework for determining effective pore volume compared to other methods espinal 2012 ley cooper et al 2008 our theoretical framework has the advantage of accurately estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale to support this scale invariant feature and while considering the computational challenge for the fracture network case we only incrementally increase the length l of the simulation domain for the single fracture matrix flow system whereas all other numerical configurations remain unchanged compared to the benchmark with l 30 m table 1 fig 2a and 3a 3b e g h f remain constant specifically by varying l l h f ranges broadly from 1 104 to 1 105 with an interval of 1 104 these numerical simulations are also implemented using comsol multiphysics with over 2 million triangular elements for the largest scale domain we find that the estimated pvt matches well with pvinput fig 3c for a broad range of length scales where the overall epv is acceptable and insensitive to the length scale with epv reaching up to 9 10 5 fig 3c this suggests that our theoretical framework performs well in estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale we find that although epv is acceptably small the absolute value of epv generally decreases with length scale and stabilizes very quickly to an asymptotic value the stabilizing difference is likely because the assumptions underlying the theoretical framework are more valid for the single fracture matrix system i e fracture aperture is orders of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the surrounding porous matrix thus the flow and transport processes in a single fracture can be impeccably treated as a 1 d problem 5 2 implications of accurately estimating pore volume in heterogeneous formations with the aid of tracer experiments or age dating techniques groundwater age or residence time can be well constrained for example by injecting solute into the subsurface and measuring the breakthrough curves we can roughly estimate solute residence time drummond et al 2012 haggerty et al 2000 alternatively isotopic measurements e g carbon14 can be used to estimate groundwater age or residence time sudicky and frind 1981 based on the measurable age residence time along with estimated velocity dispersion coefficient and hydraulically equivalent aperture the proposed framework can be thus useful for accurately determining the effective pore volume for the multiscale heterogeneous fracture matrix systems described in this study the advantage of our theoretical framework is to save time and resources to indirectly estimate the effective pore volume with high fidelity outcomes that reasonably capture large scale about hundreds of meters heterogeneity moreover the estimates derived from the groundwater age can also be used to validate the geophysics retrieved dataset that usually has a coarse spatial resolution feng et al 2020 hence our new theoretical framework provides a promising opportunity to cross validate the potential datasets of subsurface pore volume measured by geophysical and laboratory methods given that the ground truth of pore volume for heterogeneous formations is unknown and almost impossible to estimate our framework is only validated based on our hypothetic numerical simulations future work will be conducted in laboratory experiments to further prove the robustness and application of the presented framework for a diversity of geological settings 5 3 the potential for predicting effective pore volume in other preferential flow systems although our framework is theoretically derived based on fracture flow system surrounding low permeable zones with negligible velocity i e advection dominantly occurs in the high permeable flow paths such systems can be found in various subsurface natural settings for example groundwater flow passing stagnant zones gassiat et al 2013 jiang et al 2012 fluid flow through widely accepted dual porosity or dual permeability porous media andrés et al 2021 mass transport through mobile immobile zones gao et al 2010 porta et al 2015 wang et al 2020 in the above systems multiple rate mass transfer between preferential flow domain and matrix might be present haggerty and gorelick 1995 despite that our framework only considers molecular diffusion the age mass exchange flux between preferential flow and matrix is independent of multiple diffusion rates which however only depends on the pore volume of the matrix following the eq 7 and is consistent with previous findings bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 consequently once the mean groundwater age or residence time can be measured in the systems mentioned above our framework can be applied to determine the effective pore volumes of the relatively low permeable or immobile zones which are practically difficult to obtain 5 4 the limitations for predicting pore volume considering truncated residence time the breakthrough curves can be theoretically used to estimate mean residence time assuming the concentration can be measured with an infinite duration however the practical measurement normally terminates at a time when concentration is below the detection limit luo et al 2006 this likely leads to a truncated residence time that would expectedly underestimate the mean groundwater age and potentially increase error epv we further assess the effects of truncated residence time on estimating effective pore volume using our framework based on case b i e fracture network matrix system since the breakthrough curve is readily available we find that the error epv expectedly increases due to the truncated residence time fig 5 however as the transport in the fracture network matrix system evolves over sufficient time scale or the pore volumes the accuracy in epv is recovered to within 10 for example epv of 50 reduces to 10 between the transport of 150 and 628 tpv respectively fig 5 the dimensionless time tpv is defined as 18 t pv t q v f where t s is time q m2 s discharge vf m2 is the total volume of a fracture network in the two dimensional space we note that epv tends to be within 10 when sampling time is greater than 628 tpv or when the normalized concentration is 0 94 assuming a normalized concentration of 0 94 is quite likely to be detected and accuracy of within 10 our proposed framework offers promise to its application to real world scenarios the dimensionless time tpv represents water flushing time over the volume of the fracture network therefore the solute migration in fracture and its diffusive mixing with matrix requires a larger time scale to sample the complex interactions between the fracture network and matrix as such solute tailing is expected to be more prominent hyman and dentz 2021 and which can induce error e g epv on approaching 50 with early truncated times on the other hand the solute tailing might be shortened for some flow systems with a single preferential flow path lee et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2017 this indicates that the discussed accuracy 10 of our proposed framework is likely viable with early truncated times as well in certain circumstances note that epv at large tpv is expected to be trivial but is non negligible in our study fig 5 i e epv keeps increasing with tpv where epv is potentially greater than 9 when time surpasses 1800 tpv this is mainly due to the following reasons 1 there are uncertainties in estimating mean velocity and dispersion coefficient for the fracture network system 2 the accuracy of numerical simulation gets limited due to computational challenges of using very fine element size for directly solving the navier stokes and advection diffusion equations our results suggest that given that the theory is valid the validation might be challenging in some real applications another caveat is that our model only considers transverse diffusion also known as linear diffusion from the preferential flow domain i e fractures to the surrounding matrix however other types of diffusion for example radial diffusion hoffmann et al 2020 might be present that violate the assumption behind our framework in such circumstances the spherical and cylindrical diffusive models might be more suitable and merit future efforts however the usage of transverse diffusion has been the most common way to study such preferential flow systems bethke and johnson 2008 hyman and dentz 2021 roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 especially for the fracture matrix interactions and where our proposed framework is applicable last our theoretical framework is derived based on a steady state flow field in the preferential fracture flow path in some circumstances the flow field is dynamically changing that might violate the validity of the proposed framework the applicability of using age mass to interpret the effective pore volume in a dynamic flow condition would be worthy of investigation in the future moreover the two phase water and air flow process involved in the vadose zone is complex that is not considered in the current theoretical framework köhne et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2003 6 conclusions we developed a theoretical paradigm to determine the effective pore volume of a multiscale heterogeneous fracture and surrounding porous matrix system by deriving an analytical solution to the age mass transport equation to test the robustness of the proposed theoretical model we conduct numerical simulations of flow and solute age transport by employing two typical preferential flow systems i e single fracture matrix and fracture network matrix systems with pronounced heterogeneity the numerical results confirm the robustness of the proposed theoretical paradigm with relative errors of less than 9 in quantifying effective pore volume when considering formation heterogeneity and tortuous flow paths more importantly once the groundwater age or inert solute residence time are known our proposed theoretical framework provides a feasible method for accurately estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale some uncertainties remain related to the types of diffusion between the preferential flow domain and matrix and the effects of the truncated breakthrough curves when sampling at early times however the advantage of the proposed theoretical model which can include heterogeneity found at multiple length scales may overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods which either only work well at the local scale via core measurements or are less accurate at the large length scale since they rely

3286,pores in the subsurface form during the earth forming process e g sedimentation and diagenesis which evolve over the geologic time scale pores serve as the needed room for the storage of natural resources and for transporting various fluids therefore quantifying the volume of pores i e the pore volume is central to many geophysical and engineering problems however an accurate determination of subsurface pore volume has remained a challenge primarily related to the spatial heterogeneity found at multiple length scales here we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the effective pore volume of a multiscale heterogeneous porous matrix and preferential fracture flow system by evaluating groundwater age or residence time of an inert tracer the robustness of the proposed theoretical model is tested against numerical solutions from a typical fracture network matrix flow system with heterogeneous pore space distribution we find that although there are some uncertainties for the application of theory by measuring groundwater age or solute breakthrough curves our proposed theoretical model is overall robust and insensitive to the length scales with relative errors of less than

known as pore volume is crucial for determining volumetrics for either storing or recovering many precious and economic resources including oil and gas gautier et al 2009 natural gas hydrate sloan 2003 groundwater gleeson et al 2016 and thermal energy jiang et al 2016 the hydraulically connected pores which constitute the effective pore volume control permeability providing conductive flow paths for transmitting mass and energy that underpins the dynamic nature of earth s water and life cycles alley et al 2002 hoehler and jørgensen 2013 mcgarr et al 2015 parnell and mcmahon 2016 however accurate predictions of the amount of natural resources and likewise prediction of mass and energy fluxes are limited due to the lack of proper determination of the subsurface effective pore volume bust et al 2011 miller and shanley 2010 this is mainly attributed to the presence of complex heterogeneity of subsurface formations due to differences in depositional environments diagenesis and tectonic processes gleeson and ingebritsen 2012 in practice there are sophisticated procedures for estimating effective pore volume or porosity of subsurface formations first one would use geophysical methods to roughly estimate effective pore space at field scales including ground penetrating radar bradford et al 2009 seismic wave chatterjee et al 2016 feng et al 2020 electrical conductivity and electromagnetic surveys ley cooper et al 2008 however the accuracy and uncertainties of geophysical methods are closely dependent on the resolution of the selected measurement bradford et al 2009 to improve the estimation accuracy the in situ wireline logs e g neutron porosity log and density porosity log are further used to obtain high fidelity results still the measurements are only robust for the local wellbore settings fischetti and andrade 2002 moreover there are a variety of laboratory methods for estimating porosity such as gas sorption liquid intrusion x ray ct scanning chaudhary et al 2013 fredrich et al 2006 wildenschild and sheppard 2013 fib sem imaging bera et al 2011 singh 2019 and neutron scattering anovitz and cole 2015 daigle and screaton 2015 espinal 2012 although these methods are theoretically different and reliable in measuring pore volume they are all costly since they require taking core samples out from a field site more importantly results derived from wireline logs porosity from laboratory experiments are too local to capture the large scale subsurface heterogeneity anovitz and cole 2015 and estimate the effective pore volume i e the connected porosity that contribute to conductive flow paths for the transport of mass and energy consequently given the best knowledge and state of the art technology accurate quantification of effective pore volume at large length scales remains challenging due to the following facts a subsurface formations are spatially heterogeneous and b the current methods of estimating effective pore volume are either constrained at the local scale or limited by the spatial resolution at the field scale ley cooper et al 2008 to address the above challenges we propose that the effective pore volume can be estimated based on the evaluation of groundwater age or residence time of an inert tracer since the age transport process inherently carries the information of connected pore spaces with collective contributions from the preferential flow path and the stagnant zones i e porous matrix haggerty and gorelick 1995 jiang et al 2010b wang et al 2020 groundwater age can be obtained at a large field scale based on inert tracer experiments or age dating techniques sudicky and frind 1981 the inert solute hereafter simply called solute is particularly referenced since the chemical processes including sorption desorption are excluded in this study in this study we attempt to use groundwater age mass which is the product of age and mass to estimate effective pore volume in fracture porous matrix systems although a previous study doyon and molson 2012 have solved the age mass distribution for the simplified fracture matrix system the geometry is a regular shape with homogeneous matrix porosity the direct connection between age mass and total pore volume of the surrounding matrix is not fully resolved particularly when the surrounding porous matrix is naturally irregular and heterogeneous here we develop a theoretical framework for determining the effective pore volume of the heterogeneous porous matrix that surrounds fractures by analyzing solute mean residence time or groundwater age mass note that the solute s mean residence time is equivalent to groundwater age mass at the outbound monsen et al 2002 hereafter we only use and analyze mean groundwater age mass for simplicity we validated our theoretical framework by testing it against numerical solutions from two distinct cases as a measure of the robustness of the proposed theoretical framework the newly established theoretical framework can partly decipher the mysteries of encrypted effective pore volume information coded in the transport process which sheds light on interpreting many geophysical processes and guiding engineering applications for example based on our proposed framework one might be able to assess the spatial extent of the mineralization zone for sequestrating co2 in the subsurface moreover the breakthrough curves measured in the riverine system can be useful to determine the spatial extent of the hyporheic zone that is critical for sustaining riverine ecosystems 2 theoretical framework to determine subsurface effective pore volume our proposed framework is inspired by the solute transport process where the solute can eventually sample the entire subsurface domain given enough time that is with time the solute will migrate to all connected pore spaces via advection and hydrodynamic dispersion in flow conductive preferential flow zones and via diffusion in less permeable or stagnant zones roubinet et al 2012 thus we propose that the information of pore volume of the surrounding porous matrix is encrypted in and can be resolved by solute s breakthrough curves becker and shapiro 2000 or residence time distributions cardenas 2008 or groundwater age mass gleeson et al 2016 jiang et al 2010a here we rigorously derived an analytical solution that connects the unknown effective pore volume of heterogeneous formations to the measurable groundwater age mass in a preferential fracture flow system at the field scale following are the descriptions of the conceptual and mathematical framework 2 1 groundwater age mass transport in the preferential fracture flow domain the transport of mean groundwater age mass τ through a fracture surrounded by a porous matrix fig 1 can be conceptualized and simplified into one dimensional 1 d transport with advection and longitudinal dispersion in the fracture along with transverse diffusion into and out of the surrounding matrix for a steady state flow field τ satisfies advection dispersion equation in the fracture with a dirichlet boundary at the inlet i e τ 0 and a neuman boundary i e dispersive flux 0 at the outlet following bethke and johnson 2008 ginn et al 2009 goode 1996 1 u d τ dx d d 2 τ d x 2 1 f x h f θ f 2 τ x 0 0 3 τ x x l 0 where τ s is a conservative property subjected to mixing and spreading processes x m is the longitudinal direction θ f is fracture porosity θ f 1 h f m is fracture aperture u m s is mean advective velocity in fracture d m2 s is hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient beyond the asymptotic length scale koch and brady 1987 wang et al 2012 in fracture l m is domain length and f x m is a sink source term representing the age mass exchange flux between fracture and matrix due to diffusion process in the transverse direction i e linear diffusion more information about f x can be found in section 2 2 note that the governing eq 1 holds as long as the following assumptions are valid a the fracture aperture is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the surrounding matrix which oftentimes is true in nature so the transport process in the fracture can be treated as a 1 d problem in the longitudinal direction fig 1 b the solute only diffuses into and out of the matrix in the transverse direction i e z direction in fig 1 which is widely accepted for the fracture matrix system roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 therefore the transport process in the matrix can also be treated as a 1 d problem but in the transverse direction and c the flow field is steady state with invariable fracture aperture which stands fairly valid considering the aperture is comparably small 2 2 determination of age mass exchange flux per unit length of fracture f x since only transverse diffusion is present in the matrix for the fracture matrix system the age mass transport governing equation is consequently governed by the 1 d diffusion equation in the z direction which is similar to the aquifer aquitard system bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 goode 1996 take the overlaying matrix for example fig 1 the governing equation for τ in eq 1 can be simplified to 4 θ om d m τ z z θ om 0 where τ is the age mass in the overlaying matrix dm m2 s is the molecular diffusion coefficient θom is the effective porosity of overlaying matrix that can be varied in the transverse direction suggesting that the surrounding porous matrix is heterogeneous due to for example mechanical compaction process the inclusion of effective porosity in eq 4 indicates the porosity serving as a source term that elongates τ as water flows through the system integrating eq 4 by parts over the thickness of overlaying matrix hom m fig 1 yields 5 θ om d m τ z z h om θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z 0 since no flux is assumed at the upper symmetric boundary condition i e θ om d m τ z z h om 0 this simplifies eq 5 into 6 θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z eq 6 implies that the age mass exchange flux per unit length of fracture in eq 1 from the overlaying matrix amounts to the effective pore volumes of overlaying column i e f x θ om d m τ z z 0 0 h om θ om d z similarly f x from the underlying matrix column can be determined by integrating porosity over its entire thickness hum fig 1 summing up all source terms at a given location x from both underlaying and overlaying columns yields the total f x 7 f x 0 h om θ om d z 0 h um θ um d z p v x in summary f x in eq 1 represents the effective pore volume pv per unit length of fracture for the overlying and underlying columns at any given x location fig 1 this is consistent with the previous findings for the aquifer aquitard system where homogeneous porosity is assumed bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 here we further confirm that the finding the age mass exchange flux is equivalent to the pore volume of the surrounding matrix column is also applicable to the heterogeneous systems consequently eq 1 can be rewritten as 8 u d τ dx d d 2 τ d x 2 1 pv x h f θ f note that θf 1 for fracture the second term on the right hand of eq 8 suggests that the effects of source term pv x are expected to attenuate over fracture aperture 2 3 quantification of pore volume based on analytical solution of groundwater age considering the boundary conditions eqs 2 3 the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with a source term i e eq 8 can be solved analytically following the method provided by van genuchten and alves 1982 the solution to τ at the location x l is given as 9 τ λ l u λ d u 2 e u l d 1 where λ is a to be determined coefficient depending on the average value of pv x m along the longitudinal direction i e pv x the mean pore volume per unit length of fracture where pv x varies due to irregular geometry of heterogeneous matrix fig 1 note that λ is described as 10 λ pv x θ f h f 1 θ f since λ can be estimated based on measurable τ in eq 9 the estimated λ can be further used to quantify pv x using eq 10 11 pv x θ f λ 1 h f in summary the measurable τ or solute residence time at location l can be used to estimate λ with the aid of eq 9 which is further employed to approximate pv x given that h f is known according to eq 11 ultimately the total effective pore volume i e pvt m2 of the entire surrounding matrix is the product of pv x and l 12 pv t pv x l 3 methods for validating proposed theoretical framework to quantify effective pore volume to validate the newly proposed theoretical framework for quantifying effective pore volume in the surrounding heterogeneous matrix based on mean groundwater age or the solute residence time we first conduct forward modeling by solving the age mass transport process in a single fracture matrix preferential flow system namely case a fig 2 a next we solve the solute transport process in a fracture network matrix system namely case b fig 2b where the breakthrough curve btc is used to approximate the mean age mass i e residence time note that the effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix serves as an input variable in the numerical simulation domains the numerically computed mean age mass is employed to estimate pvt based on eqs 9 12 the robustness of the theoretical framework is supported by the nuance between numerically derived pvt and input value in the numerical models 3 1 preferential flow case a age mass transport in single fracture matrix system fractures are ubiquitous in the subsurface candela et al 2012 that often serve as preferential flow paths since they are more permeable or conductive compared to the surrounding porous matrix becker and tsoflias 2010 berkowitz 2002 to assess the validity and generality of the proposed theoretical framework we design a two dimensional 2 d age mass transport simulation for a fracture matrix system with an irregular shaped domain where a parallel plate a classical fracture model with h f 1 mm is surrounded by irregular geometries with no flux walls following various sinusoidal functions fig 2a the magnitude of sinusoidal functions is 0 8 m and 1 m and wavelengths of 15 m and 10 m for overlaying matrix and underlaying matrix respectively the sinusoidal functions are used here for demonstrating the flexibility of the proposed framework to estimate the effective pore volume of domains with complex boundaries such as the undulations found in aquifers and aquitards due to tectonic deformation to further test the applicability of the framework for the heterogeneous system we synthetically specify an exponential decay function of θ for representing heterogeneous matrix where θ ranges from 0 15 to 0 26 fig 2a note that for the benchmark case the total domain length l 30 m fig 2a and table 1 the flow in the fracture is driven from left to right by a constant pressure gradient of 10 pa m with a mean velocity u of 72 m d table 1 calculated following the cubic law wang et al 2015 witherspoon et al 1980 here reynolds number re ρuh f μ is 0 83 in which ρ is fluid density 1000 kg m3 and μ is fluid viscosity 0 001 pa s note that there is no flow in the surrounding matrix following assumptions used by many previous studies roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 therefore only diffusion occurs in the porous matrix regarding boundary conditions for age mass transport we used the dirichlet boundary at the inlet τ 0 and neumann boundary at the outlet fig 2a by doing so the age accumulates from inlet to outlet along with advection diffusion dispersion processes the dispersion coefficient d is calculated assuming an asymptotic dispersion i e d uh f 2 210d m following previous studies dentz and carrera 2007 wang et al 2012 for spatial discretization we adopt a very fine mesh size i e 0 1h f in fracture and relatively coarse mesh size i e 100h f approaching the edge of the surrounding matrix in total we have around 2 million triangular elements fig 3 a numerical solutions are insensitive to the further refinement of the mesh size the simulation of 2 d advection dispersion diffusion processes for age mass transport in a steady state flow field is implemented using comsol multiphysics a finite element based commercial software the simulations can complete in just a few minutes of the wall clock in a memory shared multi core workstation with 256 gb memory after solving age mass for the fracture matrix system fig 3b we calculate flux weighted age mass at the outlet that is used to determine the pore volume of the surrounding matrix following eqs 9 12 we use the relative error epv for assessing the goodness of the theoretical framework in estimating effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix which is defined as 13 e pv pv t pv input pv input where pvinput stands for the model s input value of pore volume 3 2 preferential flow case b solute transport in fracture network matrix system single fractures are hydraulically connected in space forming a fracture network frampton et al 2019 hyman et al 2021 which becomes an idealized complex setting for validating our proposed framework in natural settings the location length direction aperture and density of single fractures in the subsurface approximately follow the law of large numbers of mathematical statistics berrone et al 2018 dong et al 2018 therefore the discrete fracture network can be generated with the monte carlo method where different geometric parameters can be specified that follow diverse mathematical distributions including lognormal distribution poisson distribution negative exponential distribution etc li et al 2017 o malley et al 2018 in this study two groups of fractures in a 2 d domain with a size of 5 m 5 m are tested fig 2b where fracture length follows a lognormal distribution and the orientation angle of strike follows a normal distribution specifically for the horizontally extended group the mean value and standard deviation of fracture length are respectively 4 95 m and 0 59 m and the mean value and standard deviation of orientation angle are 0 and 1 respectively for the vertically extended group the mean value and standard deviation of length are 0 79 m and 0 01 m and the mean value and standard deviation of orientation angle are 90 and 1 respectively all single fractures have a uniform aperture of 1 mm to particularly investigate the sole effects of fracture network structure on solute transport rather than the fracture roughness whereas the matrix has a porosity of 0 25 we conduct solute transport simulation in the above mentioned fracture network matrix system like age mass transport through the single fracture matrix system flow only occurs in the preferential flow path i e the discrete fracture network which is obtained by solving the navier stokes and continuity equations 14 ρ u u p μ 2 u u 0 where u m s is the velocity vector fluid flows from bottom to top driven by a prescribed pressure gradient p pa m with the dirichlet boundary condition fig 2b where the shortest tortuous flow length l 13 03 m based on the spatial structure of fracture network the mean velocity u 16 45 m d following the cubic law and re 0 19 table 1 in other words both advection and diffusion dispersion are considered in the fracture network but only diffusion is present in the surrounding matrix fig 2b the solute is transmitted from the bottom with a given dimensionless concentration c 1 to the top where diffusive dispersive flux is zero all other boundaries are set as no flux boundary conditions the strategy of meshing the domain is similar to the single fracture matrix system where a finer mesh is used for the fracture and a coarser mesh for the matrix with a total number of triangular elements amounting to 10 million beyond which the numerical result becomes insensitive to further refinement of the mesh size this simulation is also implemented using comsol multiphysics we finally evaluate the flux weighted concentration at the outlet to obtain the breakthrough curve fig 4 which can be further used to estimate the dispersion coefficient and mean residence time as described below for demonstration purposes we plot the solute transport process over time as insets in fig 4 considering the complex fracture matrix interactions along the fracture network flow paths and the applied continuous concentration boundary condition the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d 3 98 10 4 m2 s is calculated following the second moment method based on the breakthrough curve yeo 2001 15 d σ t 2 u s 2 2 t 0 5 where the standard deviation σt s is 16 σ t t 0 84 t 0 16 2 us m s is the apparent solute transport velocity us l t 0 5 t 0 16 t 0 5 t 0 84 are the time when normalized concentration amounts to 0 1587 0 5 and 0 8413 respectively moreover we calculate the flux weighted mean residence time or age mass at the outlet based on the breakthrough curves 17 τ 0 1 c d t where c is the flux weighted normalized concentration that is the ratio of effluent solute mass to the total injected solute mass the estimated τ is further used to estimate epv for assessing the applicability of framework as discussed in eq 13 4 results 4 1 applicability of framework for preferential flow case a the calculated age mass τ 737 99 day is evaluated at the outlet based on the numerical simulation of case a which is further used to determine the effective pore volume of the surrounding matrix following eqs 9 12 we find that the numerically calculated pvt 53 108 m2 based on τ matches well with the model s input value pvinput 53 107 m2 where epv 0 003 demonstrates the robustness of our proposed theoretical framework to estimate pvt for the single fracture matrix preferential flow system considering a significant heterogeneous matrix 4 2 applicability of framework for preferential flow case b we estimate τ 174 21 days for the solute transport case in fracture network matrix system for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed theoretical framework using eqs 9 12 based on τ yield numerically derived pvt 6 79 m2 which matches the input value pvinput 6 23 m2 with epv 9 04 once again the goodness of matching pvt suggests that the proposed theoretical framework derived based on the local fracture system is viable to estimate surrounding pvt for the global fracture network system where tortuous flow paths are present with complex interactions between fracture and matrix 5 discussion and limitations of theoretical framework for determining effective pore volume in heterogeneous formations 5 1 scale sensitivity analysis of theoretical framework for determining effective pore volume compared to other methods espinal 2012 ley cooper et al 2008 our theoretical framework has the advantage of accurately estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale to support this scale invariant feature and while considering the computational challenge for the fracture network case we only incrementally increase the length l of the simulation domain for the single fracture matrix flow system whereas all other numerical configurations remain unchanged compared to the benchmark with l 30 m table 1 fig 2a and 3a 3b e g h f remain constant specifically by varying l l h f ranges broadly from 1 104 to 1 105 with an interval of 1 104 these numerical simulations are also implemented using comsol multiphysics with over 2 million triangular elements for the largest scale domain we find that the estimated pvt matches well with pvinput fig 3c for a broad range of length scales where the overall epv is acceptable and insensitive to the length scale with epv reaching up to 9 10 5 fig 3c this suggests that our theoretical framework performs well in estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale we find that although epv is acceptably small the absolute value of epv generally decreases with length scale and stabilizes very quickly to an asymptotic value the stabilizing difference is likely because the assumptions underlying the theoretical framework are more valid for the single fracture matrix system i e fracture aperture is orders of magnitude smaller than the thickness of the surrounding porous matrix thus the flow and transport processes in a single fracture can be impeccably treated as a 1 d problem 5 2 implications of accurately estimating pore volume in heterogeneous formations with the aid of tracer experiments or age dating techniques groundwater age or residence time can be well constrained for example by injecting solute into the subsurface and measuring the breakthrough curves we can roughly estimate solute residence time drummond et al 2012 haggerty et al 2000 alternatively isotopic measurements e g carbon14 can be used to estimate groundwater age or residence time sudicky and frind 1981 based on the measurable age residence time along with estimated velocity dispersion coefficient and hydraulically equivalent aperture the proposed framework can be thus useful for accurately determining the effective pore volume for the multiscale heterogeneous fracture matrix systems described in this study the advantage of our theoretical framework is to save time and resources to indirectly estimate the effective pore volume with high fidelity outcomes that reasonably capture large scale about hundreds of meters heterogeneity moreover the estimates derived from the groundwater age can also be used to validate the geophysics retrieved dataset that usually has a coarse spatial resolution feng et al 2020 hence our new theoretical framework provides a promising opportunity to cross validate the potential datasets of subsurface pore volume measured by geophysical and laboratory methods given that the ground truth of pore volume for heterogeneous formations is unknown and almost impossible to estimate our framework is only validated based on our hypothetic numerical simulations future work will be conducted in laboratory experiments to further prove the robustness and application of the presented framework for a diversity of geological settings 5 3 the potential for predicting effective pore volume in other preferential flow systems although our framework is theoretically derived based on fracture flow system surrounding low permeable zones with negligible velocity i e advection dominantly occurs in the high permeable flow paths such systems can be found in various subsurface natural settings for example groundwater flow passing stagnant zones gassiat et al 2013 jiang et al 2012 fluid flow through widely accepted dual porosity or dual permeability porous media andrés et al 2021 mass transport through mobile immobile zones gao et al 2010 porta et al 2015 wang et al 2020 in the above systems multiple rate mass transfer between preferential flow domain and matrix might be present haggerty and gorelick 1995 despite that our framework only considers molecular diffusion the age mass exchange flux between preferential flow and matrix is independent of multiple diffusion rates which however only depends on the pore volume of the matrix following the eq 7 and is consistent with previous findings bethke and johnson 2002 bethke and johnson 2008 consequently once the mean groundwater age or residence time can be measured in the systems mentioned above our framework can be applied to determine the effective pore volumes of the relatively low permeable or immobile zones which are practically difficult to obtain 5 4 the limitations for predicting pore volume considering truncated residence time the breakthrough curves can be theoretically used to estimate mean residence time assuming the concentration can be measured with an infinite duration however the practical measurement normally terminates at a time when concentration is below the detection limit luo et al 2006 this likely leads to a truncated residence time that would expectedly underestimate the mean groundwater age and potentially increase error epv we further assess the effects of truncated residence time on estimating effective pore volume using our framework based on case b i e fracture network matrix system since the breakthrough curve is readily available we find that the error epv expectedly increases due to the truncated residence time fig 5 however as the transport in the fracture network matrix system evolves over sufficient time scale or the pore volumes the accuracy in epv is recovered to within 10 for example epv of 50 reduces to 10 between the transport of 150 and 628 tpv respectively fig 5 the dimensionless time tpv is defined as 18 t pv t q v f where t s is time q m2 s discharge vf m2 is the total volume of a fracture network in the two dimensional space we note that epv tends to be within 10 when sampling time is greater than 628 tpv or when the normalized concentration is 0 94 assuming a normalized concentration of 0 94 is quite likely to be detected and accuracy of within 10 our proposed framework offers promise to its application to real world scenarios the dimensionless time tpv represents water flushing time over the volume of the fracture network therefore the solute migration in fracture and its diffusive mixing with matrix requires a larger time scale to sample the complex interactions between the fracture network and matrix as such solute tailing is expected to be more prominent hyman and dentz 2021 and which can induce error e g epv on approaching 50 with early truncated times on the other hand the solute tailing might be shortened for some flow systems with a single preferential flow path lee et al 2015 wang and cardenas 2017 this indicates that the discussed accuracy 10 of our proposed framework is likely viable with early truncated times as well in certain circumstances note that epv at large tpv is expected to be trivial but is non negligible in our study fig 5 i e epv keeps increasing with tpv where epv is potentially greater than 9 when time surpasses 1800 tpv this is mainly due to the following reasons 1 there are uncertainties in estimating mean velocity and dispersion coefficient for the fracture network system 2 the accuracy of numerical simulation gets limited due to computational challenges of using very fine element size for directly solving the navier stokes and advection diffusion equations our results suggest that given that the theory is valid the validation might be challenging in some real applications another caveat is that our model only considers transverse diffusion also known as linear diffusion from the preferential flow domain i e fractures to the surrounding matrix however other types of diffusion for example radial diffusion hoffmann et al 2020 might be present that violate the assumption behind our framework in such circumstances the spherical and cylindrical diffusive models might be more suitable and merit future efforts however the usage of transverse diffusion has been the most common way to study such preferential flow systems bethke and johnson 2008 hyman and dentz 2021 roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 especially for the fracture matrix interactions and where our proposed framework is applicable last our theoretical framework is derived based on a steady state flow field in the preferential fracture flow path in some circumstances the flow field is dynamically changing that might violate the validity of the proposed framework the applicability of using age mass to interpret the effective pore volume in a dynamic flow condition would be worthy of investigation in the future moreover the two phase water and air flow process involved in the vadose zone is complex that is not considered in the current theoretical framework köhne et al 2009 šimůnek et al 2003 6 conclusions we developed a theoretical paradigm to determine the effective pore volume of a multiscale heterogeneous fracture and surrounding porous matrix system by deriving an analytical solution to the age mass transport equation to test the robustness of the proposed theoretical model we conduct numerical simulations of flow and solute age transport by employing two typical preferential flow systems i e single fracture matrix and fracture network matrix systems with pronounced heterogeneity the numerical results confirm the robustness of the proposed theoretical paradigm with relative errors of less than 9 in quantifying effective pore volume when considering formation heterogeneity and tortuous flow paths more importantly once the groundwater age or inert solute residence time are known our proposed theoretical framework provides a feasible method for accurately estimating the effective pore volume regardless of the length scale some uncertainties remain related to the types of diffusion between the preferential flow domain and matrix and the effects of the truncated breakthrough curves when sampling at early times however the advantage of the proposed theoretical model which can include heterogeneity found at multiple length scales may overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods which either only work well at the local scale via core measurements or are less accurate at the large length scale since they rely on geophysical interpretations of data limited in spatial resolution credit authorship contribution statement lichun wang investigation methodology formal analysis visualization data curation writing

3287,serious urban floods are projected to occur more frequently in cities in the future due to continued global climate changes and accelerated urbanization however research dedicated to investigating the distribution patterns and exposure risks of urban floods among multiple cities is missing the urban flood records of 8 chinese megacities were used to explore the spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors of urban flooding and the potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions the results indicated that among the 8 megacities shanghai had the most flood events 264 points and wuhan had the highest heavy flood ratio 74 3 the flood points in all cities were significantly clustered but the mean distance between flood points in each city was quite different 443 1470 m the main factors affecting urban flooding in these chinese megacities were patch density of underlying surface green space ratio and road density based on the standardized coefficients of logistic regression the most vulnerable cities in terms of the total flood exposure risk to the population housing value and traffic conditions were tianjin shanghai and shanghai respectively however the flood points in tianjin beijing and beijing were the most vulnerable in terms of population housing value and traffic condition respectively according to the exposure risk index results the exposure risk of each flood point in beijing was the highest eripoint 0 57 while the exposure risk of the whole city in shanghai was the highest ericity 0 71 the comprehensive urban exposure risk index we proposed based on the potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions makes it possible to evaluate socioeconomic vulnerability among different cities and may provide guidance for stormwater management in megacities keywords urban flood exposure risk assessment spatial pattern population housing value traffic condition 1 introduction the world is undergoing drastic urbanization in 2020 4 4 billion people lived in cities and this number is expected to reach 6 7 billion by 2050 nations 2018 of which nearly 75 of urbanites will be in asia and africa science 2016 the rapid urbanization process inevitably leads to an increase in impervious surfaces and underground drainage pipelines which significantly change urban hydrological processes chen et al 2015 sun et al 2019 the spatial temporal variability in impervious surface area caused by urban growth could dramatically enhance the potential flooding risks especially in megacities such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou wang et al 2020 reported that every 1 increase in impervious surface fraction may increase the surface runoff by 5 51 mm year in beijing wang et al 2020 meanwhile as global warming continues abnormal weather phenomena occur frequently such as extreme precipitation typhoons and storm surge thus aggravating the increase in urban flood risks and causing serious flood losses lee et al 2017 according to the disaster records released by the chinese government from 2001 to 2018 more than 40 million people were affected by floods each year with economic losses of more than 10 billion sun et al 2020 in particular the urban flood disaster in beijing on july 21 2012 killed 79 people destroyed 8200 homes and caused economic losses of over 1 6 billion su et al 2018 riverine and coastal floods often attract more attention than urban floods because they seem to cause more damage hossain and meng 2020 nevertheless urban areas are most vulnerable to flash floods due to the high proportion of impervious surfaces studies on urban flooding have mainly focused on spatial temporal patterns kron et al 2019 kundzewicz et al 2019 influencing factors berndtsson et al 2019 bruwier et al 2020 flood susceptibility prediction choubin et al 2019 sadler et al 2017 tehrany et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 risk assessment ahmad and simonovic 2013 thanh son et al 2021 and preventive management cherqui et al 2015 liu et al 2014 among which distribution pattern analysis and risk assessment are fundamental and important research topics urban flood events are prone to be distributed in historic urban districts and present a significant spatial aggregation effect which is mainly due to the inadequate drainage density and high impervious proportion in old urban districts zhang et al 2020 the distribution pattern of urban floods is mainly affected by topographic conditions e g roughness relative elevation slope meteorological conditions e g extreme rainfall landscape patterns e g land cover configuration three dimensional building pattern and human activities e g drainage system urban planning hemmati et al 2020 ten veldhuis and clemens 2010 many minor urban flooding events are mainly due to drainage network dysfunctions rudari et al 2014 cherqui et al 2015 reported that 24 of the causes of minor urban floods in bordeaux were related to pipes e g fat and grease obstruction 41 to connections e g root obstruction and 35 to inlets e g gully pot blockage by leaves cherqui et al 2015 many methods were used to evaluate the impact of natural and socio economic factors on urban flooding such as logistic regression lr partial least squares random forest jamshed et al 2021 lee et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 lr is a powerful empirical model to explain the relationship of a number of independent variables to a dichotomous single dependent variable which represents the occurrence or non occurrence of an event kleinbaum et al 2002 yin et al 2022 the lr was first introduced by mcfadden 1973 which measures the probability of disaster in an area using specific formula that generates using the influencing factors mcfadden 1973 cities are the main places of human economic and social activities with concentrated high value assets and dense populations so the occurrence of urban flooding easily causes physical damage social interruption economic loss and environmental degradation yin et al 2015 additionally urban flash floods which are usually triggered within a few hours after the start of rainstorms greatly limit the response time of the people at risk and the emergency authorities thus increasing the potential impacts and hindering flood risk management aroca jiménez et al 2020 marchi et al 2010 terti et al 2015 therefore to quantitatively and comprehensively characterize the vulnerability of flooding in urban environments the urban exposure risk must be considered urban flood exposure risk refers to the potential loss of people property systems or other elements present in hazard areas rogelis et al 2016 quan 2014 applied stage damage curves to analyze the flooding loss rate of structure and contents of residential buildings and found that the annual average flooding loss of residence in shanghai central urban area was about cny 22 25 million quan 2014 urban flood exposure risks include not only damage to urban buildings and infrastructures but also injuries and deaths of residents diakakis 2014 moreira et al 2021 as an important infrastructure in cities roads make prominent contributions to the urban economy and society which makes the exposure risks of urban traffic unable to be ignored chen et al 2019 based on giems d15 about 35 of the global population 2 0 billion people 35 of urban areas 610 000 km2 and 18 of roads 3 3 million km are located within actively inundated areas in 2015 dryden et al 2021 most previous urban flooding studies focused on site specific or single city case studies lacking comparative analysis of large scale studies especially megacities due to the difficulty in obtaining flood point data huang et al 2018 flooding analysis over multiple cities and large scales can reveal the general distribution pattern and potential exposure risk characteristics of urban floods to fill the deficiency of large scale urban flood analysis 1154 urban flood points of 8 chinese megacities were used to 1 explore the flood distribution pattern characteristics 2 reveal the potential exposure risks to the urban economy and society 3 identify the dominant factors affecting urban floods this study provides potential implications for urban flood risk prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study 8 megacities beijing guangzhou nanjing shanghai shenzhen tianjin wuhan and xian in china were selected as the study areas of urban flooding fig 1 these cities are important and highly urbanized areas in central and eastern china with populations ranging from 9 to 24 million a total of 1154 flood records in 8 cities from 2015 to 2020 were collected from amap www amap com which included three flood degrees slight moderate and heavy floods the flood points of amap were mainly obtained through traffic police reporting user reporting and field monitoring data and the flooding points only have the location information and no specific flooding occurrence time liu et al 2019 the polygon feature dataset of individual buildings in these cities in 2017 was collected which included the number of floors of each building in the urban built up area fig 2 b and the accuracy of building heights data was 86 78 according to the verification results of the actual building heights measured by lasercraft contour xlric liu et al 2021 2 2 average nearest neighbor analysis the average nearest neighbor was used to calculate the distance between each feature centroid and its nearest neighbor s centroid location mitchel 2005 in this study the average nearest neighbor ratio annr calculated as the observed average distance divided by the expected average distance was selected to evaluate the distribution clustered or dispersed of flood points in each city eqs 1 3 1 annr d o d e 2 d o i 1 n d i n 3 d e 0 5 n a where do is the observed average distance between each flood points and its nearest neighbor point de is the expected average distance for the flood points given in a random pattern di is the distance between point i and it s nearest neighboring point n is the total number of food points in a city and a is the built up area of a city when the annr is 1 the distribution pattern of flood points presents aggregation distribution if the annr is 1 the flood points are randomly distributed when the annr is greater than 1 the trend indicates dispersion melyantono et al 2021 the p value is the probability that the observed spatial pattern was created by random process when p 0 05 the flooding points exhibit statistically significant clustering or dispersion and the annr index was calculated in arcgis 2 3 exposure risk analysis urban flood exposure risk refers to the overall flood disaster losses under certain hazard intensities including damage to residents houses and public facilities quan 2014 sun et al 2020 the actual catchments of urban rainfall runoff are obviously different from the catchments of natural watersheds the urban catchments are mainly affected by the main drainage network arranged along the main roads li et al 2021 therefore blocks or urban functional zones are often regarded as urban runoff catchments the length of blocks in china is generally 300 800 m and some public services such as primary schools and bus stations have a service radius of 500 m this 500 m service radius is generally considered the daily life radius of residents and the area most vulnerable to flooding lin et al 2018 a buffer zone of 500 m around each flood point was adopted as the affected area to assess the different kinds of exposure risks as shown in fig 2 d in this study the flood exposure risks were evaluated based on the potential affected population pap housing value pahv and traffic condition patc in the 500 m catchment area around the flood points the pap of a certain flood point was calculated from the sum of population within 500 m around the pahv was calculated from the total housing value within 500 m around and the patc was calculated from the average traffic condition within 500 m around the population data with 100 100 m spatial resolution in 2017 used in this paper were derived from the updated gridded population map of ye et al 2019 fig 2 a the gridded population map for china at 100 m spatial resolution was produced by spatially disaggregate census data within a random forest model using multiple kinds of remote sensing images nighttime light image spot ndvi image and dem and points of interests compared with worldpop this data held higher accuracy r2 0 80 in the medially populated regions and its accuracy in either highly or lowly populated areas r2 0 57 or r2 0 47 was increased ye et al 2019 the average pap refers to the average number of people affected by each flood point in a certain degree of flood in a city the housing price data of each community in these cities in 2020 were collected from the housing transaction intermediary website www anjunke com fig 2 c the building values within 500 m around the flood points were treated as the housing values affected by the flooding the traffic condition of flood points was manually divided into 5 categories according to the road width and the distance from the intersection where the flood points were located the potential influence of flooding on traffic increases gradually with the increase in traffic levels from 1 to 5 traffic level 1 refers to the flood points in nonroad areas and 5 refers to flooding at main road intersections or important traffic facilities the urban underlying surface within 500 m around the flood points were manually interpreted into five types including road water building green space and other impervious surface fig 2 d in this study the three kinds of exposure risks including the damages to residents houses and effects to traffic conditions are the components of the overall risk but they cannot be directly compared due to different units to represent the comprehensive urban flood exposure risks the exposure risk index eri for flood points and cities was designed based on the pap pahv and patc of three flood degrees eqs 4 and 5 eripoint was calculated by the average loss of all flood points in a city which indicated the average exposure risk of all flood points in a city ericity was calculated by the total loss of all flood points in a city which revealed the total exposure risk of the city 4 eri point i 1 3 f i 1 3 p i 1 3 h i 1 3 t i 5 eri city i 1 3 f i 1 3 p i 1 3 h i 1 3 t i where eripoint is the average eri of all flood points in a city i is the three different flood degrees slight moderate and heavy flood fi is the weight coefficient for three flood degrees pi is the normalized average pap of all flood points in a city hi is the normalized average pahv of all flood points in a city ti is the normalized average patc of all flood points in a city ericity is the total eri of all flood points in a city pi is the normalized total pap of all flood points in a city hi is the normalized total pahv of all flood points in a city and ti is the normalized total patc of all flood points in a city it is difficult to accurately determine the fi of slight moderate and heavy floods so we assumed that the weights of different flood degrees were 1 6 2 6 and 3 6 we also assumed that the risks to population housing and traffic were equally important so the weight coefficients of the three indicators were all 1 3 based on previous literature su et al 2018 sun et al 2020 2 4 logistic regression in this study a total of 9 potential factors of topography landscape pattern drainage capacity and rainfall related to urban flooding were selected as independent variables for lr analysis to reveal the driving forces of urban flood based on previous researches hossain and meng 2020 lin et al 2021 tehrany et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the independent variables we used for lr analysis were relative elevation re patch density pd green space ratio gsr mean building height mbh floor area ratio far distance to river dtr road density rd annual rainfall ar and monthly maximum precipitation mmp since 500 m is a common block length and the service radius in chinese cities this study took the 500 m grid of 8 urban built up areas as the lr analysis unit the topographic variable of re was calculated by dem data https earthexplorer usgs gov the landscape pattern of pd and gsr were calculated by urban land use data and mbh and far were calculated by the building heights data the quantity of the water area and river structure decided the ability of flood proofing and absorption liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2006 and street network has a strong correlation with drainage network mair et al 2017 therefore dtr and rd were used to characterize the urban drainage capacity which were calculated by surface water data and road network data downloaded from the national geomatics center of china http www ngcc cn and the built up area of each city was also obtained from the national geomatics center of china the rainfall variables of ar and mmp were calculated by the annual precipitation and monthly precipitation data obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn all 8 independent variables were calculated on the 500 m grid and then normalized the flooding event of each grid was utilized as dependent variable and dependent variable is 1 if flood point exists in the grid and dependent variable is 0 if flood point does not exist tolerance tol and variance inflation factor vif are two important indices used for multicollinearity diagnosis ozdemir 2016 tol smaller than 0 2 is an indicator for multicollinearity between independent variables and tol smaller than 0 1 suggests serious multicollinearity menard 1995 the standardized coefficient bs was calculated to evaluate the influence of each factors based on eq 1 menard 2004 a positive bs explains that the factor increases the probability of flood while a negative coefficient asserts that the factor decreases the probability and the larger the absolute value of bs the stronger the influence of factor on the probability of flood 6 b s b s x π 3 where b is the sample estimate of the unstandardized logistic regression coefficient sx is the sample standard deviation of the predictor x 3 results 3 1 distribution patterns of flood points there were great differences in the distribution characteristics of flood points in 8 megacities fig 3 in terms of the number of flood points shanghai had the most flood points 264 points while nanjing had the fewest flood points 68 points according to the built up area of each city in 2017 statistics 2018 the density of urban flood points in shanghai was the highest 25 6 points 100 km2 the density in beijing was the lowest 7 7 points 100 km2 and the density in nanjing with the fewest flood points was the second lowest only 8 5 points 100 km2 in terms of flood degree wuhan and guangzhou had the highest heavy flood ratios the ratio of the number of heavy flood points to the total number of flood points in a city 74 3 and 61 5 respectively while shenzhen and xian had the lowest heavy flood ratios 2 8 and 5 3 respectively average nearest neighbor analysis was conducted to analyze the cluster characteristics of flood points of 8 cities the annr values of the 8 cities were 1 indicating that the distribution pattern of urban flood points in all these cities presented significant aggregation p 0 01 table 2 meanwhile the annr values of shanghai and xian were the smallest which were 0 50 and 0 55 respectively revealing that their aggregation degrees were the highest combined with the built up area the mean distance of flood points could reflect the actual average flood distribution of each city the annr 0 92 and the mean distance of flood points 1470 m in nanjing were the largest illustrating that the flood points in nanjing were relatively far away and tended to be randomly distributed 3 2 urban flood exposure risks 3 2 1 population the pap of each flood point within a 500 m catchment area in different flood degrees was calculated by the 2017 grid population map the average pap of tianjin was the largest among the eight cities in different flood degrees which exceeded 60 of the whole study area the average potential population affected by slight floods was 18845 that affected by moderate floods was 19828 that affected by heavy floods was 23211 and the mean of the total flood points was 19 789 in tianjin table 3 the average pap for each flood point in nanjing was the lowest for moderate floods 4266 heavy floods 4200 and the mean of the total flood points 7828 and that of shanghai was the lowest for slight floods 8879 tianjin had the largest total pap 3 01 106 followed by shanghai 2 51 106 and wuhan 1 94 106 fig 4 a although tianjin and shanghai had the largest populations affected by flooding most of them were affected by slight and moderate floods and the proportion of pap for heavy floods was small accounting for 20 8 and 16 3 of the total pap respectively nevertheless guangzhou and wuhan had the largest population and the highest proportion of heavy floods 0 69 106 and 62 6 and 1 44 106 and 73 9 respectively which was consistent with the distribution characteristics of urban flood points in these two cities 3 2 2 housing value among the 8 cities beijing had the largest mean pahv 40 68 109 yuan while xian had the smallest 8 77 109 yuan table 4 for different flood degrees the pahv of slight floods in beijing was the highest while that in xian was the smallest the average housing value affected by moderate and heavy floods was highest in shanghai and lowest in nanjing and the gap between the two cities was 4 9 times the total pahv of these cities varied greatly from 0 97 nanjing to 9 47 shanghai 1012 yuan fig 4 b the total pahv of shanghai 9 47 1012 yuan was the highest and the pahv of heavy floods 1 82 1012 yuan was also the highest among the 8 cities the proportion of pahv of heavy floods in guangzhou was highest 71 95 while nanjing had the lowest proportion only 2 91 3 2 3 traffic condition although it is difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of floods on traffic we evaluated the potential risk of floods on traffic conditions by grading the roads and intersections where floods occur the results indicated that beijing and shenzhen had the highest average patc of flood points and wuhan and guangzhou had the lowest table 5 for the overall traffic condition of 8 cities affected by floods shanghai was the most affected total patc was the largest while nanjing was the least affected fig 4 c the traffic conditions of guangzhou and wuhan were mainly affected by heavy floods 3 3 exposure risk index according to the eripoint of the flood points in 8 cities beijing shenzhen and shanghai were the highest flood risk cities of flood points eripoint were 0 57 0 52 and 0 51 respectively while wuhan and nanjing were the lowest flood risk cities eripoint were 0 28 and 0 29 fig 5 a the main components of eripoint in the different cities were obviously different for the flood points in the different cities the pap risk as part of eripoint was the main risk in tianjin and wuhan nanjing shenzhen and xian were mainly affected by patc risk and shanghai was mainly vulnerable to pahv risk the ericity varied greatly among the 8 cities which reflected the total flood risks of each city fig 5 b shanghai had the highest ericity 0 71 which indicated that the total flood risk in shanghai was the highest among the 8 cities nanjing had the lowest total flood risk with the smallest ericity 0 05 for the total flood risk of each city the pap risks of wuhan shanghai and tianjin were higher than that of other cities the pahv risk of shanghai was highest among 8 cities and the patc risks of shanghai and wuhan were higher than those of other cities 3 4 logistic regression analysis in this study the multicollinearity test results demonstrated that 9 influencing factors were all tol greater than 0 2 and vif 10 which indicated that there were no significant multicollinearity issues between independent variables after the multicollinearity test influencing factors of each city were examined in the forward stepwise lr model to estimate the influence of each factor on urban flood the bs of significant influencing factors of each city and the total study area on the probability of urban flood were calculated fig 6 for the whole study area there were 7 factors that have a significant impact p 0 05 on urban flood except that gsr is negatively correlated with flood other factors are positively correlated among which pd bs 0 31 and gsr bs 0 31 have the greatest influence on urban flood followed by rd bs 0 18 for different cities there were generally 3 to 4 factors that have significant impacts pd and rd were the common significant factors affecting flood in all cities in addition gsr has a significant negative impact on other cities except nanjing and shanghai and the influence is also large 0 73 bs 0 22 4 discussion 4 1 influencing factors urban floods are a comprehensive urban hydrologic cycle problem caused by the combined action of many different factors according to the results of average nearest neighbor analysis the flood events in 8 megacities revealed a significant aggregation effect annr 1 and p 0 01 with the mean distance of flood points in different cities ranging from 443 to 1470 m meanwhile the flood points were mainly clustered in the central urban area of each city through lr analysis this flood agglomeration mainly due to the high intensity of urbanization of the inner city resulting in the increase of pd and rd and the decrease of gsr huang et al 2018 li et al 2021 su et al 2018 these identified flood agglomeration areas and hotspots are particularly important for government managers or urban planners to mitigate urban floods and reduce exposure risks zhang et al 2020 for a city or small community drainage capacity and urban landscape patterns have a great impact on flooding while on a large scale meteorological such as ar and mmr and topographic factors such as re will significantly influence the frequency and severity of flooding darabi et al 2019 du et al 2015 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 revealed that the influencing factors of urban floods presenting a strong scale effect which is mainly affected by topography on small analysis scale 1 km and land cover composition on large scale 5 km zhang et al 2020 ma et al 2018 found that precipitation geographical conditions and urban construction were the main causes of urban flash floods ma et al 2018 xu et al 2021 indicated that the increase rate of urban flood risk in the part with permeability of 0 35 is greatest according to the two dimensional flood model xu et al 2021 there were great differences in flooding characteristics among different cities this study found that while shenzhen and guangzhou are located very near one another the proportion of heavy floods in shenzhen was only 2 8 while 61 5 of flood points in guangzhou were heavy floods in addition to the common pd gsp and rd influencing factors of flooding in guangzhou and shenzhen dtr was also a significant factor in guangzhou according to the lr analysis results there were many river networks in the built up area of guangzhou in the rainy season heavy rainfall may cause the river backflow and exacerbate urban flooding previous researchers have studied the urban flood risks of different cities and found that urbanization areas especially coastal cities with large populations and high gdp are prone to suffer more flooding damage fang et al 2020 hu et al 2018 shi et al 2020 three essential and primary potential affected elements pap pahv and patc were used to evaluate the flood exposure loss of flood points and cities in this study the results indicated that the risk of flood exposure varied greatly in 8 cities and the eri of shanghai was 15 times that of nanjing moreover there were also great differences in the key components of the eri value in each city due to the differences in urban socioeconomic conditions the total flood risk of beijing was relatively small ericity was 0 20 mainly because most flood points were slight floods and the potential impacts of floods on population and traffic conditions were small the ericity values of pap and patc were 0 04 and 0 06 4 2 advantages and contributions this study indicates that average nearest neighbor analysis as a powerful tool to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of urban flood points which could be used to compare flood heterogeneity among cities multisource big data such as high spatial resolution population grid data housing price data based on housing intermediaries and road traffic level data were used in this study to evaluate the exposure risk of urban floods the composite index eri proposed by us can comprehensively reflect the three main aspects the impact on residents buildings and traffic conditions of the impact of flooding in different cities which can be used to evaluate the risk degrees and loss composition of flooding in different cities of urban agglomerations regions or countries and propose corresponding prevention and control measures accordingly 4 2 1 uncertainties and limitations in addition to the advantages of the exposure risk analysis of urban floods described above this study has limitations the first and important uncertainty is the bias in reported flood events the flood points data of amap was reported by different kinds of urban residents such as traffic police pedestrians drivers and flood investigators due to the different intuitive feelings and professional background of the reporters the judgment criteria for the severity of flood will be inconsistent although the catchment area of different regions may vary greatly due to differences in terrain and drainage systems the same buffer zone 500 m was identified as the affected area to assess the flood exposure risks meanwhile the relatively short period of flood records may not be sufficient to represent the overall flood risk of these cities the amount and depth of flooding produced by different degrees of flooding will be different resulting in different flood losses at the same site however the potential affected loss was calculated based on the original value within the influence range of 500 m and the difference of three flood degrees was not considered in this study furthermore the weight coefficients of different flood degrees and three risk indicators were determined based on experience and relevant papers which may be different from the actual values based on quantitative assessment hossain and meng 2020 xu et al 2018 flood risk includes many components such as vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience aroca jiménez et al 2020 sun et al 2020 while the most influential dimensions social and economic of flood exposure in urban environments were analyzed in this study future studies could set different weight coefficients according to their research purposes if the goal is to protect the personal safety of residents the weight of pap will increase and if the goal is to protect property safety the weight of pahv will increase the promotion of the method proposed in this paper may be subject to the existence of these flood points population housing value and other data 5 conclusions in this study the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of actual flood points in 8 megacities and their potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions were analyzed and a comprehensive index was proposed to evaluate the exposure risks of flooding in different cities the method we proposed makes it possible to evaluate flood patterns and compare socioeconomic vulnerability among different cities our findings revealed that shanghai had the most flood points 264 points and wuhan had the highest heavy flood ratio 74 3 the distribution pattern of urban flood points in all these cities presented significant aggregation p 0 01 but the mean distance of flood points varied from 443 to 1470 m by evaluating the bs of logistic regression we found that the main factors affecting urban flooding in these chinese megacities were patch density of underlying surface green space ratio and road density the pap pahv and patc of each flood point within the 500 m catchment area in different flood degrees were calculated using the 2017 grid population map housing price data and road traffic level data the average and total pap of tianjin were the largest among the 8 cities the average pahv of each flood point in beijing was the highest however the total pahv of shanghai was the highest reaching 9 47 1012 yuan the traffic conditions of flood points in beijing were more vulnerable to flooding while flooding in shanghai had a greater impact on the whole urban traffic condition according to the eri results the mean exposure risk of flood points in beijing was the highest eripoint 0 57 while the overall exposure risk of the whole city in shanghai was the highest ericity 0 71 meanwhile the main influencing factors of eri in different cities varied greatly indicating that flooding in cities had different degrees of effects on population buildings and transportation the potential implications of this study can provide guidance for future intercity flood risk research help government managers identify flood risk patterns

3287,serious urban floods are projected to occur more frequently in cities in the future due to continued global climate changes and accelerated urbanization however research dedicated to investigating the distribution patterns and exposure risks of urban floods among multiple cities is missing the urban flood records of 8 chinese megacities were used to explore the spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors of urban flooding and the potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions the results indicated that among the 8 megacities shanghai had the most flood events 264 points and wuhan had the highest heavy flood ratio 74 3 the flood points in all cities were significantly clustered but the mean distance between flood points in each city was quite different 443 1470 m the main factors affecting urban flooding in these chinese megacities were patch density of underlying surface green space ratio and road density based on the standardized coefficients of logistic regression the most vulnerable cities in terms of the total flood exposure risk to the population housing value and traffic conditions were tianjin shanghai and shanghai respectively however the flood points in tianjin beijing and beijing were the most vulnerable in terms of population housing value and traffic condition respectively according to the exposure risk index results the exposure risk of each flood point in beijing was the highest eripoint 0 57 while the exposure risk of the whole city in shanghai was the highest ericity 0 71 the comprehensive urban exposure risk index we proposed based on the potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions makes it possible to evaluate socioeconomic vulnerability among different cities and may provide guidance for stormwater management in megacities keywords urban flood exposure risk assessment spatial pattern population housing value traffic condition 1 introduction the world is undergoing drastic urbanization in 2020 4 4 billion people lived in cities and this number is expected to reach 6 7 billion by 2050 nations 2018 of which nearly 75 of urbanites will be in asia and africa science 2016 the rapid urbanization process inevitably leads to an increase in impervious surfaces and underground drainage pipelines which significantly change urban hydrological processes chen et al 2015 sun et al 2019 the spatial temporal variability in impervious surface area caused by urban growth could dramatically enhance the potential flooding risks especially in megacities such as beijing shanghai and guangzhou wang et al 2020 reported that every 1 increase in impervious surface fraction may increase the surface runoff by 5 51 mm year in beijing wang et al 2020 meanwhile as global warming continues abnormal weather phenomena occur frequently such as extreme precipitation typhoons and storm surge thus aggravating the increase in urban flood risks and causing serious flood losses lee et al 2017 according to the disaster records released by the chinese government from 2001 to 2018 more than 40 million people were affected by floods each year with economic losses of more than 10 billion sun et al 2020 in particular the urban flood disaster in beijing on july 21 2012 killed 79 people destroyed 8200 homes and caused economic losses of over 1 6 billion su et al 2018 riverine and coastal floods often attract more attention than urban floods because they seem to cause more damage hossain and meng 2020 nevertheless urban areas are most vulnerable to flash floods due to the high proportion of impervious surfaces studies on urban flooding have mainly focused on spatial temporal patterns kron et al 2019 kundzewicz et al 2019 influencing factors berndtsson et al 2019 bruwier et al 2020 flood susceptibility prediction choubin et al 2019 sadler et al 2017 tehrany et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 risk assessment ahmad and simonovic 2013 thanh son et al 2021 and preventive management cherqui et al 2015 liu et al 2014 among which distribution pattern analysis and risk assessment are fundamental and important research topics urban flood events are prone to be distributed in historic urban districts and present a significant spatial aggregation effect which is mainly due to the inadequate drainage density and high impervious proportion in old urban districts zhang et al 2020 the distribution pattern of urban floods is mainly affected by topographic conditions e g roughness relative elevation slope meteorological conditions e g extreme rainfall landscape patterns e g land cover configuration three dimensional building pattern and human activities e g drainage system urban planning hemmati et al 2020 ten veldhuis and clemens 2010 many minor urban flooding events are mainly due to drainage network dysfunctions rudari et al 2014 cherqui et al 2015 reported that 24 of the causes of minor urban floods in bordeaux were related to pipes e g fat and grease obstruction 41 to connections e g root obstruction and 35 to inlets e g gully pot blockage by leaves cherqui et al 2015 many methods were used to evaluate the impact of natural and socio economic factors on urban flooding such as logistic regression lr partial least squares random forest jamshed et al 2021 lee et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 lr is a powerful empirical model to explain the relationship of a number of independent variables to a dichotomous single dependent variable which represents the occurrence or non occurrence of an event kleinbaum et al 2002 yin et al 2022 the lr was first introduced by mcfadden 1973 which measures the probability of disaster in an area using specific formula that generates using the influencing factors mcfadden 1973 cities are the main places of human economic and social activities with concentrated high value assets and dense populations so the occurrence of urban flooding easily causes physical damage social interruption economic loss and environmental degradation yin et al 2015 additionally urban flash floods which are usually triggered within a few hours after the start of rainstorms greatly limit the response time of the people at risk and the emergency authorities thus increasing the potential impacts and hindering flood risk management aroca jiménez et al 2020 marchi et al 2010 terti et al 2015 therefore to quantitatively and comprehensively characterize the vulnerability of flooding in urban environments the urban exposure risk must be considered urban flood exposure risk refers to the potential loss of people property systems or other elements present in hazard areas rogelis et al 2016 quan 2014 applied stage damage curves to analyze the flooding loss rate of structure and contents of residential buildings and found that the annual average flooding loss of residence in shanghai central urban area was about cny 22 25 million quan 2014 urban flood exposure risks include not only damage to urban buildings and infrastructures but also injuries and deaths of residents diakakis 2014 moreira et al 2021 as an important infrastructure in cities roads make prominent contributions to the urban economy and society which makes the exposure risks of urban traffic unable to be ignored chen et al 2019 based on giems d15 about 35 of the global population 2 0 billion people 35 of urban areas 610 000 km2 and 18 of roads 3 3 million km are located within actively inundated areas in 2015 dryden et al 2021 most previous urban flooding studies focused on site specific or single city case studies lacking comparative analysis of large scale studies especially megacities due to the difficulty in obtaining flood point data huang et al 2018 flooding analysis over multiple cities and large scales can reveal the general distribution pattern and potential exposure risk characteristics of urban floods to fill the deficiency of large scale urban flood analysis 1154 urban flood points of 8 chinese megacities were used to 1 explore the flood distribution pattern characteristics 2 reveal the potential exposure risks to the urban economy and society 3 identify the dominant factors affecting urban floods this study provides potential implications for urban flood risk prevention and control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data in this study 8 megacities beijing guangzhou nanjing shanghai shenzhen tianjin wuhan and xian in china were selected as the study areas of urban flooding fig 1 these cities are important and highly urbanized areas in central and eastern china with populations ranging from 9 to 24 million a total of 1154 flood records in 8 cities from 2015 to 2020 were collected from amap www amap com which included three flood degrees slight moderate and heavy floods the flood points of amap were mainly obtained through traffic police reporting user reporting and field monitoring data and the flooding points only have the location information and no specific flooding occurrence time liu et al 2019 the polygon feature dataset of individual buildings in these cities in 2017 was collected which included the number of floors of each building in the urban built up area fig 2 b and the accuracy of building heights data was 86 78 according to the verification results of the actual building heights measured by lasercraft contour xlric liu et al 2021 2 2 average nearest neighbor analysis the average nearest neighbor was used to calculate the distance between each feature centroid and its nearest neighbor s centroid location mitchel 2005 in this study the average nearest neighbor ratio annr calculated as the observed average distance divided by the expected average distance was selected to evaluate the distribution clustered or dispersed of flood points in each city eqs 1 3 1 annr d o d e 2 d o i 1 n d i n 3 d e 0 5 n a where do is the observed average distance between each flood points and its nearest neighbor point de is the expected average distance for the flood points given in a random pattern di is the distance between point i and it s nearest neighboring point n is the total number of food points in a city and a is the built up area of a city when the annr is 1 the distribution pattern of flood points presents aggregation distribution if the annr is 1 the flood points are randomly distributed when the annr is greater than 1 the trend indicates dispersion melyantono et al 2021 the p value is the probability that the observed spatial pattern was created by random process when p 0 05 the flooding points exhibit statistically significant clustering or dispersion and the annr index was calculated in arcgis 2 3 exposure risk analysis urban flood exposure risk refers to the overall flood disaster losses under certain hazard intensities including damage to residents houses and public facilities quan 2014 sun et al 2020 the actual catchments of urban rainfall runoff are obviously different from the catchments of natural watersheds the urban catchments are mainly affected by the main drainage network arranged along the main roads li et al 2021 therefore blocks or urban functional zones are often regarded as urban runoff catchments the length of blocks in china is generally 300 800 m and some public services such as primary schools and bus stations have a service radius of 500 m this 500 m service radius is generally considered the daily life radius of residents and the area most vulnerable to flooding lin et al 2018 a buffer zone of 500 m around each flood point was adopted as the affected area to assess the different kinds of exposure risks as shown in fig 2 d in this study the flood exposure risks were evaluated based on the potential affected population pap housing value pahv and traffic condition patc in the 500 m catchment area around the flood points the pap of a certain flood point was calculated from the sum of population within 500 m around the pahv was calculated from the total housing value within 500 m around and the patc was calculated from the average traffic condition within 500 m around the population data with 100 100 m spatial resolution in 2017 used in this paper were derived from the updated gridded population map of ye et al 2019 fig 2 a the gridded population map for china at 100 m spatial resolution was produced by spatially disaggregate census data within a random forest model using multiple kinds of remote sensing images nighttime light image spot ndvi image and dem and points of interests compared with worldpop this data held higher accuracy r2 0 80 in the medially populated regions and its accuracy in either highly or lowly populated areas r2 0 57 or r2 0 47 was increased ye et al 2019 the average pap refers to the average number of people affected by each flood point in a certain degree of flood in a city the housing price data of each community in these cities in 2020 were collected from the housing transaction intermediary website www anjunke com fig 2 c the building values within 500 m around the flood points were treated as the housing values affected by the flooding the traffic condition of flood points was manually divided into 5 categories according to the road width and the distance from the intersection where the flood points were located the potential influence of flooding on traffic increases gradually with the increase in traffic levels from 1 to 5 traffic level 1 refers to the flood points in nonroad areas and 5 refers to flooding at main road intersections or important traffic facilities the urban underlying surface within 500 m around the flood points were manually interpreted into five types including road water building green space and other impervious surface fig 2 d in this study the three kinds of exposure risks including the damages to residents houses and effects to traffic conditions are the components of the overall risk but they cannot be directly compared due to different units to represent the comprehensive urban flood exposure risks the exposure risk index eri for flood points and cities was designed based on the pap pahv and patc of three flood degrees eqs 4 and 5 eripoint was calculated by the average loss of all flood points in a city which indicated the average exposure risk of all flood points in a city ericity was calculated by the total loss of all flood points in a city which revealed the total exposure risk of the city 4 eri point i 1 3 f i 1 3 p i 1 3 h i 1 3 t i 5 eri city i 1 3 f i 1 3 p i 1 3 h i 1 3 t i where eripoint is the average eri of all flood points in a city i is the three different flood degrees slight moderate and heavy flood fi is the weight coefficient for three flood degrees pi is the normalized average pap of all flood points in a city hi is the normalized average pahv of all flood points in a city ti is the normalized average patc of all flood points in a city ericity is the total eri of all flood points in a city pi is the normalized total pap of all flood points in a city hi is the normalized total pahv of all flood points in a city and ti is the normalized total patc of all flood points in a city it is difficult to accurately determine the fi of slight moderate and heavy floods so we assumed that the weights of different flood degrees were 1 6 2 6 and 3 6 we also assumed that the risks to population housing and traffic were equally important so the weight coefficients of the three indicators were all 1 3 based on previous literature su et al 2018 sun et al 2020 2 4 logistic regression in this study a total of 9 potential factors of topography landscape pattern drainage capacity and rainfall related to urban flooding were selected as independent variables for lr analysis to reveal the driving forces of urban flood based on previous researches hossain and meng 2020 lin et al 2021 tehrany et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the independent variables we used for lr analysis were relative elevation re patch density pd green space ratio gsr mean building height mbh floor area ratio far distance to river dtr road density rd annual rainfall ar and monthly maximum precipitation mmp since 500 m is a common block length and the service radius in chinese cities this study took the 500 m grid of 8 urban built up areas as the lr analysis unit the topographic variable of re was calculated by dem data https earthexplorer usgs gov the landscape pattern of pd and gsr were calculated by urban land use data and mbh and far were calculated by the building heights data the quantity of the water area and river structure decided the ability of flood proofing and absorption liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2006 and street network has a strong correlation with drainage network mair et al 2017 therefore dtr and rd were used to characterize the urban drainage capacity which were calculated by surface water data and road network data downloaded from the national geomatics center of china http www ngcc cn and the built up area of each city was also obtained from the national geomatics center of china the rainfall variables of ar and mmp were calculated by the annual precipitation and monthly precipitation data obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn all 8 independent variables were calculated on the 500 m grid and then normalized the flooding event of each grid was utilized as dependent variable and dependent variable is 1 if flood point exists in the grid and dependent variable is 0 if flood point does not exist tolerance tol and variance inflation factor vif are two important indices used for multicollinearity diagnosis ozdemir 2016 tol smaller than 0 2 is an indicator for multicollinearity between independent variables and tol smaller than 0 1 suggests serious multicollinearity menard 1995 the standardized coefficient bs was calculated to evaluate the influence of each factors based on eq 1 menard 2004 a positive bs explains that the factor increases the probability of flood while a negative coefficient asserts that the factor decreases the probability and the larger the absolute value of bs the stronger the influence of factor on the probability of flood 6 b s b s x π 3 where b is the sample estimate of the unstandardized logistic regression coefficient sx is the sample standard deviation of the predictor x 3 results 3 1 distribution patterns of flood points there were great differences in the distribution characteristics of flood points in 8 megacities fig 3 in terms of the number of flood points shanghai had the most flood points 264 points while nanjing had the fewest flood points 68 points according to the built up area of each city in 2017 statistics 2018 the density of urban flood points in shanghai was the highest 25 6 points 100 km2 the density in beijing was the lowest 7 7 points 100 km2 and the density in nanjing with the fewest flood points was the second lowest only 8 5 points 100 km2 in terms of flood degree wuhan and guangzhou had the highest heavy flood ratios the ratio of the number of heavy flood points to the total number of flood points in a city 74 3 and 61 5 respectively while shenzhen and xian had the lowest heavy flood ratios 2 8 and 5 3 respectively average nearest neighbor analysis was conducted to analyze the cluster characteristics of flood points of 8 cities the annr values of the 8 cities were 1 indicating that the distribution pattern of urban flood points in all these cities presented significant aggregation p 0 01 table 2 meanwhile the annr values of shanghai and xian were the smallest which were 0 50 and 0 55 respectively revealing that their aggregation degrees were the highest combined with the built up area the mean distance of flood points could reflect the actual average flood distribution of each city the annr 0 92 and the mean distance of flood points 1470 m in nanjing were the largest illustrating that the flood points in nanjing were relatively far away and tended to be randomly distributed 3 2 urban flood exposure risks 3 2 1 population the pap of each flood point within a 500 m catchment area in different flood degrees was calculated by the 2017 grid population map the average pap of tianjin was the largest among the eight cities in different flood degrees which exceeded 60 of the whole study area the average potential population affected by slight floods was 18845 that affected by moderate floods was 19828 that affected by heavy floods was 23211 and the mean of the total flood points was 19 789 in tianjin table 3 the average pap for each flood point in nanjing was the lowest for moderate floods 4266 heavy floods 4200 and the mean of the total flood points 7828 and that of shanghai was the lowest for slight floods 8879 tianjin had the largest total pap 3 01 106 followed by shanghai 2 51 106 and wuhan 1 94 106 fig 4 a although tianjin and shanghai had the largest populations affected by flooding most of them were affected by slight and moderate floods and the proportion of pap for heavy floods was small accounting for 20 8 and 16 3 of the total pap respectively nevertheless guangzhou and wuhan had the largest population and the highest proportion of heavy floods 0 69 106 and 62 6 and 1 44 106 and 73 9 respectively which was consistent with the distribution characteristics of urban flood points in these two cities 3 2 2 housing value among the 8 cities beijing had the largest mean pahv 40 68 109 yuan while xian had the smallest 8 77 109 yuan table 4 for different flood degrees the pahv of slight floods in beijing was the highest while that in xian was the smallest the average housing value affected by moderate and heavy floods was highest in shanghai and lowest in nanjing and the gap between the two cities was 4 9 times the total pahv of these cities varied greatly from 0 97 nanjing to 9 47 shanghai 1012 yuan fig 4 b the total pahv of shanghai 9 47 1012 yuan was the highest and the pahv of heavy floods 1 82 1012 yuan was also the highest among the 8 cities the proportion of pahv of heavy floods in guangzhou was highest 71 95 while nanjing had the lowest proportion only 2 91 3 2 3 traffic condition although it is difficult to quantitatively assess the impact of floods on traffic we evaluated the potential risk of floods on traffic conditions by grading the roads and intersections where floods occur the results indicated that beijing and shenzhen had the highest average patc of flood points and wuhan and guangzhou had the lowest table 5 for the overall traffic condition of 8 cities affected by floods shanghai was the most affected total patc was the largest while nanjing was the least affected fig 4 c the traffic conditions of guangzhou and wuhan were mainly affected by heavy floods 3 3 exposure risk index according to the eripoint of the flood points in 8 cities beijing shenzhen and shanghai were the highest flood risk cities of flood points eripoint were 0 57 0 52 and 0 51 respectively while wuhan and nanjing were the lowest flood risk cities eripoint were 0 28 and 0 29 fig 5 a the main components of eripoint in the different cities were obviously different for the flood points in the different cities the pap risk as part of eripoint was the main risk in tianjin and wuhan nanjing shenzhen and xian were mainly affected by patc risk and shanghai was mainly vulnerable to pahv risk the ericity varied greatly among the 8 cities which reflected the total flood risks of each city fig 5 b shanghai had the highest ericity 0 71 which indicated that the total flood risk in shanghai was the highest among the 8 cities nanjing had the lowest total flood risk with the smallest ericity 0 05 for the total flood risk of each city the pap risks of wuhan shanghai and tianjin were higher than that of other cities the pahv risk of shanghai was highest among 8 cities and the patc risks of shanghai and wuhan were higher than those of other cities 3 4 logistic regression analysis in this study the multicollinearity test results demonstrated that 9 influencing factors were all tol greater than 0 2 and vif 10 which indicated that there were no significant multicollinearity issues between independent variables after the multicollinearity test influencing factors of each city were examined in the forward stepwise lr model to estimate the influence of each factor on urban flood the bs of significant influencing factors of each city and the total study area on the probability of urban flood were calculated fig 6 for the whole study area there were 7 factors that have a significant impact p 0 05 on urban flood except that gsr is negatively correlated with flood other factors are positively correlated among which pd bs 0 31 and gsr bs 0 31 have the greatest influence on urban flood followed by rd bs 0 18 for different cities there were generally 3 to 4 factors that have significant impacts pd and rd were the common significant factors affecting flood in all cities in addition gsr has a significant negative impact on other cities except nanjing and shanghai and the influence is also large 0 73 bs 0 22 4 discussion 4 1 influencing factors urban floods are a comprehensive urban hydrologic cycle problem caused by the combined action of many different factors according to the results of average nearest neighbor analysis the flood events in 8 megacities revealed a significant aggregation effect annr 1 and p 0 01 with the mean distance of flood points in different cities ranging from 443 to 1470 m meanwhile the flood points were mainly clustered in the central urban area of each city through lr analysis this flood agglomeration mainly due to the high intensity of urbanization of the inner city resulting in the increase of pd and rd and the decrease of gsr huang et al 2018 li et al 2021 su et al 2018 these identified flood agglomeration areas and hotspots are particularly important for government managers or urban planners to mitigate urban floods and reduce exposure risks zhang et al 2020 for a city or small community drainage capacity and urban landscape patterns have a great impact on flooding while on a large scale meteorological such as ar and mmr and topographic factors such as re will significantly influence the frequency and severity of flooding darabi et al 2019 du et al 2015 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 revealed that the influencing factors of urban floods presenting a strong scale effect which is mainly affected by topography on small analysis scale 1 km and land cover composition on large scale 5 km zhang et al 2020 ma et al 2018 found that precipitation geographical conditions and urban construction were the main causes of urban flash floods ma et al 2018 xu et al 2021 indicated that the increase rate of urban flood risk in the part with permeability of 0 35 is greatest according to the two dimensional flood model xu et al 2021 there were great differences in flooding characteristics among different cities this study found that while shenzhen and guangzhou are located very near one another the proportion of heavy floods in shenzhen was only 2 8 while 61 5 of flood points in guangzhou were heavy floods in addition to the common pd gsp and rd influencing factors of flooding in guangzhou and shenzhen dtr was also a significant factor in guangzhou according to the lr analysis results there were many river networks in the built up area of guangzhou in the rainy season heavy rainfall may cause the river backflow and exacerbate urban flooding previous researchers have studied the urban flood risks of different cities and found that urbanization areas especially coastal cities with large populations and high gdp are prone to suffer more flooding damage fang et al 2020 hu et al 2018 shi et al 2020 three essential and primary potential affected elements pap pahv and patc were used to evaluate the flood exposure loss of flood points and cities in this study the results indicated that the risk of flood exposure varied greatly in 8 cities and the eri of shanghai was 15 times that of nanjing moreover there were also great differences in the key components of the eri value in each city due to the differences in urban socioeconomic conditions the total flood risk of beijing was relatively small ericity was 0 20 mainly because most flood points were slight floods and the potential impacts of floods on population and traffic conditions were small the ericity values of pap and patc were 0 04 and 0 06 4 2 advantages and contributions this study indicates that average nearest neighbor analysis as a powerful tool to analyze the spatial distribution pattern of urban flood points which could be used to compare flood heterogeneity among cities multisource big data such as high spatial resolution population grid data housing price data based on housing intermediaries and road traffic level data were used in this study to evaluate the exposure risk of urban floods the composite index eri proposed by us can comprehensively reflect the three main aspects the impact on residents buildings and traffic conditions of the impact of flooding in different cities which can be used to evaluate the risk degrees and loss composition of flooding in different cities of urban agglomerations regions or countries and propose corresponding prevention and control measures accordingly 4 2 1 uncertainties and limitations in addition to the advantages of the exposure risk analysis of urban floods described above this study has limitations the first and important uncertainty is the bias in reported flood events the flood points data of amap was reported by different kinds of urban residents such as traffic police pedestrians drivers and flood investigators due to the different intuitive feelings and professional background of the reporters the judgment criteria for the severity of flood will be inconsistent although the catchment area of different regions may vary greatly due to differences in terrain and drainage systems the same buffer zone 500 m was identified as the affected area to assess the flood exposure risks meanwhile the relatively short period of flood records may not be sufficient to represent the overall flood risk of these cities the amount and depth of flooding produced by different degrees of flooding will be different resulting in different flood losses at the same site however the potential affected loss was calculated based on the original value within the influence range of 500 m and the difference of three flood degrees was not considered in this study furthermore the weight coefficients of different flood degrees and three risk indicators were determined based on experience and relevant papers which may be different from the actual values based on quantitative assessment hossain and meng 2020 xu et al 2018 flood risk includes many components such as vulnerability exposure sensitivity and resilience aroca jiménez et al 2020 sun et al 2020 while the most influential dimensions social and economic of flood exposure in urban environments were analyzed in this study future studies could set different weight coefficients according to their research purposes if the goal is to protect the personal safety of residents the weight of pap will increase and if the goal is to protect property safety the weight of pahv will increase the promotion of the method proposed in this paper may be subject to the existence of these flood points population housing value and other data 5 conclusions in this study the distribution characteristics and influencing factors of actual flood points in 8 megacities and their potential exposure risks to population housing value and traffic conditions were analyzed and a comprehensive index was proposed to evaluate the exposure risks of flooding in different cities the method we proposed makes it possible to evaluate flood patterns and compare socioeconomic vulnerability among different cities our findings revealed that shanghai had the most flood points 264 points and wuhan had the highest heavy flood ratio 74 3 the distribution pattern of urban flood points in all these cities presented significant aggregation p 0 01 but the mean distance of flood points varied from 443 to 1470 m by evaluating the bs of logistic regression we found that the main factors affecting urban flooding in these chinese megacities were patch density of underlying surface green space ratio and road density the pap pahv and patc of each flood point within the 500 m catchment area in different flood degrees were calculated using the 2017 grid population map housing price data and road traffic level data the average and total pap of tianjin were the largest among the 8 cities the average pahv of each flood point in beijing was the highest however the total pahv of shanghai was the highest reaching 9 47 1012 yuan the traffic conditions of flood points in beijing were more vulnerable to flooding while flooding in shanghai had a greater impact on the whole urban traffic condition according to the eri results the mean exposure risk of flood points in beijing was the highest eripoint 0 57 while the overall exposure risk of the whole city in shanghai was the highest ericity 0 71 meanwhile the main influencing factors of eri in different cities varied greatly indicating that flooding in cities had different degrees of effects on population buildings and transportation the potential implications of this study can provide guidance for future intercity flood risk research help government managers identify flood risk patterns and vulnerability of different cities and formulate corresponding urban flood management measures credit authorship contribution statement chunlin li conceptualization methodology investigation

3288,storm surge a worldwide phenomenon triggering the vertical saltwater infiltration is likely to exacerbate coastal groundwater salinization due to geologic heterogeneity anthropogenic engineering and climate change this study analyzed the combined effects of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the coastal aquifer recovery a series of modeling cases were investigated using hydrogeosphere in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the heterogeneity setting is composed of different connectivity level of hydraulic conductivity field the simulation results of single storm surge event demonstrate that the connected heterogeneity elevates the salinized extent and reduces the aquifer recovery time due to a number of preferential flow paths in comparison to the equivalent homogeneous aquifer heterogeneity alleviates the maximum salinized extent and vertical intrusion distance due to the accelerated mixing of salinized groundwater with fresh groundwater physical barrier classified as subsurface dam and cutoff wall leading to different groundwater discharge pattern is tailored to investigate the influences of the permanent subsurface engineering on the aquifer recovery our results show that the connectivity level controls the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier then the repetitive storm surge events were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency for the low frequency surge event the variation of salinized metric is the repetition of the unimodal curve in the single surge event nevertheless for the high frequency surge event the residual salt mass cannot be flushed out over the simulation period especially for the low connectivity aquifer meanwhile the high frequency surge event broadens the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier these findings have critical implications for coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial environmental risks of surge induced vertical saltwater intrusion derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes keywords seawater intrusion storm surge connected heterogeneity physical barrier 1 introduction groundwater is the primary resource for water supply in coastal environments which contains approximately a billion people werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 michael et al 2017 however the vulnerability of coastal groundwater is apparent due to the inevitable and multi factor seawater intrusion swi induced by anthropogenic activities e g groundwater abstraction and natural stresses e g storm surge sea level rise in general swi process can be briefly categorized to lateral seawater intrusion lswi in which the interface between saltwater and freshwater moves landward caused by the alteration of hydraulic gradient associated with groundwater abstraction or sea level rise and the vertical seawater intrusion vswi which indicates saltwater derived from storm surge or other stresses infiltrates into coastal aquifer from the overland flow werner et al 2013 liu and tokunaga 2019 paldor and michael 2021 the physical processes of lswi resulting from groundwater over abstraction and climate change have been studied extensively in past decades strack 1976 gingerich and voss 2005 pool and carrera 2011 chang et al 2011 rasmussen et al 2013 siena and riva 2018 geng and michael 2020 walther et al 2020 the vswi phenomena induced by storm surge or tsunami event exhibit substantial risks in the coastal regions around the globe which can trigger the salinization of coastal freshwater inland migration of coastal wetlands and the degradation of coastal agricultural land on shorter timescales liu and tokunaga 2019 xiao et al 2019 guimond and michael 2021 for example storm surge event had led to economic losses of 10 5 billion chinese yuan and affected 11 5 million inhabits annually in china from 2009 to 2010 especially in bohai sea where storm surge frequently occurred in the winter feng et al 2016 feng et al 2018 zhao and jiang 2011 therefore the surge induced vswi achieves more and more attentions in the recent studies yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 liu and tokunaga 2019 guimond and michael 2021 paldor and michael 2021 however the interplay between overland flow and groundwater as well as geologic heterogeneity of the coastal aquifer and temporal behaviors of storm surge event make the accurate assessment of vswi challenging as illustrated in fig 1 the intrusion process of storm surge generally includes 1 the fast infiltration of saltwater into unsaturated zone during surge event 2 the infiltration of dense saltwater into saturated zone with fingering pattern after the recession of storm surge and 3 the gradual dilution and flushing of residual saltwater driven by precipitation recharge and landward flux which may last for decades liu and tokunaga 2019 yu et al 2016 analyzed the impacts of coastal topography on the physical process of vswi induced by storm surge showing that saltwater in the surface depression and connectivity of overland flow are the critical factors controlling the salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer yang et al 2018 simulated the surge inundation associated with the model scenarios of permeability and hydraulic gradient and recharge rate and assessed the aquifer vulnerability and recovery time guimond and michael 2021 evaluated the influences of surge induced marsh migration on the coastal agricultural land and swi in the unconfined aquifer which indicated that marsh migration can be developed as the management strategy to reduce salinization risk from storm surge paldor and michael 2021 investigated the aquifer recovery mechanisms subject to storm surge and impacts of surge frequency exacerbated by climate change through a hypothetical anisotropic coastal aquifer with hydraulic conductivity of 50 and 5 m d representing sandy deposits with variable clay content however these studies did not examine the impacts of complex geologic heterogeneity on vswi problems even though the heterogeneity of coastal aquifer is a common and critical factor which affects the variable density groundwater flow and solute transport only a few studies considered the vswi process in heterogeneous aquifer conditions mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yang et al 2015 furthermore for the coastal aquifer composed of fractured media karst conduits or connected geologic structures fig 1 the spatial field of hydraulic conductivity formed by high permeability channels would create a number of preferential flow paths and increase the complexity and variability of salinization process geng and michael 2020 de vriendt et al 2020 therefore the coastal aquifer with connected heterogeneous field leads to the complex salinization and recovery mechanisms for vswi and causes substantial uncertainty for coastal groundwater management to alleviate swi risks and safeguard coastal freshwater resources the various engineering measures have been proposed and constructed to enhance the resilience of coastal aquifer the countermeasures to mitigate vswi associated with storm surge can be categorized as hard structures such as sea walls dykes yang et al 2013 and green infrastructures such as mangrove forests seagrass and dune grass bed temmerman et al 2013 the common strategies to prevent lswi can be categorized as hydraulic barrier and physical barrier the hydraulic barrier is either the negative hydraulic barrier that reduces saltwater head by pumping seawater in the coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 or the positive hydraulic barrier that utilizes recharge wells to increase the landward flux yang et al 2021 the physical barrier includes subsurface dam chang et al 2019 with an opening in the vicinity of water table and cutoff wall with an opening adjacent to the bottom of aquifer zheng et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the physical barriers have been built in the japan and china to successfully prevent and control lswi japan green resources agency 2004 wu et al 2008 hence the measure is a feasible and effective strategy while has a longer service life than hydraulic barrier that often confronts with the injection well clogging challenge due to geologic heterogeneity the surface infrastructures can be flexibly modified to avoid the future risks of storm surge whereas physical barrier is a permanent subsurface structure which has to face the challenges derived from the exogenous stresses for example the high frequency and intensity of storm surge may induce greater vswi at the farther inland side of subsurface structure where the residual saltwater is poorly freshened due to the prolonged flow path and the barrier to our knowledge the research on salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer subject to storm surge combined with the connectivity heterogeneity and physical barrier is lacking yet of great importance for the assessment of coastal aquifer vulnerability and management this study is intended to examine the combined impacts of connected heterogeneity and physical barrier on the salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer suffering from the single and repetitive storm surges fig 1 the numerical study of fully integrated surface water and variably saturated and density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport simulation is implemented to elucidate the salinization mechanisms of vswi in the coastal aquifer characterized with the different level of connectivity heterogeneity we then analyze the impacts of physical barrier and surge frequency on the salinized extent quantified by the volume and total salt mass of salinization plume our results provide important insights into the interplay among the surge driven saltwater intrusion and geologic heterogeneity and physical barrier contributing to the coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial uncertainty and future risks from storm surge 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modeling 2 1 1 modeling tool hydrogeosphere hgs is applied to simulate the variably saturated and variable density flow and solute transport processes for storm surge event in the unconfined coastal aquifer hgs uses richard s equation for 3d variably saturated subsurface flow and the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equation for 2d overland flow therrien et al 2010 the water and solute exchange flux between surface and subsurface domains are simulated with the dual node approach which assumes a thin layer whose thickness is the coupling length and can be formulated as yang et al 2013 1 q ex ρ u ρ 0 k r k z l e h f h f o 2 γ ex c u q ex where qex is water exchange flux between surface and subsurface domains

detailed implementations of numerical methods and modeling theory can be found in the manual documents of hgs therrien et al 2010 2 1 2 model setup the 2d vertical cross section is selected as model domain to simulate aquifer salinization and recovery processes induced by storm surge as illustrated in fig 2 the domain extends 650 m long with the shoreline at x 50 m and 30 m below sea level the model was discretized with constant size 1 m in the horizontal direction and variable size in the vertical direction there are 14 layers of proportional depth between the surface and 10 m and top two layers with half size of remaining layers to simulate surficial root zone the vertical range from 10 m to 30 m is uniformly discretized to 20 layers with 1 m layer the discretization scheme satisfies the mesh péclet number criterion pem δl αl 4 voss and souza 1987 in which δl is grid size 1 m and αl is longitudinal dispersivity 0 5 m the surface slope is 0 02 from 0 to 50 m with a minimum elevation of 1 m at x 0 m and 0 005 from 50 to 650 m with a maximum elevation of 3 m at x 650 m to simulate coastal aquifer the maximum surge height is set to 2 5 m which means storm surge can reach the upstream of model domain x 550 m the single surge event firstly increased to the maximum surge height and then decreased back to zero over the stress period of 12 h the boundary conditions include seaward boundary and surface recharge boundary and landward flux boundary the seaward boundary in the overland flow zone is a specified head boundary which exhibits sinusoidal level hsurge during storm surge and then recovers to mean sea level 0 m at the remaining simulation period the subsurface sea boundary hsea is set to be linear relation of hydrostatic pressure and formulated as 4 h sea t h surge t z ρ s ρ f z where ρ s is saline density ml 3 ρf is freshwater density ml 3 z is the elevation in the seaward boundary l the salt concentration of seawater and surge inundation is uniformly prescribed to be 35 g l the surface recharge boundary is set to specified flux boundary with 0 0005 m d which is the net recharge accounting for precipitation and evapotranspiration the landward boundary is specified with an inland recharge flux 0 04 m d and the concentration of 0 g l the bottom of aquifer is bedrock surface and prescribed to be no flow boundary the simulation was run for 100 years to reach a quasi steady state in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifers in addition for the case of physical barrier the extended simulation period 30 years was set to make the lswi process reach a new steady state again then the groundwater head and salinity distribution were assigned as the initial conditions to simulate vswi process in order to evaluate the impacts of connected heterogeneity we refer to the generation flowchart of stochastic hydraulic conductivity k field developed by zinn and harvey 2003 the isotropic multi gaussian k field is created by the sequential gaussian algorithm with a gaussian covariance model using sgems remy et al 2009 then the transformation which generates unconnected k field can be formulated as zinn and harvey 2003 5 y c 2 e r f 1 2 e r f y 2 1 where yc is the transformed value of ln k and y is the original value the connected k field can be generated to reverse the sign of y c de vriendt et al 2020 analyzed the influences of connected heterogeneity on the dynamics of freshwater saltwater mixing and calcite dissolution to evaluate the karst development processes in the coastal aquifer this study aims to examine the salinization and recovery processes induced by storm surge in the different connectivity level of heterogeneous coastal aquifer furthermore for each type of k field the equivalent homogeneous k field is obtained by modeling groundwater flow with the prescribed hydraulic gradient and then the discharge flux in the efflux boundary is used with darcy s law to calculate the equivalent k geng and michael 2020 the analysis of equivalent k field aims to compare the effects of geologic heterogeneity on the surge induced vswi the model parameters for surface and subsurface flow and transport simulation are summarized in table 1 the geometric mean conductivity is assigned as 40 m d to represent the sandy aquifer with isotropic correlation length de vriendt et al 2020 the van genuchten model is selected to relate pressure head to saturation and relative k in the unsaturated zone and the fitting parameters for the water retention curve are set in terms of the magnitude of k liu and tokunaga 2019 the longitudinal dispersivity α l is set to 0 5 m based on the tradeoff between model scale and computational burden while satisfies the criterion of mesh péclet number gelhar et al 1992 the parameters for overland flow modeling include manning roughness coefficient and coupling length park et al 2009 which refer to the numerical study of yang et al 2013 for storm surge and tide simulation 2 2 modeling scenarios in order to evaluate the combined effects of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process the simulation cases are summarized in table 2 the connected gaussian and unconnected heterogeneity cases were compared to highlight the influences of various connectivity level and their equivalent homogeneity cases were implemented to compare the impacts of geologic heterogeneity on the recovery process then for each type of heterogeneity and equivalent homogeneity subsurface dam and cutoff wall and no barrier scenarios were prescribed to examine the salinization mechanisms of coastal aquifer for single surge event finally the repetitive storm surge events specified with the recurrence period of 5 and 10 years respectively were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process paldor and michael 2021 the storm surge event with 50 years of recurrence period indicates the single surge event therefore a total of 54 simulation cases were devised to illustrate the aquifer salinization pattern affected by the connected heterogeneity and physical barrier and surge frequency 2 3 evaluation metrics in this study the results of numerical experiments were compared using three measurable metrics 1 volume of salinization plume constrained with salt concentration increment greater than 0 5 g l for drinking water epa 2009 2 total salt mass of salinization plume and 3 first spatial moment or centroid position of salinization plume in order to exclude the lswi differences resulted from naturing submarine groundwater discharge and physical barrier the salinized volume vs total salt mass m s and centroid coordinates cκ of salinization plume are formulated as 6 v s t g 1 n p g v g t i f δ c g t 0 5 g l p g 1 e l s e p g 0 7 m s t g 1 n p g v g s g t δ c g t i f δ c g t 0 5 g l p g 1 e l s e p g 0 8 δ c g t c g t surge c

showing whether the salt concentration increment of model cell g δcg t is greater than 0 5 g l v g is the volume of gth model cell l3 ms t is the total salt mass of salinization plume at the tth

ml 3 note that the discretized cell concentration is averaged with the adjacent node concentration in the hgs simulation 3 results 3 1 impact of connected heterogeneity the study generates gaussian k field using sequential gaussian simulation in the sgems remy et al 2009 and transforms it to the connected and unconnected k field using equation 5 three types of lognormal k field including the same covariance function were created to represent the connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity the ratio ci between the equivalent k keff and the geometric mean km of random field was calculated to measure the connectivity level the keff is larger than km for k field ci 1 including preferential paths and vice versa the study selects the representative realizations which have the ci metric of 1 38 and 1 0 and 0 74 corresponding well to the connectivity level of connected and gaussian and unconnected k field respectively as illustrated in fig 3 a fig 3b g illustrate the spatial distribution of pore water velocity natural lswi and salt concentration increment during single surge event in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases respectively for the pore water velocity in the homogeneous media fig 3c the high velocity only emerges in the discharge zone of groundwater and declines with the decreasing equivalent k however for the heterogeneous media fig 3b the high velocity appears in the discharge zone and high k zones created by local heterogeneity simultaneously therefore the high velocity in the che connected heterogeneity case occurs in the more areas than ghe gaussian heterogeneity and uhe unconnected heterogeneity cases which demonstrates that the higher connectivity level creates more preferential flow paths the natural salinity distribution shown in fig 3d and fig 3e exhibits the mixing zone of swi as bounded in white lines showing the 95 and 5 isoline of seawater salinity and toe locations defined as the intersection point of 50 isoline of seawater salinity and the bottom of coastal aquifer the range of mixing zone in the heterogeneous cases shows the larger spatial variability than those in the homogeneous cases and gradually decreases from connected to unconnected case the toe location moves seaward with the decreasing connectivity level and equivalent k cases the difference of salinity distribution after single surge event at 500 days indicates the maximum salinized extent during surge induced vswi which exhibits the finger shaped plumes owning to density driven vertical solute transport fig 3f and fig 3g the spatial variability of finger shape in the heterogeneous case is more complex than the equivalent homogeneous case overall the vertical intrusion distance of salinization plume increases as the connectivity level elevates whereas decreases in the heterogeneous cases compared to the equivalent homogeneous cases the interesting finding is the salt concentration reduction of lswi as illustrated in the blue zone in fig 3f and fig 3g the reason for the phenomena is that the density driven vswi increases the landward groundwater pressure to push the freshwater seawater interface seaward which is consistent with the research of paldor and michael 2021 meanwhile the heterogeneous case shows the less lswi reduction zone than the corresponding homogeneous case this is because heterogeneity accelerates the mixing of salinization plume with fresh groundwater and alleviates the impacts of overpressures created by the density driven groundwater flow in order to evaluate the evolution of vswi during aquifer recovery the measureable metrics shown in equations 6 7 and 9 were calculated in fig 4 a the salinized volume vs compared to natural lswi increases rapidly and then gradually decreases over the freshening period driven by rainfall recharge and landward groundwater discharge the full recovery of coastal aquifer for all cases requires a flushing period of less than 8 years fig 4a for this set of conditions in the heterogeneous cases the vs curves close to maximum salinized volume are lower than those in the equivalent homogeneous cases therefore the vswi can be alleviated by geologic heterogeneity the elevated connectivity level of heterogeneous aquifer enlarges the maximum salinized volume and shortens the recovery time fig 4a which demonstrates that the coastal aquifer composed of connected geologic structures is more vulnerable to be salinized at the early stage of surge event whereas freshened more quickly over the long term recovery period moreover the temporal behaviors of m s metric show a similar pattern of aquifer salinization and recovery processes fig 4b however the response time of maximum ms is much less than salinized volume which indicates that salt mass accumulates quickly at the initial stage of surge event and then gradually diffuses until the formation of maximum salinization plume the centroid trajectories of salinization plume after storm surges are illustrated in fig 4c in the simulation cases the salinization plume firstly moves downward due to the density driven vertical intrusion and then migrates seaward due to the horizontal flushing of rainfall recharge and landward groundwater discharge there is a clear difference for the centroid trajectories in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases at the initial vswi stage cx 350 m the all trajectories show a similar path and the centroid moves downward due to the leading role of the density driven groundwater flow however the trajectories in the homogeneous cases show a deeper migration path than the heterogeneous cases at the later flushing stage cx 300 m which is likely attributed to the differences of mixing rate of salinized groundwater 3 2 impact of physical barrier to evaluate the effect of permanent physical barrier on the aquifer recovery subject to storm surge the subsurface dam and cutoff wall were designed at x 200 m from the shoreline with the penetration depth of 25 m in the connected gaussian unconnected and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the salinity distribution after the construction of physical barrier was simulated to reach a quasi steady state over the 30 years of stress period fig 5 for the cutoff wall scenario the freshwater volume shows a relative increment of 16 62 10 58 and 0 37 in the che ghe and uhe case and 21 11 6 94 and 3 34 in the cho connected homogeneity gho gaussian homogeneity and uho unconnected homogeneity respectively for the subsurface dam scenario the freshwater volume achieves a relative increment of 21 59 12 63 and 1 19 in che ghe and uhe case and 25 89 12 54 and 5 38 in the cho gho and uho case respectively the subsurface dam can retreat the toe location of saltwater wedge whereas cutoff wall flushing out saltwater at the opening adjacent to the bottom of aquifer can retreat the toe location at the cost of increasing the mixing width of dispersion zone which further results in a less increment of total freshwater volume for cutoff wall scenario however the residual saltwater trapped on the landward side of subsurface dam cannot be flushed out in time luyun et al 2009 which may be a persistent threat on the drinking water security zheng et al 2020 the distribution of salinity concentration difference at 500 days that is the response time close to the maximum salinized volume was compared to the pre surge lswi state subject to physical barrier for the cutoff wall scenario fig 6 a and fig 6c the enforced pressure derived from surge induced vswi propagates to the left side of the wall through an opening adjacent to the aquifer bottom and only pushes the toe location of saltwater wedge seaward where the blue zone occurs rather than the saltwater freshwater interface however for the subsurface dam scenario fig 6b and fig 6d the enforced pressure firstly propagates to the aquifer bottom and then an opening adjacent to land surface and finally pushes the saltwater freshwater interface on the left side of the dam seaward which creates more salinity reduction zones furthermore the heterogeneous case generally has a smaller vertical intrusion distance for salinization plume than the equivalent homogeneous case especially for the lower connectivity of k field the temporal changes of salinized volume and total salt mass metrics were investigated for the comparison of impacts of physical barrier and geologic heterogeneity on the long term recovery process of coastal aquifer as illustrated in fig 7 for the connected cases fig 7a 7d subsurface dam scenario leads to the greatest increment of the salinized metrics at the later stage of aquifer recovery the cutoff wall scenario achieves the reduction of salinized metrics at the early stage 0 2 years and gradually exceeds no barriers scenario but still less than those in the subsurface dam scenario moreover the recovery time of coastal aquifer constructed with physical barrier is prolonged which demonstrates salinization plume is flushed out more slowly than the cases having no barriers therefore for the connected cases physical barrier exacerbates the surge induced salinization risks especially for equivalent homogeneous cases for the gaussian cases fig 7e h both barrier scenarios decrease or maintain the similar salinized volume and total salt mass at the early stage 0 2 years and then increase the salinized extent at the later stage compared to no barriers scenario during the later stage of aquifer recovery both barrier scenarios increase the salinized metrics to the similar extent in the ghe case fig 7e and fig 7g whereas subsurface dam has a larger prolonged effect than cutoff wall in the gho case fig 7f and fig 7h overall for the long term recovery process in the gaussian k field the exacerbated salinized trend due to physical barrier can still be maintained compared to no barriers scenario in the unconnected cases fig 7i l the maximum salinized metrics are decreased compared to the peak values in the connected and gaussian cases in the uhe case fig 7i and fig 7k both barrier scenarios decrease the salinized volume and total salt mass over the simulation period which is reversed with the salinization trend of connected and gaussian cases at the later stage of aquifer recovery 6 8 years in uho case fig 7j and fig 7l subsurface dam scenario still has an increment of salinized metric and cutoff wall shows a negligible deviation compared to no barriers scenario these results demonstrate that the connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity determines the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier this study examined the accumulated salinized volume and total salt mass to evaluate the compound effects of physical barrier during aquifer recovery process in the che and ghe cases fig 8 physical barrier scenario enlarges salinized volume and total salt mass and subsurface dam scenario has a greater increment however for uhe case both barrier scenarios decrease the accumulated salinized metric compared to no barriers scenario in the cho and gho case subsurface dam scenario achieves a larger increment of salinized volume and total salt mass than the heterogeneous cases the cutoff wall scenario has a distinct increment of salinized metric in the cho case whereas shows a minor deviation in the gho case in the uho case subsurface dam scenario still maintains a slight accumulated increment of salinized metric and cutoff wall scenario shows a reduction trend compared to no barriers scenario moreover there is a clear difference between uhe and uho case therefore the geologic heterogeneity is a non trivial factor to evaluate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer confronting with the surge risks and the permeant subsurface barriers 3 3 impact of surge frequency the repetitive storm surge event assigned with the recurrence period rp of 5 and 10 years were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency on the recovery process of connected gaussian and unconnected heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the salinized volume and total salt mass metrics were examined fig 9 for the storm surge with an rp of 10 years fig 9a 9b 9e and 9f the maximum salinized volume and maximum total salt mass in the connected case green curve are the highest and followed by gaussian case red curve and unconnected case blue curve conversely the recovery time of salinized aquifer is prolonged from connected to unconnected case therefore the connectivity level is a critical factor to regulate the maximum salinized extent and aquifer recovery time moreover the heterogeneity results in the reduction of maximum salinized metrics compared to the equivalent homogeneous cases which may be attributed to the smaller vertical intrusion distance and accelerated mixing of saltwater with fresh groundwater these findings are consistent with the findings in the single surge event which shows the current surge frequency only triggers the repetition of salinization process of single surge event however for the repetitive storm surge with an rp of 5 years fig 9c 9d 9g and 9h the minimum salinized volume and minimum total salt mass have a nonzero value which demonstrates the salinized aquifer cannot be recovered to the pre surge state therefore the surge frequency results in the formation of residual salinization plume which cannot be flushed out in time before the occurrence of the next storm surge in the connected cases the minimum salinized metric is less than the gaussian and unconnected case this is due to the enhanced freshening capacity of coastal aquifer by the preferential flow paths derived from the connected geological structures meanwhile the residual salt mass and salinized volume in the gaussian and unconnected cases show the elevated surge frequency aggravates the coastal aquifer vulnerability the maximum salinized volume and total salt mass have a clear difference during the first surge event and then a minor deviation for the remaining surge events in the heterogeneous cases fig 9c and fig 9g therefore the surge frequency has been a more important factor than geologic heterogeneity to affect the maximum salinized metric in order to evaluate the impacts of physical barrier on the aquifer recovery during repetitive storm surge the accumulated differences of salinized volume and total salt mass are analyzed as illustrated in fig 10 for the che ghe cho and gho cases the salinized metric is elevated which shows that the surge induced vswi is exacerbated by physical barrier the increment of salinized volume and total salt mass for the surge event with an rp of 5 years is higher than the event with an rp of 10 years therefore the high frequency surge event magnifies the salinization differences triggered by physical barrier for the connected and gaussian cases however in the uhe case the salinized metric is reduced due to physical barrier especially for the high frequency surge event in the uho case subsurface dam scenario still increases salinized volume and total salt mass whereas cutoff wall scenario decreases total salt mass which may be attributed to the high velocity at the opening adjacent to the aquifer bottom although the rp is different for the repetitive storm surge event the relative changes of accumulated salinized metrics of the aquifer with and without physical barrier are similar to single surge event fig 8 and the high frequency surge event only amplifies the differences consequently geologic heterogeneity plays a critical role on the effects of physical barrier on the accumulated salinization process during the repetitive storm surge event 4 discussion this study highlights the roles of connected heterogeneity and physical barrier on coastal aquifer recovery process subject to the single and repetitive storm surges following the single surge event in the three type of heterogeneity i e connected gaussian and unconnected k field the che case greatly increases the maximum salinized volume and total salt mass and the freshening rate of salinized aquifer in response to storm surge the effect is expected to be much stronger and pronounced on the complex real world heterogeneity such as fractured and karst coastal aquifer or clastic sedimentary depositional aquifer aquitard system the equivalent homogeneous cases are implemented to inform the larger salinized volume and total salt mass than the corresponding heterogeneous case and the centroid trajectories of salinization plume show the heterogeneity reduces the vertical intrusion distance this study utilizes the flushing intensity f to quantitatively measure the freshening capacity of coastal aquifer which is the velocity magnitude over a horizontal distance l at elevation z zlotnik et al 2011 12 f z 1 l 0 l v x 2 x z v z 2 x z d x the velocity magnitude is averaged over the distance from the shoreline to the inland boundary and calculated as the flushing intensity over the each model layer and z is the vertical coordinate of the discretized cell at the shoreline as illustrated in fig 11 each f curve in the equivalent homogeneous cases has a linear trend as the depth increases for the majority of aquifer region 27 z 3 however the f curve in the heterogeneous case shows a non linear trend in the same region which indicates the anomalous velocity field induced by geologic heterogeneity the intersection point of f curve reflects the similar depth z 18 m for all simulation cases above the intersection point the average flushing intensity is the largest in the connected case followed by gaussian and unconnected case the anomalous changes of flushing intensity occur in the heterogeneous cases in the region where the local mixing rate of saltwater with fresh groundwater is elevated which further reduces the vertical intrusion distance therefore aquifer heterogeneity decreases maximum salinized metric compared to the equivalent homogeneous case fig 4a and fig 4b below the intersection point the variability trend of flushing intensity is reversed this is due to the lswi saltwater wedge which results in the different low velocity zone e g the connected case has a greatest lswi distance to reduce the flushing intensity at the aquifer bottom overall the comparison of f curve shows the che case including connected geological structures has a maximum flushing capacity in the upper zone of coastal aquifer where the main flushing process of surge induced vswi occurs therefore the connected case has a shortest recovery time during storm surge event compared to the gaussian and unconnected case physical barrier is an effective engineering measure to prevent lswi and safeguard the fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifer however the permanent subsurface measure alters the natural conductivity field and even eliminates the submarine groundwater discharge to ocean therefore it is of great importance to understand the role of physical barrier in the surge induced vswi for the risk assessment of storm surge event which triggers the farther inland saltwater intrusion the modeling results suggest that physical barrier in the connected and gaussian cases leads to increased salinized volume and total salt mass and the longer recovery time especially for subsurface dam scenario fig 7a h however the salinized extent is alleviated in the uho case and even reversed to enhance the aquifer flushing capacity in the uhe case fig 7i compared to no barriers scenario the centroid trajectories of salinization plume were compared for all simulation cases to illustrate the effects of physical barrier on vswi as illustrated in fig 12 each centroid trajectory was colored with total salt mass of salinization plume and the centroid gradually migrated from the landward to seaward boundary it is noted that the vertical migration distance of the centroid induced by physical barrier is larger than no barriers scenario in fig 12a b and fig 12d f which corresponds well to the simulation results indicating the detrimental effects of physical barrier in fig 7a h fig 7j and fig 7l the reason for the phenomena is that the lswi reduction in the landward zone due to physical barrier fig 5 creates a suitable zone to increase vswi extent whereas the small flushing intensity generally occurs in the deeper zone of aquifer therefore the vertical intrusion distance is a critical indicator to evaluate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer subject to storm surge and physical barrier however the centroid trajectories affected by physical barrier indicate a smaller vertical intrusion distance and larger freshening rate at the later stage of aquifer recovery compared to no barriers scenario in the uhe case fig 12c meanwhile the marked color of the centroid shows that physical barrier induces a greater extent of reduction of total salt mass at the initial stage compared to no barriers scenario which weakens the capacity of density driven vertical intrusion and accelerates the freshening process in the shallow zone of aquifer fig 12c the reason for the reduction of total salt mass at the initial stage is that physical barrier elevates the groundwater head in the landward aquifer which combines the effects of unconnected geologic structures to prevent vswi in the uhe case fig 7i and fig 7k it is important for coastal groundwater management to understand the mechanisms of groundwater salinization of the repetitive storm surge which may be exacerbated by climate changes although paldor and michael 2021 examined the influences of the repetitive surge event on lswi in the homogeneous aquifer the findings of our study demonstrate that connected heterogeneity and physical barrier are non trivial factors for the aquifer recovery process subject to storm surge with the different recurrence period the simulation of the repetitive storm surge with a 10 years rp reveals that salinized metric starts to increase to maximum and then gradually decreases and eventually reaches the pre surge lswi state which shows the full recovery of aquifer and the cycle of salinized metric in single surge event remains until the final storm surge the connected case has the maximum salinized extent and shortest recovery time followed by gaussian and unconnected case and the aquifer heterogeneity induces a decrease of maximum salinized extent compared to equivalent homogeneous aquifer these results are consistent with the salinization mechanisms of single surge event however for the repetitive storm surge with a 5 years rp the salinized metric reaches a non zero value at the end of each surge repetition which shows that salt concentration distribution cannot be recovered to the pre surge state this is because the recovery time is longer than recurrence period and residual salt mass persists over the simulation period the connected case shows a largest variation range of salinized metric due to the connected heterogeneity which creates more preferential flow paths to accelerate density driven vertical intrusion to reach the aquifer bottom and increases the flushing rate of later stage to reach the less residual salt mass however the variation range of salinized metric for gaussian and unconnected case is smaller and the residual salt mass and salinized volume are higher than the connected case fig 9c d and fig 9g h therefore the lower connectivity level for coastal aquifer shows the larger aquifer vulnerability confronting with the high frequency storm surge which is an important implication for coastal groundwater management furthermore physical barrier increases the salinized extent of the repetitive storm surge for the connected and gaussian case especially for subsurface dam in the cho case fig 10 for unconnected case the similar behavior in single surge event is observed i e physical barrier reduces the salinized extent in the uhe case overall the high frequency surge event maintains a large residual salt mass especially for coastal aquifer composed of unconnected geologic structures and enlarges the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier 5 conclusions this study quantitatively investigated the role of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on saltwater intrusion in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous coastal aquifer through a variably saturated and variable density flow and transport simulation the total salt mass and salinized volume and centroid of salinization plume were calculated to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of surge induced vswi the representative hydraulic conductivity fields were generated to describe the different connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity the equivalent homogeneous k fields were used to compare the impacts of geologic heterogeneity to evaluate the role of physical barrier during storm surge event the numerical model was tailored to the prescribed penetration depth and horizontal location setting for subsurface dam and cutoff wall furthermore this study attempted to examine the effects of surge frequency probably exacerbated by climate changes on the recovery process overall a series of 54 simulation cases have been implemented to elucidate salinization mechanisms of vswi induced by single and repetitive storm surge in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer system the major conclusions can be summarized as follows the connected heterogeneity creates preferential flow paths to accelerate the flushing of surge induced saltwater intrusion and achieves the shortest recovery time compared to equivalent homogeneous case geologic heterogeneity leads to the decreased peak values of salinized volume and total salt mass and a less vertical intrusion distance this study elucidates the distributions of averaged flushing intensity as the aquifer depth increases which indicates the anomalous non linear trend in heterogeneous cases whereas the linear trend in the homogeneous cases therefore geologic heterogeneity enhances the mixing of saltwater with fresh groundwater and triggers a faster decline of total salt mass which alleviates the density driven vswi that s the reason for the reduction of maximum salinized extent in the heterogeneous cases the physical barrier elevates the salinized extent compared to no barriers in the connected and gaussian cases and subsurface dam achieves a larger increment especially for the equivalent homogeneous cases the analysis of centroid trajectory shows that vertical intrusion distance is a non trivial indicator to evaluate the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier the implication is critical for the vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifer constructed with physical barrier due to storm surge event the emergence of the repetitive storm surge is inevitable especially for the high frequency storm surge event driven by climate changes the study suggests that the low frequency surge 10 years rp can achieve the cycle of single surge event with the same magnitude and full recovery of coastal aquifer however the high frequency surge 5 years rp maintains a residual salt mass which cannot be flushed out in time moreover the high frequency surge in the gaussian and unconnected case has a significant increase for the residual salt mass and salinized volume which demonstrates that high frequency surge induces a substantial salinization risk for the aquifer with the lower connectivity level in addition the surge frequency amplifies the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier and the relative changes of salinization trend are similar to single surge event these findings reveal the combined effects of geologic heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process which highlights the connected heterogeneity strongly affects the salinization pattern especially for coastal aquifer constructed with subsurface dam subject to high frequency surge event it is of great importance to elucidate the combined impacts to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability and achieve an adaptive strategy to safeguard the fresh groundwater resources due to the substantial swi risks derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes in general the connectivity structure is mainly determined by the variance of log normal random k field and the dimensionality of aquifer system fiori and jankovic 2012 while our study is a 2 d hypothetical case with a low variance which may be much less than that in real world aquifer system the fundamental mechanisms of coastal aquifer recovery process subject to storm surge and physical barrier in the connected heterogeneous aquifer are expected to be qualitatively similar to the case including a higher variance or sub horizontally stratified 3d aquifer aquitard system which could expect a stronger preferential flow rate therefore the future investigations should consider real world coastal aquifer system from a geologic perspective of connectivity structure and examine the complex patterns of surge induced saltwater intrusion to assist coastal groundwater management credit authorship

3288,storm surge a worldwide phenomenon triggering the vertical saltwater infiltration is likely to exacerbate coastal groundwater salinization due to geologic heterogeneity anthropogenic engineering and climate change this study analyzed the combined effects of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the coastal aquifer recovery a series of modeling cases were investigated using hydrogeosphere in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the heterogeneity setting is composed of different connectivity level of hydraulic conductivity field the simulation results of single storm surge event demonstrate that the connected heterogeneity elevates the salinized extent and reduces the aquifer recovery time due to a number of preferential flow paths in comparison to the equivalent homogeneous aquifer heterogeneity alleviates the maximum salinized extent and vertical intrusion distance due to the accelerated mixing of salinized groundwater with fresh groundwater physical barrier classified as subsurface dam and cutoff wall leading to different groundwater discharge pattern is tailored to investigate the influences of the permanent subsurface engineering on the aquifer recovery our results show that the connectivity level controls the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier then the repetitive storm surge events were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency for the low frequency surge event the variation of salinized metric is the repetition of the unimodal curve in the single surge event nevertheless for the high frequency surge event the residual salt mass cannot be flushed out over the simulation period especially for the low connectivity aquifer meanwhile the high frequency surge event broadens the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier these findings have critical implications for coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial environmental risks of surge induced vertical saltwater intrusion derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes keywords seawater intrusion storm surge connected heterogeneity physical barrier 1 introduction groundwater is the primary resource for water supply in coastal environments which contains approximately a billion people werner et al 2013 ketabchi et al 2016 michael et al 2017 however the vulnerability of coastal groundwater is apparent due to the inevitable and multi factor seawater intrusion swi induced by anthropogenic activities e g groundwater abstraction and natural stresses e g storm surge sea level rise in general swi process can be briefly categorized to lateral seawater intrusion lswi in which the interface between saltwater and freshwater moves landward caused by the alteration of hydraulic gradient associated with groundwater abstraction or sea level rise and the vertical seawater intrusion vswi which indicates saltwater derived from storm surge or other stresses infiltrates into coastal aquifer from the overland flow werner et al 2013 liu and tokunaga 2019 paldor and michael 2021 the physical processes of lswi resulting from groundwater over abstraction and climate change have been studied extensively in past decades strack 1976 gingerich and voss 2005 pool and carrera 2011 chang et al 2011 rasmussen et al 2013 siena and riva 2018 geng and michael 2020 walther et al 2020 the vswi phenomena induced by storm surge or tsunami event exhibit substantial risks in the coastal regions around the globe which can trigger the salinization of coastal freshwater inland migration of coastal wetlands and the degradation of coastal agricultural land on shorter timescales liu and tokunaga 2019 xiao et al 2019 guimond and michael 2021 for example storm surge event had led to economic losses of 10 5 billion chinese yuan and affected 11 5 million inhabits annually in china from 2009 to 2010 especially in bohai sea where storm surge frequently occurred in the winter feng et al 2016 feng et al 2018 zhao and jiang 2011 therefore the surge induced vswi achieves more and more attentions in the recent studies yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 liu and tokunaga 2019 guimond and michael 2021 paldor and michael 2021 however the interplay between overland flow and groundwater as well as geologic heterogeneity of the coastal aquifer and temporal behaviors of storm surge event make the accurate assessment of vswi challenging as illustrated in fig 1 the intrusion process of storm surge generally includes 1 the fast infiltration of saltwater into unsaturated zone during surge event 2 the infiltration of dense saltwater into saturated zone with fingering pattern after the recession of storm surge and 3 the gradual dilution and flushing of residual saltwater driven by precipitation recharge and landward flux which may last for decades liu and tokunaga 2019 yu et al 2016 analyzed the impacts of coastal topography on the physical process of vswi induced by storm surge showing that saltwater in the surface depression and connectivity of overland flow are the critical factors controlling the salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer yang et al 2018 simulated the surge inundation associated with the model scenarios of permeability and hydraulic gradient and recharge rate and assessed the aquifer vulnerability and recovery time guimond and michael 2021 evaluated the influences of surge induced marsh migration on the coastal agricultural land and swi in the unconfined aquifer which indicated that marsh migration can be developed as the management strategy to reduce salinization risk from storm surge paldor and michael 2021 investigated the aquifer recovery mechanisms subject to storm surge and impacts of surge frequency exacerbated by climate change through a hypothetical anisotropic coastal aquifer with hydraulic conductivity of 50 and 5 m d representing sandy deposits with variable clay content however these studies did not examine the impacts of complex geologic heterogeneity on vswi problems even though the heterogeneity of coastal aquifer is a common and critical factor which affects the variable density groundwater flow and solute transport only a few studies considered the vswi process in heterogeneous aquifer conditions mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2019 yang et al 2015 furthermore for the coastal aquifer composed of fractured media karst conduits or connected geologic structures fig 1 the spatial field of hydraulic conductivity formed by high permeability channels would create a number of preferential flow paths and increase the complexity and variability of salinization process geng and michael 2020 de vriendt et al 2020 therefore the coastal aquifer with connected heterogeneous field leads to the complex salinization and recovery mechanisms for vswi and causes substantial uncertainty for coastal groundwater management to alleviate swi risks and safeguard coastal freshwater resources the various engineering measures have been proposed and constructed to enhance the resilience of coastal aquifer the countermeasures to mitigate vswi associated with storm surge can be categorized as hard structures such as sea walls dykes yang et al 2013 and green infrastructures such as mangrove forests seagrass and dune grass bed temmerman et al 2013 the common strategies to prevent lswi can be categorized as hydraulic barrier and physical barrier the hydraulic barrier is either the negative hydraulic barrier that reduces saltwater head by pumping seawater in the coastal aquifer stein et al 2020 or the positive hydraulic barrier that utilizes recharge wells to increase the landward flux yang et al 2021 the physical barrier includes subsurface dam chang et al 2019 with an opening in the vicinity of water table and cutoff wall with an opening adjacent to the bottom of aquifer zheng et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the physical barriers have been built in the japan and china to successfully prevent and control lswi japan green resources agency 2004 wu et al 2008 hence the measure is a feasible and effective strategy while has a longer service life than hydraulic barrier that often confronts with the injection well clogging challenge due to geologic heterogeneity the surface infrastructures can be flexibly modified to avoid the future risks of storm surge whereas physical barrier is a permanent subsurface structure which has to face the challenges derived from the exogenous stresses for example the high frequency and intensity of storm surge may induce greater vswi at the farther inland side of subsurface structure where the residual saltwater is poorly freshened due to the prolonged flow path and the barrier to our knowledge the research on salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer subject to storm surge combined with the connectivity heterogeneity and physical barrier is lacking yet of great importance for the assessment of coastal aquifer vulnerability and management this study is intended to examine the combined impacts of connected heterogeneity and physical barrier on the salinization and recovery processes of coastal aquifer suffering from the single and repetitive storm surges fig 1 the numerical study of fully integrated surface water and variably saturated and density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport simulation is implemented to elucidate the salinization mechanisms of vswi in the coastal aquifer characterized with the different level of connectivity heterogeneity we then analyze the impacts of physical barrier and surge frequency on the salinized extent quantified by the volume and total salt mass of salinization plume our results provide important insights into the interplay among the surge driven saltwater intrusion and geologic heterogeneity and physical barrier contributing to the coastal groundwater management which is facing the substantial uncertainty and future risks from storm surge 2 methodology 2 1 numerical modeling 2 1 1 modeling tool hydrogeosphere hgs is applied to simulate the variably saturated and variable density flow and solute transport processes for storm surge event in the unconfined coastal aquifer hgs uses richard s equation for 3d variably saturated subsurface flow and the diffusive wave approximation of the saint venant equation for 2d overland flow therrien et al 2010 the water and solute exchange flux between surface and subsurface domains are simulated with the dual node approach which assumes a thin layer whose thickness is the coupling length and can be formulated as yang et al 2013 1 q ex ρ u ρ 0 k r k z l e h f h f o 2 γ ex c u q ex where qex is water exchange flux between surface and subsurface domains

detailed implementations of numerical methods and modeling theory can be found in the manual documents of hgs therrien et al 2010 2 1 2 model setup the 2d vertical cross section is selected as model domain to simulate aquifer salinization and recovery processes induced by storm surge as illustrated in fig 2 the domain extends 650 m long with the shoreline at x 50 m and 30 m below sea level the model was discretized with constant size 1 m in the horizontal direction and variable size in the vertical direction there are 14 layers of proportional depth between the surface and 10 m and top two layers with half size of remaining layers to simulate surficial root zone the vertical range from 10 m to 30 m is uniformly discretized to 20 layers with 1 m layer the discretization scheme satisfies the mesh péclet number criterion pem δl αl 4 voss and souza 1987 in which δl is grid size 1 m and αl is longitudinal dispersivity 0 5 m the surface slope is 0 02 from 0 to 50 m with a minimum elevation of 1 m at x 0 m and 0 005 from 50 to 650 m with a maximum elevation of 3 m at x 650 m to simulate coastal aquifer the maximum surge height is set to 2 5 m which means storm surge can reach the upstream of model domain x 550 m the single surge event firstly increased to the maximum surge height and then decreased back to zero over the stress period of 12 h the boundary conditions include seaward boundary and surface recharge boundary and landward flux boundary the seaward boundary in the overland flow zone is a specified head boundary which exhibits sinusoidal level hsurge during storm surge and then recovers to mean sea level 0 m at the remaining simulation period the subsurface sea boundary hsea is set to be linear relation of hydrostatic pressure and formulated as 4 h sea t h surge t z ρ s ρ f z where ρ s is saline density ml 3 ρf is freshwater density ml 3 z is the elevation in the seaward boundary l the salt concentration of seawater and surge inundation is uniformly prescribed to be 35 g l the surface recharge boundary is set to specified flux boundary with 0 0005 m d which is the net recharge accounting for precipitation and evapotranspiration the landward boundary is specified with an inland recharge flux 0 04 m d and the concentration of 0 g l the bottom of aquifer is bedrock surface and prescribed to be no flow boundary the simulation was run for 100 years to reach a quasi steady state in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifers in addition for the case of physical barrier the extended simulation period 30 years was set to make the lswi process reach a new steady state again then the groundwater head and salinity distribution were assigned as the initial conditions to simulate vswi process in order to evaluate the impacts of connected heterogeneity we refer to the generation flowchart of stochastic hydraulic conductivity k field developed by zinn and harvey 2003 the isotropic multi gaussian k field is created by the sequential gaussian algorithm with a gaussian covariance model using sgems remy et al 2009 then the transformation which generates unconnected k field can be formulated as zinn and harvey 2003 5 y c 2 e r f 1 2 e r f y 2 1 where yc is the transformed value of ln k and y is the original value the connected k field can be generated to reverse the sign of y c de vriendt et al 2020 analyzed the influences of connected heterogeneity on the dynamics of freshwater saltwater mixing and calcite dissolution to evaluate the karst development processes in the coastal aquifer this study aims to examine the salinization and recovery processes induced by storm surge in the different connectivity level of heterogeneous coastal aquifer furthermore for each type of k field the equivalent homogeneous k field is obtained by modeling groundwater flow with the prescribed hydraulic gradient and then the discharge flux in the efflux boundary is used with darcy s law to calculate the equivalent k geng and michael 2020 the analysis of equivalent k field aims to compare the effects of geologic heterogeneity on the surge induced vswi the model parameters for surface and subsurface flow and transport simulation are summarized in table 1 the geometric mean conductivity is assigned as 40 m d to represent the sandy aquifer with isotropic correlation length de vriendt et al 2020 the van genuchten model is selected to relate pressure head to saturation and relative k in the unsaturated zone and the fitting parameters for the water retention curve are set in terms of the magnitude of k liu and tokunaga 2019 the longitudinal dispersivity α l is set to 0 5 m based on the tradeoff between model scale and computational burden while satisfies the criterion of mesh péclet number gelhar et al 1992 the parameters for overland flow modeling include manning roughness coefficient and coupling length park et al 2009 which refer to the numerical study of yang et al 2013 for storm surge and tide simulation 2 2 modeling scenarios in order to evaluate the combined effects of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process the simulation cases are summarized in table 2 the connected gaussian and unconnected heterogeneity cases were compared to highlight the influences of various connectivity level and their equivalent homogeneity cases were implemented to compare the impacts of geologic heterogeneity on the recovery process then for each type of heterogeneity and equivalent homogeneity subsurface dam and cutoff wall and no barrier scenarios were prescribed to examine the salinization mechanisms of coastal aquifer for single surge event finally the repetitive storm surge events specified with the recurrence period of 5 and 10 years respectively were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process paldor and michael 2021 the storm surge event with 50 years of recurrence period indicates the single surge event therefore a total of 54 simulation cases were devised to illustrate the aquifer salinization pattern affected by the connected heterogeneity and physical barrier and surge frequency 2 3 evaluation metrics in this study the results of numerical experiments were compared using three measurable metrics 1 volume of salinization plume constrained with salt concentration increment greater than 0 5 g l for drinking water epa 2009 2 total salt mass of salinization plume and 3 first spatial moment or centroid position of salinization plume in order to exclude the lswi differences resulted from naturing submarine groundwater discharge and physical barrier the salinized volume vs total salt mass m s and centroid coordinates cκ of salinization plume are formulated as 6 v s t g 1 n p g v g t i f δ c g t 0 5 g l p g 1 e l s e p g 0 7 m s t g 1 n p g v g s g t δ c g t i f δ c g t 0 5 g l p g 1 e l s e p g 0 8 δ c g t c g t surge c

ml 3 note that the discretized cell concentration is averaged with the adjacent node concentration in the hgs simulation 3 results 3 1 impact of connected heterogeneity the study generates gaussian k field using sequential gaussian simulation in the sgems remy et al 2009 and transforms it to the connected and unconnected k field using equation 5 three types of lognormal k field including the same covariance function were created to represent the connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity the ratio ci between the equivalent k keff and the geometric mean km of random field was calculated to measure the connectivity level the keff is larger than km for k field ci 1 including preferential paths and vice versa the study selects the representative realizations which have the ci metric of 1 38 and 1 0 and 0 74 corresponding well to the connectivity level of connected and gaussian and unconnected k field respectively as illustrated in fig 3 a fig 3b g illustrate the spatial distribution of pore water velocity natural lswi and salt concentration increment during single surge event in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases respectively for the pore water velocity in the homogeneous media fig 3c the high velocity only emerges in the discharge zone of groundwater and declines with the decreasing equivalent k however for the heterogeneous media fig 3b the high velocity appears in the discharge zone and high k zones created by local heterogeneity simultaneously therefore the high velocity in the che connected heterogeneity case occurs in the more areas than ghe gaussian heterogeneity and uhe unconnected heterogeneity cases which demonstrates that the higher connectivity level creates more preferential flow paths the natural salinity distribution shown in fig 3d and fig 3e exhibits the mixing zone of swi as bounded in white lines showing the 95 and 5 isoline of seawater salinity and toe locations defined as the intersection point of 50 isoline of seawater salinity and the bottom of coastal aquifer the range of mixing zone in the heterogeneous cases shows the larger spatial variability than those in the homogeneous cases and gradually decreases from connected to unconnected case the toe location moves seaward with the decreasing connectivity level and equivalent k cases the difference of salinity distribution after single surge event at 500 days indicates the maximum salinized extent during surge induced vswi which exhibits the finger shaped plumes owning to density driven vertical solute transport fig 3f and fig 3g the spatial variability of finger shape in the heterogeneous case is more complex than the equivalent homogeneous case overall the vertical intrusion distance of salinization plume increases as the connectivity level elevates whereas decreases in the heterogeneous cases compared to the equivalent homogeneous cases the interesting finding is the salt concentration reduction of lswi as illustrated in the blue zone in fig 3f and fig 3g the reason for the phenomena is that the density driven vswi increases the landward groundwater pressure to push the freshwater seawater interface seaward which is consistent with the research of paldor and michael 2021 meanwhile the heterogeneous case shows the less lswi reduction zone than the corresponding homogeneous case this is because heterogeneity accelerates the mixing of salinization plume with fresh groundwater and alleviates the impacts of overpressures created by the density driven groundwater flow in order to evaluate the evolution of vswi during aquifer recovery the measureable metrics shown in equations 6 7 and 9 were calculated in fig 4 a the salinized volume vs compared to natural lswi increases rapidly and then gradually decreases over the freshening period driven by rainfall recharge and landward groundwater discharge the full recovery of coastal aquifer for all cases requires a flushing period of less than 8 years fig 4a for this set of conditions in the heterogeneous cases the vs curves close to maximum salinized volume are lower than those in the equivalent homogeneous cases therefore the vswi can be alleviated by geologic heterogeneity the elevated connectivity level of heterogeneous aquifer enlarges the maximum salinized volume and shortens the recovery time fig 4a which demonstrates that the coastal aquifer composed of connected geologic structures is more vulnerable to be salinized at the early stage of surge event whereas freshened more quickly over the long term recovery period moreover the temporal behaviors of m s metric show a similar pattern of aquifer salinization and recovery processes fig 4b however the response time of maximum ms is much less than salinized volume which indicates that salt mass accumulates quickly at the initial stage of surge event and then gradually diffuses until the formation of maximum salinization plume the centroid trajectories of salinization plume after storm surges are illustrated in fig 4c in the simulation cases the salinization plume firstly moves downward due to the density driven vertical intrusion and then migrates seaward due to the horizontal flushing of rainfall recharge and landward groundwater discharge there is a clear difference for the centroid trajectories in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous cases at the initial vswi stage cx 350 m the all trajectories show a similar path and the centroid moves downward due to the leading role of the density driven groundwater flow however the trajectories in the homogeneous cases show a deeper migration path than the heterogeneous cases at the later flushing stage cx 300 m which is likely attributed to the differences of mixing rate of salinized groundwater 3 2 impact of physical barrier to evaluate the effect of permanent physical barrier on the aquifer recovery subject to storm surge the subsurface dam and cutoff wall were designed at x 200 m from the shoreline with the penetration depth of 25 m in the connected gaussian unconnected and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the salinity distribution after the construction of physical barrier was simulated to reach a quasi steady state over the 30 years of stress period fig 5 for the cutoff wall scenario the freshwater volume shows a relative increment of 16 62 10 58 and 0 37 in the che ghe and uhe case and 21 11 6 94 and 3 34 in the cho connected homogeneity gho gaussian homogeneity and uho unconnected homogeneity respectively for the subsurface dam scenario the freshwater volume achieves a relative increment of 21 59 12 63 and 1 19 in che ghe and uhe case and 25 89 12 54 and 5 38 in the cho gho and uho case respectively the subsurface dam can retreat the toe location of saltwater wedge whereas cutoff wall flushing out saltwater at the opening adjacent to the bottom of aquifer can retreat the toe location at the cost of increasing the mixing width of dispersion zone which further results in a less increment of total freshwater volume for cutoff wall scenario however the residual saltwater trapped on the landward side of subsurface dam cannot be flushed out in time luyun et al 2009 which may be a persistent threat on the drinking water security zheng et al 2020 the distribution of salinity concentration difference at 500 days that is the response time close to the maximum salinized volume was compared to the pre surge lswi state subject to physical barrier for the cutoff wall scenario fig 6 a and fig 6c the enforced pressure derived from surge induced vswi propagates to the left side of the wall through an opening adjacent to the aquifer bottom and only pushes the toe location of saltwater wedge seaward where the blue zone occurs rather than the saltwater freshwater interface however for the subsurface dam scenario fig 6b and fig 6d the enforced pressure firstly propagates to the aquifer bottom and then an opening adjacent to land surface and finally pushes the saltwater freshwater interface on the left side of the dam seaward which creates more salinity reduction zones furthermore the heterogeneous case generally has a smaller vertical intrusion distance for salinization plume than the equivalent homogeneous case especially for the lower connectivity of k field the temporal changes of salinized volume and total salt mass metrics were investigated for the comparison of impacts of physical barrier and geologic heterogeneity on the long term recovery process of coastal aquifer as illustrated in fig 7 for the connected cases fig 7a 7d subsurface dam scenario leads to the greatest increment of the salinized metrics at the later stage of aquifer recovery the cutoff wall scenario achieves the reduction of salinized metrics at the early stage 0 2 years and gradually exceeds no barriers scenario but still less than those in the subsurface dam scenario moreover the recovery time of coastal aquifer constructed with physical barrier is prolonged which demonstrates salinization plume is flushed out more slowly than the cases having no barriers therefore for the connected cases physical barrier exacerbates the surge induced salinization risks especially for equivalent homogeneous cases for the gaussian cases fig 7e h both barrier scenarios decrease or maintain the similar salinized volume and total salt mass at the early stage 0 2 years and then increase the salinized extent at the later stage compared to no barriers scenario during the later stage of aquifer recovery both barrier scenarios increase the salinized metrics to the similar extent in the ghe case fig 7e and fig 7g whereas subsurface dam has a larger prolonged effect than cutoff wall in the gho case fig 7f and fig 7h overall for the long term recovery process in the gaussian k field the exacerbated salinized trend due to physical barrier can still be maintained compared to no barriers scenario in the unconnected cases fig 7i l the maximum salinized metrics are decreased compared to the peak values in the connected and gaussian cases in the uhe case fig 7i and fig 7k both barrier scenarios decrease the salinized volume and total salt mass over the simulation period which is reversed with the salinization trend of connected and gaussian cases at the later stage of aquifer recovery 6 8 years in uho case fig 7j and fig 7l subsurface dam scenario still has an increment of salinized metric and cutoff wall shows a negligible deviation compared to no barriers scenario these results demonstrate that the connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity determines the salinization pattern subject to physical barrier this study examined the accumulated salinized volume and total salt mass to evaluate the compound effects of physical barrier during aquifer recovery process in the che and ghe cases fig 8 physical barrier scenario enlarges salinized volume and total salt mass and subsurface dam scenario has a greater increment however for uhe case both barrier scenarios decrease the accumulated salinized metric compared to no barriers scenario in the cho and gho case subsurface dam scenario achieves a larger increment of salinized volume and total salt mass than the heterogeneous cases the cutoff wall scenario has a distinct increment of salinized metric in the cho case whereas shows a minor deviation in the gho case in the uho case subsurface dam scenario still maintains a slight accumulated increment of salinized metric and cutoff wall scenario shows a reduction trend compared to no barriers scenario moreover there is a clear difference between uhe and uho case therefore the geologic heterogeneity is a non trivial factor to evaluate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer confronting with the surge risks and the permeant subsurface barriers 3 3 impact of surge frequency the repetitive storm surge event assigned with the recurrence period rp of 5 and 10 years were simulated to investigate the effects of surge frequency on the recovery process of connected gaussian and unconnected heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer the salinized volume and total salt mass metrics were examined fig 9 for the storm surge with an rp of 10 years fig 9a 9b 9e and 9f the maximum salinized volume and maximum total salt mass in the connected case green curve are the highest and followed by gaussian case red curve and unconnected case blue curve conversely the recovery time of salinized aquifer is prolonged from connected to unconnected case therefore the connectivity level is a critical factor to regulate the maximum salinized extent and aquifer recovery time moreover the heterogeneity results in the reduction of maximum salinized metrics compared to the equivalent homogeneous cases which may be attributed to the smaller vertical intrusion distance and accelerated mixing of saltwater with fresh groundwater these findings are consistent with the findings in the single surge event which shows the current surge frequency only triggers the repetition of salinization process of single surge event however for the repetitive storm surge with an rp of 5 years fig 9c 9d 9g and 9h the minimum salinized volume and minimum total salt mass have a nonzero value which demonstrates the salinized aquifer cannot be recovered to the pre surge state therefore the surge frequency results in the formation of residual salinization plume which cannot be flushed out in time before the occurrence of the next storm surge in the connected cases the minimum salinized metric is less than the gaussian and unconnected case this is due to the enhanced freshening capacity of coastal aquifer by the preferential flow paths derived from the connected geological structures meanwhile the residual salt mass and salinized volume in the gaussian and unconnected cases show the elevated surge frequency aggravates the coastal aquifer vulnerability the maximum salinized volume and total salt mass have a clear difference during the first surge event and then a minor deviation for the remaining surge events in the heterogeneous cases fig 9c and fig 9g therefore the surge frequency has been a more important factor than geologic heterogeneity to affect the maximum salinized metric in order to evaluate the impacts of physical barrier on the aquifer recovery during repetitive storm surge the accumulated differences of salinized volume and total salt mass are analyzed as illustrated in fig 10 for the che ghe cho and gho cases the salinized metric is elevated which shows that the surge induced vswi is exacerbated by physical barrier the increment of salinized volume and total salt mass for the surge event with an rp of 5 years is higher than the event with an rp of 10 years therefore the high frequency surge event magnifies the salinization differences triggered by physical barrier for the connected and gaussian cases however in the uhe case the salinized metric is reduced due to physical barrier especially for the high frequency surge event in the uho case subsurface dam scenario still increases salinized volume and total salt mass whereas cutoff wall scenario decreases total salt mass which may be attributed to the high velocity at the opening adjacent to the aquifer bottom although the rp is different for the repetitive storm surge event the relative changes of accumulated salinized metrics of the aquifer with and without physical barrier are similar to single surge event fig 8 and the high frequency surge event only amplifies the differences consequently geologic heterogeneity plays a critical role on the effects of physical barrier on the accumulated salinization process during the repetitive storm surge event 4 discussion this study highlights the roles of connected heterogeneity and physical barrier on coastal aquifer recovery process subject to the single and repetitive storm surges following the single surge event in the three type of heterogeneity i e connected gaussian and unconnected k field the che case greatly increases the maximum salinized volume and total salt mass and the freshening rate of salinized aquifer in response to storm surge the effect is expected to be much stronger and pronounced on the complex real world heterogeneity such as fractured and karst coastal aquifer or clastic sedimentary depositional aquifer aquitard system the equivalent homogeneous cases are implemented to inform the larger salinized volume and total salt mass than the corresponding heterogeneous case and the centroid trajectories of salinization plume show the heterogeneity reduces the vertical intrusion distance this study utilizes the flushing intensity f to quantitatively measure the freshening capacity of coastal aquifer which is the velocity magnitude over a horizontal distance l at elevation z zlotnik et al 2011 12 f z 1 l 0 l v x 2 x z v z 2 x z d x the velocity magnitude is averaged over the distance from the shoreline to the inland boundary and calculated as the flushing intensity over the each model layer and z is the vertical coordinate of the discretized cell at the shoreline as illustrated in fig 11 each f curve in the equivalent homogeneous cases has a linear trend as the depth increases for the majority of aquifer region 27 z 3 however the f curve in the heterogeneous case shows a non linear trend in the same region which indicates the anomalous velocity field induced by geologic heterogeneity the intersection point of f curve reflects the similar depth z 18 m for all simulation cases above the intersection point the average flushing intensity is the largest in the connected case followed by gaussian and unconnected case the anomalous changes of flushing intensity occur in the heterogeneous cases in the region where the local mixing rate of saltwater with fresh groundwater is elevated which further reduces the vertical intrusion distance therefore aquifer heterogeneity decreases maximum salinized metric compared to the equivalent homogeneous case fig 4a and fig 4b below the intersection point the variability trend of flushing intensity is reversed this is due to the lswi saltwater wedge which results in the different low velocity zone e g the connected case has a greatest lswi distance to reduce the flushing intensity at the aquifer bottom overall the comparison of f curve shows the che case including connected geological structures has a maximum flushing capacity in the upper zone of coastal aquifer where the main flushing process of surge induced vswi occurs therefore the connected case has a shortest recovery time during storm surge event compared to the gaussian and unconnected case physical barrier is an effective engineering measure to prevent lswi and safeguard the fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifer however the permanent subsurface measure alters the natural conductivity field and even eliminates the submarine groundwater discharge to ocean therefore it is of great importance to understand the role of physical barrier in the surge induced vswi for the risk assessment of storm surge event which triggers the farther inland saltwater intrusion the modeling results suggest that physical barrier in the connected and gaussian cases leads to increased salinized volume and total salt mass and the longer recovery time especially for subsurface dam scenario fig 7a h however the salinized extent is alleviated in the uho case and even reversed to enhance the aquifer flushing capacity in the uhe case fig 7i compared to no barriers scenario the centroid trajectories of salinization plume were compared for all simulation cases to illustrate the effects of physical barrier on vswi as illustrated in fig 12 each centroid trajectory was colored with total salt mass of salinization plume and the centroid gradually migrated from the landward to seaward boundary it is noted that the vertical migration distance of the centroid induced by physical barrier is larger than no barriers scenario in fig 12a b and fig 12d f which corresponds well to the simulation results indicating the detrimental effects of physical barrier in fig 7a h fig 7j and fig 7l the reason for the phenomena is that the lswi reduction in the landward zone due to physical barrier fig 5 creates a suitable zone to increase vswi extent whereas the small flushing intensity generally occurs in the deeper zone of aquifer therefore the vertical intrusion distance is a critical indicator to evaluate the vulnerability of coastal aquifer subject to storm surge and physical barrier however the centroid trajectories affected by physical barrier indicate a smaller vertical intrusion distance and larger freshening rate at the later stage of aquifer recovery compared to no barriers scenario in the uhe case fig 12c meanwhile the marked color of the centroid shows that physical barrier induces a greater extent of reduction of total salt mass at the initial stage compared to no barriers scenario which weakens the capacity of density driven vertical intrusion and accelerates the freshening process in the shallow zone of aquifer fig 12c the reason for the reduction of total salt mass at the initial stage is that physical barrier elevates the groundwater head in the landward aquifer which combines the effects of unconnected geologic structures to prevent vswi in the uhe case fig 7i and fig 7k it is important for coastal groundwater management to understand the mechanisms of groundwater salinization of the repetitive storm surge which may be exacerbated by climate changes although paldor and michael 2021 examined the influences of the repetitive surge event on lswi in the homogeneous aquifer the findings of our study demonstrate that connected heterogeneity and physical barrier are non trivial factors for the aquifer recovery process subject to storm surge with the different recurrence period the simulation of the repetitive storm surge with a 10 years rp reveals that salinized metric starts to increase to maximum and then gradually decreases and eventually reaches the pre surge lswi state which shows the full recovery of aquifer and the cycle of salinized metric in single surge event remains until the final storm surge the connected case has the maximum salinized extent and shortest recovery time followed by gaussian and unconnected case and the aquifer heterogeneity induces a decrease of maximum salinized extent compared to equivalent homogeneous aquifer these results are consistent with the salinization mechanisms of single surge event however for the repetitive storm surge with a 5 years rp the salinized metric reaches a non zero value at the end of each surge repetition which shows that salt concentration distribution cannot be recovered to the pre surge state this is because the recovery time is longer than recurrence period and residual salt mass persists over the simulation period the connected case shows a largest variation range of salinized metric due to the connected heterogeneity which creates more preferential flow paths to accelerate density driven vertical intrusion to reach the aquifer bottom and increases the flushing rate of later stage to reach the less residual salt mass however the variation range of salinized metric for gaussian and unconnected case is smaller and the residual salt mass and salinized volume are higher than the connected case fig 9c d and fig 9g h therefore the lower connectivity level for coastal aquifer shows the larger aquifer vulnerability confronting with the high frequency storm surge which is an important implication for coastal groundwater management furthermore physical barrier increases the salinized extent of the repetitive storm surge for the connected and gaussian case especially for subsurface dam in the cho case fig 10 for unconnected case the similar behavior in single surge event is observed i e physical barrier reduces the salinized extent in the uhe case overall the high frequency surge event maintains a large residual salt mass especially for coastal aquifer composed of unconnected geologic structures and enlarges the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier 5 conclusions this study quantitatively investigated the role of connected heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on saltwater intrusion in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous coastal aquifer through a variably saturated and variable density flow and transport simulation the total salt mass and salinized volume and centroid of salinization plume were calculated to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of surge induced vswi the representative hydraulic conductivity fields were generated to describe the different connectivity level of geologic heterogeneity the equivalent homogeneous k fields were used to compare the impacts of geologic heterogeneity to evaluate the role of physical barrier during storm surge event the numerical model was tailored to the prescribed penetration depth and horizontal location setting for subsurface dam and cutoff wall furthermore this study attempted to examine the effects of surge frequency probably exacerbated by climate changes on the recovery process overall a series of 54 simulation cases have been implemented to elucidate salinization mechanisms of vswi induced by single and repetitive storm surge in the heterogeneous and equivalent homogeneous aquifer system the major conclusions can be summarized as follows the connected heterogeneity creates preferential flow paths to accelerate the flushing of surge induced saltwater intrusion and achieves the shortest recovery time compared to equivalent homogeneous case geologic heterogeneity leads to the decreased peak values of salinized volume and total salt mass and a less vertical intrusion distance this study elucidates the distributions of averaged flushing intensity as the aquifer depth increases which indicates the anomalous non linear trend in heterogeneous cases whereas the linear trend in the homogeneous cases therefore geologic heterogeneity enhances the mixing of saltwater with fresh groundwater and triggers a faster decline of total salt mass which alleviates the density driven vswi that s the reason for the reduction of maximum salinized extent in the heterogeneous cases the physical barrier elevates the salinized extent compared to no barriers in the connected and gaussian cases and subsurface dam achieves a larger increment especially for the equivalent homogeneous cases the analysis of centroid trajectory shows that vertical intrusion distance is a non trivial indicator to evaluate the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier the implication is critical for the vulnerability assessment of coastal aquifer constructed with physical barrier due to storm surge event the emergence of the repetitive storm surge is inevitable especially for the high frequency storm surge event driven by climate changes the study suggests that the low frequency surge 10 years rp can achieve the cycle of single surge event with the same magnitude and full recovery of coastal aquifer however the high frequency surge 5 years rp maintains a residual salt mass which cannot be flushed out in time moreover the high frequency surge in the gaussian and unconnected case has a significant increase for the residual salt mass and salinized volume which demonstrates that high frequency surge induces a substantial salinization risk for the aquifer with the lower connectivity level in addition the surge frequency amplifies the differences of aquifer recovery process due to physical barrier and the relative changes of salinization trend are similar to single surge event these findings reveal the combined effects of geologic heterogeneity physical barrier and surge frequency on the aquifer recovery process which highlights the connected heterogeneity strongly affects the salinization pattern especially for coastal aquifer constructed with subsurface dam subject to high frequency surge event it is of great importance to elucidate the combined impacts to evaluate the aquifer vulnerability and achieve an adaptive strategy to safeguard the fresh groundwater resources due to the substantial swi risks derived from geologic heterogeneity and climate changes in general the connectivity structure is mainly determined by the variance of log normal random k field and the dimensionality of aquifer system fiori and jankovic 2012 while our study is a 2 d hypothetical case with a low variance which may be much less than that in real world aquifer system the fundamental mechanisms of coastal aquifer recovery process subject to storm surge and physical barrier in the connected heterogeneous aquifer are expected to be qualitatively similar to the case including a higher variance or sub horizontally stratified 3d aquifer aquitard system which could expect a stronger preferential flow rate therefore the future investigations should consider real world coastal aquifer system from a geologic perspective of connectivity structure and examine the complex patterns of surge induced saltwater intrusion to assist coastal groundwater management credit authorship

3289,coupled inversion is a promising technique for determining soil hydraulic properties from time lapse geophysical measurements in this inversion approach a hydrological model is coupled with ground penetrating radar gpr forward modelling to avoid interpretation errors from data processing in this study a workflow for coupled gpr full waveform inversion cfwi is proposed that combines the benefits of coupled inversion and full waveform inversion fwi to estimate soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr measurements in particular a synthetic modelling study is presented that compares the performance of coupled inversion of full waveforms and first arrival time data from zero offset profile zop borehole measurements obtained during an infiltration event for estimating hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer soil profile it was found that the thickness of the first layer could be more accurately estimated by cfwi because of the additional information contained in reflected and refracted waves from the air soil layer boundary furthermore the hydraulic parameters estimated by the coupled inversion of gpr travel times slightly deviated from true values and showed a relatively large uncertainty whereas the results of cfwi precisely matched the known water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions despite these promising results several challenges should be solved before cfwi can be applied to experimental gpr data first conducting cfwi needs accurate conceptual setups for the hydro geo logical model furthermore a robust approach should be developed to accurately estimate an effective source wavelet from the experimental zop data and a more sophisticated hydrological modelling approach has to be considered to better estimate the distribution of soil electrical conductivity during the infiltration event finally the accuracy and efficiency of current gpr modelling methods may need to be improved keywords coupled inversion full waveform inversion soil hydraulic properties 1 introduction accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is crucial for the reliable prediction of water

content swc dynamics e g huisman et al 2003 klotzsche et al 2018 that are directly influenced by soil hydraulic properties because of the strong link between swc and bulk dielectric permittivity topp et al 1980 in the last decades significant progress has been made with the use of different gpr configurations surface off ground and borehole gpr to estimate soil hydraulic parameters e g busch et al 2013 jadoon et al 2008 jadoon et al 2012 lambot et al 2006 kowalsky et al 2004 rossi et al 2015 rucker and ferré 2004 yu et al 2021 borehole gpr has a larger investigation depth and a better control of the vertical resolution than off ground and surface gpr huisman et al 2003 and thus shows advantages for estimating soil hydraulic parameters especially at specialized test sites with appropriate boreholes e g binley et al 2001 looms et al 2008 kowalsky et al 2005 borehole gpr data are conventionally processed using ray based inversion approaches e g irving et al 2007 which only provide velocity and attenuation information obtained from the first arrival times and first cycle amplitudes of the gpr data respectively such ray based approaches generally have a limited resolution for subsurface characterization because only a small amount of the data is considered therefore ray based inversions have difficulty to provide information resolving small scale high contrast layers such as high porosity zones that could be related to preferential flow zones in aquifer systems or impermeable clay lenses klotzsche et al 2019a in contrast full waveform inversion fwi of gpr data considers the entire measured signal including reflections and refractions and is therefore able to provide more accurate and spatially higher resolved permittivity and electrical conductivity information than ray based methods the fwi method was first proposed by tarantola 1984 for seismic data fwi of seismic data has been further developed since then and is currently widely used e g berkhout 2012 brossier et al 2009 vigh and starr 2008 a comprehensive overview of fwi developments and applications is provided by virieux and operto 2009 because of the similarity between seismic and

obtain high resolution information on the spatial distribution of both dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity the application of fwi for off ground and surface gpr has mainly focused on estimating the properties of simplified models with a limited number of unknowns such as layered media busch et al 2012 ihamouten et al 2018 or cylindrical objects liu et al 2018 in the subsurface in contrast fwi of vertical borehole gpr multi offset gathers mog measurements can obtain high resolution 2d subsurface images by using a gradient based inversion algorithm e g gueting et al 2017 klotzsche et al 2010 klotzsche et al 2014 looms et al 2017 borehole gpr can also be conducted in horizontally installed boreholes using zero offset profiling zop measurements to estimate the distribution of dielectric permittivity at specific depths e g galagedara et al 2002 yu et al 2020 we will refer to this as horizontal borehole gpr measurements in the following one of the first long term case studies applying horizontal borehole gpr was reported by klotzsche et al 2019b for monitoring horizonal swc variations at different depths and treatments at the selhausen test site using the two rhizotron facilities cai et al 2016 however the 2d gradient based fwi algorithm cannot be applied with the current forward model using several horizontal zop measurements along the horizontal tubes to provide a tomographic image with the correct lateral variability the main reason for this problem is that the air soil interface which causes critical refracted airwaves in the data that interfere with the direct wave cannot be accounted for additionally using zop data do not provide the necessary dense ray coverage with a high amount of different ray path angles to derive accurate permittivity and electrical conductivity results until now only a preliminary study was performed by klotzsche et al 2016 to invert dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity for a vertical 2 layer soil profile using the full waveforms of zop data measured at different depths this approach worked well with synthetic gpr data where the effective source wavelet is known and kept fixed during the inversion however it is still challenging to apply fwi to experimental horizontal borehole gpr data because it is difficult to estimate an effective source wavelet from a single zop trace to estimate soil hydraulic properties from time lapse geophysical data many recent studies have relied on a coupled inversion approach e g hinnell et al 2010 huisman et al 2010 lambot et al 2006 mboh et al 2012 compared to a traditional sequential inversion approach where the hydrological model is inverted with swc information estimated from geophysical data coupled inversion is recognized as a more reliable and advanced approach that directly assimilates the geophysical data and therefore avoids interpretation errors from data processing coupled inversion was applied successfully to gpr travel times to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters at the field scale looms et al 2008 scholer et al 2013 yu et al 2021 since gpr waveforms are expected to contain more information about the subsurface than gpr travel times it is anticipated that the combined use of coupled inversion and fwi i e coupled full waveform inversion cfwi is potentially able to provide soil hydraulic parameter estimates with less uncertainty up to now there are only a few studies that have reported the use of cfwi to estimate hydraulic parameters from time lapse off ground gpr measurements lambot et al 2009 or synthetic seismic data li et al 2020 however no studies have been reported that applied cfwi to borehole gpr data for parameterizing hydrological models based on the fwi technique reported by klotzsche et al 2016 and the workflow of coupled inversion of gpr travel times developed by yu et al 2021 this study investigates potential benefits and shortcomings of coupled full waveform inversion cfwi for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer profile using synthetic horizontal borehole gpr data first a workflow for cfwi will be proposed next a synthetic infiltration experiment will be designed to simulate swc and gpr data and parameter correlations between hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer will be analyzed for cfwi finally cfwi will be applied to the synthetic data and the inversion results will be compared with the results from the inversion of swc data from point measurements and the more established coupled inversion of gpr travel times 2 materials and methods 2 1 horizontal borehole gpr measurements zop measurements can be used to monitor swc dynamics at the depths where horizontal boreholes are installed e g klotzsche et al 2019b to perform a zop survey the transmitter and receiver antennas are moved simultaneously with the same spacing in two different boreholes using a straight wave approximation the first arrival times from the zop survey can be used to determine a 1d dielectric permittivity profile using 1 ε obs c t obs t 0 d 2 where ε obs is the observed dielectric permittivity d m is the distance between two boreholes t obs ns is the first arrival time c is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 and t 0 ns is the time zero offset this offset is commonly determined by conducting multi offset measurements with the borehole antennas in air with respect to the details for obtaining t 0 from experimental zop data we refer to klotzsche et al 2019b in the case of synthetic gpr data t 0 is known after obtaining the soil dielectric permittivity swc θ obs can be calculated using the complex refractive index model crim roth et al 1990 2 θ obs ε obs 1 φ ε s φ ε w 1 where ε s is the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil matrix φ is the soil porosity and ε w is the relative permittivity of water 84 at 10 c in this study ε s is assumed to be 4 7 for soils with high quartz content robinson et al 2005 2 2 vertical water flow vertical 1d water flow in porous media can be described by the richards equation 3 θ h t z k r h h z 1 where θ h is the water retention function describing the relationship between the volumetric swc θ cm3 cm 3 and pressure head h cm k r h is the hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 as a function of the pressure

constitutive relations the soil hydraulic properties can be described with six parameters θ r θ s α n k s l 2 3 hydrological and gpr forward modelling a synthetic case study was used to investigate advantages and shortcomings of cfwi for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer h t for a vertical 2 layer profile based on horizontal borehole gpr measurements the synthetic case study is based on the realistic infiltration experiment reported by yu et al 2021 a 2 layer soil profile 1 5 m deep was employed to generate synthetic swc profiles based on the hydraulic parameterization described by cai et al 2018 to represent the selhausen test site table 1 in this model we changed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil from 0 0004 cm min 1 reported by cai et al 2018 to 0 04 cm min 1 because it should be greater than the infiltration rate to avoid ponding of water at the layer interface the synthetic study consists of a single 6 hour infiltration event 360 min followed by a 90 min period with soil water redistribution without infiltration the infiltration rate was 0 03 cm min 1 horizontal borehole gpr data were simulated at 3 different depths 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m every 30 min fig 1 a hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 was used to simulate the vertical swc dynamics in this synthetic infiltration experiment the total simulation domain was 1 5 m deep and discretized with 151 nodes with an equal spacing of 1 cm since it is commonly not easy to obtain accurate pressure head information during a real infiltration experiment we used a vertical swc profile as the initial condition because swc data can be obtained from borehole gpr data acquired prior to the first infiltration event in this study the initial condition was defined as a linearly interpolated swc profile with a swc of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 at the surface and a swc of 0 08 cm3 cm 3 at 1 5 m depth for both forward simulations and inversions it is assumed that the infiltration events were conducted on bare soil and therefore root water uptake was neglected also evaporation was not considered in the hydrological modelling because typical evaporation rates are much lower than the used infiltration rate an atmospheric boundary condition with surface run off was used as the upper boundary condition and a seepage face h 0 was used as the lower boundary condition gprmax3d giannopoulos 2005 warren et al 2016 was used to simulate 3d gpr wave propagation using a finite difference time domain fdtd numerical method in this study the size of the simulation domain for gprmax3d was set to 2 1 1 1 5 m fig 1b which was discretized with a cell size of 0 02 m perfectly matched layers pml were used as the absorbing boundary conditions with 10 cells at each side horizontal borehole gpr data were simulated at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depths according to the borehole setup for the selhausen test site the distance between transmitter and receiver antennas was set as 0 75 m the magnetic permeability μ 0 is 4 π 10 7n a 2 to save simulation time the thickness of the soil layer was set to 0 8 m instead of the 1 5 m that was used for hydrological modelling since swc changes below 0 8 m depth were expected to have minor influence on the gpr data simulated at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depth this size of the domain also ensured that the pml boundaries were sufficiently far away from the gpr simulation domain we defined a current source in the y direction to excite the electromagnetic waves the center frequency of the current source was 200 mhz and the excitation function was the first derivative of a gaussian wavelet after obtaining the synthetic gpr data from gprmax3d the first arrival time of each gpr trace can be automatically picked using the approach reported by yu et al 2021 for a more realistic synthetic modelling study gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 1 ns δ t was added to the noise free gpr travel time the noise level of 0 1 ns is based on the sampling interval of 0 2 ns typically used in horizontal borehole gpr applications which limits the accuracy of travel time determination the noise added to the gpr waveform data was based on noise evaluation using previously experimental gpr waveforms reported by yu et al 2020 which showed that noise varied from 0 1 to 0 5 of the maximum amplitude therefore gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 5 of the maximum amplitude δ e was added to the simulated gpr waveforms in this synthetic study 2 4 set up of the coupled full waveform inversion we consider two inversion strategies in this study coupled inversion of gpr travel times fig 2 a and coupled full waveform inversion fig 2b in both approaches vertical swc profiles θ mod were obtained from hydrus 1d simulation with hydraulic parameters next the dielectric permittivity profiles ε mod used as input for the gprmax3d simulations were obtained from θ mod by rearranging eq 2 7 ε mod ε w 1 θ mod 1 φ ε s φ 2 the main difference between cfwi and coupled inversion of travel times is that cfwi directly minimizes the misfit between measured e obs v m 1 and simulated waveforms e mod v m 1 in the time domain instead of the misfit between first arrival times in this study the soil is assumed to be low loss therefore the first arrival time is not sensitive to the soil electrical conductivity which was thus not considered for the coupled inversion of travel times in contrast the soil electrical conductivity should be considered for gpr modelling in cfwi since the soil electrical conductivity influences the attenuation and thus the amplitude of the gpr waveform the distribution of the electrical conductivity can be reasonably obtained from the distribution of swc and a petrophysical relationship e g by archie s law archie 1942 8 σ mod 1 k a σ w φ m a θ mod φ n a where σ mod s m 1 is the bulk soil electrical conductivity used for gpr modelling σ w is the

assumed to 1 2 and 2 respectively as suggested by ewing and hunt 2006 the cost function c mvg t ns for the coupled inversion of gpr travel times is the rmse of modelled t mod and observed t obs gpr

inversion of gpr travel times were minimized using sce ua duan et al 1993 which is a general purpose global optimization algorithm the inversion was assumed to be converged if the cost function value decreased to a specified value or the improvement of the best model was below 0 01 in the last 10 evolution loops before conducting the inversions the response surface method vrugt and dane 2006 was employed to show the parameter uncertainty and correlation for cfwi and the coupled inversion of travel times by using a 2d grid search of the cost function distribution as a reference the response surface was also generated based on noisy swc data that could be obtained by point measurements such as time domain reflectometry tdr the noise level for swc was assumed to be 0 01 cm3 cm 3 topp and ferré 2005 the response surfaces for point measurements were generated based on the following cost function 11 c mvg θ i 1 n θ θ i mod θ i obs 2 n θ where θ i mod and θ i obs are modelled and measured swc respectively and n θ is the number of the point measurements the residual swc θ r can only be reliably estimated with swc information obtained under very dry conditions e g groenevelt and grant 2004 van dam et al 1994 weynants et al 2009 since the initial swc profile used in this study did not consider dry conditions the inversion is not expected to be sensitive to θ r therefore we only inverted the hydraulic parameters θ s α n k s and the thickness of the first layer h t for a 2 layer soil profile k s was inverted using a log transformation log k s after obtaining the final inversion results from cfwi and coupled inversion of gpr travel times the uncertainty and the correlation coefficients between the estimated parameters were evaluated using a first order uncertainty approximation kool and parker 1988 here it was assumed that correlation coefficients that exceed 0 6 indicate an undesirably strong correlation 3 results 3 1 synthetic data the vertical swc profiles at times when synthetic gpr measurements were simulated are shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that the infiltration front reached the layer boundary at a depth of 0 3 m after 180 min at the end of the infiltration event 360 min the upper 0 6 m of soil was saturated and the infiltration front moved to 0 8 m depth after the infiltration stopped the infiltration front still moved down to a depth of 0 9 m and the swc above 0 6 m depth slightly decreased due to redistribution the synthetic time lapse swc data at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depths are shown in fig 3b it was found that the soil at 0 2 and 0 4 m depth reached saturation after 200 and 300 min respectively after obtaining the synthetic swc profiles the dielectric permittivity profiles and the electrical conductivity profiles were obtained to generate synthetic gpr data with gprmax3d fig 3c which were then used to determine the gpr first arrival time data red crosses in fig 3c a comparison of fig 3a and fig 3b shows that the synthetic time lapse swc data and gpr travel time data have synchronous dynamics during the entire experiment the gpr waveforms simulated at different times and depths showed large differences fig 3c which was not always the case for the swc measurements and the first arrival times for example the arrival time of the direct wave simulated at a 0 6 m depth did not show a clear difference between 0 and 30 min but the simulated gpr waveforms are obviously different at these two measurement times moreover the arrival times and waveforms of the reflected waves generated on the air soil boundary are different at these measurement times see the waveforms enclosed by the red rectangle in fig 3c to explain this in detail wavefield snapshots for the gpr measurements at 0 6 m depth were obtained at 0 and 30 min infiltration time fig 4 in the early stage 8 ns only the direct waves can be observed fig 4a and 4b as the infiltration front did not reach the 0 6 m depth the waveforms of the direct wave that were measured by the receiver between 8 and 14 ns fig 3c did not show differences at these two measurement times the reflected waves were generated on the soil surface at around 12 ns fig 4c and 4d since infiltration increased the swc of the top 0 1 m of the soil at 30 min see fig 3a the permittivity of the top soil and the reflection coefficient of the soil surface were changed as a result the travel time and amplitude of the reflected waves measured by the receiver between 15 and 20 ns see the red rectangle in fig 3c showed substantial differences see fig 4e 4 h at these measurement times in particular the reflected wave simulated at 30 min showed later arrival times but a larger amplitude than the reflected wave simulated at 0 min 3 2 response surfaces before inverting the synthetic gpr data using coupled inversion parameter correlations were analyzed using response surface analysis given the available computing power it was not possible to calculate the response surface for all parameter pairs for a 2 layer profile in the case of gpr travel time and waveform data since until now no studies have reported the correlation between the thickness of the first layer and hydraulic parameters based on borehole gpr measurements response surfaces considered in this study were specifically analyzed to reveal the correlations between the thickness of the first layer and different hydraulic parameters for a 2 layer soil profile from gpr waveforms gpr travel times and true swc data fig 5 because of the computational cost relatively narrow parameter bounds were used for calculating the response surfaces additionally the true parameter values were known and therefore a large search space was not required in general response surfaces obtained from different types of data showed similar parameter correlations in the response surfaces for h t n 1 and h t n 2 a steep gradient of the cost function was observed near the global minimum which indicates that h t n 1 and n 2 are well constrained by all inversion approaches however in the response surfaces for h t log k s 1 h t log k s 2 h t α 1 and h t α 2 the misfit distribution was perpendicular to the h t axis suggesting that log k s 1 log k s 2 α 1 and α 2 are relatively poorly constrained in the inversion the global minima in the response surfaces for h t θ s 1 and h t θ s 2 were positioned in an elongated valley with a negative slope that suggests that θ s 1 and θ s 2 are negatively correlated with h t the misfit distributions in the response surfaces for point swc measurements showed a strong change at h t 0 2 m and h t 0 4 m fig 5 which were depths where swc data were simulated to explain this synthetic swc data fig 6 a were simulated by using h t 0 18 m and h t 0 22 m while keeping the other parameters at the optimal values see blue crosses in fig 5a large swc differences were observed at 0 2 m depth after the soil got fully saturated because the saturated swc at this depth was different for the models with h t 0 18 m and h t 0 22 m θ s 1 0 229 and θ s 2 0 326 cm3 cm 3 similarly models with the layer boundary below 0 4 m depth will also have different saturated swc the response surfaces for gpr travel times and waveforms did not show a sudden change at h t 0 2 m and h t 0 4 m although the simulations with h t 0 18 m and h 0 22 m showed differences in gpr travel time fig 6b and gpr waveforms fig 6c the cost function values for gpr travel times 0 36 and 0 23 ns and gpr waveforms 0 98 and 0 84 v m 1 showed much less pronounced differences as the values for swc 0 05 and 0 014 cm3 cm 3 this can be explained by the fact that 200 mhz gpr measurements have a larger sampling volume than point measurements klotzsche et al 2019b because of the spatial averaging gpr travel times and waveforms will be less sensitive to abrupt changes in the vertical swc profile besides potential parameter correlations it is also interesting to analyze normalized cost function values for different types of data to obtain qualitative insights in parameter uncertainty the response surfaces show that many model parameters can be inverted with low uncertainty for the gpr waveform data at least in theory as indicated by the small area with a normalized error smaller than 1 to further illustrate this two sets of model parameters black crosses in fig 5a were selected in the response surfaces for h t θ s 1 while the other parameters were set to the optimal parameters the temporal dynamics in swc travel times and waveforms were simulated for both sets of model parameters fig 7 time series of swc and travel time fig 7a and 7b only showed very minor differences for these two sets of simulations for the simulated gpr waveforms fig 7c the two sets of model parameters also provide almost identical gpr waveforms at the beginning of the experiment 30 min because the infiltration front was still located at a shallow depth in the first layer fig 3a when the infiltration front approached the layer boundary 210 min obvious differences appeared between the waveforms from the true model and the two selected parameter sets especially at the 0 2 m depth to explain this in detail wavefield snapshots were simulated with the true model and the selected parameter sets fig 8 due the considerable swc permittivity differences between the first and second layer a strong reflected wave was generated on the layer boundary theoretically a potential refracted wave was also generated on the air soil boundary nevertheless the energy of the refracted wave was very weak and therefore its influence on first arrival time and waveform could be neglected the reflected wave was superimposed with the direct wave but this did not affect the first arrival time fig 8a 8b and 8c hence the gpr travel times for the selected parameter sets only showed minor differences however the path length and reflection coefficient of the reflected wave are related to h t and thus the travel time and amplitude of this reflected wave were different this resulted in substantial differences for the simulated gpr waveforms fig 8d and 8e and explained the difference in gpr waveforms for these models at the end of the infiltration 420 min this analysis highlights that the inversion of swc and gpr travel times only contains information about the swc at or near the borehole depth on the other hand cfwi contains additional information on the swc at other depths as well as the layer depth due to the reflected wave generated from the layer boundary therefore cfwi is expected to outperform the inversion of swc and travel times for estimating hydraulic parameters and h t 3 3 coupled inversion results hydraulic parameters were estimated by using inversion of swc data coupled inversion of noisy travel times and cfwi respectively table 2 in this study we used the parameter bounds reported by yu et al 2021 to estimate the hydraulic parameters for the selhausen test site relatively narrow bounds were used for θ s to ensure that θ s 1 is always greater than θ s 2 for all the models evaluated during the inversion to avoid overfitting inversions were stopped when the noise levels for swc data 0 01 cm3cm 3 travel time 0 1 ns and waveform data 0 03 v m 1 were reached in general the noisy swcs fig 9 a travel times fig 9b and waveforms fig 9c were fitted well by the estimated parameters however the estimated hydraulic parameters from swc data showed much larger uncertainty compared to the results from coupled inversion of travel times and cfwi especially for log k s 1 and log k s 2 this can be explained by the fact that only very limited information point swc data at 3 depths was used in the inversion furthermore it was found that the waveforms simulated with the results of the coupled inversion of travel times resulted in a slight mismatch for several measurements e g the measurement conducted at 0 2 m depth at 210 min fig 9c this is attributed to the fact that the coupled inversion of travel times did not use all the information contained in the waveforms in the case of the coupled inversion of travel times the inversely estimated parameters showed larger uncertainty than for cfwi especially for θ s 1 α 1 θ s 2 α 2 and h t the estimated values of n 1 log k s 1 n 2 and log k s 2 for cfwi still showed a slight deviation from the known reference values this is likely caused by the correlations between n 1 log k s 1 and n 2 log k s 2 table 3 other parameter combinations did not show strong correlations fig 10 presents 50 realizations of the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions based on the estimated parameters from inversion of swc data coupled inversion of travel times and cfwi and the associated uncertainty in table 2 as expected the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions estimated from the swc data covered the true functions but showed considerable uncertainty since the cfwi accurately obtained the hydraulic parameters with considerably smaller uncertainty a very good match was found between the estimated and true water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions however for the coupled inversion of travel times the estimated water retention functions fig 10 a and 10c showed relatively larger uncertainty and did not accurately predict the true function at low pressure heads because the n 1 and n 2 of the true model were not within the uncertainty bounds of the estimated n 1 and n 2 in addition since the uncertainty interval of estimated k s 2 did contain the true k s 2 value a slight mismatch fig 10d of the estimated and true relative hydraulic conductivity functions can be found when the second layer is close to saturation 4 discussion although cfwi showed advantages over the coupled inversion of gpr travel times in the presented synthetic study it is currently still challenging to use cfwi for processing experimental gpr data for several reasons first cfwi considers late arrival reflected waves from the layer boundary and therefore in principle it is expected to outperform the coupled inversion of travel times for estimating the thickness of the first layer however it is still challenging to correctly simulate the complex behavior of reflected waves even with state of the art gpr modelling software this synthetic study is based on a well characterized test site klotzsche et al 2019b yu et al 2021 which was refilled after the installation of the tubes and thus likely has a relatively homogeneous soil with horizontal layer boundaries in more natural conditions the soil is commonly heterogeneous and the energy reflected from a layer boundary can be weaker in addition the reflected wave generated from the layer boundary can potentially experience interference from other reflections from lateral variations in geology or infiltration patterns these issues do not influence the coupled travel time inversion but may have a significant effect on the results of cfwi to conduct cfwi with experimental gpr data more advanced gpr modelling methods e g using an actual antenna model as the exciting source may therefore need to be developed and more accurate and complicated conceptual setups for hydrological and geological model should be established for example using a 2d or 3d model to describe the soil heterogeneities like the fwi approach proposed by klotzsche et al 2016 the use of cfwi also requires an accurate estimation of the source wavelet from the experimental gpr data as the gpr waveform does not only depend on the medium properties dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity but also on the source wavelet emitted by the system and the coupling of the antenna and the medium busch et al 2012 klotzsche et al 2018 ineffective source wavelet estimation from experimental gpr data will likely result in erroneous simulation of gpr waveform data and in consequence will lead to erroneous estimates of the hydraulic parameters using cfwi in previous studies the effective source wavelet was estimated using a deconvolution approach which relies on the experimental data and forward modelling based on starting model values if there are insufficient measurements with varying offsets or angles it is very difficult to define such starting models and hence to obtain effective source wavelets therefore the effective source wavelet is very difficult to estimate from zop data for the gpr data in this study the phase of the effective source wavelet can be estimated using a starting model where the permittivity is obtained from a ray based inversion with sufficient accuracy however the amplitude of the wavelet is directly coupled to the medium properties and is very sensitive to small changes in the electrical conductivity to estimate an effective source wavelet for cfwi a feasible approach would be to perform mog measurements between the tubes at the same depth before measuring the zop data or to apply the workflow proposed by busch et al 2012 to estimate the effective source wavelet from the zop mog data another challenge for cfwi is the need for accurate estimation of the electrical conductivity distribution within the soil profile in this study the electrical conductivity profiles for gpr modelling were obtained from the corresponding swc profiles by using archie s law however the uncertainty in archie s law for estimating soil conductivity from swc is much greater than that in the petrophysical models relating permittivity and swc e g crim because the soil electrical conductivity is also sensitive to other factors e g clay content and pore water salinity binley et al 2015 furthermore archie s law does not consider surface electrical conductivity associated with the electrical double layer surrounding soil particles advanced petrophysical models should be employed in future studies to consider the influence of the surface conductivity e g revil et al 2007 mboh et al 2012 in addition the electrical conductivity distribution may not only be related to the swc distribution because of independent variations in the pore water electrical conductivity associated with fertilizer application or biogeochemical reactions in the subsurface this potential mismatch between the distribution of electrical conductivity and swc cannot be neglected in the interpretation of actual infiltration experiments to accurately describe the electrical conductivity distribution it may thus be necessary to consider solute transport and geochemical reactions in addition to water flow to predict the distribution of the bulk electrical conductivity in unsaturated soil e g loague and green 1991 unfortunately this will introduce additional unknowns and will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of cfwi finally soils of high salinity or clay content may lead to a strong attenuation of the waveform amplitude as a result the noise level of the actual field data measured in these types of soil could be relatively high compared to the coupled inversion of the travel times cfwi may thus be less robust to estimate the hydraulic parameters for these types of soils finally it is important to emphasize that cfwi already requires substantial computational resources for the set up used in this study cfwi took almost 10 days of computations with a computer cluster 48 processers of amd opteron 6300 or a week with the jureca supercomputer 24 processors jülich supercomputing centre 2018 although the fdtd algorithm in gprmax3d was able to calculate in parallel note that further studies should check how this performance can be improved using further parallelization and hpc clusters for example the simultaneous parallelization of the sce ua and fdtd algorithm furthermore the grid size was set to 0 02 m in this study which may not be sufficient for accurate gpr simulations in actual 2d or 3d applications of cfwi due to the systematic errors of fdtd algorithm caused by the finite difference discretization and numerical dispersion if modelling errors need to be further reduced the discretization of the simulation needs to be refined which will further increase computational costs therefore it is important to improve the efficiency of current gpr modelling methods 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a synthetic study to explore the feasibility of using cfwi to estimate hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer soil profile first a workflow for cfwi was introduced compared with the coupled inversion of travel times cfwi directly uses the entire gpr waveform and can therefore avoid propagation of uncertainties from the picking of first arrivals into the inversion in a next step we proposed an infiltration experiment to obtain synthetic vertical swc profiles based on the real infiltration experiment reported by yu et al 2021 this experiment included a 6 hour infiltration event with gpr measurements at three depths 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depth based on this experimental design response surfaces for the thickness of the first layer and different hydraulic parameters were calculated for point swc measurements gpr travel times and gpr waveforms to investigate potential parameter correlations it was found that layer depth h t was negatively correlated with θ s 1 and θ s 2 in addition the response surfaces indicated that cfwi provided more accurate estimates of layer depth compared with coupled inversion of gpr travel times and inversion of point swc measurements this is attributed to the fact that cfwi contains additional information introduced by the reflected wave from the layer boundary finally inversion of swc data from point measurements coupled inversion of gpr travel times and cfwi were applied to the synthetic infiltration experiment the simulated swcs travel times and waveforms matched well with the noisy data but the estimates of the hydraulic parameters from swc data showed considerably larger uncertainty also the coupled inversion of travel times showed a slight deviation from the true values and a relatively larger uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity and retention functions in contrast hydraulic parameters estimated from cfwi had considerably smaller uncertainty and thus better matched the known water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves however a range of challenges remain for the application of cfwi to real field experiments first cfwi requires an accurate conceptual setup for the hydro geo logical model furthermore a robust approach for effective source wavelet estimation for experimental zop data has to be developed moreover the use of a more sophisticated hydrological model that couples the simulations of water flow and solute transport has to be considered for cfwi to cope with changes in electrical conductivity associated with fertilization and geochemical processes in addition the efficiency and accuracy of the current gpr modelling may need to be improved in conclusion cfwi has several advantages over the coupled inversion of gpr travel times and it is expected to be a promising inversion approach for estimating hydraulic parameters after several remaining challenges have been addressed credit authorship contribution statement yi yu

3289,coupled inversion is a promising technique for determining soil hydraulic properties from time lapse geophysical measurements in this inversion approach a hydrological model is coupled with ground penetrating radar gpr forward modelling to avoid interpretation errors from data processing in this study a workflow for coupled gpr full waveform inversion cfwi is proposed that combines the benefits of coupled inversion and full waveform inversion fwi to estimate soil hydraulic properties from time lapse horizontal borehole gpr measurements in particular a synthetic modelling study is presented that compares the performance of coupled inversion of full waveforms and first arrival time data from zero offset profile zop borehole measurements obtained during an infiltration event for estimating hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer soil profile it was found that the thickness of the first layer could be more accurately estimated by cfwi because of the additional information contained in reflected and refracted waves from the air soil layer boundary furthermore the hydraulic parameters estimated by the coupled inversion of gpr travel times slightly deviated from true values and showed a relatively large uncertainty whereas the results of cfwi precisely matched the known water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions despite these promising results several challenges should be solved before cfwi can be applied to experimental gpr data first conducting cfwi needs accurate conceptual setups for the hydro geo logical model furthermore a robust approach should be developed to accurately estimate an effective source wavelet from the experimental zop data and a more sophisticated hydrological modelling approach has to be considered to better estimate the distribution of soil electrical conductivity during the infiltration event finally the accuracy and efficiency of current gpr modelling methods may need to be improved keywords coupled inversion full waveform inversion soil hydraulic properties 1 introduction accurate estimation of soil hydraulic parameters is crucial for the reliable prediction of water

of the vertical resolution than off ground and surface gpr huisman et al 2003 and thus shows advantages for estimating soil hydraulic parameters especially at specialized test sites with appropriate boreholes e g binley et al 2001 looms et al 2008 kowalsky et al 2005 borehole gpr data are conventionally processed using ray based inversion approaches e g irving et al 2007 which only provide velocity and attenuation information obtained from the first arrival times and first cycle amplitudes of the gpr data respectively such ray based approaches generally have a limited resolution for subsurface characterization because only a small amount of the data is considered therefore ray based inversions have difficulty to provide information resolving small scale high contrast layers such as high porosity zones that could be related to preferential flow zones in aquifer systems or impermeable clay lenses klotzsche et al 2019a in contrast full waveform inversion fwi of gpr data considers the entire measured signal including reflections and refractions and is therefore able to provide more accurate and spatially higher resolved permittivity and electrical conductivity information than ray based methods the fwi method was first proposed by tarantola 1984 for seismic data fwi of seismic data has been further developed since then and is currently widely used e g berkhout 2012 brossier et al 2009 vigh and starr 2008 a comprehensive overview of fwi developments and applications is provided by virieux and operto 2009 because of the similarity between seismic and

obtain high resolution information on the spatial distribution of both dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity the application of fwi for off ground and surface gpr has mainly focused on estimating the properties of simplified models with a limited number of unknowns such as layered media busch et al 2012 ihamouten et al 2018 or cylindrical objects liu et al 2018 in the subsurface in contrast fwi of vertical borehole gpr multi offset gathers mog measurements can obtain high resolution 2d subsurface images by using a gradient based inversion algorithm e g gueting et al 2017 klotzsche et al 2010 klotzsche et al 2014 looms et al 2017 borehole gpr can also be conducted in horizontally installed boreholes using zero offset profiling zop measurements to estimate the distribution of dielectric permittivity at specific depths e g galagedara et al 2002 yu et al 2020 we will refer to this as horizontal borehole gpr measurements in the following one of the first long term case studies applying horizontal borehole gpr was reported by klotzsche et al 2019b for monitoring horizonal swc variations at different depths and treatments at the selhausen test site using the two rhizotron facilities cai et al 2016 however the 2d gradient based fwi algorithm cannot be applied with the current forward model using several horizontal zop measurements along the horizontal tubes to provide a tomographic image with the correct lateral variability the main reason for this problem is that the air soil interface which causes critical refracted airwaves in the data that interfere with the direct wave cannot be accounted for additionally using zop data do not provide the necessary dense ray coverage with a high amount of different ray path angles to derive accurate permittivity and electrical conductivity results until now only a preliminary study was performed by klotzsche et al 2016 to invert dielectric permittivity and electric conductivity for a vertical 2 layer soil profile using the full waveforms of zop data measured at different depths this approach worked well with synthetic gpr data where the effective source wavelet is known and kept fixed during the inversion however it is still challenging to apply fwi to experimental horizontal borehole gpr data because it is difficult to estimate an effective source wavelet from a single zop trace to estimate soil hydraulic properties from time lapse geophysical data many recent studies have relied on a coupled inversion approach e g hinnell et al 2010 huisman et al 2010 lambot et al 2006 mboh et al 2012 compared to a traditional sequential inversion approach where the hydrological model is inverted with swc information estimated from geophysical data coupled inversion is recognized as a more reliable and advanced approach that directly assimilates the geophysical data and therefore avoids interpretation errors from data processing coupled inversion was applied successfully to gpr travel times to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters at the field scale looms et al 2008 scholer et al 2013 yu et al 2021 since gpr waveforms are expected to contain more information about the subsurface than gpr travel times it is anticipated that the combined use of coupled inversion and fwi i e coupled full waveform inversion cfwi is potentially able to provide soil hydraulic parameter estimates with less uncertainty up to now there are only a few studies that have reported the use of cfwi to estimate hydraulic parameters from time lapse off ground gpr measurements lambot et al 2009 or synthetic seismic data li et al 2020 however no studies have been reported that applied cfwi to borehole gpr data for parameterizing hydrological models based on the fwi technique reported by klotzsche et al 2016 and the workflow of coupled inversion of gpr travel times developed by yu et al 2021 this study investigates potential benefits and shortcomings of coupled full waveform inversion cfwi for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer profile using synthetic horizontal borehole gpr data first a workflow for cfwi will be proposed next a synthetic infiltration experiment will be designed to simulate swc and gpr data and parameter correlations between hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer will be analyzed for cfwi finally cfwi will be applied to the synthetic data and the inversion results will be compared with the results from the inversion of swc data from point measurements and the more established coupled inversion of gpr travel times 2 materials and methods 2 1 horizontal borehole gpr measurements zop measurements can be used to monitor swc dynamics at the depths where horizontal boreholes are installed e g klotzsche et al 2019b to perform a zop survey the transmitter and receiver antennas are moved simultaneously with the same spacing in two different boreholes using a straight wave approximation the first arrival times from the zop survey can be used to determine a 1d dielectric permittivity profile using 1 ε obs c t obs t 0 d 2 where ε obs is the observed dielectric permittivity d m is the distance between two boreholes t obs ns is the first arrival time c is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum 0 3 m ns 1 and t 0 ns is the time zero offset this offset is commonly determined by conducting multi offset measurements with the borehole antennas in air with respect to the details for obtaining t 0 from experimental zop data we refer to klotzsche et al 2019b in the case of synthetic gpr data t 0 is known after obtaining the soil dielectric permittivity swc θ obs can be calculated using the complex refractive index model crim roth et al 1990 2 θ obs ε obs 1 φ ε s φ ε w 1 where ε s is the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil matrix φ is the soil porosity and ε w is the relative permittivity of water 84 at 10 c in this study ε s is assumed to be 4 7 for soils with high quartz content robinson et al 2005 2 2 vertical water flow vertical 1d water flow in porous media can be described by the richards equation 3 θ h t z k r h h z 1 where θ

constitutive relations the soil hydraulic properties can be described with six parameters θ r θ s α n k s l 2 3 hydrological and gpr forward modelling a synthetic case study was used to investigate advantages and shortcomings of cfwi for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer h t for a vertical 2 layer profile based on horizontal borehole gpr measurements the synthetic case study is based on the realistic infiltration experiment reported by yu et al 2021 a 2 layer soil profile 1 5 m deep was employed to generate synthetic swc profiles based on the hydraulic parameterization described by cai et al 2018 to represent the selhausen test site table 1 in this model we changed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil from 0 0004 cm min 1 reported by cai et al 2018 to 0 04 cm min 1 because it should be greater than the infiltration rate to avoid ponding of water at the layer interface the synthetic study consists of a single 6 hour infiltration event 360 min followed by a 90 min period with soil water redistribution without infiltration the infiltration rate was 0 03 cm min 1 horizontal borehole gpr data were simulated at 3 different depths 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m every 30 min fig 1 a hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 was used to simulate the vertical swc dynamics in this synthetic infiltration experiment the total simulation domain was 1 5 m deep and discretized with 151 nodes with an equal spacing of 1 cm since it is commonly not easy to obtain accurate pressure head information during a real infiltration experiment we used a vertical swc profile as the initial condition because swc data can be obtained from borehole gpr data acquired prior to the first infiltration event in this study the initial condition was defined as a linearly interpolated swc profile with a swc of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 at the surface and a swc of 0 08 cm3 cm 3 at 1 5 m depth for both forward simulations and inversions it is assumed that the infiltration events were conducted on bare soil and therefore root water uptake was neglected also evaporation was not considered in the hydrological modelling because typical evaporation rates are much lower than the used infiltration rate an atmospheric boundary condition with surface run off was used as the upper boundary condition and a seepage face h 0 was used as the lower boundary condition gprmax3d giannopoulos 2005 warren et al 2016 was used to simulate 3d gpr wave propagation using a finite difference time domain fdtd numerical method in this study the size of the simulation domain for gprmax3d was set to 2 1 1 1 5 m fig 1b which was discretized with a cell size of 0 02 m perfectly matched layers pml were used as the absorbing boundary conditions with 10 cells at each side horizontal borehole gpr data were simulated at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depths according to the borehole setup for the selhausen test site the distance between transmitter and receiver antennas was set as 0 75 m the magnetic permeability μ 0 is 4 π 10 7n a 2 to save simulation time the thickness of the soil layer was set to 0 8 m instead of the 1 5 m that was used for hydrological modelling since swc changes below 0 8 m depth were expected to have minor influence on the gpr data simulated at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depth this size of the domain also ensured that the pml boundaries were sufficiently far away from the gpr simulation domain we defined a current source in the y direction to excite the electromagnetic waves the center frequency of the current source was 200 mhz and the excitation function was the first derivative of a gaussian wavelet after obtaining the synthetic gpr data from gprmax3d the first arrival time of each gpr trace can be automatically picked using the approach reported by yu et al 2021 for a more realistic synthetic modelling study gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 1 ns δ t was added to the noise free gpr travel time the noise level of 0 1 ns is based on the sampling interval of 0 2 ns typically used in horizontal borehole gpr applications which limits the accuracy of travel time determination the noise added to the gpr waveform data was based on noise evaluation using previously experimental gpr waveforms reported by yu et al 2020 which showed that noise varied from 0 1 to 0 5 of the maximum amplitude therefore gaussian noise with zero mean and a standard deviation of 0 5 of the maximum amplitude δ e was added to the simulated gpr waveforms in this synthetic study 2 4 set up of the coupled full waveform inversion we consider two inversion strategies in this study coupled inversion of gpr travel times fig 2 a and coupled full waveform inversion fig 2b in both approaches vertical swc profiles θ mod were obtained from hydrus 1d simulation with hydraulic parameters next the dielectric permittivity profiles ε mod used as input for the gprmax3d simulations were obtained from θ mod by rearranging eq 2 7 ε mod ε w 1 θ mod 1 φ ε s φ 2 the main difference between cfwi and coupled inversion of travel times is that cfwi directly minimizes the misfit between measured e obs v m 1 and simulated waveforms e mod v m 1 in the time domain instead of the misfit between first arrival times in this study the soil is assumed to be low loss therefore the first arrival time is not sensitive to the soil electrical conductivity which was thus not considered for the coupled inversion of travel times in contrast the soil electrical conductivity should be considered for gpr modelling in cfwi since the soil electrical conductivity influences the attenuation and thus the amplitude of the gpr waveform the distribution of the electrical conductivity can be reasonably obtained from the distribution of swc and a petrophysical relationship e g by archie s law archie 1942 8 σ mod 1 k a σ w φ m a θ mod φ n a where σ mod s m 1 is the bulk soil electrical conductivity used for gpr modelling σ w is the electrical conductivity of the water assumed to be 0 0519 s m 1 here k a is a tortuosity constant n a is the saturation exponent and m a is the cementation exponent in this study k a n a and m a are assumed to 1 2 and 2 respectively as suggested by ewing and hunt 2006 the cost function c mvg t ns for the coupled inversion of gpr travel times is the rmse of modelled t mod and observed t obs gpr first arrival times 9 c mvg t i 1 n t t i mod t i obs 2 n t where n t is the number of gpr measurements similarly the cost function c mvg e v m 1 for cfwi uses the rmse between the modelled and measured electrical fields 10 c mvg e i 1 n e e i mod e i obs 2 n e where n e is the number of the electric field points in the modelled gpr data in this study the cost function for cfwi and coupled inversion of gpr travel times were minimized using sce ua duan et al 1993 which is a general purpose global optimization algorithm the inversion was assumed to be converged if the cost function value decreased to a specified value or the improvement of the best model was below 0 01 in the last 10 evolution loops before conducting the inversions the response surface method vrugt and dane 2006 was employed to show the parameter uncertainty and correlation for cfwi and the coupled inversion of travel times by using a 2d grid search of the cost function distribution as a reference the response surface was also generated based on noisy swc data that could be obtained by point measurements such as time domain reflectometry tdr the noise level for swc was assumed to be 0 01 cm3 cm 3 topp and ferré 2005 the response surfaces for point measurements were generated based on the following cost function 11 c mvg θ i 1 n θ θ i mod θ i obs 2 n θ where θ i mod and θ i obs are modelled and measured swc respectively and n θ is the number of the point measurements the residual swc θ r can only be reliably estimated with swc information obtained under very dry conditions e g groenevelt and grant 2004 van dam et al 1994 weynants et al 2009 since the initial swc profile used in this study did not consider dry conditions the inversion is not expected to be sensitive to θ r therefore we only inverted the hydraulic parameters θ s α n k s and the thickness of the first layer h t for a 2 layer soil profile k s was inverted using a log transformation log k s after obtaining the final inversion results from cfwi and coupled inversion of gpr travel times the uncertainty and the correlation coefficients between the estimated parameters were evaluated using a first order uncertainty approximation kool and parker 1988 here it was assumed that correlation coefficients that exceed 0 6 indicate an undesirably strong correlation 3 results 3 1 synthetic data the vertical swc profiles at times when synthetic gpr measurements were simulated are shown in fig 3 a it can be seen that the infiltration front reached the layer boundary at a depth of 0 3 m after 180 min at the end of the infiltration event 360 min the upper 0 6 m of soil was saturated and the infiltration front moved to 0 8 m depth after the infiltration stopped the infiltration front still moved down to a depth of 0 9 m and the swc above 0 6 m depth slightly decreased due to redistribution the synthetic time lapse swc data at 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depths are shown in fig 3b it was found that the soil at 0 2 and 0 4 m depth reached saturation after 200 and 300 min respectively after obtaining the synthetic swc profiles the dielectric permittivity profiles and the electrical conductivity profiles were obtained to generate synthetic gpr data with gprmax3d fig 3c which were then used to determine the gpr first arrival time data red crosses in fig 3c a comparison of fig 3a and fig 3b shows that the synthetic time lapse swc data and gpr travel time data have synchronous dynamics during the entire experiment the gpr waveforms simulated at different times and depths showed large differences fig 3c which was not always the case for the swc measurements and the first arrival times for example the arrival time of the direct wave simulated at a 0 6 m depth did not show a clear difference between 0 and 30 min but the simulated gpr waveforms are obviously different at these two measurement times moreover the arrival times and waveforms of the reflected waves generated on the air soil boundary are different at these measurement times see the waveforms enclosed by the red rectangle in fig 3c to explain this in detail wavefield snapshots for the gpr measurements at 0 6 m depth were obtained at 0 and 30 min infiltration time fig 4 in the early stage 8 ns only the direct waves can be observed fig 4a and 4b as the infiltration front did not reach the 0 6 m depth the waveforms of the direct wave that were measured by the receiver between 8 and 14 ns fig 3c did not show differences at these two measurement times the reflected waves were generated on the soil surface at around 12 ns fig 4c and 4d since infiltration increased the swc of the top 0 1 m of the soil at 30 min see fig 3a the permittivity of the top soil and the reflection coefficient of the soil surface were changed as a result the travel time and amplitude of the reflected waves measured by the receiver between 15 and 20 ns see the red rectangle in fig 3c showed substantial differences see fig 4e 4 h at these measurement times in particular the reflected wave simulated at 30 min showed later arrival times but a larger amplitude than the reflected wave simulated at 0 min 3 2 response surfaces before inverting the synthetic gpr data using coupled inversion parameter correlations were analyzed using response surface analysis given the available computing power it was not possible to calculate the response surface for all parameter pairs for a 2 layer profile in the case of gpr travel time and waveform data since until now no studies have reported the correlation between the thickness of the first layer and hydraulic parameters based on borehole gpr measurements response surfaces considered in this study were specifically analyzed to reveal the correlations between the thickness of the first layer and different hydraulic parameters for a 2 layer soil profile from gpr waveforms gpr travel times and true swc data fig 5 because of the computational cost relatively narrow parameter bounds were used for calculating the response surfaces additionally the true parameter values were known and therefore a large search space was not required in general response surfaces obtained from different types of data showed similar parameter correlations in the response surfaces for h t n 1 and h t n 2 a steep gradient of the cost function was observed near the global minimum which indicates that h t n 1 and n 2 are well constrained by all inversion approaches however in the response surfaces for h t log k s 1 h t log k s 2 h t α 1 and h t α 2 the misfit distribution was perpendicular to the h t axis suggesting that log k s 1 log k s 2 α 1 and α 2 are relatively poorly constrained in the inversion the global minima in the response surfaces for h t θ s 1 and h t θ s 2 were positioned in an elongated valley with a negative slope that suggests that θ s 1 and θ s 2 are negatively correlated with h t the misfit distributions in the response surfaces for point swc measurements showed a strong change at h t 0 2 m and h t 0 4 m fig 5 which were depths where swc data were simulated to explain this synthetic swc data fig 6 a were simulated by using h t 0 18 m and h t 0 22 m while keeping the other parameters at the optimal values see blue crosses in fig 5a large swc differences were observed at 0 2 m depth after the soil got fully saturated because the saturated swc at this depth was different for the models with h t 0 18 m and h t 0 22 m θ s 1 0 229 and θ s 2 0 326 cm3 cm 3 similarly models with the layer boundary below 0 4 m depth will also have different saturated swc the response surfaces for gpr travel times and waveforms did not show a sudden change at h t 0 2 m and h t 0 4 m although the simulations with h t 0 18 m and h 0 22 m showed differences in gpr travel time fig 6b and gpr waveforms fig 6c the cost function values for gpr travel times 0 36 and 0 23 ns and gpr waveforms 0 98 and 0 84 v m 1 showed much less pronounced differences as the values for swc 0 05 and 0 014 cm3 cm 3 this can be explained by the fact that 200 mhz gpr measurements have a larger sampling volume than point measurements klotzsche et al 2019b because of the spatial averaging gpr travel times and waveforms will be less sensitive to abrupt changes in the vertical swc profile besides potential parameter correlations it is also interesting to analyze normalized cost function values for different types of data to obtain qualitative insights in parameter uncertainty the response surfaces show that many model parameters can be inverted with low uncertainty for the gpr waveform data at least in theory as indicated by the small area with a normalized error smaller than 1 to further illustrate this two sets of model parameters black crosses in fig 5a were selected in the response surfaces for h t θ s 1 while the other parameters were set to the optimal parameters the temporal dynamics in swc travel times and waveforms were simulated for both sets of model parameters fig 7 time series of swc and travel time fig 7a and 7b only showed very minor differences for these two sets of simulations for the simulated gpr waveforms fig 7c the two sets of model parameters also provide almost identical gpr waveforms at the beginning of the experiment 30 min because the infiltration front was still located at a shallow depth in the first layer fig 3a when the infiltration front approached the layer boundary 210 min obvious differences appeared between the waveforms from the true model and the two selected parameter sets especially at the 0 2 m depth to explain this in detail wavefield snapshots were simulated with the true model and the selected parameter sets fig 8 due the considerable swc permittivity differences between the first and second layer a strong reflected wave was generated on the layer boundary theoretically a potential refracted wave was also generated on the air soil boundary nevertheless the energy of the refracted wave was very weak and therefore its influence on first arrival time and waveform could be neglected the reflected wave was superimposed with the direct wave but this did not affect the first arrival time fig 8a 8b and 8c hence the gpr travel times for the selected parameter sets only showed minor differences however the path length and reflection coefficient of the reflected wave are related to h t and thus the travel time and amplitude of this reflected wave were different this resulted in substantial differences for the simulated gpr waveforms fig 8d and 8e and explained the difference in gpr waveforms for these models at the end of the infiltration 420 min this analysis highlights that the inversion of swc and gpr travel times only contains information about the swc at or near the borehole depth on the other hand cfwi contains additional information on the swc at other depths as well as the layer depth due to the reflected wave generated from the layer boundary therefore cfwi is expected to outperform the inversion of swc and travel times for estimating hydraulic parameters and h t 3 3 coupled inversion results hydraulic parameters were estimated by using inversion of swc data coupled inversion of noisy travel times and cfwi respectively table 2 in this study we used the parameter bounds reported by yu et al 2021 to estimate the hydraulic parameters for the selhausen test site relatively narrow bounds were used for θ s to ensure that θ s 1 is always greater than θ s 2 for all the models evaluated during the inversion to avoid overfitting inversions were stopped when the noise levels for swc data 0 01 cm3cm 3 travel time 0 1 ns and waveform data 0 03 v m 1 were reached in general the noisy swcs fig 9 a travel times fig 9b and waveforms fig 9c were fitted well by the estimated parameters however the estimated hydraulic parameters from swc data showed much larger uncertainty compared to the results from coupled inversion of travel times and cfwi especially for log k s 1 and log k s 2 this can be explained by the fact that only very limited information point swc data at 3 depths was used in the inversion furthermore it was found that the waveforms simulated with the results of the coupled inversion of travel times resulted in a slight mismatch for several measurements e g the measurement conducted at 0 2 m depth at 210 min fig 9c this is attributed to the fact that the coupled inversion of travel times did not use all the information contained in the waveforms in the case of the coupled inversion of travel times the inversely estimated parameters showed larger uncertainty than for cfwi especially for θ s 1 α 1 θ s 2 α 2 and h t the estimated values of n 1 log k s 1 n 2 and log k s 2 for cfwi still showed a slight deviation from the known reference values this is likely caused by the correlations between n 1 log k s 1 and n 2 log k s 2 table 3 other parameter combinations did not show strong correlations fig 10 presents 50 realizations of the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions based on the estimated parameters from inversion of swc data coupled inversion of travel times and cfwi and the associated uncertainty in table 2 as expected the water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions estimated from the swc data covered the true functions but showed considerable uncertainty since the cfwi accurately obtained the hydraulic parameters with considerably smaller uncertainty a very good match was found between the estimated and true water retention and relative hydraulic conductivity functions however for the coupled inversion of travel times the estimated water retention functions fig 10 a and 10c showed relatively larger uncertainty and did not accurately predict the true function at low pressure heads because the n 1 and n 2 of the true model were not within the uncertainty bounds of the estimated n 1 and n 2 in addition since the uncertainty interval of estimated k s 2 did contain the true k s 2 value a slight mismatch fig 10d of the estimated and true relative hydraulic conductivity functions can be found when the second layer is close to saturation 4 discussion although cfwi showed advantages over the coupled inversion of gpr travel times in the presented synthetic study it is currently still challenging to use cfwi for processing experimental gpr data for several reasons first cfwi considers late arrival reflected waves from the layer boundary and therefore in principle it is expected to outperform the coupled inversion of travel times for estimating the thickness of the first layer however it is still challenging to correctly simulate the complex behavior of reflected waves even with state of the art gpr modelling software this synthetic study is based on a well characterized test site klotzsche et al 2019b yu et al 2021 which was refilled after the installation of the tubes and thus likely has a relatively homogeneous soil with horizontal layer boundaries in more natural conditions the soil is commonly heterogeneous and the energy reflected from a layer boundary can be weaker in addition the reflected wave generated from the layer boundary can potentially experience interference from other reflections from lateral variations in geology or infiltration patterns these issues do not influence the coupled travel time inversion but may have a significant effect on the results of cfwi to conduct cfwi with experimental gpr data more advanced gpr modelling methods e g using an actual antenna model as the exciting source may therefore need to be developed and more accurate and complicated conceptual setups for hydrological and geological model should be established for example using a 2d or 3d model to describe the soil heterogeneities like the fwi approach proposed by klotzsche et al 2016 the use of cfwi also requires an accurate estimation of the source wavelet from the experimental gpr data as the gpr waveform does not only depend on the medium properties dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity but also on the source wavelet emitted by the system and the coupling of the antenna and the medium busch et al 2012 klotzsche et al 2018 ineffective source wavelet estimation from experimental gpr data will likely result in erroneous simulation of gpr waveform data and in consequence will lead to erroneous estimates of the hydraulic parameters using cfwi in previous studies the effective source wavelet was estimated using a deconvolution approach which relies on the experimental data and forward modelling based on starting model values if there are insufficient measurements with varying offsets or angles it is very difficult to define such starting models and hence to obtain effective source wavelets therefore the effective source wavelet is very difficult to estimate from zop data for the gpr data in this study the phase of the effective source wavelet can be estimated using a starting model where the permittivity is obtained from a ray based inversion with sufficient accuracy however the amplitude of the wavelet is directly coupled to the medium properties and is very sensitive to small changes in the electrical conductivity to estimate an effective source wavelet for cfwi a feasible approach would be to perform mog measurements between the tubes at the same depth before measuring the zop data or to apply the workflow proposed by busch et al 2012 to estimate the effective source wavelet from the zop mog data another challenge for cfwi is the need for accurate estimation of the electrical conductivity distribution within the soil profile in this study the electrical conductivity profiles for gpr modelling were obtained from the corresponding swc profiles by using archie s law however the uncertainty in archie s law for estimating soil conductivity from swc is much greater than that in the petrophysical models relating permittivity and swc e g crim because the soil electrical conductivity is also sensitive to other factors e g clay content and pore water salinity binley et al 2015 furthermore archie s law does not consider surface electrical conductivity associated with the electrical double layer surrounding soil particles advanced petrophysical models should be employed in future studies to consider the influence of the surface conductivity e g revil et al 2007 mboh et al 2012 in addition the electrical conductivity distribution may not only be related to the swc distribution because of independent variations in the pore water electrical conductivity associated with fertilizer application or biogeochemical reactions in the subsurface this potential mismatch between the distribution of electrical conductivity and swc cannot be neglected in the interpretation of actual infiltration experiments to accurately describe the electrical conductivity distribution it may thus be necessary to consider solute transport and geochemical reactions in addition to water flow to predict the distribution of the bulk electrical conductivity in unsaturated soil e g loague and green 1991 unfortunately this will introduce additional unknowns and will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of cfwi finally soils of high salinity or clay content may lead to a strong attenuation of the waveform amplitude as a result the noise level of the actual field data measured in these types of soil could be relatively high compared to the coupled inversion of the travel times cfwi may thus be less robust to estimate the hydraulic parameters for these types of soils finally it is important to emphasize that cfwi already requires substantial computational resources for the set up used in this study cfwi took almost 10 days of computations with a computer cluster 48 processers of amd opteron 6300 or a week with the jureca supercomputer 24 processors jülich supercomputing centre 2018 although the fdtd algorithm in gprmax3d was able to calculate in parallel note that further studies should check how this performance can be improved using further parallelization and hpc clusters for example the simultaneous parallelization of the sce ua and fdtd algorithm furthermore the grid size was set to 0 02 m in this study which may not be sufficient for accurate gpr simulations in actual 2d or 3d applications of cfwi due to the systematic errors of fdtd algorithm caused by the finite difference discretization and numerical dispersion if modelling errors need to be further reduced the discretization of the simulation needs to be refined which will further increase computational costs therefore it is important to improve the efficiency of current gpr modelling methods 5 conclusions in this study we conducted a synthetic study to explore the feasibility of using cfwi to estimate hydraulic parameters and the thickness of the first layer for a 2 layer soil profile first a workflow for cfwi was introduced compared with the coupled inversion of travel times cfwi directly uses the entire gpr waveform and can therefore avoid propagation of uncertainties from the picking of first arrivals into the inversion in a next step we proposed an infiltration experiment to obtain synthetic vertical swc profiles based on the real infiltration experiment reported by yu et al 2021 this experiment included a 6 hour infiltration event with gpr measurements at three depths 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 m depth based on this experimental design response surfaces for the thickness of the first layer and different hydraulic parameters were calculated for point swc measurements gpr travel times and gpr waveforms to investigate potential parameter correlations it was found that layer depth h t was negatively correlated with θ s 1 and θ s 2 in addition the response surfaces indicated that cfwi provided more accurate estimates of layer depth compared with coupled inversion of gpr travel times and inversion of point swc measurements this is attributed to the fact that cfwi contains additional information introduced by the reflected wave from the layer boundary finally inversion of swc data from point measurements coupled inversion of gpr travel times and cfwi were applied to the synthetic infiltration experiment the simulated swcs travel times and waveforms matched well with the noisy data but the estimates of the hydraulic parameters from swc data showed considerably larger uncertainty also the coupled inversion of travel times showed a slight deviation from the true values and a relatively larger uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity and retention functions in contrast hydraulic parameters estimated from cfwi had considerably smaller uncertainty and thus better matched the known water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves however a range of challenges remain for the application of cfwi to real field experiments first cfwi requires an accurate conceptual setup for the hydro geo logical model furthermore a robust approach for effective source wavelet estimation for experimental zop data has to be developed moreover the use of a more sophisticated hydrological model that couples the simulations of water flow and solute transport has to be considered for cfwi to cope with changes in electrical conductivity associated with fertilization and geochemical processes in addition the efficiency and accuracy of the current gpr modelling may need to be improved in conclusion cfwi has several advantages over the coupled inversion of gpr travel times and it is expected to be a promising inversion approach for estimating hydraulic parameters after several remaining challenges have been addressed credit authorship contribution statement yi yu
