15440,simultaneously achieving efficient nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal without adding external carbon source is vital for carbon neutral wastewater treatment in this study a novel cross flow honeycomb bionic microbial carrier cf was developed to improve the efficiency of simultaneous nitrification denitrification and p removal sndpr in an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system a parallel laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor with the commercialized microbial carriers cm cm ifas was performed as the comparative system for over 233 d the results demonstrated that cf ifas exhibited a more consistent n removal efficiency and better performance than cm ifas in the cf ifas the highest n and p removal efficiencies were 95 40 and 100 respectively typical cycle analysis revealed that nitrate was primarily removed by the denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms in the cf ifas and by denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms in the cm ifas the neutral community model showed that the microbial community assembly in both the reactors was driven by deterministic selection rather than stochastic factors compared to those in cm ifas the microorganisms in cf ifas were more closely related to each other and had more keystone species norank f norank o norank c om190 sm1a02 defluviicoccus norank f saprospiraceae and norank f rhodocyclaceae the absolute contents of the genes associated with n removal bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk were higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the n cycle activity was also stronger in the cf ifas overall the microecological environment differed between both systems this study provides novel insights into the potential of bionic carriers to improve sndpr performance by shaping microbial communities thereby providing scientific guidance for practical engineering graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial carrier nitrogen removal microbial community assembly keystone species integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas technology which was developed in 1994 increases microbial population diversity and pollutant removal efficiency through synergistic effects between the biofilms on carriers and suspended biomass in activated sludge shreve and brennan 2019 in the ifas system biofilms on carriers have long retention time and good stress tolerance can reduce wash out and promote the growth of slow growing bacteria yang et al 2019 the limited diffusion of oxygen and simultaneous diffusion of nox n in the biofilm form several anoxic regions thereby creating a favorable environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification massoompour et al 2022 moreover the loosely structured suspended flocs have advantages in substrate transport and diffusion from the liquid phase to the flocs thereby promoting microbial growth and contaminant removal perez et al 2005 hence the ifas system combining biofilm and suspended flocs is an efficient way to retrofit conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtps and may aid in enhancing simultaneous nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal efficiencies reducing sludge production and improving the sludge settling performance shreve and brennan 2019 the carrier is the core of the ifas system that provides ample space for biofilm growth liu et al 2020 the porosity of the carrier is conducive to the biofilm and its material and structure affect the formation and thickness of the biofilm thereby influencing the gas liquid mass transfer and treatment efficiency al amshawee et al 2020 furthermore reactor kinetics and temperature sensitivity are affected by the carrier configuration ashkanani et al 2019 commonly used carriers include polyethylene pe alginate bamboo fiber and ceramsite pe has been widely applied owing to its low density stability resistance to biodegradation and aging and strong mechanical strength massoompour et al 2020 however pe is usually weakly hydrophilic and its large specific surface area is still limited restricting the transfer of pollutants or the adhesion of surface positive bacteria deng et al 2016 therefore developing hydrophilic pe carriers with large specific surface area is necessary studying structural hierarchies in nature is a fruitful resource for bio inspired design strategies such as for carrier structures a layered honeycomb bionic structure lhbs has high porosity reduced material use good stability and large specific surface area with wide applications in cell scaffolds antibacterial materials molecular arrays and biosensing kawano et al 2013 luo et al 2022 chen and wang 2016 li et al 2022 the lhbs is also conducive to microbial cell adhesion tsuruma et al 2008 and has led to good biofilm growth in previous preliminary experiments considering the advantages of lhbs we have successfully developed a novel carrier the cross flow honeycomb bionic carrier cf by adding hydrophilic substances to pe raw materials and adopting lhbs in the configuration the continuous fluidization of wastewater on the layered carrier results in a dissolved oxygen do gradient throughout the different levels favorable to the growth of different microorganisms we speculate that a reactor with cf may result in a different microecological environment than that with commercialized microbial carrier cm therefore enhancing the wastewater treatment performance distinct microecological environments favor the formation of different dominant microbial communities as the major nutrient removal contributors various microbes play essential roles in wastewater treatment for example highly enriched phosphate accumulating organisms paos denitrifying paos dpaos glycogen accumulating organisms gaos denitrifying gaos dgaos nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria all collaborate to increase the storage of internal glycogen gly obtained from influent wastewater this gly storage is then used as a carbon and energy source for the n and p uptake in the simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal process sndpr to the best of our knowledge no study on sndpr in the ifas system has been previously reported few studies reported a simultaneous analysis of microbial community assembly keystone species and functional genes for sndpr with most only describing the microbial community composition therein the mechanism behind community assembly deterministic or stochastic processes is a crucial challenge in microbial ecology goldford et al 2018 microbial community structure is shaped by a combination of deterministic traditional niche based theory and stochastic processes unified neutral theory potts et al 2022 deterministic community assembly results from the predictable screening of species based on environmental and biological conditions attributed to different habitat preferences and adaptive capabilities of microorganisms however stochastic community assembly results from essentially random processes of dispersal birth death and drift romdhane et al 2022 in a recent study the neutral community model ncm was used to reveal the seasonal succession patterns of planktonic eukaryotic microorganisms chen et al 2019 in addition to microbial assembly keystone species have an equally important impact on the structure and function of microbial communities as they are key to microbial interactions and function zhao et al 2022 the loss of keystone species can lead to substantial changes in microbial community function and ecosystem processes banerjee et al 2018 therefore community assembly and the identification of keystone species are critical for comprehensively understanding microbial n and p removal for further understanding and improving the efficiency of sndpr the objectives of this study were to i compare the n and p removal performances of the cf system cf ifas with the cm system cm ifas ii elucidate the mechanisms of n and p removal through stoichiometric calculations and iii analyze the microbial communities and functional genes as well as the interphase relationships among microorganisms microbial community assembly and keystone species this study provides a theoretical reference basis and valuable insights into the performance mechanisms and keystone species of sndpr 2 method and materials 2 1 characteristics of the novel carrier the cf fig 1 s1 was obtained by mixing 75 pe 11 starch 1 maleic anhydride 11 activated carbon 1 8 calcium carbonate and 0 2 azodicarbonamide according to weight percentages and was extruded at high temperature the carrier was internally provided through multiple hexagonal prisms with a simulated lhbs and a horizontal inclination of 60 and the wavy surface of the prisms had numerous plurality of small bulges to promote biofilm formation several parallel corrugated grooves with an inclination of 60 were uniformly arranged on the front and rear sides of the carrier surface according to the hydrodynamic calculation and numerous small pores were distributed on the left and right sides the arrangement of parallel grooves can further reduces the time of biofilm formation the high pore distribution together with the hydrodynamics designs can effectively alleviate the problem that the honeycomb carrier is easy to be blocked ensuring that the growth and disruption of the biofilm are in a balanced state additional details can be found in patent cn 112 875 873 a 2 2 experiment design and operation two identical cylindrical reactors made of plexiglass with a working volume of 5 l were used in this study one reactor with cm was named as cm ifas system and the other reactor with cf was named cf ifas system fig 1 the two reactors were operated in anaerobic 240 min aerobic 200 min anoxic 240 min mode at room temperature 20 25 c for 2 cycles per day at the beginning of each cycle 3 l of synthetic wastewater was fed to the reactor with a drainage ratio of 60 at the end of the anoxic stage a certain amount of mixed solution was discharged to maintain sludge retention time srt at 13 days the used synthetic wastewater was made from tap water by dissolving naac kh2po4 nh4cl nano2 nano3 mgso4 7h2o cacl2 and 1 ml l trace elements yang et al 2021 the experiment involved three phases based on different influent nh4 n concentrations the characteristics of the influents in each phase are presented in table 1 do concentration of the mixture in the aerobic stage during the whole experiment was 0 5 1 3 mg l activated sludge from the secondary sedimentation tanks at harbin wenchang wwtp harbin china was inoculated to start up the reactors with an initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 3500 119 mg l 2 3 sampling and analysis the mixed samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter and chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and p concentrations were analyzed using a spectrophotometer n6000 yoke china total nitrogen tn was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n ph and do were measured using a ph phb 4 rex china and do jpb 607a rex china meter respectively freeze dried biomass was used for determining polyhydroxyalkanoates phas poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv and glycogen gly according to the study by wang et al 2016b phas and gly concentrations were determined via gas chromatography and gly was analyzed via the anthrone sulfuric acid method du et al 2019 extracellular polymeric substances eps on the biofilm were extracted via the heat extraction method he et al 2020 polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in eps were determined via the anthrone colorimetric method and folin phenol method respectively 2 4 high throughput sequencing and quantitative real time pcr qpcr at the end of each phase 89 days 141 days and 233 days suspended flocs and biofilm samples were taken from the reactors to determine the changes in microbial communities and identify dominant microorganisms the suspended flocs and biofilm samples in cm ifas were called cmw and cmm whereas those in cf ifas were called cfw and cfm the specific sequencing steps and platform used were consistent with those used in the study of zhong et al 2021 the functional annotation of tax4fun and prokaryotic taxa faprotax were used to predict microbial functions tax4fun predictions were obtained from silva labeled operational taxonomic unit otu abundances cheng et al 2022 faprotax predictions were based on the normalized contig based 16s rrna otu table annotated in the database of prokaryotic environmental functions louca et al 2016 microbial functional genes associated with n and p removal were quantified via quantitative real time pcr qpcr the primers used to target the specific sequences and their annealing temperatures are listed in table s1 the analyses of all samples were performed in triplicate and the average was determined and analyzed each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 16 4 μl sybr primix ex taqtm takara japan 0 8 μl of each forward and reverse primer and 2 μl dna template 2 5 bioinformatic analysis the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime qiime version 1 9 1 http qiime org install index html pipeline was used to analyze the sequence data otu clustering of the non repetitive sequences excluding single sequences was performed by uparse version 7 0 1090 http drive5 com uparse with 97 similarity and chimeras were removed during clustering to acquire representative sequences of otus to obtain the taxonomic information of the species corresponding to each otu the ribosomal database project rdp classifier bayesian algorithm was used to perform taxonomic analysis of the representative

adonis and an analysis of similarity anosim using by qiime software were used to analyze the explanatory degree r value and group significance p value for cm ifas and cf ifas alpha diversity indices shannon diversity index and chao1 estimator were calculated using mothur version 1 30 2 https mothur org wiki calculators to elucidate the microbial community assembly ncm was used to predict the relative abundances of otus and their frequency based on the method proposed by burns et al burns et al 2016 to ascertain the interactions and keystone species between the microbial communities co occurrence networks analyses were performed using a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi according to the rmt based approach l deng et al 2016 gephi version 0 9 5 was used to graphically visualize the co occurrence networks 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative performance of n and p removal in cf ifas and cm ifas systems the variations and removal efficiencies of n p and cod were analyzed to determine the performance of the two reactors fig 2 both systems exhibited excellent n removal performance with effluent nh4 n concentration of 0 mg l during phase i the effluent tn concentration and removal efficiencies in cf ifas were 3 24 1 02 mg l and 94 71 1 94 respectively and those in cm ifas were 5 10 0 90 mg l and 90 19 1 73 respectively fig 2 when the influent nh4 n concentration was increased to 76 04 1 95 mg l in phase ii lower effluent nh4 n 83 37 1 07 and tn 68 05 2 48 removal efficiencies were observed in cm ifas compared with those in cf ifas 94 49 1 74 for nh4 n 82 04 2 65 for tn after stabilization in phase iii nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies in cf ifas remained at approximately 80 and 70 respectively however they were only approximately 70 and 66 respectively in cm ifas there was no accumulation of no2 n in either reactor the cod and p removal efficiencies in both reactors remained consistently high for example the cod removal efficiencies of cf ifas were 94 89 2 78 phase i 94 58 3 91 phase ii and 93 87 3 39 phase iii and p was completely removed moreover welch s t test and one way anova were conducted on the n p and cod removal efficiencies of the two systems at different phases tables s2 s3 the results showed significant differences in the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies between the two systems during the three phases of the experiment however no significant difference was observed in the cod removal efficiency although the p removal efficiency of both systems remained consistently high a significant difference was observed in both system in phase iii illustrating the influence of the carrier on the p removal efficiency of the system throughout the experiment cf ifas outperformed cm ifas in terms of n removal this is because the porous honeycomb structure of cf could effectively reduce the shear force of water flow providing a more stable environment for microorganism growth and avoiding the shedding of microorganisms this can also be established by the secretion of more eps pn ps from cf fig s2 eps helps protect biofilms from the changes in the external environment pan et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 the pn in cm ifas and cf ifas accounted for 86 05 and 94 43 of the total eps respectively demonstrating that pn played a major role in maintaining the reactor performance huang et al 2020 shi et al 2020 pn and ps are typically hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances respectively and the enhancement of hydrophobic components highly contributes to biofilm formation han et al 2018 han et al 2020 in addition the high tss vss and thick biofilm on cf table s4 also confirmed that cf had good biofilm forming characteristics long term monitoring revealed that do concentration ranged 0 3 0 7 mg l inside the cf and 0 5 1 3 mg l outside the cf however no significant difference was observed in do concentration inside and outside cm 0 5 1 3 mg l this implies that the structure of cf itself had certain obstructive effect on oxygen transfer leading to uneven do distribution inside and outside the carrier the do concentration inside the cf was lower than that of the cm however it was same outside of both the carriers likely making the cm ifas more favorable for ammonia oxidation however nh4 n removal efficiency was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas which may be owing to the higher amount of microorganisms associated with ammonia oxidation attached to the outside of the cf than that of the cm absolute abundance of functional genes on both carriers was further analyzed in section 3 3 5 moreover the different structures of the two carriers may have formed different micro ecological environments within the systems resulting in different nutrient removal mechanisms 3 2 mechanism of n and p removal to elucidate the n and p removal pathways n p and internal and external carbon transformation stoichiometry in typical cycles 89 days 141 days and 233 days were analyzed to determine the n and p conversion as shown in fig 3 a and tables s5 s6 in the anaerobic stage of cm ifas system the p release amount pra to δphas was 0 29 mol p mol c considerably lower than that of paos model 0 625 mol p mol c smolders et al 1994a and closer to that of metabolic model for dpaos 0 24 mol p mol c zeng et al 2003a confirming that dpaos were the major contributor to p release the value of δgly δphas 0 52 mol c mol c of cm ifas system was higher than that of both dpaos 0 43 mol c mol c and paos models 0 385 mol c mol c but lower than that of gaos 0 628 mol c mol c and dgaos 0 62 mol c mol c models this illustrated that in addition to paos and dpaos gaos and dgaos contributed to phas synthesis and gly decomposition in the aerobic stage δgly δphas was 0 48 mol c mol c more closer to the dpaos model 0 45 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003a than to paos model reported by both smolders et al 0 42 mol c mol c and zeng et al 0 53 mol c mol c smolders et al 1994b zeng et al al 2003a and much lower than dgaos 0 63 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003c and gaos models 0 95 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b demonstrating that dpaos played a dominant role in the conversion of carbon sources in the aerobic stage the p uptake amount pua to δphas 0 16 mol p mol c of cm ifas system was consistent with that of dpaos 0 16 mol p mol c as reported by guisasola et al 2009 and closer to that of paos 0 23 mol p mol c as reported by zeng et al 2003a but lower than that of the paos values 0 41 mol p mol c as reported by smolders et al 1994b this suggested the involvement of both paos and dpaos in the p removal process but higher contribution of dpaos this could also be supported by the high relative abundance of dechloromonas 5 97 11 18 a kind of dpaos in cm ifas system cod was only reduced by 6 08 mg l in this stage therefore most n was removed via endogenous denitrification by dpaos during the anoxic stage of cm ifas δno3 n δphas 0 15 mol n mol c was closer to that of dgaona 0 13 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 and dpaona models 0 16 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a indicating that no3 n was directly removed as an electron donor by dpaos and dgaos in cm ifas the δno3 n δgly 0 60 mol n mol c was marginally higher than that of dpaona model 0 52 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a and considerably lower than that of dpaoni model 0 75 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a suggesting that most of no3 n was removed as an electron donor by dpaos in the anaerobic stage of cf ifas pra δphas was 0 27 mol p mol c closer to that of the dpaos 0 24 mol p mol c zeng et al 2003a than that of the paos 0 625 mol p mol c model smolders et al 1994a confirming that dpaos were major contributors to p release fig 3b the δgly δphas 0 66 mol c mol c was considerably higher than that of the paos 0 385 mol c mol c smolders et al 1994a and dpaos 0 43 mol c mol c model zeng et al 2003a but closer to that of gaos 0 628 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b and dgaos 0 62 mol c mol c models zeng et al 2003c demonstrating that only a small amount of phas was stored by dpaos and paos compared with that by gaos and dgaos endogenous denitrification occurred in this system as evidenced by the reduction in cod by only 2 15 mg l in the aerobic stage of cf ifas the δgly δphas 0 577 mol c mol c was higher than that of the dpaos 0 45 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003a and paos 0 42 mol c mol c models as reported by smolders et al 1994b closer to that of paos 0 53 molc mol c as reported by zeng et al al 2003a slightly lower than that of the dgaos model 0 63 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003c and considerably lower than that of gaos model 0 95 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b demonstrating that in addition to dgaos dpaos and paos contributed to pha decomposition and gly synthesis pua δphas 0 31 mol p mol c was higher than that of dpaos model 0 24 mol p molc 0 16 mol p molc zeng et al 2003a guisasola et al 2009 and the paos value 0 23 mol p molc reported by zeng et al 2003a but lower than that of paos model 0 41 mol p molc as reported by smolders et al 1994b indicating that p removal was achieved by the combined action of paos and dpaos during the anoxic stage of cf ifas the δno3 n δphas value 0 33 mol n mol c was lower than that of the dgaona ni 0 80 mol n mol c model ji et al 2017 but higher than that of the dgaoni 0 28 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 dpaoni 0 27 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a dgaona 0 13 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 and dpaona 0 16 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a models this indicates that most no3 n was first reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and no2 n acted as an electron donor for endogenous denitrification via dpaoni and dgaoni however the δno3 n δgly value 0 36 mol n mol c was slightly higher than that of dgaoni 0 27 mol n mol c model wang et al 2015 and considerably lower than that of dpaoni model 0 75 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a suggesting that both dpaoni and dgaoni contributed to n removal with the contribution of dgaoni being higher these results illustrated that most no3 n was reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and then removed through endogenous denitrification by dgaoni the n and p removal mechanisms in both the systems at 141 days and 233 days respectively were similar to those at 89 days figs s3 s4 the possible n and p removal pathways are shown in figs 3c 3d the mechanism of pollutant removal in the two reactors could be suggested as follows i in cm ifas system dpaos were the major contributor to p release in the anaerobic stage and during phas synthesis and gly decomposition all paos dpaos gaos and dgaos contributed p was primarily removed via dpaos in the aerobic stage most of the no3 n was removed as a direct electron donor by dpaos ii in cf ifas system dpaos were the major contributors to p release in anaerobic stage and only a small amount of phas was stored by dpaos and paos compared with that by gaos and dgaos p removal was achieved by the combined activity of paos and dpaos in the aerobic stage in the anoxic stage most no3 n was reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and then removed through endogenous denitrification by dgaoni 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 microbial community diversity the illumina sequencing data were rarefied to the same sequencing depth of 27 371 sequences per sample from the rarefaction curves fig s5 the 27 371 sequences could generally represent the bacterial diversity of each sample alpha diversity analysis revealed higher chao1 richness in cf ifas than in cm ifas fig s6b similarly the shannon evenness indices fig s6a that denote the abundance and uniformity of bacterial communities were higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas therefore species diversity was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the pca revealed distinct difference among different systems fig s6c furthermore multivariate analyses including adonis and anosim fig s6d revealed significant differences between the cm ifas and cf ifas systems adonis f 27 463 p 0 002 anosim r 0 856 p 0 002 additionally there were 314 otus in both systems fig s7a and the percentage of exclusive otus in cf ifas and cm ifas ranged from 1 56 to 4 36 and 0 53 2 03 respectively demonstrating that the abundance of dominant microorganisms within the two systems was not high 3 3 2 microbial community taxonomic and functional compositions at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both reactors fig s7b with relative abundances of 43 09 55 34 in cm ifas and 37 66 43 57 in cf ifas bacteroidota was the second most abundant phylum in both reactors followed by acidobacteriota in cm ifas and actinobacteriota in cf ifas the heatmap fig s7c clustering using the top 30 genera showed four distinct clusters of dominant genera cluster 1 had only one genus acinetobacter more predominant in cmw89d average 21 52 cmm89d average 6 69 and cfw89d average 1 78 cluster 2 contained candidatus competibacter a dgao and norank f saprospiraceae which play important roles in endogenous denitrification and aerobic denitrification respectively wang et al 2020 most genera in cf ifas were concentrated in cluster 3 12 genera however the majority of the bacteria in cm ifas was primarily found in cluster 4 15 genera specifically candidatus competibacter 12 07 23 04 was the most abundant genus in cf ifas followed by norank f saprospiraceae 6 72 9 49 norank f phos he36 3 00 4 42 dokdonella 2 74 3 79 and olb8 2 28 3 92 dechloromonas 5 97 11 18 was the most abundant genus in cm ifas and other genera included zoogloea 2 28 15 38 candidatus accumulibacter 0 16 8 70 sulfuritalea averaged 2 89 3 97 and olb8 1 77 6 15 dechloromonas and candidatus accumulibacter are typical dpaos that can use no3 n or no2 n as electron acceptors for denitrifying p removal wang et al 2022 additionally all samples were divided into two categories that is genera of samples in cm ifas clustered together whereas those of cf ifas clustered as a separate group suggesting a difference in the species composition of cm ifas and cf ifas however some samples sampled at different times from the same reactor were clustered at the same branches indicating that the impact of influent nh4 n concentration was considerably less than that of the carriers based on the ncbi database the dynamic changes in potential functional bacteria that are crucial to n and p removal were evaluated in cm ifas and cf ifas systems fig 4 a twenty six potential functional species were selected to distinguish the functional divergence between the two systems including two ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob one nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob fifteen denitrifiers two paos four dpaos and one dgao as shown in fig 4a aob was more abundant in cm ifas than in cf ifas which contradicted the high nh4 n removal efficiency of cf ifas in the whole process this could be attributed to the presence of other unidentified bacteria with nitrification functions a welch s t test on the 26 potential functional species on biofilm and suspended flocs in both systems revealed a significant difference between candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas figs 4b 4c candidatus competibacter was dominant present in cf ifas whereas dechloromonas was dominant in cm ifas the dpaos content in cm ifas was higher than that of paos and dgao contents indicating that p and n removals were driven by dpaos the paos content in cf ifas was slightly lower than dpaos contents and dgao content was significantly higher than that of dpaos implying that p and n removals resulted from the combined action of dpaos and paos with a greater contribution from dpaos endogenous denitrification was primarily driven by dgaos in cf ifas these results are consistent with the analysis results of typical cycles 3 3 3 microbial community assembly bacterial diversity and composition differed between the two systems therefore the forces involved in determining bacterial diversity and composition were further investigated by ncm if neutral stochastic processes dominate ncm predictions would correspond with experimental data lu et al 2022 however as shown in fig 5 and table s7 only a very few otus in the biofilm and suspended flocs of the two systems matched the expected values and most taxa occurred more frequently higher enrichment than their expected relative abundances this suggests that deterministic selection may dominate the microbial community assembly in both systems the r2 value of biofilm in both reactors was smaller than that of suspended flocs indicating that the deterministic selection accounts for a larger proportion in the microbial assembly process on biofilm r2 of biofilm in cf ifas was lower than that in cm ifas further illustrating that cf played an important role in microbial deterministic selection 3 3 4 keystone taxa and species interactions similar to the alpha diversity analysis otu level co occurrence networks in cf ifas were considerably more complex than those in cm ifas figs 6 a 6b with more nodes and links and higher average degree avg k and modularity values table s8 the r 2 of power law in cm ifas 0 743 and cf ifas 0 719 showed that the network topology followed the power law distribution the topological features of both networks such as the average clustering coefficient avg cc harmonic geodesic distance hd transitivity trans and modularity were apparently higher than those of the corresponding random networks table s9 moreover the small world coefficients σ of both networks were higher than 1 table s9 confirming small world and modular structure of the networks xu et al 2021 specifically as the cf ifas system network had higher average connectivity avg k higher avg cc and shorter hd species interactions in cf ifas were more intensive than that in cm ifas additionally there were 76 and 110 modules in cm ifas and cf ifas network with a modularity of 0 852 and 0 869 respectively microorganisms in the same module may tend to have similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 based on the within module connectivity zi among module connectivity pi plot all nodes could be classified into four categories namely peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 zeng et al 2021 in cm ifas system three module hubs and one connectors were detected in the constructed network fig 6c otu14 was derived from the genus pedobacter 0 004 0 08 which plays an important role in nitrification x zuo et al 2020 otu 178 belonged to the genus norank f anaerolineaceae 0 16 0 88 one of the bacteria that can determine nitrification x zuo et al 2020 and otu 2218 belonged to the genus candidatus accumulibacter 0 16 8 70 a kind of p removing bacteria otu362 was derived from the genus norank f norank o norank c tk10 0 003 0 015 which may play an essential role in denitrification xing et al 2020 for cf ifas system there were five keystone species four model hubs otus249 1280 2313 and 2375 and one connector otu1984 fig 6d otu249 was from the genus norank f norank o norank c om190 0 18 0 82 which belonged to om190 class having a vital role in the c cycle c chen et al 2021a otu1280 belonged to genus sm1a02 0 28 0 58 which has been found in many activated sludge system with good nitrifying performance chu et al 2015 otu 2313 was from the genus defluviicoccus 0 24 0 62 which is a gao chen et al 2021b otu2375 was derived from the genus norank f saprospiraceae 6 72 9 49 which may play an important role in aerobic denitrification wang et al 2020 as the only connector otu1984 belonged to the genus norank f rhodocyclaceae 0 57 1 00 which is a bacterium with denitrification function the vital role of these keystone species in the network can also be demonstrated by their high degree and betweenness text s1 tables s10 s11 the relative abundance of the genera in which most keystone species were found was not high for example sm1a02 had a relative abundance between 0 28 and 0 58 whereas the genus norank f saprospiraceae in which otu2375 was found had a relatively high abundance 6 72 9 49 previous studies have revealed that low abundance species are as important or more important than abundant species in maintaining the stability of microbial networks shi et al 2016 lu et al 2022 consistent with the results in this study unlike those found in cm ifas four keystone species five keystone species were found in cf ifas figs 6c 6d this is because the cf ifas system increased bacterial diversity by creating niche differentiation which enriched keystone species closely related to nutrient removal and n p and c transformation tables 2 3 iannacone et al 2020 x zuo et al 2020 tian et al 2022 the above results indicated that different keystone species were formed within the reactors using different carriers 3 3 5 quantification of functional genes the genes bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs nirk and 16s rrna genes of gaos and paos which are associated with ammonia oxidation nitrate nitrite reductase endogenious denitrificaton and phosphorus removal were all detected in both biofilm and suspended flocs of cm ifas and cf ifas the absolute abundance of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa and the nitrate nitrite reductase narg napa nirs nirk of each phase in cf ifas were higher than those in cm ifas this result corresponds with the higher nitrogen removal efficiencies of cf ifas however the relative abundance of aob in cf ifas was slightly lower than that in cm ifas and the absolute abundance of bacterial amoa was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the reason could be that there were bacteria containing genes with ammonia oxidation functions that are not currently identified and thus they would not be identified via high throughput sequencing but would be included when the absolute gene content is tested in addition the total absolute contents of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk of cf 1 94 109 2 84 109 copies g dry weight were marginally higher than those of cm 1 23 109 2 64 109 copies g dry weight this shows that cf is more conducive to the formation of functional genes the abundance of 16s rrna total bacteria in biofilm and suspended flocs varied within 9 10 orders of magnitude with no significant difference between the two reactors figs 7 a 7b notably 16s rrna gene of gaos exhibited relatively higher abundance in cf ifas 1 41 109 5 40 109 copies g dry weight than in cm ifas however 16s rrna gene of paos was relative lower in cf ifas which further demonstrated that dgaos played an important role in cf ifas 3 3 6 functional prediction the faprotax and tax4fun were employed to predict the functions of the identified microbial community fig s8 shows that relatively strong nitrate nitrite n respiration nitric oxide nitrate nitrite denitrification and nitrate reduction were observed in cf ifas than in cm ifas meanwhile the n cycle activity was low in cm ifas consistent with the n removal results observed in cf ifas the n cycle activity on the biofilm was slightly stronger than that of the suspended flocs at the same phase which may be owing to the increased growth of denitrifying bacteria caused by the formation of anoxic areas in cf therefore more denitrifying bacteria are speculated in the anoxic zone inside cf we will continue to conduct comprehensive analysis on the structure of microbial communities at different locations in cf in the future studies the abundance of functional genes and enzymes was classified and quantified based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database figs 7c 7d the abundance of the nitrification gene hao both on biofilm and suspended flocs was considerably higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas however the percentage of amoabc was similar corroborating the enhanced nh4 n removal capacity of cf ifas this also demonstrates the existence of some unidentified microorganisms with nitrification functions in cf ifas meanwhile majority of the denitrification genes such as narp narl napa nord and norq were more abundant in cf ifas than in cm ifas at the same phase these results are similar to the faprotax results in which enhanced n removal efficiency was observed in cf ifas 4 conclusions overall the results show that cf can improve the sndpr performance in the ifas system through the formation of different microecological environments nitrate was primarily removed by dgao driven endogenous denitrification in the cf ifas and by dpaos in the cm ifas in both reactors the microbial community assembly was driven by deterministic rather than stochastic factors the co occurrence network in the cf ifas was more complex and the types and numbers of keystone species differed between the two reactors with five genera in the cf ifas norank f norank o norank c om190 sm1a02 defluviicoccus norank f saprospiraceae and norank f rhodocyclaceae and only four in the cm ifas pedobacter norank f anaerolineaceae candidatus accumulibacter and norank f norank o norank c tk10 the absolute content of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk genes were higher in the cf ifas than in the cm ifas and the n cycle activity was also stronger in cf ifas we conclude that the special structure of the cf favors sndpr performance by shaping the microbial community through the formation of more anoxic zones these findings may provide a theoretical

15440,simultaneously achieving efficient nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal without adding external carbon source is vital for carbon neutral wastewater treatment in this study a novel cross flow honeycomb bionic microbial carrier cf was developed to improve the efficiency of simultaneous nitrification denitrification and p removal sndpr in an integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system a parallel laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor with the commercialized microbial carriers cm cm ifas was performed as the comparative system for over 233 d the results demonstrated that cf ifas exhibited a more consistent n removal efficiency and better performance than cm ifas in the cf ifas the highest n and p removal efficiencies were 95 40 and 100 respectively typical cycle analysis revealed that nitrate was primarily removed by the denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms in the cf ifas and by denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms in the cm ifas the neutral community model showed that the microbial community assembly in both the reactors was driven by deterministic selection rather than stochastic factors compared to those in cm ifas the microorganisms in cf ifas were more closely related to each other and had more keystone species norank f norank o norank c om190 sm1a02 defluviicoccus norank f saprospiraceae and norank f rhodocyclaceae the absolute contents of the genes associated with n removal bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk were higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the n cycle activity was also stronger in the cf ifas overall the microecological environment differed between both systems this study provides novel insights into the potential of bionic carriers to improve sndpr performance by shaping microbial communities thereby providing scientific guidance for practical engineering graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial carrier nitrogen removal microbial community assembly keystone species integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas technology which was developed in 1994 increases microbial population diversity and pollutant removal efficiency through synergistic effects between the biofilms on carriers and suspended biomass in activated sludge shreve and brennan 2019 in the ifas system biofilms on carriers have long retention time and good stress tolerance can reduce wash out and promote the growth of slow growing bacteria yang et al 2019 the limited diffusion of oxygen and simultaneous diffusion of nox n in the biofilm form several anoxic regions thereby creating a favorable environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification massoompour et al 2022 moreover the loosely structured suspended flocs have advantages in substrate transport and diffusion from the liquid phase to the flocs thereby promoting microbial growth and contaminant removal perez et al 2005 hence the ifas system combining biofilm and suspended flocs is an efficient way to retrofit conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtps and may aid in enhancing simultaneous nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal efficiencies reducing sludge production and improving the sludge settling performance shreve and brennan 2019 the carrier is the core of the ifas system that provides ample space for biofilm growth liu et al 2020 the porosity of the carrier is conducive to the biofilm and its material and structure affect the formation and thickness of the biofilm thereby influencing the gas liquid mass transfer and treatment efficiency al amshawee et al 2020 furthermore reactor kinetics and temperature sensitivity are affected by the carrier configuration ashkanani et al 2019 commonly used carriers include polyethylene pe alginate bamboo fiber and ceramsite pe has been widely applied owing to its low density stability resistance to biodegradation and aging and strong mechanical strength massoompour et al 2020 however pe is usually weakly hydrophilic and its large specific surface area is still limited restricting the transfer of pollutants or the adhesion of surface positive bacteria deng et al 2016 therefore developing hydrophilic pe carriers with large specific surface area is necessary studying structural hierarchies in nature is a fruitful resource for bio inspired design strategies such as for carrier structures a layered honeycomb bionic structure lhbs has high porosity reduced material use good stability and large specific surface area with wide applications in cell scaffolds antibacterial materials molecular arrays and biosensing kawano et al 2013 luo et al 2022 chen and wang 2016 li et al 2022 the lhbs is also conducive to microbial cell adhesion tsuruma et al 2008 and has led to good biofilm growth in previous preliminary experiments considering the advantages of lhbs we have successfully developed a novel carrier the cross flow honeycomb bionic carrier cf by adding hydrophilic substances to pe raw materials and adopting lhbs in the configuration the continuous fluidization of wastewater on the layered carrier results in a dissolved oxygen do gradient throughout the different levels favorable to the growth of different microorganisms we speculate that a reactor with cf may result in a different microecological environment than that with commercialized microbial carrier cm therefore enhancing the wastewater treatment performance distinct microecological environments favor the formation of different dominant microbial communities as the major nutrient removal contributors various microbes play essential roles in wastewater treatment for example highly enriched phosphate accumulating organisms paos denitrifying paos dpaos glycogen accumulating organisms gaos denitrifying gaos dgaos nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria all collaborate to increase the storage of internal glycogen gly obtained from influent wastewater this gly storage is then used as a carbon and energy source for the n and p uptake in the simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal process sndpr to the best of our knowledge no study on sndpr in the ifas system has been previously reported few studies reported a simultaneous analysis of microbial community assembly keystone species and functional genes for sndpr with most only describing the microbial community composition therein the mechanism behind community assembly deterministic or stochastic processes is a crucial challenge in microbial ecology goldford et al 2018 microbial community structure is shaped by a combination of deterministic traditional niche based theory and stochastic processes unified neutral theory potts et al 2022 deterministic community assembly results from the predictable screening of species based on environmental and biological conditions attributed to different habitat preferences and adaptive capabilities of microorganisms however stochastic community assembly results from essentially random processes of dispersal birth death and drift romdhane et al 2022 in a recent study the neutral community model ncm was used to reveal the seasonal succession patterns of planktonic eukaryotic microorganisms chen et al 2019 in addition to microbial assembly keystone species have an equally important impact on the structure and function of microbial communities as they are key to microbial interactions and function zhao et al 2022 the loss of keystone species can lead to substantial changes in microbial community function and ecosystem processes banerjee et al 2018 therefore community assembly and the identification of keystone species are critical for comprehensively understanding microbial n and p removal for further understanding and improving the efficiency of sndpr the objectives of this study were to i compare the n and p removal performances of the cf system cf ifas with the cm system cm ifas ii elucidate the mechanisms of n and p removal through stoichiometric calculations and iii analyze the microbial communities and functional genes as well as the interphase relationships among microorganisms microbial community assembly and keystone species this study provides a theoretical reference basis and valuable insights into the performance mechanisms and keystone species of sndpr 2 method and materials 2 1 characteristics of the novel carrier the cf fig 1 s1 was obtained by mixing 75 pe 11 starch 1 maleic anhydride 11 activated carbon 1 8 calcium carbonate and 0 2 azodicarbonamide according to weight percentages and was extruded at high temperature the carrier was internally provided through multiple hexagonal prisms with a simulated lhbs and a horizontal inclination of 60 and the wavy surface of the prisms had numerous plurality of small bulges to promote biofilm formation several parallel corrugated grooves with an inclination of 60 were uniformly arranged on the front and rear sides of the carrier surface according to the hydrodynamic calculation and numerous small pores were distributed on the left and right sides the arrangement of parallel grooves can further reduces the time of biofilm formation the high pore distribution together with the hydrodynamics designs can effectively alleviate the problem that the honeycomb carrier is easy to be blocked ensuring that the growth and disruption of the biofilm are in a balanced state additional details can be found in patent cn 112 875 873 a 2 2 experiment design and operation two identical cylindrical reactors made of plexiglass with a working volume of 5 l were used in this study one reactor with cm was named as cm ifas system and the other reactor with cf was named cf ifas system fig 1 the two reactors were operated in anaerobic 240 min aerobic 200 min anoxic 240 min mode at room temperature 20 25 c for 2 cycles per day at the beginning of each cycle 3 l of synthetic wastewater was fed to the reactor with a drainage ratio of 60 at the end of the anoxic stage a certain amount of mixed solution was discharged to maintain sludge retention time srt at 13 days the used synthetic wastewater was made from tap water by dissolving naac kh2po4 nh4cl nano2 nano3 mgso4 7h2o cacl2 and 1 ml l trace elements yang et al 2021 the experiment involved three phases based on different influent nh4 n concentrations the characteristics of the influents in each phase are presented in table 1 do concentration of the mixture in the aerobic stage during the whole experiment was 0 5 1 3 mg l activated sludge from the secondary sedimentation tanks at harbin wenchang wwtp harbin china was inoculated to start up the reactors with an initial mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 3500 119 mg l 2 3 sampling and analysis the mixed samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter and chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and p concentrations were analyzed using a spectrophotometer n6000 yoke china total nitrogen tn was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n ph and do were measured using a ph phb 4 rex china and do jpb 607a rex china meter respectively freeze dried biomass was used for determining polyhydroxyalkanoates phas poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv and glycogen gly according to the study by wang et al 2016b phas and gly concentrations were determined via gas chromatography and gly was analyzed via the anthrone sulfuric acid method du et al 2019 extracellular polymeric substances eps on the biofilm were extracted via the heat extraction method he et al 2020 polysaccharides ps and proteins pn in eps were determined via the anthrone colorimetric method and folin phenol method respectively 2 4 high throughput sequencing and quantitative real time pcr qpcr at the end of each phase 89 days 141 days and 233 days suspended flocs and biofilm samples were taken from the reactors to determine the changes in microbial communities and identify dominant microorganisms the suspended flocs and biofilm samples in cm ifas were called cmw and cmm whereas those in cf ifas were called cfw and cfm the specific sequencing steps and platform used were consistent with those used in the study of zhong et al 2021 the functional annotation of tax4fun and prokaryotic taxa faprotax were used to predict microbial functions tax4fun predictions were obtained from silva labeled operational taxonomic unit otu abundances cheng et al 2022 faprotax predictions were based on the normalized contig based 16s rrna otu table annotated in the database of prokaryotic environmental functions louca et al 2016 microbial functional genes associated with n and p removal were quantified via quantitative real time pcr qpcr the primers used to target the specific sequences and their annealing temperatures are listed in table s1 the analyses of all samples were performed in triplicate and the average was determined and analyzed each 20 μl reaction mixture contained 16 4 μl sybr primix ex taqtm takara japan 0 8 μl of each forward and reverse primer and 2 μl dna template 2 5 bioinformatic analysis the

relative abundances of otus and their frequency based on the method proposed by burns et al burns et al 2016 to ascertain the interactions and keystone species between the microbial communities co occurrence networks analyses were performed using a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi according to the rmt based approach l deng et al 2016 gephi version 0 9 5 was used to graphically visualize the co occurrence networks 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative performance of n and p removal in cf ifas and cm ifas systems the variations and removal efficiencies of n p and cod were analyzed to determine the performance of the two reactors fig 2 both systems exhibited excellent n removal performance with effluent nh4 n concentration of 0 mg l during phase i the effluent tn concentration and removal efficiencies in cf ifas were 3 24 1 02 mg l and 94 71 1 94 respectively and those in cm ifas were 5 10 0 90 mg l and 90 19 1 73 respectively fig 2 when the influent nh4 n concentration was increased to 76 04 1 95 mg l in phase ii lower effluent nh4 n 83 37 1 07 and tn 68 05 2 48 removal efficiencies were observed in cm ifas compared with those in cf ifas 94 49 1 74 for nh4 n 82 04 2 65 for tn after stabilization in phase iii nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies in cf ifas remained at approximately 80 and 70 respectively however they were only approximately 70 and 66 respectively in cm ifas there was no accumulation of no2 n in either reactor the cod and p removal efficiencies in both reactors remained consistently high for example the cod removal efficiencies of cf ifas were 94 89 2 78 phase i 94 58 3 91 phase ii and 93 87 3 39 phase iii and p was completely removed moreover welch s t test and one way anova were conducted on the n p and cod removal efficiencies of the two systems at different phases tables s2 s3 the results showed significant differences in the nh4 n and tn removal efficiencies between the two systems during the three phases of the experiment however no significant difference was observed in the cod removal efficiency although the p removal efficiency of both systems remained consistently high a significant difference was observed in both system in phase iii illustrating the influence of the carrier on the p removal efficiency of the system throughout the experiment cf ifas outperformed cm ifas in terms of n removal this is because the porous honeycomb structure of cf could effectively reduce the shear force of water flow providing a more stable environment for microorganism growth and avoiding the shedding of microorganisms this can also be established by the secretion of more eps pn ps from cf fig s2 eps helps protect biofilms from the changes in the external environment pan et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 the pn in cm ifas and cf ifas accounted for 86 05 and 94 43 of the total eps respectively demonstrating that pn played a major role in maintaining the reactor performance huang et al 2020 shi et al 2020 pn and ps are typically hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances respectively and the enhancement of hydrophobic components highly contributes to biofilm formation han et al 2018 han et al 2020 in addition the high tss vss and thick biofilm on cf table s4 also confirmed that cf had good biofilm forming characteristics long term monitoring revealed that do concentration ranged 0 3 0 7 mg l inside the cf and 0 5 1 3 mg l outside the cf however no significant difference was observed in do concentration inside and outside cm 0 5 1 3 mg l this implies that the structure of cf itself had certain obstructive effect on oxygen transfer leading to uneven do distribution inside and outside the carrier the do concentration inside the cf was lower than that of the cm however it was same outside of both the carriers likely making the cm ifas more favorable for ammonia oxidation however nh4 n removal efficiency was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas which may be owing to the higher amount of microorganisms associated with ammonia oxidation attached to the outside of the cf than that of the cm absolute abundance of functional genes on both carriers was further analyzed in section 3 3 5 moreover the different structures of the two carriers may have formed different micro ecological environments within the systems resulting in different nutrient removal mechanisms 3 2 mechanism of n and p removal to elucidate the n and p removal pathways n p and internal and external carbon transformation stoichiometry in typical cycles 89 days 141 days and 233 days were analyzed to determine the n and p conversion as shown in fig 3 a and tables s5 s6 in the anaerobic stage of cm ifas system the p release amount pra to δphas was 0 29 mol p mol c considerably lower than that of paos model 0 625 mol p mol c smolders et al 1994a and closer to that of metabolic model for dpaos 0 24 mol p mol c zeng et al 2003a confirming that dpaos were the major contributor to p release the value of δgly δphas 0 52 mol c mol c of cm ifas system was higher than that of both dpaos 0 43 mol c mol c and paos models 0 385 mol c mol c but lower than that of gaos 0 628 mol c mol c and dgaos 0 62 mol c mol c models this illustrated that in addition to paos and dpaos gaos and dgaos contributed to phas synthesis and gly decomposition in the aerobic stage δgly δphas was 0 48 mol c mol c more closer to the dpaos model 0 45 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003a than to paos model reported by both smolders et al 0 42 mol c mol c and zeng et al 0 53 mol c mol c smolders et al 1994b zeng et al al 2003a and much lower than dgaos 0 63 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003c and gaos models 0 95 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b demonstrating that dpaos played a dominant role in the conversion of carbon sources in the aerobic stage the p uptake amount pua to δphas 0 16 mol p mol c of cm ifas system was consistent with that of dpaos 0 16 mol p mol c as reported by guisasola et al 2009 and closer to that of paos 0 23 mol p mol c as reported by zeng et al 2003a but lower than that of the paos values 0 41 mol p mol c as reported by smolders et al 1994b this suggested the involvement of both paos and dpaos in the p removal process but higher contribution of dpaos this could also be supported by the high relative abundance of dechloromonas 5 97 11 18 a kind of dpaos in cm ifas system cod was only reduced by 6 08 mg l in this stage therefore most n was removed via endogenous denitrification by dpaos during the anoxic stage of cm ifas δno3 n δphas 0 15 mol n mol c was closer to that of dgaona 0 13 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 and dpaona models 0 16 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a indicating that no3 n was directly removed as an electron donor by dpaos and dgaos in cm ifas the δno3 n δgly 0 60 mol n mol c was marginally higher than that of dpaona model 0 52 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a and considerably lower than that of dpaoni model 0 75 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a suggesting that most of no3 n was removed as an electron donor by dpaos in the anaerobic stage of cf ifas pra δphas was 0 27 mol p mol c closer to that of the dpaos 0 24 mol p mol c zeng et al 2003a than that of the paos 0 625 mol p mol c model smolders et al 1994a confirming that dpaos were major contributors to p release fig 3b the δgly δphas 0 66 mol c mol c was considerably higher than that of the paos 0 385 mol c mol c smolders et al 1994a and dpaos 0 43 mol c mol c model zeng et al 2003a but closer to that of gaos 0 628 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b and dgaos 0 62 mol c mol c models zeng et al 2003c demonstrating that only a small amount of phas was stored by dpaos and paos compared with that by gaos and dgaos endogenous denitrification occurred in this system as evidenced by the reduction in cod by only 2 15 mg l in the aerobic stage of cf ifas the δgly δphas 0 577 mol c mol c was higher than that of the dpaos 0 45 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003a and paos 0 42 mol c mol c models as reported by smolders et al 1994b closer to that of paos 0 53 molc mol c as reported by zeng et al al 2003a slightly lower than that of the dgaos model 0 63 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003c and considerably lower than that of gaos model 0 95 mol c mol c zeng et al 2003b demonstrating that in addition to dgaos dpaos and paos contributed to pha decomposition and gly synthesis pua δphas 0 31 mol p mol c was higher than that of dpaos model 0 24 mol p molc 0 16 mol p molc zeng et al 2003a guisasola et al 2009 and the paos value 0 23 mol p molc reported by zeng et al 2003a but lower than that of paos model 0 41 mol p molc as reported by smolders et al 1994b indicating that p removal was achieved by the combined action of paos and dpaos during the anoxic stage of cf ifas the δno3 n δphas value 0 33 mol n mol c was lower than that of the dgaona ni 0 80 mol n mol c model ji et al 2017 but higher than that of the dgaoni 0 28 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 dpaoni 0 27 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a dgaona 0 13 mol n mol c wang et al 2015 and dpaona 0 16 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a models this indicates that most no3 n was first reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and no2 n acted as an electron donor for endogenous denitrification via dpaoni and dgaoni however the δno3 n δgly value 0 36 mol n mol c was slightly higher than that of dgaoni 0 27 mol n mol c model wang et al 2015 and considerably lower than that of dpaoni model 0 75 mol n mol c wang et al 2016a suggesting that both dpaoni and dgaoni contributed to n removal with the contribution of dgaoni being higher these results illustrated that most no3 n was reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and then removed through endogenous denitrification by dgaoni the n and p removal mechanisms in both the systems at 141 days and 233 days respectively were similar to those at 89 days figs s3 s4 the possible n and p removal pathways are shown in figs 3c 3d the mechanism of pollutant removal in the two reactors could be suggested as follows i in cm ifas system dpaos were the major contributor to p release in the anaerobic stage and during phas synthesis and gly decomposition all paos dpaos gaos and dgaos contributed p was primarily removed via dpaos in the aerobic stage most of the no3 n was removed as a direct electron donor by dpaos ii in cf ifas system dpaos were the major contributors to p release in anaerobic stage and only a small amount of phas was stored by dpaos and paos compared with that by gaos and dgaos p removal was achieved by the combined activity of paos and dpaos in the aerobic stage in the anoxic stage most no3 n was reduced to no2 n by dgaona ni and then removed through endogenous denitrification by dgaoni 3 3 microbial community analysis 3 3 1 microbial community diversity the illumina sequencing data were rarefied to the same sequencing depth of 27 371 sequences per sample from the rarefaction curves fig s5 the 27 371 sequences could generally represent the bacterial diversity of each sample alpha diversity analysis revealed higher chao1 richness in cf ifas than in cm ifas fig s6b similarly the shannon evenness indices fig s6a that denote the abundance and uniformity of bacterial communities were higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas therefore species diversity was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the pca revealed distinct difference among different systems fig s6c furthermore multivariate analyses including adonis and anosim fig s6d revealed significant differences between the cm ifas and cf ifas systems adonis f 27 463 p 0 002 anosim r 0 856 p 0 002 additionally there were 314 otus in both systems fig s7a and the percentage of exclusive otus in cf ifas and cm ifas ranged from 1 56 to 4 36 and 0 53 2 03 respectively demonstrating that the abundance of dominant microorganisms within the two systems was not high 3 3 2 microbial community taxonomic and functional compositions at the phylum level proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in both reactors fig s7b with relative abundances of 43 09 55 34 in cm ifas and 37 66 43 57 in cf ifas bacteroidota was the second most abundant phylum in both reactors followed by acidobacteriota in cm ifas and actinobacteriota in cf ifas the heatmap fig s7c clustering using the top 30 genera showed four distinct clusters of dominant genera cluster 1 had only one genus acinetobacter more predominant in cmw89d average 21 52 cmm89d average 6 69 and cfw89d average 1 78 cluster 2 contained candidatus competibacter a dgao and norank f saprospiraceae which play important roles in endogenous denitrification and aerobic denitrification respectively wang et al 2020 most genera in cf ifas were concentrated in cluster 3 12 genera however the majority of the bacteria in cm ifas was primarily found in cluster 4 15 genera specifically candidatus competibacter 12 07 23 04 was the most abundant genus in cf ifas followed by norank f saprospiraceae 6 72 9 49 norank f phos he36 3 00 4 42 dokdonella 2 74 3 79 and olb8 2 28 3 92 dechloromonas 5 97 11 18 was the most abundant genus in cm ifas and other genera included zoogloea 2 28 15 38 candidatus accumulibacter 0 16 8 70 sulfuritalea averaged 2 89 3 97 and olb8 1 77 6 15 dechloromonas and candidatus accumulibacter are typical dpaos that can use no3 n or no2 n as electron acceptors for denitrifying p removal wang et al 2022 additionally all samples were divided into two categories that is genera of samples in cm ifas clustered together whereas those of cf ifas clustered as a separate group suggesting a difference in the species composition of cm ifas and cf ifas however some samples sampled at different times from the same reactor were clustered at the same branches indicating that the impact of influent nh4 n concentration was considerably less than that of the carriers based on the ncbi database the dynamic changes in potential functional bacteria that are crucial to n and p removal were evaluated in cm ifas and cf ifas systems fig 4 a twenty six potential functional species were selected to distinguish the functional divergence between the two systems including two ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob one nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob fifteen denitrifiers two paos four dpaos and one dgao as shown in fig 4a aob was more abundant in cm ifas than in cf ifas which contradicted the high nh4 n removal efficiency of cf ifas in the whole process this could be attributed to the presence of other unidentified bacteria with nitrification functions a welch s t test on the 26 potential functional species on biofilm and suspended flocs in both systems revealed a significant difference between candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas figs 4b 4c candidatus competibacter was dominant present in cf ifas whereas dechloromonas was dominant in cm ifas the dpaos content in cm ifas was higher than that of paos and dgao contents indicating that p and n removals were driven by dpaos the paos content in cf ifas was slightly lower than dpaos contents and dgao content was significantly higher than that of dpaos implying that p and n removals resulted from the combined action of dpaos and paos with a greater contribution from dpaos endogenous denitrification was primarily driven by dgaos in cf ifas these results are consistent with the analysis results of typical cycles 3 3 3 microbial community assembly bacterial diversity and composition differed between the two systems therefore the forces involved in determining bacterial diversity and composition were further investigated by ncm if neutral stochastic processes dominate ncm predictions would correspond with experimental data lu et al 2022 however as shown in fig 5 and table s7 only a very few otus in the biofilm and suspended flocs of the two systems matched the expected values and most taxa occurred more frequently higher enrichment than their expected relative abundances this suggests that deterministic selection may dominate the microbial community assembly in both systems the r2 value of biofilm in both reactors was smaller than that of suspended flocs indicating that the deterministic selection accounts for a larger proportion in the microbial assembly process on biofilm r2 of biofilm in cf ifas was lower than that in cm ifas further illustrating that cf played an important role in microbial deterministic selection 3 3 4 keystone taxa and species interactions similar to the alpha diversity analysis otu level co occurrence networks in cf ifas were considerably more complex than those in cm ifas figs 6 a 6b with more nodes and links and higher average degree avg k and modularity values table s8 the r 2 of power law in cm ifas 0 743 and cf ifas 0 719 showed that the network topology followed the power law distribution the topological features of both networks such as the average clustering coefficient avg cc harmonic geodesic distance hd transitivity trans and modularity were apparently higher than those of the corresponding random networks table s9 moreover the small world coefficients σ of both networks were higher than 1 table s9 confirming small world and modular structure of the networks xu et al 2021 specifically as the cf ifas system network had higher average connectivity avg k higher avg cc and shorter hd species interactions in cf ifas were more intensive than that in cm ifas additionally there were 76 and 110 modules in cm ifas and cf ifas network with a modularity of 0 852 and 0 869 respectively microorganisms in the same module may tend to have similar ecological niches eiler et al 2012 based on the within module connectivity zi among module connectivity pi plot all nodes could be classified into four categories namely peripherals zi 2 5 pi 0 62 module zi 2 5 pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 zeng et al 2021 in cm ifas system three module hubs and one connectors were detected in the constructed network fig 6c otu14 was derived from the genus pedobacter 0 004 0 08 which plays an important role in nitrification x zuo et al 2020 otu 178 belonged to the genus norank f anaerolineaceae 0 16 0 88 one of the bacteria that can determine nitrification x zuo et al 2020 and otu 2218 belonged to the genus candidatus accumulibacter 0 16 8 70 a kind of p removing bacteria otu362 was derived from the genus norank f norank o norank c tk10 0 003 0 015 which may play an essential role in denitrification xing et al 2020 for cf ifas system there were five keystone species four model hubs otus249 1280 2313 and 2375 and one connector otu1984 fig 6d otu249 was from the genus norank f norank o norank c om190 0 18 0 82 which belonged to om190 class having a vital role in the c cycle c chen et al 2021a otu1280 belonged to genus sm1a02 0 28 0 58 which has been found in many activated sludge system with good nitrifying performance chu et al 2015 otu 2313 was from the genus defluviicoccus 0 24 0 62 which is a gao chen et al 2021b otu2375 was derived from the genus norank f saprospiraceae 6 72 9 49 which may play an important role in aerobic denitrification wang et al 2020 as the only connector otu1984 belonged to the genus norank f rhodocyclaceae 0 57 1 00 which is a bacterium with denitrification function the vital role of these keystone species in the network can also be demonstrated by their high degree and betweenness text s1 tables s10 s11 the relative abundance of the genera in which most keystone species were found was not high for example sm1a02 had a relative abundance between 0 28 and 0 58 whereas the genus norank f saprospiraceae in which otu2375 was found had a relatively high abundance 6 72 9 49 previous studies have revealed that low abundance species are as important or more important than abundant species in maintaining the stability of microbial networks shi et al 2016 lu et al 2022 consistent with the results in this study unlike those found in cm ifas four keystone species five keystone species were found in cf ifas figs 6c 6d this is because the cf ifas system increased bacterial diversity by creating niche differentiation which enriched keystone species closely related to nutrient removal and n p and c transformation tables 2 3 iannacone et al 2020 x zuo et al 2020 tian et al 2022 the above results indicated that different keystone species were formed within the reactors using different carriers 3 3 5 quantification of functional genes the genes bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs nirk and 16s rrna genes of gaos and paos which are associated with ammonia oxidation nitrate nitrite reductase endogenious denitrificaton and phosphorus removal were all detected in both biofilm and suspended flocs of cm ifas and cf ifas the absolute abundance of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa and the nitrate nitrite reductase narg napa nirs nirk of each phase in cf ifas were higher than those in cm ifas this result corresponds with the higher nitrogen removal efficiencies of cf ifas however the relative abundance of aob in cf ifas was slightly lower than that in cm ifas and the absolute abundance of bacterial amoa was higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas the reason could be that there were bacteria containing genes with ammonia oxidation functions that are not currently identified and thus they would not be identified via high throughput sequencing but would be included when the absolute gene content is tested in addition the total absolute contents of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk of cf 1 94 109 2 84 109 copies g dry weight were marginally higher than those of cm 1 23 109 2 64 109 copies g dry weight this shows that cf is more conducive to the formation of functional genes the abundance of 16s rrna total bacteria in biofilm and suspended flocs varied within 9 10 orders of magnitude with no significant difference between the two reactors figs 7 a 7b notably 16s rrna gene of gaos exhibited relatively higher abundance in cf ifas 1 41 109 5 40 109 copies g dry weight than in cm ifas however 16s rrna gene of paos was relative lower in cf ifas which further demonstrated that dgaos played an important role in cf ifas 3 3 6 functional prediction the faprotax and tax4fun were employed to predict the functions of the identified microbial community fig s8 shows that relatively strong nitrate nitrite n respiration nitric oxide nitrate nitrite denitrification and nitrate reduction were observed in cf ifas than in cm ifas meanwhile the n cycle activity was low in cm ifas consistent with the n removal results observed in cf ifas the n cycle activity on the biofilm was slightly stronger than that of the suspended flocs at the same phase which may be owing to the increased growth of denitrifying bacteria caused by the formation of anoxic areas in cf therefore more denitrifying bacteria are speculated in the anoxic zone inside cf we will continue to conduct comprehensive analysis on the structure of microbial communities at different locations in cf in the future studies the abundance of functional genes and enzymes was classified and quantified based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database figs 7c 7d the abundance of the nitrification gene hao both on biofilm and suspended flocs was considerably higher in cf ifas than in cm ifas however the percentage of amoabc was similar corroborating the enhanced nh4 n removal capacity of cf ifas this also demonstrates the existence of some unidentified microorganisms with nitrification functions in cf ifas meanwhile majority of the denitrification genes such as narp narl napa nord and norq were more abundant in cf ifas than in cm ifas at the same phase these results are similar to the faprotax results in which enhanced n removal efficiency was observed in cf ifas 4 conclusions overall the results show that cf can improve the sndpr performance in the ifas system through the formation of different microecological environments nitrate was primarily removed by dgao driven endogenous denitrification in the cf ifas and by dpaos in the cm ifas in both reactors the microbial community assembly was driven by deterministic rather than stochastic factors the co occurrence network in the cf ifas was more complex and the types and numbers of keystone species differed between the two reactors with five genera in the cf ifas norank f norank o norank c om190 sm1a02 defluviicoccus norank f saprospiraceae and norank f rhodocyclaceae and only four in the cm ifas pedobacter norank f anaerolineaceae candidatus accumulibacter and norank f norank o norank c tk10 the absolute content of bacterial amoa archaeal amoa narg napa nirs and nirk genes were higher in the cf ifas than in the cm ifas and the n cycle activity was also stronger in cf ifas we conclude that the special structure of the cf favors sndpr performance by shaping the microbial community through the formation of more anoxic zones these findings may provide a theoretical

15441,media amendment has been more and more frequently tested in stormwater bioretention systems for enhanced runoff pollutant treatment however few studies systematically evaluated the amended system over a long time span which hindered the further optimization of the proposed amended media in this study biochar pyrite system pb conventional sand system sb and biochar woodchip system wb were established and operated for 26 months media amendment greatly enhanced the dissolved nutrient removal the highest total dissolved nitrogen removal in pb and wb were 65 6 3 6 and 68 2 2 5 respectively compared with pb wb could maintain excellent nitrogen removal under long term operation in contrast pb demonstrated stable and more effective total dissolved phosphorus removal during all stages 73 1 3 1 80 3 4 1 a high content of phosphorus and organic matter was leached in wb especially at initial operation while the initial pollutant leaching in pb and sb is much lower about one third of wb microbial and metabolic function analysis indicated that the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and stable media amendment enhanced microbial diversity and the relative abundance of functional genera related to nitrogen nitrospira thauera denitratisoma etc sulfur thiobacillus geobacter desulfovibrio etc and carbon cycles cellulomonas saccharimonadales and sbr1031 etc which well explained the enhanced pollutant removal and by product leaching in different systems overall the current study indicates that although media amendment is conducive to enhanced dissolved nutrient removal in bioretention systems it can hardly maintain both stability and efficiency from initial set up to long term operation in practical application catchment characteristics prioritized pollutants meteorological factors etc should all be considered before choosing suitable amended media and its design factors thereby maximising the stability and efficiency of the bioretention system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater runoff green infrastructure stormwater biofilter stormwater management low impact development rain garden data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban stormwater runoff was recognised as the major contributor to the deteriorated water quality in urban waterways excessive nutrients carried by urban runoff caused severe environmental problems such as hypoxia eutrophication and aquatic dead zone bratieres et al 2008 kong et al 2021a to manage excessive stormwater and decrease concomitant financial losses advanced stormwater control measures have been more and more used worldwide tirpak et al 2021 bioretention also known as stormwater biofilter or rain garden is one of the most popular stormwater control measures which were proved to be effective in runoff volumes and particulate pollutant control and has been used worldwide for decades davis et al 2009 however a vast amount of studies indicated that the conventional sand soil based bioretention systems are incapable of dissolved pollutant removal especially for dissolved nutrients for instance huge fluctuations in total nitrogen tn removal from 630 and 46 were reported in the previous research bratieres et al 2008 lopez ponnada et al 2020 nitrate leaching was also frequently found in conventional bioretention systems due to the lack of electron donors and low hydraulic retention times li and davis 2014 zinger et al 2013 to improve the dissolved nutrients removal performance amended measures such as internal water storage zone iwsz intensified plant amended media etc have been introduced into the bioretention system tirpak et al 2021 xu et al 2020 as an indispensable part of bioretention the media has attracted much attention since it can directly influence the pollutant treatment process and greatly enhanced pollutant treatment efficiency xu et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 for example robust total phosphorus tp removal higher than 90 was reported when water treatment residuals were used xu et al 2020 berger et al 2019 observed that biochar amendment can enhance the exhaustion rate of woodchips making the stormwater biofilter achieve 100 nitrate removal at low infiltration rates 19 and 37 mm h our previous studies also developed two types of pyrite based bioretention systems whose removal for tn and tp reached higher than 70 chen et al 2020 kong et al 2021b however the majority of the media amendment studies including our previous studies only focus on the pollutant treatment performance within a short duration almost no studies systematically evaluate the variation of the amended bioretention system performance over a long period willard et al 2017 media amendment can complicate the pollutant treatment process and microbial characteristics in the bioretention system tirpak et al 2021 thus compared with the conventional system amended systems may experience a higher fluctuation in terms of pollutant dynamics from initial set up to long term operation the lack of comprehensive evaluation of performance and its change in different stages may underestimate the potential risks of the amended media and impede its further design optimization and field scale application meanwhile most previous studies only focus on water quality assessment compared to other similar systems such as constructed wetlands and biofilters the knowledge of microbial characteristics in the bioretention system is still limited huang et al 2021 media amendment can alter the media property e g electron donor type microenvironment etc which in turn could influence microbial characteristics associated with the water quality performance of bioretention systems liu et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 those characteristics such as the microbial composition and metabolic function can at minimum partially elucidate the operation mechanism in different bioretention systems which can be useful for further optimization of amended media however the potential link between media amendment and microorganisms in the bioretention system has rarely been well investigated given the knowledge gap three representative bioretention systems i e biochar pyrite system pb conventional sand system sb and biochar woodchip system wb were established and operated for 26 months the current work intends to provide a holistic assessment of the influence of media amendment on pollutant removal and by product generation in bioretention systems from initial set up to long term operation a systematical evaluation of pollutant leaching pollutant treatment performance and process pore water dynamic microbial community and metabolic function was performed based on those results implications refer to the amendment media evaluation and the balance between the efficiency and stability of the bioretention system were given we estimated that the results can extend the knowledge for bioretention design amended media selection and technology development 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention configuration and establishment bioretention cells were established in duplicate using acrylic with 30 cm inner diameter and 120 cm height for all three systems five layers were constructed in each cell from the bottom up namely 5 cm drainage layer with perforated pipe 5 cm transition layer for media washing out prevention 40 cm submerged zone 45 cm vadose zone 5 cm cobblestone protection layer and 20 cm ponding zone fig 1 the vadose zone of sb contained 92 sand 3 moss peat and 5 sandy loam by volume and the vadose zone of pb and wb consisted of 77 sand 3 moss peat and 20 biochar by volume the submerged zone of sb was filled with 100 sand and the submerged zone of pb and wb were modified with 10 pyrite 2 oyster shell and 10 woodchip by volume respectively the outflow pipe was elevated for 45 cm to create an iwsz for enhanced denitrification detailed information on media sources media properties and bioretention cell design parameters is listed in table s1 other more detailed bioretention set up processes can be found in kong et al 2021b 2 2 reactor operation and water sampling 2 2 1 simulated rainfall events the simulated rainfall volume was calculated as v f φ h where the f 1 413 m2 indicates the simulated catchment area which is twenty times the reactor surface area φ 0 7 is the runoff coefficient and h is the precipitation depth during all experiments except the first initial leaching experiment describe later h was set as 25 mm which lead to a total of 24 7 l of simulated stormwater tap water was used for simulated stormwater preparation before each experiment 180 l of tap water was added into a pe barrel 200 l of volume for more than 24 h to decrease the residual chlorine stormwater was applied to each reactor for 2 h at a constant flow rate 206 1 ml min using peristaltic pumps and 15 sprinkler heads uniformly the antecedent dry duration add between each event was 72 h the glossary of stormwater related terms can be found in text s1 2 2 2 initial leaching experiments initial leaching experiments were conducted for the first two months the first leaching experiment was conducted one day after reactor set up to stabilize media during this experiment tap water was applied at 80 ml min for 24 h 115 2 l to stabilize microorganisms and evaluate the pollutant leaching level in different systems another 15 leaching experiments were conducted a calibrated bucket was used to receive the outflow for each reactor the outflow water was mixed manually when no obvious outflow was found which is generally about 0 5 1 5 h after each experiment and one 500 ml mixed water sample was collected for analysis 2 2 3 pollutant removal experiments to study the pollutant removal performance of different systems three stages namely short term operation 4 6 months mid term operation 15 17 months and long term operation 24 26 months were set the period between each stage aims either for the ageing of the bioretention system or other mechanism experiments which have been published in kong et al 2021b detailed schedule in table s2 the total rainfall depth during 26 months of operation was approximately 6000 mm which is about 9 to 10 years of mean annual precipitation in china since the bioretention systems usually needed to be operated in natural conditions for years to decades the three stages divided by the current study can well represent the performance of the bioretention system s short term mid term and long term operation during those three stages glycine c2h5no2 kno3 nh4cl kh2po4 and ch3coona 3h2o were added to dechlorinated tap water to simulate dissolved organic nitrogen don nitrate no 3 n ammonium nh 4 n phosphate po 4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod in stormwater runoff and they were 3 3 2 0 5 and 18 2 mg l respectively the nutrient concentration was chosen at a relatively high level based on runoff characteristics review and our previous field runoff monitoring study kayhanian et al 2012 kong et al 2021a all three stages were operated in the same frame i e 10 routine experiments plus 2 intensive experiments and 2 iwsz pore water sampling experiments for routine experiments the outflow was collected in the same way as the initial leaching experiment for intensive experiments outflow water was sampled six times for each reactor during each experiment when outflow volumes were 3 5 7 10 5 21l the intensive experiments aim to study the detailed variation of the pollutant removal process as for pore water sampling experiments pore water in the iwsz was collected during 3 d add to study the pollutant variation in the iwsz one 50 ml of water sample was collected in sample port a from each reactor at 0 1 3 7 19 31 55 and 72 h after the last rainfall event finished fig 1 2 3 media sampling media were sampled after the mid term operation stage 17 months for high throughput sequencing since the bioretention system was generally operated under varied add which might slightly influence the microbial community a modified sampling scheme that sampled media four times at different add 3 6 10 20 d was used in this study compared with our previous study kong et al 2021a the samples collected from the surface and ports 1 3 were mixed to represent the vadose zone the samples collected from ports 4 7 were mixed to represent the iwsz fig 1 all mixed samples were frozen immediately 80 c until analysis 2 4 water sample characterization and analysis anions i e no 3 n o 2 and so 4 2 were tested using ion chromatography dionex ics 600 usa fetotal total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp n h 4 n and cod were tested by standard methods with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa uv254 absorbance was used as a surrogate measurement for dissolved organic matter berger et al 2019 measured by the dr6000 as well if the measured result was below the detection limits a value of 1 2 of the detection limit was used for analysis don was acquired by subtracting the sum of n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n from tdn if the don was below zero it was recorded as zero 2 5 high throughput sequencing the total genomic dna of each sample was extracted by magpure media dna lq kit magen the dna concentration was quantified using a nanodrop uv vis spectrophotometer thermo nc2000 usa followed by the dna quality check with 1 20 agarose gel electrophoresis primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes then sequencing was conducted by personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china on an illumina miseq platform sequencing data were processed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime2 v2019 4 pipeline with dada2 to generate amplicon sequence variants asvs other detailed procedures for data processing can be found in kong et al 2021b 2 6 data analysis anova analysis with a p value threshold of 0 05 was performed by imb spss statistics 25 to evaluate the significant difference in pollutant removal efficiency between different stages for bioinformatics analysis shannon simpson and chao 1 index were calculated to study the alpha diversity kruskal wallis h test was used to test whether adds significantly influence the alpha diversity index nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on bray curtis distance was performed to determine beta diversity between different samples analysis of similarities anosim was employed to assess the statistical differences among the media samples between different adds using bray curtis distance phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 was used to predict metabolic functions of the microbial community in each sample using the kegg orthology database both kruskal wallis h test p 0 05 and anosim r 0 p 0 05 indicate that different media and layers vadose zone and iwsz instead of add greatly influence alpha and beta diversity fig s1 therefore the mean value of quadruple samples different add was calculated for taxonomic composition elucidation 3 result and discussion 3 1 initial pollutant leaching as shown in figs 2 and s2 tp and cod instead of nitrogen were the main leached pollutants in all three groups and their leaching concentration decreased with the operation prolong compared with sb and pb wb demonstrated much higher cumulative tp and cod leaching which reached 512 3 mg and 18 1 g respectively about 2 5 to 3 times higher than the leaching in pb and sb the overall initial leaching in pb was slightly lower than non amended sb these results are expected since previous studies also demonstrated that nutrients and organic matter can be leached from woodchip based bioreactors especially during the initial stages due to the hydrolysis of woodchips lopez ponnada et al 2017 the slight amount of leached tp and cod in pb and sb may derive from biochar and or peat moss in the vadose zone as the batch leaching experiment also indicated that the biochar used in this study is a phosphorus leaching source data not shown as a unique by product of pb fetotal only showed slight leaching during the initial operation the highest leaching took place in the first operation 0 44 0 12 mg l and after 10 simulated events the fetotal was only about 0 1 mg l 3 2 pollutant treatment performance and processes at different stages the don removal in pb and wb kept between 83 9 4 5 and 89 0 6 4 during the three stages while in sb it was only approximately 68 in the short term and mid term stages figs 3 a and 4 a c compared to wb pb showed a significant higher don removal than wb in the short term stage p 0 05 while in the mid term and long term their don removal did not have a significant difference p 0 05 as for n h 4 n all three groups demonstrated a higher n h 4 n removal with the operation prolonged pb showed the best n h 4 n removal which reached about 98 in the mid term and long term operation fig 3b however a 0 6 0 7 mg l n h 4 n was constantly detected in the outflow of pb in the short term operation fig 4d compared with pb the n h 4 n removal in wb was slightly lower and slight amounts of n h 4 n persisted in the former 17 5 l outflow of wb fig 4f in comparison the n h 4 n removal in sb was always the lowest with the increase of outflow the n h 4 n concentration in the outflow of sb increased at all stages fig 4e adsorption and biotransformation are the two most important processes for don and n h 4 n removal in bioretention system li and davis 2014 when the bioretention system was aged the matured microbe can transform don and n h 4 n into n o x n by ammonification and nitrification process effectively however during the initial operation the autotroph nitrifier may still be immature due to its low growth rate and competitive disadvantage with heterotrophs xia et al 2005 which may lead to the accumulation of n h 4 n in the media and low n h 4 n treatment efficiency meanwhile don and n h 4 n can also be generated by nitrogen binding material such as organic matter due to microbial mediated hydrolysis and decomposition lopez ponnada et al 2017 in comparison amendments with high ion exchange ability such as biochar can greatly increase the don and n h 4 n removal the n o x n removal in all systems dropped under long term operation thereinto wb demonstrated the best n o x n removal in the short term stage 47 1 9 0 but it reduced to 1 1 9 0 in the long term stage pb and sb even showed negative n o x n removal in the long term stage and they were 29 1 11 6 and 60 0 15 7 respectively fig 3c the enhanced n o x n removal in pb and wb can be attributed to the extra electron donor provided by pyrite and organic matter compared with pyrite woodchip apparently facilitates more effective denitrification however an obvious n o x n breakthrough after 14 l was found for all groups especially under long term operation stages fig 4g i nitrate breakthrough is a ubiquitous question in the bioretention system li and davis 2014 liu et al 2021 stormwater can flush the nitrate generated by nitrification through the iwsz quickly in rainfall events which makes iwsz fail to treat those parts of nitrate although several previous studies demonstrated denitrification can take place in the micro anoxic site in the vadose zone kong et al 2021b tian et al 2019 waller et al 2018 the in situ denitrification is often ineffective due to the do susceptibility of the vadose zone the long term operation further leads to the consumption of the bioavailable organic matter in the vadose zone and causes reduced in situ denitrification discuss later overall all three groups showed high removal of tdn in the short term and mid term stages but their efficiency dropped in the long term stage the highest tdn removal in pb sb and wb reached 65 6 3 6 36 9 4 5 and 68 2 2 5 respectively fig 3d pb and wb did not have a significant difference in terms of tdn removal in the short term stage p 0 05 but wb demonstrated significant higher tdn removal in the mid term and long term stages p 0 05 compared with pb wb exhibited a more sustainable nitrogen removal ability in terms of tdp its removal in pb only decreased slightly from short term 80 3 4 1 to long term 73 1 3 1 in comparison tdp removal in sb decreased moderately during 26 months from 45 2 4 1 to 17 9 8 2 intriguingly the tdp removal in wb increased slightly from 17 2 7 8 in the short term stage to approximately 35 in the mid term and long term stages fig 3e the possible reason for the higher tdp removal in wb may be the mitigation of phosphorus leaching from woodchip which was proved by the phosphorus profile that the initial tdp concentration first 17 5 l in wb decreased during the mid term and long term operation fig 5 c generally phosphorus was removed by media adsorption and precipitation in bioretention system due to the tendency towards adsorption equilibrium phosphorus removal in the bioretention system will degrade under long term operation li and davis 2016 therefore using fe al binding media e g pyrite instead of potential phosphorus leaching source e g woodchip can facilitate more effective and sustainable phosphorous removal li and davis 2016 finally for uv254 a relative stable uv254 absorbance was found in pb and wb during all stages fig 3f wb exhibited much higher uv254 absorbance than pb which is also in accordance with their media characteristics as for sb an obviously higher uv254 was found in the mid term and long term operation fig 3f which indicates that sb leached more organic matter after ageing interestingly the uv254 in sb met its peak at 17 5 l outflow during long term operation stages instead of maintaining a constantly increasing trend like the short term and mid term operation fig 5e we estimated the potential reason may be the move down of the organic matter decomposition location organic matter in the vadose zone can be decomposed by aerobic microbial processes after the long term operation the loss of biodegradable organic matter in the upper layer of sb s vadose zone makes more do can penetrate the mid or lower layer of the vadose zone and facilitate the organic matter decomposition there since the rainfall volume was kept constant during the current study the moving down of the organic matter generation location may cause more organic matter to be flushed out of the bioretention system instead of to its iwsz these results were further proved by the drop of the initial uv254 in the iwsz of each system during long term operation fig s3d f consequently the consumption of the bioavailable organic matter may further lead to the decrease of the in situ denitrification in the vadose zone as indicated by higher nitrate breakthrough 3 3 pore water pollutant variation in iwsz under different operation stages the iwsz of all three groups demonstrated don removal ability irrespective of operation stages fig 6 a c compared with sb the initial 0 h don concentration in pb and wb was much lower the results indirectly reflect that more don was adsorbed or biodegraded before entering the iwsz i e at the vadose zone in pb and wb and biochar addition greatly enhanced don removal performance similarly pb and wb showed a much lower initial n h 4 n than sb fig 6d f however due to the immature nitrification in the vadose zone of pb and wb in the short term stage a slight amount of n h 4 n still entered their iwsz the high water holding capacity of the biochar well protected the iwsz from do influence and inhibited nitrification in iwsz making n h 4 n stably existed during 3 d add for wb n h 4 n can even be generated by woodchip hydrolysis and result in an increasing n h 4 n profile fig 6f in comparison the n h 4 n in the iwsz of sb showed a decreasing trend with the add prolonged especially during long term operation the result indirectly exhibits that sand is not as effective as biochar for do resistance the long term operation further consumes the organic matter in sb s vadose zone and results in a decrease in do resistance as for n o x n both pb and sb showed a poorer removal with the operation prolonged while for wb stable and very effective denitrification was maintained through 26 months fig 6g i the decline of denitrification in iwsz of sb can be attributed to two reasons 1 more organic matter was flushed out from the systems instead of into iwsz as discussed in section 3 2 and 2 poor anoxic condition is not suitable for the effective denitrification similarly the lower performance in pb can also be caused by the lower organic matter flushed from the vadose zone fig s3d besides the degradation of pyrite based autotrophic denitrification may also be one reason previous studies indicate that the intermediate product e g iron hydro oxide generation might cover the pyrite surface and influence denitrification hu et al 2020 overall for tdn the iwsz of wb kept the best tdn removal performance during all three stages followed by pb while the iwsz of sb showed the poorest nitrogen removal ability fig 6j l as for tdp with the add prolonged the tdp in the iwsz of pb and sb kept stable but increased in wb fig s3a c this result exhibit that the in situ phosphorus generation by woodchip exists persistently nevertheless compared with the short term operation the initial tdp in wb was much lower in the long term stage which indirectly demonstrates that more phosphorus was removed by the vadose zone of wb after ageing we anticipated that drying and wetting cycles may labilize and flush out the phosphorus in biochar which free the adsorption site of the biochar and increase the phosphorus removal ability during long term operation accordingly the adsorption test also showed the leached biochar used in this study has acceptable phosphate adsorption ability langmuir q m a x 328 567 mg kg kong et al 2021b 3 4 microbial community and metabolic function 3 4 1 alpha diversity the rarefaction curves demonstrated that the sequencing depth was adequate to describe the microbial communities fig s4 as for alpha diversity in the vadose zone biochar addition increased shannon simpson and chao 1 indexes which indicates biochar addition increased both microbial richness and diversity in the iwsz both pyrite and woodchip amendment increased all indexes than sand table s3 compared with the similar system constructed wetland the richness and diversity tested in this study were much higher for example the chao 1 and shannon index in pb2 were 2666 23 309 09 and 7 48 0 33 respectively much higher than the corresponding values in long term operated pyrite based constructed wetlands 481 02 1277 65 and 2 81 5 18 si et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the fluctuating conditions e g unstable drying and wetting cycle etc may shape the more complicated microbial community in the bioretention system 3 4 2 beta diversity and taxonomic composition as for beta diversity nmds analysis indicates that samples from different media amendments and layers i e the vadose zone and the iwsz showed marked differences from each other both biochar and woodchip addition greatly changed the microbial community composition while pyrite addition only slightly shaped the microbial community fig 7 a to further identify the functional microorganism and explain the different biological processes in these different systems the taxonomic diversity was analyzed at the phylum level proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance 45 4 59 2 followed by actinobacteria 5 7 39 2 and chloroflexi 2 7 20 1 fig s5 all the dominant phyla have been frequently detected in bioretention systems or constructed wetlands xu et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 microbes belonging to actinobacteria could form spores to resist severe environments xu et al 2021 the higher proportion of it in the iwsz of sb may indicate that the conditions there were harsher than in other amended groups as for the genus level fig 7b and table s4 in the vadose zone thauera 5 0 17 4 azoarcus 0 7 6 2 and pseudomonas 1 8 2 3 showed high relative abundance in all systems several species belonging to those genera were reported to be denitrifiers qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 other potential denitrifiers such as pedomicrobium 1 6 3 5 pseudolabrys 0 7 1 5 and haliangium 0 7 1 1 were also detected jia et al 2021 levesque et al 2020 besides nitrifiers such as nitrosomonas 0 0 0 5 nitrospira 0 7 1 8 and aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria like genera belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae such as mnd1 0 3 1 2 ellin6067 0 1 0 9 and is 44 0 5 1 0 li et al 2020b xia et al 2005 were also detected in the vadose zone compared with sb biochar addition increased the relative abundance of those potential nitrifiers which can be attributed to the increase of ammonium adsorption by biochar leads to a favourable condition for nitrifier proliferation meanwhile all three system s vadose zone also showed a high abundance of heterotrophic genera such as ramlibacter 0 1 1 3 sbr1031 4 0 7 4 and a4b 4 6 8 4 deng et al 2021 xia et al 2016 which may be caused by the peat moss addition as for the iwsz pyrite addition enhanced the relative abundance of potential autotrophic and heterotopic denitrifiers such as thauera 2 2 thiobacillus 1 5 and bacillus 1 2 si et al 2021 xu et al 2021 which indicates the denitrification in the iwsz of pb can be ascribed to mixotrophic denitrification meanwhile the common pyrite aerobic oxidation genera such as acidithiobacillus were not found in pb2 which also fit the limited fetotal and so 4 2 generation in pb fig s6 in comparison woodchip facilitated more potential heterotrophic denitrifiers such as bacillus 4 3 bradyrhizobium 1 0 and denitratisoma table s4 1 2 jia et al 2021 liu et al 2021 other heterotrophic bacteria related to organic matter decomposition and digestion such as cellulomonas table s4 0 7 saccharimonadales 1 1 li et al 2020a wei et al 2018 and genera of anaerolineae e g sbr1031 8 23 a4b 1 33 and longilinea table s4 0 44 chen et al 2021 xia et al 2016 were also detected the woodchip layer also showed a high relative abundance of paenibacillus 1 45 which were often linked to phosphate solubilization grady et al 2016 the taxonomic composition of iwsz of wb well explained the enhanced denitrification and elevated nh 4 n organic matter and tdp in wb interestingly woodchip addition also increased the relative abundance of thiobacillus 1 1 and several other genera related to sulfur cycling e g sulfurisoma sulfuritalea geobacter and desulfovibrio table s4 qiu et al 2020 the results also agree with the sulfate reduction in wb detected in our previous work at prolonged add kong et al 2021b the sulfate reduction process can lead to h2s generation during prolonged add lopez ponnada et al 2017 which may induce poor sensory outflow and potentially threaten human health besides a low relative abundance of nitrospira 0 4 and nitrosomonas table s4 0 1 were detected in the iwsz of sb while their relative abundance in the iwsz of pb and wb was very low or even undetected this result also matches the observed nitrification in the sb s iwsz 3 4 3 metabolic function to further elucidate the metabolic function of the microbial community in the bioretention system the picrust2 analysis was conducted since very limited information about picrust picrust2 analysis was reported in previous bioretention studies studies of sulfur based denitrification qiu et al 2020 sulfidogenic granular sludge biswal et al 2020 and intermittent aeration constructed wetland li et al 2021 were selected as representatives and compared with this study a total of 200 predicted functions were identified sequences associated with the functions involved in metabolism showed the highest proportion 80 6 83 3 followed by genetic information processing 9 5 11 5 cellular processes 3 8 4 9 and environmental information processing 2 2 2 6 for all groups fig 7c compared with the above mentioned studies the relative proportion of the metabolism in their study was lower about 40 60 but the relative proportion of environmental information processing in their study was higher approximately 10 20 although a high proportion of functions involved in metabolism was found energy metabolism which was deemed as one of the three most frequently detected high proportion items in the metabolism category the other two are carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism li et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 did not show a high relative abundance in all samples 4 7 5 3 nitrogen metabolism which covered important nitrogen removal processes e g nitrification denitrification etc is also included in this category unlike those reference studies where dominant genera were enriched for enhanced pollutant removal or transformation at controlled conditions the varied stormwater conditions and low pollutant level in stormwater runoff determine that most of the metabolic activity in the bioretention system should be related to microbial survival instead of nutrient removal which potentially explained the low proportion of energy metabolism but the high proportion of other metabolism categories 3 4 4 the relationship between media amendment and microbial community based on the microbial characteristics it can be found that the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and versatile the complicated microbial community is beneficial for the robustness of the bioretention system under complicated natural conditions however the complicated conditions may also induce a low relative abundance of key microbes for pollutant removal suitable media amendment can increase microbial diversity and the relative abundance of key microbes by providing substrates or and a suitable physicochemical environment which are conducive to enhanced pollutant treatment nevertheless some of the microbes belonging to the versatile microbial community after media amendment can also lead to by product generation problems in practical application complicated natural conditions and inconsistent design construction standards may shape the inconsistent microbial community than in lab experiments problems such as the lack of functional microbes and or enrichment of the unwanted microbes can be incurred making the amended system become a pollutant source instead of a treatment facility more studies are needed to focus on microbial related processes from lab scale to field scale and between different operating stages climate conditions amendments etc 3 5 implication for stormwater bioretention 3 5 1 the amended bioretention system should be evaluated at a more dynamic pattern the important nitrogen and phosphorus treatment processes in the bioretention system can be impacted by adsorption saturation immature functional microbes substrate consumption etc from short term to long term operation which leads to the huge fluctuation of the dissolved nutrient treatment performance compared with conventional bioretention systems the influence of different operation stages on the amended system can be more drastic since the amendment greatly complicate the biochemical processes for instance unstable internal media conditions can incur severe pollutant leaching in the amended system during the initial operation significant pollutant treatment efficiency drop down can also be faced by the amended system after the long term operation the short duration evaluation may hard to catch those temporal variations in terms of pollutant treatment and lead to an incomprehensive understanding of the amended system as a result the prediction of the potential risk in the more complicated field application and the further design optimization of the amendment will also be restricted therefore it is meaningful to evaluate the amended bioretention system in a dynamic view 3 5 2 the balance between stability and efficiency in the bioretention system woodchip was frequently used in the iwsz of the bioretention system for enhanced heterotrophic denitrification liu et al 2021 lopez ponnada et al 2020 pyrite was recently considered as one alternative for organic matter for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal in iwsz by our previous studies chen et al 2020 kong et al 2021b based on the long term evaluation of this study it is easy to find that pb is conserved while wb demonstrates more extreme characteristics ideally the amended media should combine both stability and efficiency from initial set up to long term operation however unfortunately this aim is hard to be achieved due to the reasons like drastically changed natural conditions and media ageing etc to our knowledge no study has reported such well rounded technology therefore it is important to evaluate the suitable application scenarios of different amended systems thereby maximising their stability and efficiency local environmental variables such as catchment information pollutant characteristics and meteorological conditions can be the most important factors for extreme amendments like wb their application in highly polluted and frequent rainfall areas can be more appropriate since those conditions can enlarge their high efficiency merits while diminishing the by product generation problems in comparison conserved amendments such as pb may need a longer time to achieve effective pollutant treatment therefore their application in cleaner catchments and low rainfall frequency areas can help them maintain both stability and efficiency media amendments can further be designated for those prioritized pollutants of the receiving ecosystem to enlarge their advantages zinger et al 2013 for example using al fe containing media for phosphorus control while using organic matter amendment for enhanced denitrification it should be noted that the design parameters can also impact the stability and efficiency of the amendment for example excessive filling of pyrite in our previous study generated severe iron and sulfate by product chen et al 2020 larger woodchip size may lead to lower denitrification rate but limit by product generation as well lopez ponnada et al 2017 besides other factors such as local sources available market price and policy can also influence the amended media selection and adoption tirpak et al 2021 therefore the balance between efficiency and stability of novel amendments in field application can be more complicated research about design optimization stormwater management life cycle assessment etc should all be integrated 3 5 3 research limits this study only deals with dissolved nutrients stormwater is more and more being considered as an alternative source of reuse water recently which urged bioretention systems to simultaneously remove multiple pollutants more than nutrients e g emerging pollutants heavy metals bacteria etc tirpak et al 2021 in that case how to balance stability and efficiency is more challenging similar to the impact on nutrients media amendment can pose a potential leaching risk for other pollutants as well for instance improper use of metal binding amendments such as minerals and compost is likely to cause heavy metals leaching hu et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 some types of biochar may also release heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to the improper raw material used liu et al 2018 even for the amended media that are effective for treating multiple pollutants concerns about pollutant adsorption capacity transformation fate biodegradable ability etc should also be evaluated over a long time span whether there exists competition and or synergy effect between different pollutants treatment by amended bioretention system should also be studied in more detail finally although systematic lab scale evaluation is conducive for the amended bioretention system scale up there are still gaps between field and lab scale studies more research that evaluates the microbial characteristics and field performance of the various amendment is also urgently needed 4 conclusion in this study two modified bioretention systems and one conventional sand system were evaluated from the initial set up to 26 months of long term operation specific conclusions are 1 media amendment enhanced the dissolved nutrient removal performance pb demonstrated the highest tdp removal which is 80 3 4 1 while wb showed the highest tdn removal which is 68 1 2 5 in comparison the highest tdp and tdn removal in sb was only 45 2 4 0 and 36 9 4 4 respectively 2 different amendments demonstrate diverse pollutant removal and leaching pattern at different operation stages pb could achieve simultaneous phosphorus and nitrogen removal with limited by product generation however the denitrification efficiency in pb declined during long term operation in contrast wb could maintain effective and sustained nitrogen removal but demonstrate higher organic matter and phosphorus leaching than pb especially during the initial operation stage all three systems showed higher ammonium but low nitrate removal during long term operation 3 the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and stable media amendment enhanced the richness diversity and relative abundance of several key functional microbes for nitrogen sulfur and organic matter cycling which well explained the enhanced dissolved nutrient removal in pb and wb and by product generation in wb 4 media amendment is hard to achieve both stability and efficiency in the bioretention system from initial set up to long term operation nevertheless those two traits can be balanced by choosing suitable design factors and corresponding application scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no potential conflicts of interest with

15441,media amendment has been more and more frequently tested in stormwater bioretention systems for enhanced runoff pollutant treatment however few studies systematically evaluated the amended system over a long time span which hindered the further optimization of the proposed amended media in this study biochar pyrite system pb conventional sand system sb and biochar woodchip system wb were established and operated for 26 months media amendment greatly enhanced the dissolved nutrient removal the highest total dissolved nitrogen removal in pb and wb were 65 6 3 6 and 68 2 2 5 respectively compared with pb wb could maintain excellent nitrogen removal under long term operation in contrast pb demonstrated stable and more effective total dissolved phosphorus removal during all stages 73 1 3 1 80 3 4 1 a high content of phosphorus and organic matter was leached in wb especially at initial operation while the initial pollutant leaching in pb and sb is much lower about one third of wb microbial and metabolic function analysis indicated that the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and stable media amendment enhanced microbial diversity and the relative abundance of functional genera related to nitrogen nitrospira thauera denitratisoma etc sulfur thiobacillus geobacter desulfovibrio etc and carbon cycles cellulomonas saccharimonadales and sbr1031 etc which well explained the enhanced pollutant removal and by product leaching in different systems overall the current study indicates that although media amendment is conducive to enhanced dissolved nutrient removal in bioretention systems it can hardly maintain both stability and efficiency from initial set up to long term operation in practical application catchment characteristics prioritized pollutants meteorological factors etc should all be considered before choosing suitable amended media and its design factors thereby maximising the stability and efficiency of the bioretention system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater runoff green infrastructure stormwater biofilter stormwater management low impact development rain garden data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urban stormwater runoff was recognised as the major contributor to the deteriorated water quality in urban waterways excessive nutrients carried by urban runoff caused severe environmental problems such as hypoxia eutrophication and aquatic dead zone bratieres et al 2008 kong et al 2021a to manage excessive stormwater and decrease concomitant financial losses advanced stormwater control measures have been more and more used worldwide tirpak et al 2021 bioretention also known as stormwater biofilter or rain garden is one of the most popular stormwater control measures which were proved to be effective in runoff volumes and particulate pollutant control and has been used worldwide for decades davis et al 2009 however a vast amount of studies indicated that the conventional sand soil based bioretention systems are incapable of dissolved pollutant removal especially for dissolved nutrients for instance huge fluctuations in total nitrogen tn removal from 630 and 46 were reported in the previous research bratieres et al 2008 lopez ponnada et al 2020 nitrate leaching was also frequently found in conventional bioretention systems due to the lack of electron donors and low hydraulic retention times li and davis 2014 zinger et al 2013 to improve the dissolved nutrients removal performance amended measures such as internal water storage zone iwsz intensified plant amended media etc have been introduced into the bioretention system tirpak et al 2021 xu et al 2020 as an indispensable part of bioretention the media has attracted much attention since it can directly influence the pollutant treatment process and greatly enhanced pollutant treatment efficiency xu et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 for example robust total phosphorus tp removal higher than 90 was reported when water treatment residuals were used xu et al 2020 berger et al 2019 observed that biochar amendment can enhance the exhaustion rate of woodchips making the stormwater biofilter achieve 100 nitrate removal at low infiltration rates 19 and 37 mm h our previous studies also developed two types of pyrite based bioretention systems whose removal for tn and tp reached higher than 70 chen et al 2020 kong et al 2021b however the majority of the media amendment studies including our previous studies only focus on the pollutant treatment performance within a short duration almost no studies systematically evaluate the variation of the amended bioretention system performance over a long period willard et al 2017 media amendment can complicate the pollutant treatment process and microbial characteristics in the bioretention system tirpak et al 2021 thus compared with the conventional system amended systems may experience a higher fluctuation in terms of pollutant dynamics from initial set up to long term operation the lack of comprehensive evaluation of performance and its change in different stages may underestimate the potential risks of the amended media and impede its further design optimization and field scale application meanwhile most previous studies only focus on water quality assessment compared to other similar systems such as constructed wetlands and biofilters the knowledge of microbial characteristics in the bioretention system is still limited huang et al 2021 media amendment can alter the media property e g electron donor type microenvironment etc which in turn could influence microbial characteristics associated with the water quality performance of bioretention systems liu et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 those characteristics such as the microbial composition and metabolic function can at minimum partially elucidate the operation mechanism in different bioretention systems which can be useful for further optimization of amended media however the potential link between media amendment and microorganisms in the bioretention system has rarely been well investigated given the knowledge gap three representative bioretention systems i e biochar pyrite system pb conventional sand system sb and biochar woodchip system wb were established and operated for 26 months the current work intends to provide a holistic assessment of the influence of media amendment on pollutant removal and by product generation in bioretention systems from initial set up to long term operation a systematical evaluation of pollutant leaching pollutant treatment performance and process pore water dynamic microbial community and metabolic function was performed based on those results implications refer to the amendment media evaluation and the balance between the efficiency and stability of the bioretention system were given we estimated that the results can extend the knowledge for bioretention design amended media selection and technology development 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioretention configuration and establishment bioretention cells were established in duplicate using acrylic with 30 cm inner diameter and 120 cm height for all three systems five layers were constructed in each cell from the bottom up namely 5 cm drainage layer with perforated pipe 5 cm transition layer for media washing out prevention 40 cm submerged zone 45 cm vadose zone 5 cm cobblestone protection layer and 20 cm ponding zone fig 1 the vadose zone of sb contained 92 sand 3 moss peat and 5 sandy loam by volume and the vadose zone of pb and wb consisted of 77 sand 3 moss peat and 20 biochar by volume the submerged zone of sb was filled with 100 sand and the submerged zone of pb and wb were modified with 10 pyrite 2 oyster shell and 10 woodchip by volume respectively the outflow pipe was elevated for 45 cm to create an iwsz for enhanced denitrification detailed information on media sources media properties and bioretention cell design parameters is listed in table s1 other more detailed bioretention set up processes can be found in kong et al 2021b 2 2 reactor operation and water sampling 2 2 1 simulated rainfall events the simulated rainfall volume was calculated as v f φ h where the f 1 413 m2 indicates the simulated catchment area which is twenty times the reactor surface area φ 0 7 is the runoff coefficient and h is the precipitation depth during all experiments except the first initial leaching experiment describe later h was set as 25 mm which lead to a total of 24 7 l of simulated stormwater tap water was used for simulated stormwater preparation before each experiment 180 l of tap water was added into a pe barrel 200 l of volume for more than 24 h to decrease the residual chlorine stormwater was applied to each reactor for 2 h at a constant flow rate 206 1 ml min using peristaltic pumps and 15 sprinkler heads uniformly the antecedent dry duration add between each event was 72 h the glossary of stormwater related terms can be found in text s1 2 2 2 initial leaching experiments initial leaching experiments were conducted for the first two months the first leaching experiment was conducted one day after reactor set up to stabilize media during this experiment tap water was applied at 80 ml min for 24 h 115 2 l to stabilize microorganisms and evaluate the pollutant leaching level in different systems another 15 leaching experiments were conducted a calibrated bucket was used to receive the outflow for each reactor the outflow water was mixed manually when no obvious outflow was found which is generally about 0 5 1 5 h after each experiment and one 500 ml mixed water sample was collected for analysis 2 2 3 pollutant removal experiments to study the pollutant removal performance of different systems three stages namely short term operation 4 6 months mid term operation 15 17 months and long term operation 24 26 months were set the period between each stage aims either for the ageing of the bioretention system or other mechanism experiments which have been published in kong et al 2021b detailed schedule in table s2 the total rainfall depth during 26 months of operation was approximately 6000 mm which is about 9 to 10 years of mean annual precipitation in china since the bioretention systems usually needed to be operated in natural conditions for years to decades the three stages divided by the current study can well represent the performance of the bioretention system s short term mid term and long term operation during those three stages glycine c2h5no2 kno3 nh4cl kh2po4 and ch3coona 3h2o were added to dechlorinated tap water to simulate dissolved organic nitrogen don nitrate no 3 n ammonium nh 4 n phosphate po 4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod in stormwater runoff and they were 3 3 2 0 5 and 18 2 mg l respectively the nutrient concentration was chosen at a relatively high level based on runoff characteristics review and our previous field runoff monitoring study kayhanian et al 2012 kong et al 2021a all three stages were operated in the same frame i e 10 routine experiments plus 2 intensive experiments and 2 iwsz pore water sampling experiments for routine experiments the outflow was collected in the same way as the initial leaching experiment for intensive experiments outflow water was sampled six times for each reactor during each experiment when outflow volumes were 3 5 7 10 5 21l the intensive experiments aim to study the detailed variation of the pollutant removal process as for pore water sampling experiments pore water in the iwsz was collected during 3 d add to study the pollutant variation in the iwsz one 50 ml of water sample was collected in sample port a from each reactor at 0 1 3 7 19 31 55 and 72 h after the last rainfall event finished fig 1 2 3 media sampling media were sampled after the mid term operation stage 17 months for high throughput sequencing since the bioretention system was generally operated under varied add which might slightly influence the microbial community a modified sampling scheme that sampled media four times at different add 3 6 10 20 d was used in this study compared with our previous study kong et al 2021a the samples collected from the surface and ports 1 3 were mixed to represent the vadose zone the samples collected from ports 4 7 were mixed to represent the iwsz fig 1 all mixed samples were frozen immediately 80 c until analysis 2 4 water sample characterization and analysis anions i e no 3 n o 2 and so 4 2 were tested using ion chromatography dionex ics 600 usa fetotal total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp n h 4 n and cod were tested by standard methods with a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa uv254 absorbance was used as a surrogate measurement for dissolved organic matter berger et al 2019 measured by the dr6000 as well if the measured result was below the detection limits a value of 1 2 of the detection limit was used for analysis don was acquired by subtracting the sum of n h 4 n n o 2 n and n o 3 n from tdn if the don was below zero it was recorded as zero 2 5 high throughput sequencing the total genomic dna of each sample was extracted by magpure media dna lq kit magen the dna concentration was quantified using a nanodrop uv vis spectrophotometer thermo nc2000 usa followed by the dna quality check with 1 20 agarose gel electrophoresis primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagca and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat were used to amplify the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes then sequencing was conducted by personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china on an illumina miseq platform sequencing data were processed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2 qiime2 v2019 4 pipeline with dada2 to generate amplicon sequence variants asvs other detailed procedures for data processing can be found in kong et al 2021b 2 6 data analysis anova analysis with a p value threshold of 0 05 was performed by imb spss statistics 25 to evaluate the significant difference in pollutant removal efficiency between different stages for bioinformatics analysis shannon simpson and chao 1 index were calculated to study the alpha diversity kruskal wallis h test was used to test whether adds significantly influence the alpha diversity index nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds based on bray curtis distance was performed to determine beta diversity between different samples analysis of similarities anosim was employed to assess the statistical differences among the media samples between different adds using bray curtis distance phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 was used to predict metabolic functions of the microbial community in each sample using the kegg orthology database both kruskal wallis h test p 0 05 and anosim r 0 p 0 05 indicate that different media and layers vadose zone and iwsz instead of add greatly influence alpha and beta diversity fig s1 therefore the mean value of quadruple samples different add was calculated for taxonomic composition elucidation 3 result and discussion 3 1 initial pollutant leaching as shown in figs 2 and s2 tp and cod instead of nitrogen were the main leached pollutants in all three groups and their leaching concentration decreased with the operation prolong compared with sb and pb wb demonstrated much higher cumulative tp and cod leaching which reached 512 3 mg and 18 1 g respectively about 2 5 to 3 times higher than the leaching in pb and sb the overall initial leaching in pb was slightly lower than non amended sb these results are expected since previous studies also demonstrated that nutrients and organic matter can be leached from woodchip based bioreactors especially during the initial stages due to the hydrolysis of woodchips lopez ponnada et al 2017 the slight amount of leached tp and cod in pb and sb may derive from biochar and or peat moss in the vadose zone as the batch leaching experiment also indicated that the biochar used in this study is a phosphorus leaching source data not shown as a unique by product of pb fetotal only showed slight leaching during the initial operation the highest leaching took place in the first operation 0 44 0 12 mg l and after 10 simulated events the fetotal was only about 0 1 mg l 3 2 pollutant treatment performance and processes at different stages the don removal in pb and wb kept between 83 9 4 5 and 89 0 6 4 during the three stages while in sb it was only approximately 68 in the short term and mid term stages figs 3 a and 4 a c compared to wb pb showed a significant higher don removal than wb in the short term stage p 0 05 while in the mid term and long term their don removal did not have a significant difference p 0 05 as for n h 4 n all three groups demonstrated a higher n h 4 n removal with the operation prolonged pb showed the best n h 4 n removal which reached about 98 in the mid term and long term operation fig 3b however a 0 6 0 7 mg l n h 4 n was constantly detected in the outflow of pb in the short term operation fig 4d compared with pb the n h 4 n removal in wb was slightly lower and slight amounts of n h 4 n persisted in the former 17 5 l outflow of wb fig 4f in comparison the n h 4 n removal in sb was always the lowest with the increase of outflow the n h 4 n concentration in the outflow of sb increased at all stages fig 4e adsorption and biotransformation are the two most important processes for don and n h 4 n removal in bioretention system li and davis 2014 when the bioretention system was aged the matured microbe can transform don and n h 4 n into n o x n by ammonification and nitrification process effectively however during the initial operation the autotroph nitrifier may still be immature due to its low growth rate and competitive disadvantage with heterotrophs xia et al 2005 which may lead to the accumulation of n h 4 n in the media and low n h 4 n treatment efficiency meanwhile don and n h 4 n can also be generated by nitrogen binding material such as organic matter due to microbial mediated hydrolysis and decomposition lopez ponnada et al 2017 in comparison amendments with high ion exchange ability such as biochar can greatly increase the don and n h 4 n removal the n o x n removal in all systems dropped under long term operation thereinto wb demonstrated the best n o x n removal in the short term stage 47 1 9 0 but it reduced to 1 1 9 0 in the long term stage pb and sb even showed negative n o x n removal in the long term stage and they were 29 1 11 6 and 60 0 15 7 respectively fig 3c the enhanced n o x n removal in pb and wb can be attributed to the extra electron donor provided by pyrite and organic matter compared with pyrite woodchip apparently facilitates more effective denitrification however an obvious n o x n breakthrough after 14 l was found for all groups especially under long term operation stages fig 4g i nitrate breakthrough is a ubiquitous question in the bioretention system li and davis 2014 liu et al 2021 stormwater can flush the nitrate generated by nitrification through the iwsz quickly in rainfall events which makes iwsz fail to treat those parts of nitrate although several previous studies demonstrated denitrification can take place in the micro anoxic site in the vadose zone kong et al 2021b tian et al 2019 waller et al 2018 the in situ denitrification is often ineffective due to the do susceptibility of the vadose zone the long term operation further leads to the consumption of the bioavailable organic matter in the vadose zone and causes reduced in situ denitrification discuss later overall all three groups showed high removal of tdn in the short term and mid term stages but their efficiency dropped in the long term stage the highest tdn removal in pb sb and wb reached 65 6 3 6 36 9 4 5 and 68 2 2 5 respectively fig 3d pb and wb did not have a significant difference in terms of tdn removal in the short term stage p 0 05 but wb demonstrated significant higher tdn removal in the mid term and long term stages p 0 05 compared with pb wb exhibited a more sustainable nitrogen removal ability in terms of tdp its removal in pb only decreased slightly from short term 80 3 4 1 to long term 73 1 3 1 in comparison tdp removal in sb decreased moderately during 26 months from 45 2 4 1 to 17 9 8 2 intriguingly the tdp removal in wb increased slightly from 17 2 7 8 in the short term stage to approximately 35 in the mid term and long term stages fig 3e the possible reason for the higher tdp removal in wb may be the mitigation of phosphorus leaching from woodchip which was proved by the phosphorus profile that the initial tdp concentration first 17 5 l in wb decreased during the mid term and long term operation fig 5 c generally phosphorus was removed by media adsorption and precipitation in bioretention system due to the tendency towards adsorption equilibrium phosphorus removal in the bioretention system will degrade under long term operation li and davis 2016 therefore using fe al binding media e g pyrite instead of potential phosphorus leaching source e g woodchip can facilitate more effective and sustainable phosphorous removal li and davis 2016 finally for uv254 a relative stable uv254 absorbance was found in pb and wb during all stages fig 3f wb exhibited much higher uv254 absorbance than pb which is also in accordance with their media characteristics as for sb an obviously higher uv254 was found in the mid term and long term operation fig 3f which indicates that sb leached more organic matter after ageing interestingly the uv254 in sb met its peak at 17 5 l outflow during long term operation stages instead of maintaining a constantly increasing trend like the short term and mid term operation fig 5e we estimated the potential reason may be the move down of the organic matter decomposition location organic matter in the vadose zone can be decomposed by aerobic microbial processes after the long term operation the loss of biodegradable organic matter in the upper layer of sb s vadose zone makes more do can penetrate the mid or lower layer of the vadose zone and facilitate the organic matter decomposition there since the rainfall volume was kept constant during the current study the moving down of the organic matter generation location may cause more organic matter to be flushed out of the bioretention system instead of to its iwsz these results were further proved by the drop of the initial uv254 in the iwsz of each system during long term operation fig s3d f consequently the consumption of the bioavailable organic matter may further lead to the decrease of the in situ denitrification in the vadose zone as indicated by higher nitrate breakthrough 3 3 pore water pollutant variation in iwsz under different operation stages the iwsz of all three groups demonstrated don removal ability irrespective of operation stages fig 6 a c compared with sb the initial 0 h don concentration in pb and wb was much lower the results indirectly reflect that more don was adsorbed or biodegraded before entering the iwsz i e at the vadose zone in pb and wb and biochar addition greatly enhanced don removal performance similarly pb and wb showed a much lower initial n h 4 n than sb fig 6d f however due to the immature nitrification in the vadose zone of pb and wb in the short term stage a slight amount of n h 4 n still entered their iwsz the high water holding capacity of the biochar well protected the iwsz from do influence and inhibited nitrification in iwsz making n h 4 n stably existed during 3 d add for wb n h 4 n can even be generated by woodchip hydrolysis and result in an increasing n h 4 n profile fig 6f in comparison the n h 4 n in the iwsz of sb showed a decreasing trend with the add prolonged especially during long term operation the result indirectly exhibits that sand is not as effective as biochar for do resistance the long term operation further consumes the organic matter in sb s vadose zone and results in a decrease in do resistance as for n o x n both pb and sb showed a poorer removal with the operation prolonged while for wb stable and very effective denitrification was maintained through 26 months fig 6g i the decline of denitrification in iwsz of sb can be attributed to two reasons 1 more organic matter was flushed out from the systems instead of into iwsz as discussed in section 3 2 and 2 poor anoxic condition is not suitable for the effective denitrification similarly the lower performance in pb can also be caused by the lower organic matter flushed from the vadose zone fig s3d besides the degradation of pyrite based autotrophic denitrification may also be one reason previous studies indicate that the intermediate product e g iron hydro oxide generation might cover the pyrite surface and influence denitrification hu et al 2020 overall for tdn the iwsz of wb kept the best tdn removal performance during all three stages followed by pb while the iwsz of sb showed the poorest nitrogen removal ability fig 6j l as for tdp with the add prolonged the tdp in the iwsz of pb and sb kept stable but increased in wb fig s3a c this result exhibit that the in situ phosphorus generation by woodchip exists persistently nevertheless compared with the short term operation the initial tdp in wb was much lower in the long term stage which indirectly demonstrates that more phosphorus was removed by the vadose zone of wb after ageing we anticipated that drying and wetting cycles may labilize and flush out the phosphorus in biochar which free the adsorption site of the biochar and increase the phosphorus removal ability during long term operation accordingly the adsorption test also showed the leached biochar used in this study has acceptable phosphate adsorption ability langmuir q m a x 328 567 mg kg kong et al 2021b 3 4 microbial community and metabolic function 3 4 1 alpha diversity the rarefaction curves demonstrated that the sequencing depth was adequate to describe the microbial communities fig s4 as for alpha diversity in the vadose zone biochar addition increased shannon simpson and chao 1 indexes which indicates biochar addition increased both microbial richness and diversity in the iwsz both pyrite and woodchip amendment increased all indexes than sand table s3 compared with the similar system constructed wetland the richness and diversity tested in this study were much higher for example the chao 1 and shannon index in pb2 were 2666 23 309 09 and 7 48 0 33 respectively much higher than the corresponding values in long term operated pyrite based constructed wetlands 481 02 1277 65 and 2 81 5 18 si et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the fluctuating conditions e g unstable drying and wetting cycle etc may shape the more complicated microbial community in the bioretention system 3 4 2 beta diversity and taxonomic composition as for beta diversity nmds analysis indicates that samples from different media amendments and layers i e the vadose zone and the iwsz showed marked differences from each other both biochar and woodchip addition greatly changed the microbial community composition while pyrite addition only slightly shaped the microbial community fig 7 a to further identify the functional microorganism and explain the different biological processes in these different systems the taxonomic diversity was analyzed at the phylum level proteobacteria had the highest relative abundance 45 4 59 2 followed by actinobacteria 5 7 39 2 and chloroflexi 2 7 20 1 fig s5 all the dominant phyla have been frequently detected in bioretention systems or constructed wetlands xu et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 microbes belonging to actinobacteria could form spores to resist severe environments xu et al 2021 the higher proportion of it in the iwsz of sb may indicate that the conditions there were harsher than in other amended groups as for the genus level fig 7b and table s4 in the vadose zone thauera 5 0 17 4 azoarcus 0 7 6 2 and pseudomonas 1 8 2 3 showed high relative abundance in all systems several species belonging to those genera were reported to be denitrifiers qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 other potential denitrifiers such as pedomicrobium 1 6 3 5 pseudolabrys 0 7 1 5 and haliangium 0 7 1 1 were also detected jia et al 2021 levesque et al 2020 besides nitrifiers such as nitrosomonas 0 0 0 5 nitrospira 0 7 1 8 and aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria like genera belong to the family nitrosomonadaceae such as mnd1 0 3 1 2 ellin6067 0 1 0 9 and is 44 0 5 1 0 li et al 2020b xia et al 2005 were also detected in the vadose zone compared with sb biochar addition increased the relative abundance of those potential nitrifiers which can be attributed to the increase of ammonium adsorption by biochar leads to a favourable condition for nitrifier proliferation meanwhile all three system s vadose zone also showed a high abundance of heterotrophic genera such as ramlibacter 0 1 1 3 sbr1031 4 0 7 4 and a4b 4 6 8 4 deng et al 2021 xia et al 2016 which may be caused by the peat moss addition as for the iwsz pyrite addition enhanced the relative abundance of potential autotrophic and heterotopic denitrifiers such as thauera 2 2 thiobacillus 1 5 and bacillus 1 2 si et al 2021 xu et al 2021 which indicates the denitrification in the iwsz of pb can be ascribed to mixotrophic denitrification meanwhile the common pyrite aerobic oxidation genera such as acidithiobacillus were not found in pb2 which also fit the limited fetotal and so 4 2 generation in pb fig s6 in comparison woodchip facilitated more potential heterotrophic denitrifiers such as bacillus 4 3 bradyrhizobium 1 0 and denitratisoma table s4 1 2 jia et al 2021 liu et al 2021 other heterotrophic bacteria related to organic matter decomposition and digestion such as cellulomonas table s4 0 7 saccharimonadales 1 1 li et al 2020a wei et al 2018 and genera of anaerolineae e g sbr1031 8 23 a4b 1 33 and longilinea table s4 0 44 chen et al 2021 xia et al 2016 were also detected the woodchip layer also showed a high relative abundance of paenibacillus 1 45 which were often linked to phosphate solubilization grady et al 2016 the taxonomic composition of iwsz of wb well explained the enhanced denitrification and elevated nh 4 n organic matter and tdp in wb interestingly woodchip addition also increased the relative abundance of thiobacillus 1 1 and several other genera related to sulfur cycling e g sulfurisoma sulfuritalea geobacter and desulfovibrio table s4 qiu et al 2020 the results also agree with the sulfate reduction in wb detected in our previous work at prolonged add kong et al 2021b the sulfate reduction process can lead to h2s generation during prolonged add lopez ponnada et al 2017 which may induce poor sensory outflow and potentially threaten human health besides a low relative abundance of nitrospira 0 4 and nitrosomonas table s4 0 1 were detected in the iwsz of sb while their relative abundance in the iwsz of pb and wb was very low or even undetected this result also matches the observed nitrification in the sb s iwsz 3 4 3 metabolic function to further elucidate the metabolic function of the microbial community in the bioretention system the picrust2 analysis was conducted since very limited information about picrust picrust2 analysis was reported in previous bioretention studies studies of sulfur based denitrification qiu et al 2020 sulfidogenic granular sludge biswal et al 2020 and intermittent aeration constructed wetland li et al 2021 were selected as representatives and compared with this study a total of 200 predicted functions were identified sequences associated with the functions involved in metabolism showed the highest proportion 80 6 83 3 followed by genetic information processing 9 5 11 5 cellular processes 3 8 4 9 and environmental information processing 2 2 2 6 for all groups fig 7c compared with the above mentioned studies the relative proportion of the metabolism in their study was lower about 40 60 but the relative proportion of environmental information processing in their study was higher approximately 10 20 although a high proportion of functions involved in metabolism was found energy metabolism which was deemed as one of the three most frequently detected high proportion items in the metabolism category the other two are carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism li et al 2021 qiu et al 2020 did not show a high relative abundance in all samples 4 7 5 3 nitrogen metabolism which covered important nitrogen removal processes e g nitrification denitrification etc is also included in this category unlike those reference studies where dominant genera were enriched for enhanced pollutant removal or transformation at controlled conditions the varied stormwater conditions and low pollutant level in stormwater runoff determine that most of the metabolic activity in the bioretention system should be related to microbial survival instead of nutrient removal which potentially explained the low proportion of energy metabolism but the high proportion of other metabolism categories 3 4 4 the relationship between media amendment and microbial community based on the microbial characteristics it can be found that the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and versatile the complicated microbial community is beneficial for the robustness of the bioretention system under complicated natural conditions however the complicated conditions may also induce a low relative abundance of key microbes for pollutant removal suitable media amendment can increase microbial diversity and the relative abundance of key microbes by providing substrates or and a suitable physicochemical environment which are conducive to enhanced pollutant treatment nevertheless some of the microbes belonging to the versatile microbial community after media amendment can also lead to by product generation problems in practical application complicated natural conditions and inconsistent design construction standards may shape the inconsistent microbial community than in lab experiments problems such as the lack of functional microbes and or enrichment of the unwanted microbes can be incurred making the amended system become a pollutant source instead of a treatment facility more studies are needed to focus on microbial related processes from lab scale to field scale and between different operating stages climate conditions amendments etc 3 5 implication for stormwater bioretention 3 5 1 the amended bioretention system should be evaluated at a more dynamic pattern the important nitrogen and phosphorus treatment processes in the bioretention system can be impacted by adsorption saturation immature functional microbes substrate consumption etc from short term to long term operation which leads to the huge fluctuation of the dissolved nutrient treatment performance compared with conventional bioretention systems the influence of different operation stages on the amended system can be more drastic since the amendment greatly complicate the biochemical processes for instance unstable internal media conditions can incur severe pollutant leaching in the amended system during the initial operation significant pollutant treatment efficiency drop down can also be faced by the amended system after the long term operation the short duration evaluation may hard to catch those temporal variations in terms of pollutant treatment and lead to an incomprehensive understanding of the amended system as a result the prediction of the potential risk in the more complicated field application and the further design optimization of the amendment will also be restricted therefore it is meaningful to evaluate the amended bioretention system in a dynamic view 3 5 2 the balance between stability and efficiency in the bioretention system woodchip was frequently used in the iwsz of the bioretention system for enhanced heterotrophic denitrification liu et al 2021 lopez ponnada et al 2020 pyrite was recently considered as one alternative for organic matter for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal in iwsz by our previous studies chen et al 2020 kong et al 2021b based on the long term evaluation of this study it is easy to find that pb is conserved while wb demonstrates more extreme characteristics ideally the amended media should combine both stability and efficiency from initial set up to long term operation however unfortunately this aim is hard to be achieved due to the reasons like drastically changed natural conditions and media ageing etc to our knowledge no study has reported such well rounded technology therefore it is important to evaluate the suitable application scenarios of different amended systems thereby maximising their stability and efficiency local environmental variables such as catchment information pollutant characteristics and meteorological conditions can be the most important factors for extreme amendments like wb their application in highly polluted and frequent rainfall areas can be more appropriate since those conditions can enlarge their high efficiency merits while diminishing the by product generation problems in comparison conserved amendments such as pb may need a longer time to achieve effective pollutant treatment therefore their application in cleaner catchments and low rainfall frequency areas can help them maintain both stability and efficiency media amendments can further be designated for those prioritized pollutants of the receiving ecosystem to enlarge their advantages zinger et al 2013 for example using al fe containing media for phosphorus control while using organic matter amendment for enhanced denitrification it should be noted that the design parameters can also impact the stability and efficiency of the amendment for example excessive filling of pyrite in our previous study generated severe iron and sulfate by product chen et al 2020 larger woodchip size may lead to lower denitrification rate but limit by product generation as well lopez ponnada et al 2017 besides other factors such as local sources available market price and policy can also influence the amended media selection and adoption tirpak et al 2021 therefore the balance between efficiency and stability of novel amendments in field application can be more complicated research about design optimization stormwater management life cycle assessment etc should all be integrated 3 5 3 research limits this study only deals with dissolved nutrients stormwater is more and more being considered as an alternative source of reuse water recently which urged bioretention systems to simultaneously remove multiple pollutants more than nutrients e g emerging pollutants heavy metals bacteria etc tirpak et al 2021 in that case how to balance stability and efficiency is more challenging similar to the impact on nutrients media amendment can pose a potential leaching risk for other pollutants as well for instance improper use of metal binding amendments such as minerals and compost is likely to cause heavy metals leaching hu et al 2020 tirpak et al 2021 some types of biochar may also release heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to the improper raw material used liu et al 2018 even for the amended media that are effective for treating multiple pollutants concerns about pollutant adsorption capacity transformation fate biodegradable ability etc should also be evaluated over a long time span whether there exists competition and or synergy effect between different pollutants treatment by amended bioretention system should also be studied in more detail finally although systematic lab scale evaluation is conducive for the amended bioretention system scale up there are still gaps between field and lab scale studies more research that evaluates the microbial characteristics and field performance of the various amendment is also urgently needed 4 conclusion in this study two modified bioretention systems and one conventional sand system were evaluated from the initial set up to 26 months of long term operation specific conclusions are 1 media amendment enhanced the dissolved nutrient removal performance pb demonstrated the highest tdp removal which is 80 3 4 1 while wb showed the highest tdn removal which is 68 1 2 5 in comparison the highest tdp and tdn removal in sb was only 45 2 4 0 and 36 9 4 4 respectively 2 different amendments demonstrate diverse pollutant removal and leaching pattern at different operation stages pb could achieve simultaneous phosphorus and nitrogen removal with limited by product generation however the denitrification efficiency in pb declined during long term operation in contrast wb could maintain effective and sustained nitrogen removal but demonstrate higher organic matter and phosphorus leaching than pb especially during the initial operation stage all three systems showed higher ammonium but low nitrate removal during long term operation 3 the microbial community in the bioretention system is complicated and stable media amendment enhanced the richness diversity and relative abundance of several key functional microbes for nitrogen sulfur and organic matter cycling which well explained the enhanced dissolved nutrient removal in pb and wb and by product generation in wb 4 media amendment is hard to achieve both stability and efficiency in the bioretention system from initial set up to long term operation nevertheless those two traits can be balanced by choosing suitable design factors and corresponding application scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no potential conflicts of interest with

15442,contamination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in sediment has long been of great concern because of their toxic effects to benthic organisms sediment quality guidelines sqgs are the basis to evaluate the potential ecological risks of pahs in sediments species sensitivity distribution ssd has been widely applied in deriving water quality criteria but seldom employed in sqgs in this study ssd was used to derive the freshwater sqgs for four representative pahs naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene based on the sediment toxicity results a linear relationship between the sqgs and octanol water partition coefficient log k ow was developed and applied to predict the sqgs of other twelve pahs the obtained sqgs were in the range of 0 46 1 79 mg kg with a geometric mean of 0 97 mg kg which was proposed as the sqgs for total pahs based on these sqgs the risk quotients of pahs in the sediments collected from haihe river of china were calculated and the toxic effects were also tested using three representative benthic organisms as the risk quotients of the pahs and heavy metals in the sediments were summed up good correlations were found p 0 074 and 0 018 between them and the observed toxicities of the sediments the sqgs developed for pahs was promising in ecological risk assessment for contaminated freshwater sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs freshwater sediment quality guideline species sensitivity distribution benthic organism data availability data can be found in supplementary information 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a class of organic contaminants consisting of two or more condensed aromatic hydrocarbon rings and ubiquitous in air water soil and sediment the main sources of pahs in the environment include use of petroleum coal and oil combustion and wastewater discharge some pahs and their metabolites are mutagenic and carcinogenic yang et al 2021 mallah et al 2022 therefore sixteen pahs are listed as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency us epa and eight are in the list of ministry of ecology and environment of china due to the relatively high hydrophobicity and low solubility pahs tend to partition to sediments and accumulate in benthic organisms hence pose potential ecological risks to benthic organisms li et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a additionally pahs in sediment may be released into the overlying water again under internal or external disturbance therefore pahs contamination in sediment has the potential to pose a long term ecological and human health risks maletic et al 2019 dai et al 2022 sediment quality guidelines sqgs are the threshold concentrations of pollutants in sediments that are intended to protect sediment dwelling benthic organisms from adverse effects batley et al 2005 burton 2013 2018 kwok et al 2014 the sqgs of several pollutants including heavy metals and organic contaminants are available for risk assessment and pollution management long et al 2006 meador 2006 burgess et al 2013 simpson and batley 2016 the most commonly used approaches to derive sqgs include empirical methods and mechanistic methods empirical sqgs are obtained from the empirical correlations between reported biological effects and environmental concentrations of contaminants in sediment long et al 2006 mechanistic sqgs are usually based on the corresponding water quality criteria and the equilibrium partitioning eqp theory which assumes the chemicals adsorbed on sediment organic carbon and that dissolved in pore water reach an equilibrium burgess et al 2013 one assumption of this method is that benthos are exposed to contaminants mainly through pore water apparently the exposure pathway via ingestion of sediment is not included thus exposure risks might be underestimated the sqgs of pahs have been derived using both empirical and mechanistic methods for protection of benthic organisms mcgrath et al 2019 the empirical sqgs of 12 individual pahs including interim sediment quality guidelines isqgs and probable effect levels pels have been adopted in canada ccme 1999 us epa adopts the equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks esbs for 34 pahs using the eqp approach swartz 1999 di toro and mcgrath 2000b usepa 2003 in the netherlands maximum permissible concentrations mpc for 16 pahs in sediment were derived from available sediment toxicity data and described on the basis of fraction of organic carbon f oc verbruggen 2012 considering that pahs always occur as a complex mixture sqgs for total pahs were also derived in addition to individual pahs for example empirical sqgs of total pahs were derived based on the sum of sqgs of individual pahs long et al 1995 macdonald et al 2000 in norway the sqgs for total pahs in marine sediments are classified into 5 levels background good moderate bad very bad and the values for total pahs range from 0 3 mg kg background to 20 mg kg very bad bakke et al 2010 in australia and new zealand normalized with the total organic carbon toc of 1 a sediment quality guideline value sqgv of 10 mg kg and an upper guideline sqg high of 50 mg kg for total pahs were recommended simpson et al 2013 2020 species sensitivity distribution ssd is a cumulative probability distribution fitted to a set of toxicity thresholds for individual organism species in the ecosystem aldenberg and jaworska 2000 newman et al 2000 fox et al 2021 ssd has been officially used to derive water quality guidelines of contaminants in australia and new zealand warne et al 2018 stauber et al 2021 batley et al 2021 recently ministry of ecology and environment of china also recommended ssd as the standard method to derive water quality criteria wqc of pollutants technical guideline for deriving water quality criteria for freshwater organisms first version as hj 831 2017 and updated as hj 831 2022 liu et al 2014 feng et al 2019 it was employed to estimate ecologically safe thresholds for ammonia in aquatic system yan et al 2020 it is also regarded as a promising method for deriving sqgs when there are sufficient sediment toxicity data available for different taxa leung et al 2005 kwok et al 2008 simpson et al 2011 vangheluwe et al 2013 in comparison with empirical approach ssd is derived preferably based on the toxicity data of spiked sediment with a single pollutant therefore reducing the uncertainty of using the toxicity data of field sediment containing a range of pollutants additionally ssd reduces the dependency on wqc in eqp method which are not always available for some pollutants particularly the ingestion exposure pathway of benthos was taken into account octanol water partition coefficient k ow is one of the most important physical chemical properties of organic chemicals and was reported to correlate with the toxicities of some organic pollutants di toro et al 2000a chi et al 2018 it was observed that the toxicities of pahs to fish embryos increased with their molecular sizes and log k ow values hodson 2017 the acute toxicities of pahs to two freshwater invertebrates daphnia magna and hyalella azteca also displayed a positive correlation with their log k ow values ha et al 2019 in this study we attempted to derive the sqgs of 16 pahs using ssd approach and the relationship between sqgs and log k ow field sediments were collected from haihe river china the sediment concentrations of pahs were measured additionally the overall toxicities of the collected sediments were tested using three representative benthic organisms by comparing the calculated risk quotients of pahs and the toxic effects the reliability of the derived sqgs in assessment of the related risks was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and screening the 16 target pahs of this study include naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene fluorene anthracene phenanthrene pyrene fluoranthene chrysene

weights mw and log k ow are listed in table s1 four pahs composed of 2 to 5 benzene rings i e naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene are chosen as representatives of the 16 pahs hence their toxicity data were collected from references and databases of web of science www webofscience com china national knowledge infrastructure cnki https www cnki net and ecotox http cfpub epa gov ecotox the collected toxicity data were screened following the rules recommended in the chinese standard method for deriving wqc hj 831 2022 technical guideline for deriving water quality criteria for freshwater organisms generally the organisms in the tests should be freshwater species and preferably native benthic organisms across china higher priority was given to the data based on whole sediment toxicity tests of spiked sediment which were conducted following standard methods wqc usually comprise of short term criteria based on acute toxicity data and long term criteria based on chronic data in contrast only long term sqgs based on chronic data are usually derived given that the concentrations of contaminants in sediment do not vary as quickly as in water therefore chronic long term 10 d toxicity data rather than acute short term 10 d data should be used for deriving sqgs a total number of at least eight species covering different taxonomic groups is desirable while ten to fifteen is preferable if the minimum data requirement is not met data conversion from acute toxicity to chronic toxicity or from water only test to whole sediment test is needed when there are no sufficient chronic toxicity data available acute data are divided by acute to chronic ratio acr for aquatic organisms to obtain chronic data when there are only limited number of spiked sediment toxicity data water toxicity data with benthic organisms were converted into sediment toxicity data using eqs 1 and 2 di toro and mcgrath 2000b to complement the sediment toxicity data set 1 log k o c

was applied to derive sqgs with sediment toxicity data curves fitting were conducted following the guideline hj 831 2022 with the software chinese national ecological environment criteria calculation

model the derived hc5 was then divided with an assessment factor to obtain sqgs the assessment factor was 2 when the data number 15 and was 3 when 15 following this procedure of ssd approach the sqgs of naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene were derived based on the derived sqgs of the four representative pahs a linear relationship between the sqgs and log k ow was established eq 3

sediment collection and characterization seventeen surface sediments 10 cm were collected by grab sampling in october 2017 and may 2018 from haihe river and the tributaries haihe river basin locates in north china and covers an area of 320 000 km2 it supports several large cities including beijing and tianjin and is a highly developed region in china as one of the most highly industrialized and densely populated area in china haihe river basin has high concentrations of pahs in the surface sediments shi et al 2005 jiang et al 2007 qian et al 2017 most of the sampling sites are listed in the

according to the method hj 911 2017 soil and sediment extraction of organic compounds ultrasonic extraction after the extraction was cleaned up with solid phase extraction the 16 pahs were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms following the method hj 805 2016 soil and sediment determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by gas chromatography mass spectrometry method the gc ms analysis was conducted with agilent 7890b 5977a equipped with a db 5ms ui gc column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the limit of detection lod for the 16 pahs ranged from 0 08 to 0 17 mg kg respectively the recoveries for the 16 pahs were within 63 107 one blank was measured for every 20 samples the duplicates were typically within 30 2 5 whole sediment toxicity tests to evaluate the reliability of the derived sqgs the whole sediment toxicity tests were carried out with three freshwater benthic organisms i e tubificid worm limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and two kinds of chironomid larvae chironomus tentans and chironomus kiiensis the toxicity endpoints include 28 d mortality for l hoffmeisteri 14 d larval mortality and unemergence for c tentans and 21 d larval mortality and unemergence for c kiiensis the tests were conducted referring to the technical guidelines of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd tg 218 tg 225 and tg 233 www oecd org the protocols for the toxicity testing have been described in detail in our previous study zhang et al 2017 2019 the organisms were continuously cultured in our laboratory the adult tubificids about 3 cm long and the second instar chironomid larvae were selected for testing the amount of sediment was 50 g per test vessel and the volume ratio of sediment to overlying water was about 1 4 there were 10 organisms in each vessel three replicates were performed for each toxicity test the organisms were recorded as dead when they did not respond to a gentle mechanical stimulus or were found missing emergence is the development of chironomids larvae into adults as indicated by their coming out from the sediments unemergence is the difference between the number of larval chironomids introduced to the vessel and that of the adult midges emerged from the vessel mortality and unemergence ratio are recorded as the toxicity value of the sediments the sediment of control was collected from clean area of tianjin china the toc was 2 18 and the ph was 7 62 for the control the mortality and the unemergence ratio of the organisms were all below 10 2 6 statistical analyses ecological risk quotients for pahs in sediments were calculated with the pahs concentrations divided by the corresponding sqg values and corrected with f oc the risk quotient based on the concentration of individual pahs qpahs was calculated using eq 4 and the risk quotient based on the total concentration of 16 pahs qʃpahs was calculated using eq 5 4 q p a h s c pah 1 sqg f o c 5 q p a h s c p a h s 1 s q g p a h s f o c where cpah is the concentration of individual pah mg kg cʃpahs is the total concentration of 16 pahs mg kg f oc is the fraction of organic carbon in the sediment sqg and sqgʃpahs are respectively the sediment quality guideline value for individual pah and total pahs mg kg f oc 1 considering that the sediments also usually contained high levels of heavy metals mean risk quotient for heavy metals and pahs was often calculated for risk assessment long et al 2006 simpson et al 2020 qmetals is the sum of risk quotients for 5 heavy metals cd cu ni pb zn and the values were reported in our previous study zhang et al 2021b in the present study q metals pahs 2 is the average of qmetals and qpahs and q metals ʃpahs 2 is the average of qmetals and qʃpahs the correlations between sediment toxicity and the risk quotients were analyzed by simple linear regression in order to validate the feasibility of risk assessment with pahs sqgs 3 results and discussion 3 1 deriving sqgs of the four representative pahs by ssd sufficient high quality toxicity data are essential to derive sqgs considering that there are no sufficient toxicity data available for all the 16 pahs 4 of them i e naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene were selected as representative pahs for sqgs deriving these 4 pahs are composed of 2 to 5 benzene rings respectively fig s1 and among the most concerned and often detected pahs in the environments generally ssd is recommended when the dataset contains at least eight species from four taxonomic groups and 10 15 data points are necessary to generate satisfied fitting if the minimum data requirement is not met data conversion from acute toxicity to chronic toxicity with acr table s3 or that from water only test to whole sediment test with eqp is recommended by literature searching and data conversion 60 sediment chronic toxicity data including 16 for naphthalene 18 for phenanthrene 14 for pyrene and 12 for benzo a pyrene were obtained table s4 among them 25 were transformed from the short term acute data applying the acr method and 77 were transformed from water toxicity data using eqp approach although increasing efforts are devoted to develop standard methods for whole sediment toxicity tests the number of toxicity data for sediment contaminants is still limited mechanistic sqgs based on eqp are derived from wqc and toxicity data of water only tests in which the exposure of organisms from sediment is ignored by incorporating sediment toxicity data as many as possible in developing sqgs the uncertainty of sqg values could decrease the ssd curves for the 4 pahs are shown in fig 1 and the corresponding statistical details are illustrated in table 1 for each compound 4 regression models were obtained employing the software eec ssd for hc5 calculation the best fittings were log normal for naphthalene and pyrene logistic for phenanthrene and normal for benzo a pyrene respectively table 1 according to the number of toxicity data for each compound an assessment factor of 2 was applied to hc5 for naphthalene and phenanthrene and 3 was applied to pyrene and benzo a pyrene to derive sqgs expressed on a dry weight basis using an assumption of f oc 1 the sqgs of naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene are 1 79 1 18 1 17 and 0 64 mg kg respectively the sqgs were in the range of existent empirical sqgs recommended by other countries table 2 compared with the mechanistic sqgs such as esb of usa mpc of netherland and pnecchronic predicted no effects concentration value for chronic exposure of norway the values are mostly within the scope of 0 17 to 9 1 fold table 2 3 2 predicting sqgs of other 12 pahs and total pahs several studies reported the correlations between the toxicities and log k ow for pahs di toro et al 2000a 2000b hodson 2017 ha et al 2019 since sqgs are based on toxicities di toro and mcgrath 2000b observed a positive linear correlation between the logarithm of molar sqg and log k ow in our study a significant correlation was also established between the logarithm of molar sqg and log k ow of the four representative pahs eq 6 r 2 0 987 p 0 004 0 01 based on this correlation the sqgs for the other 12 pahs were predicted with their log k ow values table s1 and the results are listed in table 2 6 log s q g m w 0 2739 log k o w 0 9427 compared with the mechanistic sqgs recorded in the literatures the sqgs of present study are lower than esb of usa usepa 2003 and higher than mpc of netherland verbruggen 2012 and pnecchronic of norway bakke et al 2010 table 2 generally the values are comparable and the differences are acceptable as compared with mpc and pnecchronic 72 of the sqgs of the present study are in the range of 10 fold and 94 are 50 fold compared with esb 81 of the values are within the scope of 0 05 0 5 fold the variation of empirical sqg for each pah is much larger than that of mechanistic sqgs table 2 probably because empirical sqgs were derived from the toxicity data of a wide range of field sediments having different f oc and containing varieties of contaminants which inevitably increased the uncertainties because of the scarcity of available toxicity data there were only 4 compounds included in the regression analysis more reliable results will be obtained by incorporating more compounds in the model pahs always coexist as a mixture in the environment thus the total concentration of pahs is often recorded accordingly it is essential to develop the sqgs for total pahs sqgs for total pahs have been derived from the sum long et al 1995 the arithmetic mean swartz 1999 or the geometric mean macdonald et al 2000 of the sqgs values for individual pahs on account of the wide variation in the number and type of pahs detected in the sediments in our present study the geometric mean of the sqg values of the 16 individual pahs i e 0 97 mg kg dry weight f oc 1 was proposed as the sqg for total pahs ʃpahs table 2 due to the diverse concepts and methods for sqgs the sqg values for total pahs have a wide range from 0 197 to 100 mg kg table 2 in norway a marine and estuarine sqg for total pahs of 2 0 mg kg f oc 1 was used to distinguish good quality and moderate quality sediments bakke et al 2010 based on the chronic molar sqgs acute molar sqgs and the average molecular weight for total pahs simpson et al 2013 recommended that the sqgv and sqg high value for australia and new zealand be set respectively as 10 and 50 mg kg f oc 1 and used them for assessing the remediation of gasworks impacted sediments simpson et al 2020 in our present study sqg for total pahs was calculated equally from sqgs of the 16 pahs ignoring the compositions of pahs in the sediments the sqg value of 0 97 mg kg lies between that of pyrene 1 17 mg kg and fluoranthene 0 89 mg kg table 2 therefore this sqg value may underestimate the ecological risk if the sediments contain mostly high molecular weight pahs with four or more rings more hydrophobic than fluoranthene while overestimate the risk if contain mostly low molecular weight pahs with less than four rings less hydrophobic than pyrene 3 3 pahs concentrations and the related risk quotients in sediments of haihe river seventeen sediments collected from haihe river were analyzed to detect pahs contamination for the reason that most of the sampling sites are far from industrial areas the pahs concentrations in these sediments are relatively low relatively high levels of pahs were detected with confidence in four sediments s6 s10 s12 and s13 fig 2 table s5 and the total pahs concentrations all exceeded the sqg of 0 97 mg kg the 2 ring pah of naphthalene was minor in the sediments probably because of its higher water solubility than the other pahs the 3 to 6 ring pahs predominated at s12 and s13 but with relatively low concentrations in s6 and s10 however high molecular weight pahs especially 5 and 6 ring pahs contributed over 2 3 of the total concentration of pahs s12 and s13 were collected from the lower reaches of the river thus had possibly received pahs transported by water flow from the upstream in contrast the sampling site of s6 was located in the upper reaches and the pahs contamination was probably due to the local discharge the total concentration of pahs in s10 was 27 39 mg kg dry weight much higher than the other three sediments and over 28 times of the sqg in line with our study very high level of pahs was reported at s10 qian et al 2017 the sampling site of s10 was close to large petrochemical enterprises which might be the cause of high pahs concentrations at this site as one of the most important freshwater reservoir in north china haihe river basin supports several large cities including beijing and tianjin and is a highly developed region in china pahs contamination in some sediment of haihe river was attributed to industrial discharge and traffic emission jiang et al 2007 qian et al 2017 an extremely high concentration of 1943 mg kg of total pahs in sediment had been once detected in haihe river while pahs pollution is decreasing in recently years due to effective pollution control shi et al 2005 zhang et al 2021a the risk quotients of pahs in the four sediments s6 s10 s12 and s13 were calculated using the derived sqgs for individual pahs and total pahs qpahs and qʃpahs and the results are listed in table s6 qpahs is the sum of risk quotients derived from the individual sqgs and qʃpahs is the risk quotient derived from the sqg of total pahs both qpahs and qʃpahs represent the potential ecological risk of pahs mixture in the sediment the qpahs for s12 0 5 and s13 1 2 were relatively low while that of s6 4 4 was higher due to the higher pah concentrations and the lower f oc 0 90 at this site and it was as high as 11 5 at s10 there is a significant linear relationship between qʃpahs and qpahs p 0 01 fig s3 suggesting that the sqg derived for total pahs is useful as well as the individual sqgs in ecological risk assessment yet may underestimate the risk when the sediment contains mainly high molecular weight pahs 4 rings 3 4 testing the reliability of the derived sqgs using sediment toxicity the sediment toxicities of the 17 sediments collected from haihe river were evaluated using three representative benthic organisms based on multiple endpoints to evaluate the reliability of the sqgs for pahs in ecological risk assessment the correlation between the risk quotients of the pahs and the observed toxicities tested by benthic organisms expressed as toxic effect was inspected by simple linear regression as shown in fig 3 a and b both the log qpahs and log qʃpahs have poor linear relations with the observed toxic effects p 0 713 and 0 778 implying that other toxicants in the sediments might make contributions to the toxic effects in our previous study zhang et al 2021b heavy metals were measured in these sediment samples thus the qmetals were also calculated as the sum of risk quotients for five individual heavy metals cd cu ni pb zn given the complex mechanisms of joint toxicity of pahs and heavy metals q metals pahs 2 and q metals ʃpahs 2 are calculated as the average of risk quotients for pahs and metals fig 3 c and d illustrate that when the risk quotients of heavy metals were incorporated the correlations between log q metals pahs 2 as well as log q metals ʃpahs 2 and the observed sediment toxicities increased significantly p 0 074 and 0 018 the result magnified that both pahs and heavy metals made dominant contributions to the toxicities of the sediment this also suggests that the empirical sqgs based on field sediments might incorporate large uncertainty due to the coexistent of various toxicants while the derived sqgs of pahs using ssd approach in this study are valuable for risk assessment of field contaminated sediments 4 conclusions in this study freshwater sqgs for individual and total pahs were derived with ssd method sediment toxicity data based on whole sediment tests and from conversion of water only tests were employed for ssd fitting to develop sqgs for four representative pahs based on the significant relationship between the sqgs and log k ow the sqgs of the other 12 pahs and total pahs were proposed the obtained sqgs were applied to evaluate the pahs related risk quotients in the field sediments from haihe river of china the risk quotients based on sqgs for individual and total pahs were very similar and highly correlated as the risk quotients of pahs and heavy metals in the sediment samples were summed up a good correlation was found between them and the observed toxic effects tested by benthic organisms it showed that the pahs sqgs are promising in ecological risk assessment for contaminated field sediments in consideration of the joint toxicity of pahs and heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15442,contamination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in sediment has long been of great concern because of their toxic effects to benthic organisms sediment quality guidelines sqgs are the basis to evaluate the potential ecological risks of pahs in sediments species sensitivity distribution ssd has been widely applied in deriving water quality criteria but seldom employed in sqgs in this study ssd was used to derive the freshwater sqgs for four representative pahs naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene based on the sediment toxicity results a linear relationship between the sqgs and octanol water partition coefficient log k ow was developed and applied to predict the sqgs of other twelve pahs the obtained sqgs were in the range of 0 46 1 79 mg kg with a geometric mean of 0 97 mg kg which was proposed as the sqgs for total pahs based on these sqgs the risk quotients of pahs in the sediments collected from haihe river of china were calculated and the toxic effects were also tested using three representative benthic organisms as the risk quotients of the pahs and heavy metals in the sediments were summed up good correlations were found p 0 074 and 0 018 between them and the observed toxicities of the sediments the sqgs developed for pahs was promising in ecological risk assessment for contaminated freshwater sediments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pahs freshwater sediment quality guideline species sensitivity distribution benthic organism data availability data can be found in supplementary information 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are a class of organic contaminants consisting of two or more condensed aromatic hydrocarbon rings and ubiquitous in air water soil and sediment the main sources of pahs in the environment include use of petroleum coal and oil combustion and wastewater discharge some pahs and their metabolites are mutagenic and carcinogenic yang et al 2021 mallah et al 2022 therefore sixteen pahs are listed as priority pollutants by the us environmental protection agency us epa and eight are in the list of ministry of ecology and environment of china due to the relatively high hydrophobicity and low solubility pahs tend to partition to sediments and accumulate in benthic organisms hence pose potential ecological risks to benthic organisms li et al 2017 zhang et al 2021a additionally pahs in sediment may be released into the overlying water again under internal or external disturbance therefore pahs contamination in sediment has the potential to pose a long term ecological and human health risks maletic et al 2019 dai et al 2022 sediment quality guidelines sqgs are the threshold concentrations of pollutants in sediments that are intended to protect sediment dwelling benthic organisms from adverse effects batley et al 2005 burton 2013 2018 kwok et al 2014 the sqgs of several pollutants including heavy metals and organic contaminants are available for risk assessment and pollution management long et al 2006 meador 2006 burgess et al 2013 simpson and batley 2016 the most commonly used approaches to derive sqgs include empirical methods and mechanistic methods empirical sqgs are obtained from the empirical correlations between reported biological effects and environmental concentrations of contaminants in sediment long et al 2006 mechanistic sqgs are usually based on the corresponding water quality criteria and the equilibrium partitioning eqp theory which assumes the chemicals adsorbed on sediment organic carbon and that dissolved in pore water reach an equilibrium burgess et al 2013 one assumption of this method is that benthos are exposed to contaminants mainly through pore water apparently the exposure pathway via ingestion of sediment is not included thus exposure risks might be underestimated the sqgs of pahs have been derived using both empirical and mechanistic methods for protection of benthic organisms mcgrath et al 2019 the empirical sqgs of 12 individual pahs including interim sediment quality guidelines isqgs and probable effect levels pels have been adopted in canada ccme 1999 us epa adopts the equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks esbs for 34 pahs using the eqp approach swartz 1999 di toro and mcgrath 2000b usepa 2003 in the netherlands maximum permissible concentrations mpc for 16 pahs in sediment were derived from available sediment toxicity data and described on the basis of fraction of organic carbon f oc verbruggen 2012 considering that pahs always occur as a complex mixture sqgs for total pahs were also derived in addition to individual pahs for example empirical sqgs of total pahs were derived based on the sum of sqgs of individual pahs long et al 1995 macdonald et al 2000 in norway the sqgs for total pahs in marine sediments are classified into 5 levels background good moderate bad very bad and the values for total pahs range from 0 3 mg kg background to 20 mg kg very bad bakke et al 2010 in australia and new zealand normalized with the total organic carbon toc of 1 a sediment quality guideline value sqgv of 10 mg kg and an upper guideline sqg high of 50 mg kg for total pahs were recommended simpson et al 2013 2020 species sensitivity distribution ssd is a cumulative probability distribution fitted to a set of toxicity thresholds for individual organism species in the ecosystem aldenberg and jaworska 2000 newman et al 2000 fox et al 2021 ssd has been officially used to derive water quality guidelines of contaminants in australia and new zealand warne et al 2018 stauber et al 2021 batley et al 2021 recently ministry of ecology and environment of china also recommended ssd as the standard method to derive water quality criteria wqc of pollutants technical guideline for deriving water quality criteria for freshwater organisms first version as hj 831 2017 and updated as hj 831 2022 liu et al 2014 feng et al 2019 it was employed to estimate ecologically safe thresholds for ammonia in aquatic system yan et al 2020 it is also regarded as a promising method for deriving sqgs when there are sufficient sediment toxicity data available for different taxa leung et al 2005 kwok et al 2008 simpson et al 2011 vangheluwe et al 2013 in comparison with empirical approach ssd is derived preferably based on the toxicity data of spiked sediment with a single pollutant therefore reducing the uncertainty of using the toxicity data of field sediment containing a range of pollutants additionally ssd reduces the dependency on wqc in eqp method which are not always available for some pollutants particularly the ingestion exposure pathway of benthos was taken into account octanol water partition coefficient k ow is one of the most important physical chemical properties of organic chemicals and was reported to correlate with the toxicities of some organic pollutants di toro et al 2000a chi et al 2018 it was observed that the toxicities of pahs to fish embryos increased with their molecular sizes and log k ow values hodson 2017 the acute toxicities of pahs to two freshwater invertebrates daphnia magna and hyalella azteca also displayed a positive correlation with their log k ow values ha et al 2019 in this study we attempted to derive the sqgs of 16 pahs using ssd approach and the relationship between sqgs and log k ow field sediments were collected from haihe river china the sediment concentrations of pahs were measured additionally the overall toxicities of the collected sediments were tested using three representative benthic organisms by comparing the calculated risk quotients of pahs and the toxic effects the reliability of the derived sqgs in assessment of the related risks was evaluated 2

ecotox the collected toxicity data were screened following the rules recommended in the chinese standard method for deriving wqc hj 831 2022 technical guideline for deriving water quality criteria for freshwater organisms generally the organisms in the tests should be freshwater species and preferably native benthic organisms across china higher priority was given to the data based on whole sediment toxicity tests of spiked sediment which were conducted following standard methods wqc usually comprise of short term criteria based on acute toxicity data and long term criteria based on chronic data in contrast only long term sqgs based on chronic data are usually derived given that the concentrations of contaminants in sediment do not vary as quickly as in water therefore chronic long term 10 d toxicity data rather than acute short term 10 d data should be used for deriving sqgs a total number of at least eight species covering different taxonomic groups is desirable while ten to fifteen is preferable if the minimum data requirement is not met data conversion from acute toxicity to chronic toxicity or from water only test to whole sediment test is needed when there are no sufficient chronic toxicity data available acute data are divided by acute to chronic ratio acr for aquatic organisms to obtain chronic data when there are only limited number of spiked sediment

sediments were calculated with the pahs concentrations divided by the corresponding sqg values and corrected with f oc the risk quotient based on the concentration of individual pahs qpahs was calculated using eq 4 and the risk quotient based on the total concentration of 16 pahs qʃpahs was calculated using eq 5 4 q p a h s c pah 1 sqg f o c 5 q p a h s c p a h s 1 s q g p a h s f o c where cpah is the concentration of individual pah mg kg cʃpahs is the total concentration of 16 pahs mg kg f oc is the fraction of organic carbon in the sediment sqg and sqgʃpahs are respectively the sediment quality guideline value for individual pah and total pahs mg kg f oc 1 considering that the sediments also usually contained high levels of heavy metals mean risk quotient for heavy metals and pahs was often calculated for risk assessment long et al 2006 simpson et al 2020 qmetals is the sum of risk quotients for 5 heavy metals cd cu ni pb zn and the values were reported in our previous study zhang et al 2021b in the present study q metals pahs 2 is the average of qmetals and qpahs and q metals ʃpahs 2 is the average of qmetals and qʃpahs the correlations between sediment toxicity and the risk quotients were analyzed by simple linear regression in order to validate the feasibility of risk assessment with pahs sqgs 3 results and discussion 3 1 deriving sqgs of the four representative pahs by ssd sufficient high quality toxicity data are essential to derive sqgs considering that there are no sufficient toxicity data available for all the 16 pahs 4 of them i e naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene were selected as representative pahs for sqgs deriving these 4 pahs are composed of 2 to 5 benzene rings respectively fig s1 and among the most concerned and often detected pahs in the environments generally ssd is recommended when the dataset contains at least eight species from four taxonomic groups and 10 15 data points are necessary to generate satisfied fitting if the minimum data requirement is not met data conversion from acute toxicity to chronic toxicity with acr table s3 or that from water only test to whole sediment test with eqp is recommended by literature searching and data conversion 60 sediment chronic toxicity data including 16 for naphthalene 18 for phenanthrene 14 for pyrene and 12 for benzo a pyrene were obtained table s4 among them 25 were transformed from the short term acute data applying the acr method and 77 were transformed from water toxicity data using eqp approach although increasing efforts are devoted to develop standard methods for whole sediment toxicity tests the number of toxicity data for sediment contaminants is still limited mechanistic sqgs based on eqp are derived from wqc and toxicity data of water only tests in which the exposure of organisms from sediment is ignored by incorporating sediment toxicity data as many as possible in developing sqgs the uncertainty of sqg values could decrease the ssd curves for the 4 pahs are shown in fig 1 and the corresponding statistical details are illustrated in table 1 for each compound 4 regression models were obtained employing the software eec ssd for hc5 calculation the best fittings were log normal for naphthalene and pyrene logistic for phenanthrene and normal for benzo a pyrene respectively table 1 according to the number of toxicity data for each compound an assessment factor of 2 was applied to hc5 for naphthalene and phenanthrene and 3 was applied to pyrene and benzo a pyrene to derive sqgs expressed on a dry weight basis using an assumption of f oc 1 the sqgs of naphthalene phenanthrene pyrene and benzo a pyrene are 1 79 1 18 1 17 and 0 64 mg kg respectively the sqgs were in the range of existent empirical sqgs recommended by other countries table 2 compared with the mechanistic sqgs such as esb of usa mpc of netherland and pnecchronic predicted no effects concentration value for chronic exposure of norway the values are mostly within the scope of 0 17 to 9 1 fold table 2 3 2 predicting sqgs of other 12 pahs and total pahs several studies reported the correlations between the toxicities and log k ow for pahs di toro et al 2000a 2000b hodson 2017 ha et al 2019 since sqgs are based on toxicities di toro and mcgrath 2000b observed a positive linear correlation between the logarithm of molar sqg and log k ow in our study a significant correlation was also established between the logarithm of molar sqg and log k ow of the four representative pahs eq 6 r 2 0 987 p 0 004 0 01 based on this correlation the sqgs for the other 12 pahs were predicted with their log k ow values table s1 and the results are listed in table 2 6 log s q g m w 0 2739 log k o w 0 9427 compared with the mechanistic sqgs recorded in the literatures the sqgs of present study are lower than esb of usa usepa 2003 and higher than mpc of netherland verbruggen 2012 and pnecchronic of norway bakke et al 2010 table 2 generally the values are comparable and the differences are acceptable as compared with mpc and pnecchronic 72 of the sqgs of the present study are in the range of 10 fold and 94 are 50 fold compared with esb 81 of the values are within the scope of 0 05 0 5 fold the variation of empirical sqg for each pah is much larger than that of mechanistic sqgs table 2 probably because empirical sqgs were derived from the toxicity data of a wide range of field sediments having different f oc and containing varieties of contaminants which inevitably increased the uncertainties because of the scarcity of available toxicity data there were only 4 compounds included in the regression analysis more reliable results will be obtained by incorporating more compounds in the model pahs always coexist as a mixture in the environment thus the total concentration of pahs is often recorded accordingly it is essential to develop the sqgs for total pahs sqgs for total pahs have been derived from the sum long et al 1995 the arithmetic mean swartz 1999 or the geometric mean macdonald et al 2000 of the sqgs values for individual pahs on account of the wide variation in the number and type of pahs detected in the sediments in our present study the geometric mean of the sqg values of the 16 individual pahs i e 0 97 mg kg dry weight f oc 1 was proposed as the sqg for total pahs ʃpahs table 2 due to the diverse concepts and methods for sqgs the sqg values for total pahs have a wide range from 0 197 to 100 mg kg table 2 in norway a marine and estuarine sqg for total pahs of 2 0 mg kg f oc 1 was used to distinguish good quality and moderate quality sediments bakke et al 2010 based on the chronic molar sqgs acute molar sqgs and the average molecular weight for total pahs simpson et al 2013 recommended that the sqgv and sqg high value for australia and new zealand be set respectively as 10 and 50 mg kg f oc 1 and used them for assessing the remediation of gasworks impacted sediments simpson et al 2020 in our present study sqg for total pahs was calculated equally from sqgs of the 16 pahs ignoring the compositions of pahs in the sediments the sqg value of 0 97 mg kg lies between that of pyrene 1 17 mg kg and fluoranthene 0 89 mg kg table 2 therefore this sqg value may underestimate the ecological risk if the sediments contain mostly high molecular weight pahs with four or more rings more hydrophobic than fluoranthene while overestimate the risk if contain mostly low molecular weight pahs with less than four rings less hydrophobic than pyrene 3 3 pahs concentrations and the related risk quotients in sediments of haihe river seventeen sediments collected from haihe river were analyzed to detect pahs contamination for the reason that most of the sampling sites are far from industrial areas the pahs concentrations in these sediments are relatively low relatively high levels of pahs were detected with confidence in four sediments s6 s10 s12 and s13 fig 2 table s5 and the total pahs concentrations all exceeded the sqg of 0 97 mg kg the 2 ring pah of naphthalene was minor in the sediments probably because of its higher water solubility than the other pahs the 3 to 6 ring pahs predominated at s12 and s13 but with relatively low concentrations in s6 and s10 however high molecular weight pahs especially 5 and 6 ring pahs contributed over 2 3 of the total concentration of pahs s12 and s13 were collected from the lower reaches of the river thus had possibly received pahs transported by water flow from the upstream in contrast the sampling site of s6 was located in the upper reaches and the pahs contamination was probably due to the local discharge the total concentration of pahs in s10 was 27 39 mg kg dry weight much higher than the other three sediments and over 28 times of the sqg in line with our study very high level of pahs was reported at s10 qian et al 2017 the sampling site of s10 was close to large petrochemical enterprises which might be the cause of high pahs concentrations at this site as one of the most important freshwater reservoir in north china haihe river basin supports several large cities including beijing and tianjin and is a highly developed region in china pahs contamination in some sediment of haihe river was attributed to industrial discharge and traffic emission jiang et al 2007 qian et al 2017 an extremely high concentration of 1943 mg kg of total pahs in sediment had been once detected in haihe river while pahs pollution is decreasing in recently years due to effective pollution control shi et al 2005 zhang et al 2021a the risk quotients of pahs in the four sediments s6 s10 s12 and s13 were calculated using the derived sqgs for individual pahs and total pahs qpahs and qʃpahs and the results are listed in table s6 qpahs is the sum of risk quotients derived from the individual sqgs and qʃpahs is the risk quotient derived from the sqg of total pahs both qpahs and qʃpahs represent the potential ecological risk of pahs mixture in the sediment the qpahs for s12 0 5 and s13 1 2 were relatively low while that of s6 4 4 was higher due to the higher pah concentrations and the lower f oc 0 90 at this site and it was as high as 11 5 at s10 there is a significant linear relationship between qʃpahs and qpahs p 0 01 fig s3 suggesting that the sqg derived for total pahs is useful as well as the individual sqgs in ecological risk assessment yet may underestimate the risk when the sediment contains mainly high molecular weight pahs 4 rings 3 4 testing the reliability of the derived sqgs using sediment toxicity the sediment toxicities of the 17 sediments collected from haihe river were evaluated using three representative benthic organisms based on multiple endpoints to evaluate the reliability of the sqgs for pahs in ecological risk assessment the correlation between the risk quotients of the pahs and the observed toxicities tested by benthic organisms expressed as toxic effect was inspected by simple linear regression as shown in fig 3 a and b both the log qpahs and log qʃpahs have poor linear relations with the observed toxic effects p 0 713 and 0 778 implying that other toxicants in the sediments might make contributions to the toxic effects in our previous study zhang et al 2021b heavy metals were measured in these sediment samples thus the qmetals were also calculated as the sum of risk quotients for five individual heavy metals cd cu ni pb zn given the complex mechanisms of joint toxicity of pahs and heavy metals q metals pahs 2 and q metals ʃpahs 2 are calculated as the average of risk quotients for pahs and metals fig 3 c and d illustrate that when the risk quotients of heavy metals were incorporated the correlations between log q metals pahs 2 as well as log q metals ʃpahs 2 and the observed sediment toxicities increased significantly p 0 074 and 0 018 the result magnified that both pahs and heavy metals made dominant contributions to the toxicities of the sediment this also suggests that the empirical sqgs based on field sediments might incorporate large uncertainty due to the coexistent of various toxicants while the derived sqgs of pahs using ssd approach in this study are valuable for risk assessment of field contaminated sediments 4 conclusions in this study freshwater sqgs for individual and total pahs were derived with ssd method sediment toxicity data based on whole sediment tests and from conversion of water only tests were employed for ssd fitting to develop sqgs for four representative pahs based on the significant relationship between the sqgs and log k ow the sqgs of the other 12 pahs and total pahs were proposed the obtained sqgs were applied to evaluate the pahs related risk quotients in the field sediments from haihe river of china the risk quotients based on sqgs for individual and total pahs were very similar and highly correlated as the risk quotients of pahs and heavy metals in the sediment samples were summed up a good correlation was found between them and the observed toxic effects tested by benthic organisms it showed that the pahs sqgs are promising in ecological risk assessment for contaminated field sediments in consideration of the joint toxicity of pahs and heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

ecms leveraging non radical pathways are rarely explored herein we demonstrated a janus ecm realizing ultra efficient micropollutant mp removal via electro activating peroxymonosulfate pms in a fast flow through single pass electro filtration the janus ecm features two separate palladium pd functionalized electrocatalytic reaction zones engineered on its two sides we confirmed that the pms electro filtration system induced non radical pathways for mp degradation including singlet oxygenation and mediating direct electron transfer det from mp to pms under the design of the ecm featuring dual electrocatalytic reaction zones in the ceramic membrane intrapores the janus ecm showed over one fold increase in micropollutant removal rate as 94 5 and lower electric energy consumption as 1 78 wh g 1 mp in the pms electro activation process as compared with the conventional ecm assembly implementing only half cell reaction this finding manifested the janus ecm configuration advantage for maximizing the pms electro activation efficiency via singlet oxygenation intensification and direct usage of cathode for det mediation the janus ecm boosted the pms electro activation and water decontamination efficiency by enhancing the convective mass transfer and the spatial confinement effect our work demonstrated a high efficiency pms electro activation method based on electro filtration and maximized the non radical mediated pms oxidation for mp removal expanding the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrified membrane ceramic membrane peroxymonosulfate micropollutant water decontamination 1 introduction water purification technology using low pressure driven lpd membrane is one of the leading approaches for augmenting clean water supply lpd membranes applied in gravity driven membrane filtration microfiltration and ultrafiltration show high water productivity cost effectiveness and broad practicability for decentralized point of use systems and large scale water treatment plants peter varbanets et al 2009 pronk et al 2019 porous ceramic membranes are promising options in lpd membrane filtration owing to their high robustness i e high thermal mechanical and chemical resistance and long service lifespan however lpd ceramic membranes are unable to remove emerging recalcitrant micropollutants mps such as antibiotics pesticides and dyes by the size exclusion effect to achieve mps removal by lpd ceramic membranes solutions including membrane surface functionalization and nanostructure engineering have been successfully explored to impart additional functionalities to ceramic membranes e g photoactivity berger et al 2020 park et al 2021 and electroactivity gayen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 the functionalized ceramic membranes can integrate fit for purpose catalytic reactions with filtration process demonstrating enhanced water treatment performances in removing micropollutants than conventional lpd ceramic membranes electrified lpdm featuring a porous structure can leverage in situ electrochemical reactions during membrane filtration to remove mps under both harsh and mild conditions sun et al 2021 trellu et al 2018 the primary merit of the electrified membrane em is its fast kinetics of electrochemical reactions for mps degradation and minimal disposal of concentrated waste streams to the environment li et al 2021 zhu and jassby 2019 notably ceramic membranes with high resilience to chemical oxidation and strong stability is considered as an ideal substrate for em gayen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 electrified ceramic membranes ecms have been widely investigated for water decontamination including mps removal jiang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a typical ecms focus on hydroxyl radical oh mediated electro filtration for mps removal where oh is in situ generated by the anodic oxidation of h2o zaky and chaplin 2014 or cathodic fenton reaction jiang et al 2018 liang et al 2016 however non radical oxidation pathways are less explored in ecm filtrations for mps removal comparing with radical based oxidation non radical mediated oxidation pathways such as direct electron transfer det exhibit high resilience of mp removal under complex water matrices as it cannot be influenced by the radical scavengers such as natural organic matter and inorganic anions ren et al 2021 therefore exploring ecms which exploit non radical mediated mps degradation pathways may expand the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination peroxymonosulfate pms has been increasingly recognized as an alternative potent and green oxidant for water decontamination zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a electro activated pms oxidations can remove mps via radical oxidation e g so4 or non radical oxidation pathway specifically non radical oxidation pathway includes singlet oxygenation and det oxidation pathways fu et al 2022 li et al 2019 nevertheless the reported electro activated pms oxidation processes are generally conducted in conventional electrochemical systems with flow by mode i e convective transport is parallel to the electrode surface where the electrochemical degradation rate of mps is hindered by the thick diffusional boundary layer of the electrode ca 100 μm chaplin 2019 contrastively the ecms feature microporous and high surface area structures the electro filtration using ecms can enable flow through mode i e convective transport is vertical to the electrode surface which notably reduces the diffusional boundary layer thickness to the range of pore radius and renders a large amount of surface area electro active chaplin 2019 liu and vecitis 2012 consequently electro filtration using ecms enhances both charge transfer and mass transport showing electrochemical reaction rates an order of magnitude higher than those of the conventional flow by electrochemical systems huang et al 2017a liu et al 2019 recently we successfully conceived a novel janus ecm and its corresponding flow through electro filtration configuration zhao et al 2020b the janus ecm features two separate electrochemical reaction zones inside a porous ceramic membrane yang et al 2018a huang et al 2017b such membrane configuration can incorporate an overall electrochemical redox reaction in membrane intrapores during filtration differing from the conventional ems that implement half cell reaction either cathodic or anodic reaction the janus ecm shows key advantages of i maximizing the beneficial effect of the convective enhanced mass transfer of the flow through electro filtration and ii enhancing the spatial confinement effect of membrane pores these key merits accelerate mp degradation and increase electric energy utilization efficiency of the electro filtration system given the advantages of the electro activated pms process and the janus ecm configuration it is imperative to investigate the performance of the pms janus ecm system and to understand the underlying electro oxidation mechanisms herein we demonstrate for the first time a pms janus ecm filtration system for highly efficient mps removal a janus ecm was prepared by sputtering palladium pd particles on the two sides of a porous microfiltration ceramic membrane substrate denoted as pdcm forming dual electrochemical reaction zones in the pdcm noble metal pd was chosen as it exhibits high electrical conductivity ren et al 2020 and is shown to activate pms without electric stimulation via a non radical pathway with higher activation efficiency than other noble metals e g pt au ag and benchmark pms activators e g co2 ahn et al 2016 we first comprehensively characterize the physicochemical and electrical properties of the pdcm we then evaluate mp removal efficiency and electric energy consumption of the pms pdcm electro filtration system using methylene blue as a model mp we further conducted a thorough mechanism analysis of the oxidation pathways in the pms pdcm electro filtration system contributing to the mp removal overall the development of the pms janus ecm filtration configuration and elucidation of the underlying mechanism can provide guidance on the smart design of high performance ecm filtration systems for water decontamination 2 materials and methods 2 1

phillipsburg nj usa pristine ceramic membrane cm molecular weight cut off 300 kda diameter 47 mm thickness 2 5 mm was purchased from sterlitech co the main components of cm are titanium oxide tio2 and zirconium oxide zro2 solutions were prepared using deionized water purified by a milli q system 2 2 fabrication and characterization of pdcm pdcm was fabricated by confocal magnetron co sputtering aja international atc 2200 according to our previously reported procedures zhao et al 2020b deposition thickness of pd was regulated as 30 nm on both surfaces of the pristine cm the microscopic morphologies of the membranes were measured by scanning electron microscopy sem su8230 hitachi and the distribution of pd element was detected by x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds xflash 5060fq bruker x ray diffraction xrd patterns were analyzed by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps escalab 250xi with monochromatic al kα radiation source was employed to investigate the element valence states the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces was characterized by a contact angle goniometer contact angle meter qspj 360 jinshengxin china 2 3 electro filtration performance tests electro filtration performance was evaluated using a customized cross flow filtration setup which comprised of a feed chamber 12 ml a permeate chamber 12 ml and affiliated valves for cross flow circulation and permeation a membrane was placed between the feed and permeate chambers during filtration unless otherwise noted the top surface facing the feed side and bottom surface facing the permeate side of the pdcm functioned as the cathode and anode respectively and were connected to a dc power supply e3617a hewlett packard a multimeter fluke 87 v everett wa was also connected in series to the system for current measurement additionally a porous titanium ti mesh plate with the same area as pdcm was used as a counter electrode in the electro filtration where pdcm functioned only as cathode or anode during the electro filtration a constant voltage of 1 6 v was applied to the pdcm and the transmembrane pressure and filtration volume were set as 0 1 bar and 50 ml respectively the cross flow velocity was controlled as 0 8 l min 1 by a gear pump cole parmer instrument company vernon hills il usa unless otherwise noted 10 μm mb and 10 mm na2so4 were used as the feed solution ph 5 7 0 1 mm pms was added to the feed solution immediately before the electro filtration the detection of mb was conducted by a uv vis spectrophotometer rf 5301 pc shimadzu at a wavelength of 665 nm the detection of pms concentration was conducted by the abts method yang et al 2015 with detailed information given in text s1 supporting information 2 4 electrochemical measurements to evaluate the conductivity enhancement of pdcm relative to the pristine cm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was carried out using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instruments the electrochemical workstation used a three electrode cell with a membrane a platinum wire and an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively eis was tested under the following condition frequency range of 106 1 hz electrolyte solution of 10 mm na2so4 solution to investigate the electron transfer mediating action of pdcm cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca tests were conducted using the electrochemical working station parstat302n metrohm during the cv and ca tests 1 2 piece of the pdcm was employed for detection the two surfaces of the pdcm were used as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively and an ag agcl electrode was used as the reference electrode cv measurement was recorded with a scan rate of 100 mv s 1 ca measurement was conducted with the working electrode biased at a given potential monitoring the current changes in response to the sequential addition of pms and mb 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural properties of the pdcm pdcm was prepared by sputtering pd nanoparticles nps on the top and bottom surfaces of an electric insulating cm substrate via the method of confocal magnetron co sputtering as illustrated in fig 1 a a discernible color transformation of pdcm compared to that of the pristine cm was observed fig s1 supporting information the microscopic morphologies of pdcm were characterized by sem with eds elemental mapping pd nps were evenly scattered on membrane top and bottom surfaces as evidenced by the uniform distribution of pd elemental mapping signals in fig s2 notably profound sputtered depths of approximately 60 and 90 μm fig 1b and c were noticed for the respective pd layers reaching from membrane top and bottom surfaces towards internal pore channels this ensured electrocatalytic reactions occurring inside membrane porous structures instead of membrane surfaces the greater sputtered depth as compared with the initial sputtered thickness 30 nm was ascribed to the distinct asymmetric porous architecture of cm which caused sputtered pd nps penetrating membrane surface and attaching within pore channels xps characterization of the pdcm top surface fig 1d showed that the characteristic peaks of pd 3d3 2 and pd 3d5 2 were centered at the binding energies of 340 5 and 335 3 ev this suggested the presence of two chemical states where pd0 was the dominant component coexisting with pd2 due to partial surface oxidation niu et al 2017 additionally as illustrated in fig 1e the pdcm top surface showed an xrd diffraction peak at 39 2 which was indexed to 111 plane of the characteristic face centered cubic fcc crystal structure of pd0 jcpds no 46 1043 patil et al 2008 this broad xrd peak and the lack of more detectable xrd peaks of pd0 could be ascribed to the high dispersion of pd nps enabled by confocal magnetron sputtering venezia et al 2001 and the rather low amount of pd loading similar information of the pdcm bottom surface was obtained from the xps and xrd analyses in figs s3 and s5 pdcm showed similar water permeability compared to the pristine cm under diverse transmembrane pressures fig s6 indicating that the attachment of pd nps did not cause significant aggregation or pore blocking inside membrane porous structures this observation coincided with the xrd analysis pertaining high dispersion of pd nps fig 1e additionally pdcm exhibited resembling hydrophilic attributes as the pristine cm according to the measurement of water contact angles fig s7 the uncompromised permeability and hydrophilicity guaranteed comparable water production and anti fouling efficiency of the pdcm as those of the pristine cm lu et al 2016 zhao et al 2020a the cost effectiveness of the pdcm was compared with that of other reported electrified membranes based on the analysis of the factors including material conductivity stability cost and commercialization as shown in table s1 the cost of pd for fabricating janus ecm is comparable i e 44 9 m2 membrane surface to that of other typical electrified membranes this is due to the sputtering of an ultrathin pd coating 30 nm on the membrane substrate 3 2 electrical properties of the pdcm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was employed to analyze the electrical properties of the pdcm figs 2 a and 2b showed the nyquist plots of both surfaces of the pdcm with frequency ranging from 106 to 1 hz for each case the nyquist plot consists of a semicircle at high frequency region and a nonvertical line at low frequency region as illustrated at the top of fig 2a the semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance depicting the internal impedance within the porous electrode mei et al 2018 the following nonvertical line shows the diffusion of mobile ions in the electrolyte from figs 2a and 2b the semicircles of pdcm top and bottom surfaces are notably smaller than the corresponding surfaces of the pristine cm this indicates that the charge transfer resistance within both surfaces of the pdcm is greatly reduced after metal sputtering a randles circuit model fig 2c was further employed to interpret the impedance performance of the pdcm chen et al 2019 sun et al 2018 the fitting curves were shown in figs 2a and 2b in this model resistor ro is connected in series with a parallel combination of a constant phase element cpe and a combined resistance rct and w here cpe is employed in place of a capacitor to compensate for the inhomogeneity and porosity of the pdcm sun et al 2018 additionally rct represents the charge transfer resistance inside the porous electrode ro encompasses other resistances in the system including solution resistance and contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector qin et al 2019 w or warburg impedance stands for the electrolyte diffusion resistance from table s2 rct values of the pdcm top and bottom surfaces are 866 and 750 7 ω 10 times smaller than those of cm substrate surfaces i e 8049 and 9025 ω this result confirms that the seeding of pd nanoparticles inside porous cm markedly enhances the charge transfer within membrane ro values of the pdcm are also smaller than those of the pristine cm which is likely due to the mitigation of the contact resistance between the membrane and the current collector taken together benefit from pd seeding inside porous membrane the effect of charge transfer within the membrane is greatly intensified as illustrated in fig 2d 3 3 pdcm performance and energy efficiency in electro activating pms for micropollutant removal the performance of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms was investigated in a customized cross flow low pressure filtration device as shown in fig 3 a during filtration the cathodic and anodic sides of the pdcm faced the feed and the permeate respectively methylene blue mb a typical model mp was applied for indicating the water decontamination efficacy of the electro filtration system as shown in fig 3b the single pass pms janus pdcm electro filtration showed an ultra efficient mb removal 94 5 under a low dc supply of 1 6 v to the pdcm the residence time inside the membrane was ca 23 s which was two orders of magnitude lower than those of the flow by pms electro activation systems li et al 2019 liu et al 2019b the efficacy of the pms janus pdcm electro filtration was further compared with those of other catalytic and electrocatalytic filtration configurations as shown in fig 3c bare pdcm filtration showed certain mb removal i e 27 4 which is likely due to the mb adsorption on the membrane instead of the size exclusion effect of the porous pdcm given the significantly lower molecular weight of mb 319 85 da than the molecular weight cut off of the pdcm ca 300 kda compared with the bare pdcm filtration the non electric pms pdcm filtration exhibited a nearly one fold increase of the mb removal rate this could be ascribed to the effective pms activation by pd as the noble metals pd along with pt and au were shown to outperform benchmark pms activators i e cobalt ions for organics degradation ahn et al 2016 when adding only a half cell reaction to the pdcm where pdcm served as either cathode or anode the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems slightly increased mb removal to 60 1 and 55 6 as compared with the non electric pms pdcm filtration further when integrating both cathodic and anodic reactions inside the pdcm for pms electro activation the mb removal rate notably improved to 94 5 the stability of the pms pdcm electro filtration for mb removal was also well retained as shown in fig s8 following a similar trend as the mb removal the pms janus pdcm electro filtration demonstrated enhanced current density than those of the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems red diamond fig 3c confirming the improved electron transfer within the janus pdcm membrane porous structure fig 2d overall these results collectively indicated the key role of using both sides of the pdcm as electrodes for intensifying pms activating performance while integrating a half cell reaction in the pdcm can only slightly improve the ability of the pdcm in activating pms besides water decontamination efficiency electric energy consumption ec is another prominent factor for evaluating the electro filtration system as shown in fig 3d black squares among the pdcm electro filtration systems the pms janus pdcm electro filtration consumed the maximum amount of ec i e 5 376 wh m 3 mainly due to the highest current density when taking the mb removal efficacy into account the specific energy consumption sec red circles fig 3d of the pms janus pdcm electro filtration was lower than the secs of the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems which indicated the enhanced energy efficiency of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms on the other hand the janus pdcm electro filtration without pms addition showed the lowest ec and sec among all electro filtration modes in fig 3d this suggests that while the pms chemical addition into the electro filtration system can improve the water decontamination performance it also enhances the system energy consumption mainly due to the enhanced electron transfer i e current density furthermore as compared with other reported electro filtration systems the pms pdcm electro filtration system showed a high mp removal rate and the lowest electric energy consumption table s3 indicating high efficiency of water decontamination in addition the removal efficiency of typical micropollutants by the pms pdcm electro filtration system was examined as shown in fig s9 the pms pdcm electro filtration system exhibited near complete removal of phenol and over 85 removal of sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a and 4 chlorophenol further indicating the high efficiency of the electro filtration system in water decontamination 3 4 mechanisms of pms pdcm electro filtration system on mb removal the fundamental mechanism of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms was investigated as follows mb removal by the electrocatalytic pms pdcm system could be ascribed to two routes which are i the indirect oxidation by the in situ generated reactive species and ii det between pms and mb via pdcm as the electron mediator to confirm the first route scavenge tests of the reactive species were conducted pms is able to produce reactive species via activation including sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2020 scavengers of these species were chosen according to their known kinetic rate constants with the reactive species table s4 the addition of tba and etoh both caused minor influence on the mb removal rate yellow circle and blue triangle fig 4 a indicating a negligible contribution of so4 and oh on the other hand ffa a benchmark 1o2 scavenger more notably suppressed mb removal from 94 5 to 72 red diamond fig 4a it is worth noting that ffa can directly react with pms owing to the possible electrophilic attack of the ffa diene structure by the distal o of pms yang et al 2018a therefore the inhibitory effect by ffa may not serve as an effective indicator for 1o2 existence in the pms involved systems other typical 1o2 scavengers i e l histidine and sodium azide also show similar limitations due to their direct reaction with pms lee et al 2020 yang et al 2018b electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection is applied for further analysis of 1o2 1o2 can react with the trapping agent temp to form tempo exhibiting a triplet signal in the epr spectrum the characteristic signal of tempo increased by nine fold red line fig 4b when pdcm electrically activated pms as compared with the non electric pms pdcm system blue line fig 4b it is worth noting that other than 1o2 oxidation temp may undergo an alternative route to form tempo where temp is abstracted by one electron to form temp and temp further undergoes deprotonation and oxygenation to form tempo nardi et al 2014 given the intrinsic property of pms as an electron trapper chu et al 2019 pms can likely abstract electron from temp to form temp yun et al 2018 therefore the enhanced tempo signal in fig 4b could be interpreted by the enhanced 1o2 formation or the improved det effect between pms and temp via pdcm as the electron mediator the kinetic solvent isotope effect ksie has been considered as a diagnostic method to investigate 1o2 contribution towards organics degradation due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 67 μs than that in h2o solvent 3 6 μs davis et al 2018 nonell and flors 2016 the enhanced degradation of the organics in the d2o enriched environment is generally ascribed to this 1o2 specific ksie from fig 4c mb removal rate increased by 34 in d2o solvent suggesting that singlet oxygenation contributes to mb removal additionally it is worth noting that the ksie in d2o not only affects 1o2 reactivity but may also impose other influences e g enhancing the reaction kinetics of certain intermediate organic radicals davis et al 2018 and lowering the activity of reactants shao et al 2021 as shown in the inset of fig 4c the pms decomposition rate is reduced by ca 4 3 times in d2o solvent than in h2o solvent suggesting the retardation of pms reactivity by d2o this could be ascribed to that the h atom of the oh group of pms can readily be replaced by d atom and that the d substituted compounds are less reactive than the h containing counterparts due to the lower zero point energy of deuterium than that of hydrogen shao et al 2021 hence ksie by d2o exhibits a contradictory effect on the pms involved systems as it simultaneously hinders pms activation while improving 1o2 longevity combining the results of improved mb removal in d2o solvent and hindered pms reactivity fig 4c it is reasonable to deduce that 1o2 contributes to mb removal in the pms pdcm electro filtration system however more rigorous analytical methods including in situ time resolved detection of phenomena e g catalytic reaction reactive species generation and ion solvation occurring inside membrane pores are needed to further clarify the 1o2 related reaction pathways during membrane filtration the contribution of det on both cathodic and anodic sides of the pdcm towards mb removal was investigated via cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca measurements at the cathodic side of the pdcm a distinctive cv peak occurred at an applied potential of 0 5 v vs ag agcl by the injection of mb into the solution blue line fig 5 a suggesting that det is achievable in the presence of mb to further clarify the det at the voltage of 0 5 v vs ag agcl ca was performed on the cathodic side of the pdcm following the sequential addition of pms and mb into the na2so4 electrolyte resulting chronoamperogram showed that in response to mb addition the current intensity increased drastically and became stable afterward fig 5b this corroborated with the det reaction pathway where the cathodic pdcm served as an electron mediator between pms electron acceptor and mb electron donor in addition previous reports showed that without electricity input pd activates pms mainly through electron transfer mediation instead of the reduction conversion of pms to radicals ahn et al 2016 these findings indicated that the cathodic activation likely stimulates pd to enhance det between pms and organic compounds on the other hand at the anodic side of the pdcm fig 5c the indiscernible difference in the cv curves following the addition of mb suggests a negligible det effect when pdcm functions as an anode taken together the janus pdcm electro activates pms mainly by singlet oxygenation and cathodic det while the radical i e so4 and oh mediated oxidation and anodic det contributed little the det reaction pathway induced by the pdcm is likely triggered by the high adsorption ability and high electrical conductivity of the pdcm specifically pd nanoparticles have been proved to promote the adsorption of chemicals on the pd catalyst surface which is the primary step for inducing electron transfer reaction qin et al 2022 long et al 2013 the subsequent electron transfer is further enhanced by the pdcm mediating as an efficient electron transfer shuttle in addition the generation of 1o2 could be due to that during pms activation pd nanoparticles facilitate the electron transfer between 1o2 precursors e g pd oh and pd o via the chemisorption of 1o2 precursors onto the pd nanoparticles leading to the activation of oxygen from its ground state triplet to a high energy state singlet wang et al 2017 the products of mb by the pms pdcm electro filtration were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis the detected products of mb agree well with the reported oxidation products of mb by 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer wang et al 2022 fig s10 detailed detection methods are provided in the supplementary information a possible degradation pathway of mb was proposed accordingly in fig s11 including the demethylation at the n sites of the phenothiazine ring and the consequent ring cleavage to form smaller molecules 4 conclusion this study demonstrated a janus pdcm for high efficiency pms activation and high performance mp degradation in a single pass flow through electro filtration process as shown in fig 6 the janus pdcm featured dual electrocatalytic pd reaction zones inside cm pores formed by magnetron sputtering the janus pdcm demonstrated uncompromised membrane permeability and hydrophilicity as compared with the pristine cm substrate combining the analyses of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and randles circuit model we demonstrated that the janus pdcm greatly intensified the charge transfer within the membrane benefiting from pd seeding inside membrane pores the single pass pms janus pdcm electro filtration exhibited an ultra efficient mb removal 94 5 under the condition of a low dc supply of 1 6 v to the pdcm and a short reaction time of ca 23 s inside the membrane the janus pdcm showed over one fold increase in the mb removal rate by electro activating pms compared to the single sided pdcm additionally the janus pdcm showed more readily electron transfer and lower specific electric energy consumption than the single sided pdcm these results corroborated the advantage of the janus ecm configuration for intensifying pms activation at a maximal and beneficial synergy of the flow through electro filtration and the spatial confinement effects in porous membranes further the underlying mechanisms of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms were investigated epr reactive species quenching tests and kinetic solvent isotope experiments collectively indicated that so4 and oh played a minor role whereas 1o2 oxidation should contribute to mb removal from cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements the cathodic pdcm surface also promoted mb removal by mediating det from mb to pms whereas the anodic pdcm exhibited a negligible det effect overall our work demonstrated a janus ecm configuration for high efficiency pms electro activation and maximized the non radical mediated pms oxidation for mp removal expanding the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination this high performance electro filtration system has promising prospects in applications such as fast water purification and water pollution control

ecms leveraging non radical pathways are rarely explored herein we demonstrated a janus ecm realizing ultra efficient micropollutant mp removal via electro activating peroxymonosulfate pms in a fast flow through single pass electro filtration the janus ecm features two separate palladium pd functionalized electrocatalytic reaction zones engineered on its two sides we confirmed that the pms electro filtration system induced non radical pathways for mp degradation including singlet oxygenation and mediating direct electron transfer det from mp to pms under the design of the ecm featuring dual electrocatalytic reaction zones in the ceramic membrane intrapores the janus ecm showed over one fold increase in micropollutant removal rate as 94 5 and lower electric energy consumption as 1 78 wh g 1 mp in the pms electro activation process as compared with the conventional ecm assembly implementing only half cell reaction this finding manifested the janus ecm configuration advantage for maximizing the pms electro activation efficiency via singlet oxygenation intensification and direct usage of cathode for det mediation the janus ecm boosted the pms electro activation and water decontamination efficiency by enhancing the convective mass transfer and the spatial confinement effect our work demonstrated a high efficiency pms electro activation method based on electro filtration and maximized the non radical mediated pms oxidation for mp removal expanding the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrified membrane ceramic membrane peroxymonosulfate micropollutant water decontamination 1 introduction water purification technology using low pressure driven lpd membrane is one of the leading approaches for augmenting clean water supply lpd membranes applied in gravity driven membrane filtration microfiltration and ultrafiltration show high water productivity cost effectiveness and broad practicability for decentralized point of use systems and large scale water treatment plants peter varbanets et al 2009 pronk et al 2019 porous ceramic membranes are promising options in lpd membrane filtration owing to their high robustness i e high thermal mechanical and chemical resistance and long service lifespan however lpd ceramic membranes are unable to remove emerging recalcitrant micropollutants mps such as antibiotics pesticides and dyes by the size exclusion effect to achieve mps removal by lpd ceramic membranes solutions including membrane surface functionalization and nanostructure engineering have been successfully explored to impart additional functionalities to ceramic membranes e g photoactivity berger et al 2020 park et al 2021 and electroactivity gayen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 the functionalized ceramic membranes can integrate fit for purpose catalytic reactions with filtration process demonstrating enhanced water treatment performances in removing micropollutants than conventional lpd ceramic membranes electrified lpdm featuring a porous structure can leverage in situ electrochemical reactions during membrane filtration to remove mps under both harsh and mild conditions sun et al 2021 trellu et al 2018 the primary merit of the electrified membrane em is its fast kinetics of electrochemical reactions for mps degradation and minimal disposal of concentrated waste streams to the environment li et al 2021 zhu and jassby 2019 notably ceramic membranes with high resilience to chemical oxidation and strong stability is considered as an ideal substrate for em gayen et al 2018 sun et al 2021 electrified ceramic membranes ecms have been widely investigated for water decontamination including mps removal jiang et al 2018 zhao et al 2020a typical ecms focus on hydroxyl radical oh mediated electro filtration for mps removal where oh is in situ generated by the anodic oxidation of h2o zaky and chaplin 2014 or cathodic fenton reaction jiang et al 2018 liang et al 2016 however non radical oxidation pathways are less explored in ecm filtrations for mps removal comparing with radical based oxidation non radical mediated oxidation pathways such as direct electron transfer det exhibit high resilience of mp removal under complex water matrices as it cannot be influenced by the radical scavengers such as natural organic matter and inorganic anions ren et al 2021 therefore exploring ecms which exploit non radical mediated mps degradation pathways may expand the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination peroxymonosulfate pms has been increasingly recognized as an alternative potent and green oxidant for water decontamination zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a electro activated pms oxidations can remove mps via radical oxidation e g so4 or non radical oxidation pathway specifically non radical oxidation pathway includes singlet oxygenation and det oxidation pathways fu et al 2022 li et al 2019 nevertheless the reported electro activated pms oxidation processes are generally conducted in conventional electrochemical systems with flow by mode i e convective transport is parallel to the electrode surface where the electrochemical degradation rate of mps is hindered by the thick diffusional boundary layer of the electrode ca 100 μm chaplin 2019 contrastively the ecms feature microporous and high surface area structures the electro filtration using ecms can enable flow through mode i e convective transport is vertical to the electrode surface which notably reduces the diffusional boundary layer thickness to the range of pore radius and renders a large amount of surface area electro active chaplin 2019 liu and vecitis 2012 consequently electro filtration using ecms enhances both charge transfer and mass transport showing electrochemical reaction rates an order of magnitude higher than those of the conventional flow by electrochemical systems huang et al 2017a liu et al 2019 recently we successfully conceived a novel janus ecm and its corresponding flow through electro filtration configuration zhao et al 2020b the janus ecm features two separate electrochemical reaction zones inside a porous ceramic membrane yang et al 2018a huang et al 2017b such membrane configuration can incorporate an overall electrochemical redox reaction in membrane intrapores during filtration differing from the conventional ems that implement half cell reaction either cathodic or anodic reaction the janus ecm shows key advantages of i maximizing the beneficial effect of the convective enhanced mass transfer of the flow through electro filtration and ii enhancing the spatial confinement effect of membrane pores these key merits accelerate mp degradation and increase electric energy utilization efficiency of the electro filtration system given the advantages of the electro activated pms process and the janus ecm configuration it is imperative to investigate the performance of the pms janus ecm system and to understand the underlying electro oxidation mechanisms herein we demonstrate for the first time a pms janus ecm filtration system for highly efficient mps removal a janus ecm was prepared by sputtering palladium pd particles on the two sides of a porous microfiltration ceramic membrane substrate denoted as pdcm forming dual electrochemical reaction zones in the pdcm noble metal pd was chosen as it exhibits high electrical conductivity ren et al 2020 and is shown to activate pms without electric stimulation via a non radical pathway with higher activation efficiency than other noble metals e g pt au ag and benchmark pms activators e g co2 ahn et al 2016 we first comprehensively characterize the physicochemical and electrical properties of the pdcm we then evaluate mp removal efficiency and electric energy consumption of the pms pdcm electro filtration system using methylene blue as a model mp we further conducted a thorough mechanism analysis of the oxidation pathways in the pms pdcm electro filtration system contributing to the mp removal overall the development of the pms janus ecm filtration configuration and elucidation of the underlying mechanism can provide guidance on the smart design of high performance ecm filtration systems for water decontamination 2 materials and methods 2 1

phillipsburg nj usa pristine ceramic membrane cm molecular weight cut off 300 kda diameter 47 mm thickness 2 5 mm was purchased from sterlitech co the main components of cm are titanium oxide tio2 and zirconium oxide zro2 solutions were prepared using deionized water purified by a milli q system 2 2 fabrication and characterization of pdcm pdcm was fabricated by confocal magnetron co sputtering aja international atc 2200 according to our previously reported procedures zhao et al 2020b deposition thickness of pd was regulated as 30 nm on both surfaces of the pristine cm the microscopic morphologies of the membranes were measured by scanning electron microscopy sem su8230 hitachi and the distribution of pd element was detected by x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds xflash 5060fq bruker x ray diffraction xrd patterns were analyzed by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps escalab 250xi with monochromatic al kα radiation source was employed to investigate the element valence states the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces was characterized by a contact angle goniometer contact angle meter qspj 360 jinshengxin china 2 3 electro filtration performance tests electro filtration performance was evaluated using a customized cross flow filtration setup which comprised of a feed chamber 12 ml a permeate chamber 12 ml and affiliated valves for cross flow circulation and permeation a membrane was placed between the feed and permeate chambers during filtration unless otherwise noted the top surface facing the feed side and bottom surface facing the permeate side of the pdcm functioned as the cathode and anode respectively and were connected to a dc power supply e3617a hewlett packard a multimeter fluke 87 v everett wa was also connected in series to the system for current measurement additionally a porous titanium ti mesh plate with the same area as pdcm was used as a counter electrode in the electro filtration where pdcm functioned only as cathode or anode during the electro filtration a constant voltage of 1 6 v was applied to the pdcm and the transmembrane pressure and filtration volume were set as 0 1 bar and 50 ml respectively the cross flow velocity was controlled as 0 8 l min 1 by a gear pump cole parmer instrument company vernon hills il usa unless otherwise noted 10 μm mb and 10 mm na2so4 were used as the feed solution ph 5 7 0 1 mm pms was added to the feed solution immediately before the electro filtration the detection of mb was conducted by a uv vis spectrophotometer rf 5301 pc shimadzu at a wavelength of 665 nm the detection of pms concentration was conducted by the abts method yang et al 2015 with detailed information given in text s1 supporting information 2 4 electrochemical measurements to evaluate the conductivity enhancement of pdcm relative to the pristine cm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was carried out using an electrochemical workstation chi 660e ch instruments the electrochemical workstation used a three electrode cell with a membrane a platinum wire and an ag agcl electrode as the working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively eis was tested under the following condition frequency range of 106 1 hz electrolyte solution of 10 mm na2so4 solution to investigate the electron transfer mediating action of pdcm cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca tests were conducted using the electrochemical working station parstat302n metrohm during the cv and ca tests 1 2 piece of the pdcm was employed for detection the two surfaces of the pdcm were used as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively and an ag agcl electrode was used as the reference electrode cv measurement was recorded with a scan rate of 100 mv s 1 ca measurement was conducted with the working electrode biased at a given potential monitoring the current changes in response to the sequential addition of pms and mb 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural properties of the pdcm pdcm was prepared by sputtering pd nanoparticles nps on the top and bottom surfaces of an electric insulating cm substrate via the method of confocal magnetron co sputtering as illustrated in fig 1 a a discernible color transformation of pdcm compared to that of the pristine cm was observed fig s1 supporting information the microscopic morphologies of pdcm were characterized by sem with eds elemental mapping pd nps were evenly scattered on membrane top and bottom surfaces as evidenced by the uniform distribution of pd elemental mapping signals in fig s2 notably profound sputtered depths of approximately 60 and 90 μm fig 1b and c were noticed for the respective pd layers reaching from membrane top and bottom surfaces towards internal pore channels this ensured electrocatalytic reactions occurring inside membrane porous structures instead of membrane surfaces the greater sputtered depth as compared with the initial sputtered thickness 30 nm was ascribed to the distinct asymmetric porous architecture of cm which caused sputtered pd nps penetrating membrane surface and attaching within pore channels xps characterization of the pdcm top surface fig 1d showed that the characteristic peaks of pd 3d3 2 and pd 3d5 2 were centered at the binding energies of 340 5 and 335 3 ev this suggested the presence of two chemical states where pd0 was the dominant component coexisting with pd2 due to partial surface oxidation niu et al 2017 additionally as illustrated in fig 1e the pdcm top surface showed an xrd diffraction peak at 39 2 which was indexed to 111 plane of the characteristic face centered cubic fcc crystal structure of pd0 jcpds no 46 1043 patil et al 2008 this broad xrd peak and the lack of more detectable xrd peaks of pd0 could be ascribed to the high dispersion of pd nps enabled by confocal magnetron sputtering venezia et al 2001 and the rather low amount of pd loading similar information of the pdcm bottom surface was obtained from the xps and xrd analyses in figs s3 and s5 pdcm showed similar water permeability compared to the pristine cm under diverse transmembrane pressures fig s6 indicating that the attachment of pd nps did not cause significant aggregation or pore blocking inside membrane porous structures this observation coincided with the xrd analysis pertaining high dispersion of pd nps fig 1e additionally pdcm exhibited resembling hydrophilic attributes as the pristine cm according to the measurement of water contact angles fig s7 the uncompromised permeability and hydrophilicity guaranteed comparable water production and anti fouling efficiency of the pdcm as those of the pristine cm lu et al 2016 zhao et al 2020a the cost effectiveness of the pdcm was compared with that of other reported electrified membranes based on the analysis of the factors including material conductivity stability cost and commercialization as shown in table s1 the cost of pd for fabricating janus ecm is comparable i e 44 9 m2 membrane surface to that of other typical electrified membranes this is due to the sputtering of an ultrathin pd coating 30 nm on the membrane substrate 3 2 electrical properties of the pdcm electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was employed to analyze the electrical properties of the pdcm figs 2 a and 2b showed the nyquist plots of both surfaces of the pdcm with frequency ranging from 106 to 1 hz for each case the nyquist plot consists of a semicircle at high frequency region and a nonvertical line at low frequency region as illustrated at the top of fig 2a the semicircle is attributed to the charge transfer resistance depicting the internal impedance within the porous electrode mei et al 2018 the following nonvertical line shows the diffusion of mobile ions in the electrolyte from figs 2a and 2b the semicircles of pdcm top and bottom surfaces are notably smaller than the corresponding surfaces of the pristine cm this indicates that the charge transfer resistance within both surfaces of the pdcm is greatly reduced after metal sputtering a randles circuit model fig 2c was further employed to interpret the impedance performance of the pdcm chen et al 2019 sun et al 2018 the fitting curves were shown in figs 2a and 2b in this model resistor ro is connected in series with a parallel combination of a constant phase element cpe and a combined resistance rct and w here cpe is employed in place of a capacitor to compensate for the inhomogeneity and porosity of the pdcm sun et al 2018 additionally rct represents the charge transfer resistance inside the porous electrode ro encompasses other resistances in the system including solution resistance and contact resistance between the electrode and the current collector qin et al 2019 w or warburg impedance stands for the electrolyte diffusion resistance from table s2 rct values of the pdcm top and bottom surfaces are 866 and 750 7 ω 10 times smaller than those of cm substrate surfaces i e 8049 and 9025 ω this result confirms that the seeding of pd nanoparticles inside porous cm markedly enhances the charge transfer within membrane ro values of the pdcm are also smaller than those of the pristine cm which is likely due to the mitigation of the contact resistance between the membrane and the current collector taken together benefit from pd seeding inside porous membrane the effect of charge transfer within the membrane is greatly intensified as illustrated in fig 2d 3 3 pdcm performance and energy efficiency in electro activating pms for micropollutant removal the performance of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms was investigated in a customized cross flow low pressure filtration device as shown in fig 3 a during filtration the cathodic and anodic sides of the pdcm faced the feed and the permeate respectively methylene blue mb a typical model mp was applied for indicating the water decontamination efficacy of the electro filtration system as shown in fig 3b the single pass pms janus pdcm electro filtration showed an ultra efficient mb removal 94 5 under a low dc supply of 1 6 v to the pdcm the residence time inside the membrane was ca 23 s which was two orders of magnitude lower than those of the flow by pms electro activation systems li et al 2019 liu et al 2019b the efficacy of the pms janus pdcm electro filtration was further compared with those of other catalytic and electrocatalytic filtration configurations as shown in fig 3c bare pdcm filtration showed certain mb removal i e 27 4 which is likely due to the mb adsorption on the membrane instead of the size exclusion effect of the porous pdcm given the significantly lower molecular weight of mb 319 85 da than the molecular weight cut off of the pdcm ca 300 kda compared with the bare pdcm filtration the non electric pms pdcm filtration exhibited a nearly one fold increase of the mb removal rate this could be ascribed to the effective pms activation by pd as the noble metals pd along with pt and au were shown to outperform benchmark pms activators i e cobalt ions for organics degradation ahn et al 2016 when adding only a half cell reaction to the pdcm where pdcm served as either cathode or anode the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems slightly increased mb removal to 60 1 and 55 6 as compared with the non electric pms pdcm filtration further when integrating both cathodic and anodic reactions inside the pdcm for pms electro activation the mb removal rate notably improved to 94 5 the stability of the pms pdcm electro filtration for mb removal was also well retained as shown in fig s8 following a similar trend as the mb removal the pms janus pdcm electro filtration demonstrated enhanced current density than those of the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems red diamond fig 3c confirming the improved electron transfer within the janus pdcm membrane porous structure fig 2d overall these results collectively indicated the key role of using both sides of the pdcm as electrodes for intensifying pms activating performance while integrating a half cell reaction in the pdcm can only slightly improve the ability of the pdcm in activating pms besides water decontamination efficiency electric energy consumption ec is another prominent factor for evaluating the electro filtration system as shown in fig 3d black squares among the pdcm electro filtration systems the pms janus pdcm electro filtration consumed the maximum amount of ec i e 5 376 wh m 3 mainly due to the highest current density when taking the mb removal efficacy into account the specific energy consumption sec red circles fig 3d of the pms janus pdcm electro filtration was lower than the secs of the pms single sided pdcm electro filtration systems which indicated the enhanced energy efficiency of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms on the other hand the janus pdcm electro filtration without pms addition showed the lowest ec and sec among all electro filtration modes in fig 3d this suggests that while the pms chemical addition into the electro filtration system can improve the water decontamination performance it also enhances the system energy consumption mainly due to the enhanced electron transfer i e current density furthermore as compared with other reported electro filtration systems the pms pdcm electro filtration system showed a high mp removal rate and the lowest electric energy consumption table s3 indicating high efficiency of water decontamination in addition the removal efficiency of typical micropollutants by the pms pdcm electro filtration system was examined as shown in fig s9 the pms pdcm electro filtration system exhibited near complete removal of phenol and over 85 removal of sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a and 4 chlorophenol further indicating the high efficiency of the electro filtration system in water decontamination 3 4 mechanisms of pms pdcm electro filtration system on mb removal the fundamental mechanism of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms was investigated as follows mb removal by the electrocatalytic pms pdcm system could be ascribed to two routes which are i the indirect oxidation by the in situ generated reactive species and ii det between pms and mb via pdcm as the electron mediator to confirm the first route scavenge tests of the reactive species were conducted pms is able to produce reactive species via activation including sulfate radical so4 hydroxyl radical oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2020 scavengers of these species were chosen according to their known kinetic rate constants with the reactive species table s4 the addition of tba and etoh both caused minor influence on the mb removal rate yellow circle and blue triangle fig 4 a indicating a negligible contribution of so4 and oh on the other hand ffa a benchmark 1o2 scavenger more notably suppressed mb removal from 94 5 to 72 red diamond fig 4a it is worth noting that ffa can directly react with pms owing to the possible electrophilic attack of the ffa diene structure by the distal o of pms yang et al 2018a therefore the inhibitory effect by ffa may not serve as an effective indicator for 1o2 existence in the pms involved systems other typical 1o2 scavengers i e l histidine and sodium azide also show similar limitations due to their direct reaction with pms lee et al 2020 yang et al 2018b electron paramagnetic resonance epr detection is applied for further analysis of 1o2 1o2 can react with the trapping agent temp to form tempo exhibiting a triplet signal in the epr spectrum the characteristic signal of tempo increased by nine fold red line fig 4b when pdcm electrically activated pms as compared with the non electric pms pdcm system blue line fig 4b it is worth noting that other than 1o2 oxidation temp may undergo an alternative route to form tempo where temp is abstracted by one electron to form temp and temp further undergoes deprotonation and oxygenation to form tempo nardi et al 2014 given the intrinsic property of pms as an electron trapper chu et al 2019 pms can likely abstract electron from temp to form temp yun et al 2018 therefore the enhanced tempo signal in fig 4b could be interpreted by the enhanced 1o2 formation or the improved det effect between pms and temp via pdcm as the electron mediator the kinetic solvent isotope effect ksie has been considered as a diagnostic method to investigate 1o2 contribution towards organics degradation due to the longer lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 67 μs than that in h2o solvent 3 6 μs davis et al 2018 nonell and flors 2016 the enhanced degradation of the organics in the d2o enriched environment is generally ascribed to this 1o2 specific ksie from fig 4c mb removal rate increased by 34 in d2o solvent suggesting that singlet oxygenation contributes to mb removal additionally it is worth noting that the ksie in d2o not only affects 1o2 reactivity but may also impose other influences e g enhancing the reaction kinetics of certain intermediate organic radicals davis et al 2018 and lowering the activity of reactants shao et al 2021 as shown in the inset of fig 4c the pms decomposition rate is reduced by ca 4 3 times in d2o solvent than in h2o solvent suggesting the retardation of pms reactivity by d2o this could be ascribed to that the h atom of the oh group of pms can readily be replaced by d atom and that the d substituted compounds are less reactive than the h containing counterparts due to the lower zero point energy of deuterium than that of hydrogen shao et al 2021 hence ksie by d2o exhibits a contradictory effect on the pms involved systems as it simultaneously hinders pms activation while improving 1o2 longevity combining the results of improved mb removal in d2o solvent and hindered pms reactivity fig 4c it is reasonable to deduce that 1o2 contributes to mb removal in the pms pdcm electro filtration system however more rigorous analytical methods including in situ time resolved detection of phenomena e g catalytic reaction reactive species generation and ion solvation occurring inside membrane pores are needed to further clarify the 1o2 related reaction pathways during membrane filtration the contribution of det on both cathodic and anodic sides of the pdcm towards mb removal was investigated via cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca measurements at the cathodic side of the pdcm a distinctive cv peak occurred at an applied potential of 0 5 v vs ag agcl by the injection of mb into the solution blue line fig 5 a suggesting that det is achievable in the presence of mb to further clarify the det at the voltage of 0 5 v vs ag agcl ca was performed on the cathodic side of the pdcm following the sequential addition of pms and mb into the na2so4 electrolyte resulting chronoamperogram showed that in response to mb addition the current intensity increased drastically and became stable afterward fig 5b this corroborated with the det reaction pathway where the cathodic pdcm served as an electron mediator between pms electron acceptor and mb electron donor in addition previous reports showed that without electricity input pd activates pms mainly through electron transfer mediation instead of the reduction conversion of pms to radicals ahn et al 2016 these findings indicated that the cathodic activation likely stimulates pd to enhance det between pms and organic compounds on the other hand at the anodic side of the pdcm fig 5c the indiscernible difference in the cv curves following the addition of mb suggests a negligible det effect when pdcm functions as an anode taken together the janus pdcm electro activates pms mainly by singlet oxygenation and cathodic det while the radical i e so4 and oh mediated oxidation and anodic det contributed little the det reaction pathway induced by the pdcm is likely triggered by the high adsorption ability and high electrical conductivity of the pdcm specifically pd nanoparticles have been proved to promote the adsorption of chemicals on the pd catalyst surface which is the primary step for inducing electron transfer reaction qin et al 2022 long et al 2013 the subsequent electron transfer is further enhanced by the pdcm mediating as an efficient electron transfer shuttle in addition the generation of 1o2 could be due to that during pms activation pd nanoparticles facilitate the electron transfer between 1o2 precursors e g pd oh and pd o via the chemisorption of 1o2 precursors onto the pd nanoparticles leading to the activation of oxygen from its ground state triplet to a high energy state singlet wang et al 2017 the products of mb by the pms pdcm electro filtration were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis the detected products of mb agree well with the reported oxidation products of mb by 1o2 oxidation and electron transfer wang et al 2022 fig s10 detailed detection methods are provided in the supplementary information a possible degradation pathway of mb was proposed accordingly in fig s11 including the demethylation at the n sites of the phenothiazine ring and the consequent ring cleavage to form smaller molecules 4 conclusion this study demonstrated a janus pdcm for high efficiency pms activation and high performance mp degradation in a single pass flow through electro filtration process as shown in fig 6 the janus pdcm featured dual electrocatalytic pd reaction zones inside cm pores formed by magnetron sputtering the janus pdcm demonstrated uncompromised membrane permeability and hydrophilicity as compared with the pristine cm substrate combining the analyses of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and randles circuit model we demonstrated that the janus pdcm greatly intensified the charge transfer within the membrane benefiting from pd seeding inside membrane pores the single pass pms janus pdcm electro filtration exhibited an ultra efficient mb removal 94 5 under the condition of a low dc supply of 1 6 v to the pdcm and a short reaction time of ca 23 s inside the membrane the janus pdcm showed over one fold increase in the mb removal rate by electro activating pms compared to the single sided pdcm additionally the janus pdcm showed more readily electron transfer and lower specific electric energy consumption than the single sided pdcm these results corroborated the advantage of the janus ecm configuration for intensifying pms activation at a maximal and beneficial synergy of the flow through electro filtration and the spatial confinement effects in porous membranes further the underlying mechanisms of the janus pdcm for electro activating pms were investigated epr reactive species quenching tests and kinetic solvent isotope experiments collectively indicated that so4 and oh played a minor role whereas 1o2 oxidation should contribute to mb removal from cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry measurements the cathodic pdcm surface also promoted mb removal by mediating det from mb to pms whereas the anodic pdcm exhibited a negligible det effect overall our work demonstrated a janus ecm configuration for high efficiency pms electro activation and maximized the non radical mediated pms oxidation for mp removal expanding the ecm filtration strategies for water decontamination this high performance electro filtration system has promising prospects in applications such as fast water purification and water pollution control further the comprehensive analyses of the oxidative pathway in our work could guide future evaluation of other possible non radical mediated electro filtration systems data availability the data that

15444,a single stage intermittent aeration microaerobic reactor iamr has been developed for the cost effective nitrogen removal from piggery wastewater with a low ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod to total nitrogen tn in this study a quantified nitrogen metabolic network was constructed based on the metagenomics reaction kinetics and mathematical model to provide a revealing insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in the iamr metagenomics revealed that a complex nitrogen metabolic network including aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidation anammox denitrification via nitrate and nitrite and nitrate respiration existed in the iamr a novel method for solving kinetic parameters with high stability was developed based on a genetic algorithm use this method to calculate the kinetics of various reactions involved in nitrogen metabolism kinetics revealed that simultaneous partial nitritation anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pdn a were the dominant approaches to nitrogen removal in the iamr finally a kinetics based model was proposed for quantitatively describing the nitrogen metabolic network under the limitation of cod 58 67 of nitrogen was removed via the anammox based processes pn a and pdn a but only 7 12 and 1 2 of nitrogen were removed via heterotrophic denitrification of nitrite and nitrate respectively the half inhibition constant of dissolved oxygen do on anammox was simulated as 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 filling the gap in quantifying do inhibition on anammox high frequency intermittent aeration was identified as the crucial measure to suppress nitrite oxidizing bacteria although it has a high affinity for do and no2 n in continuous aeration mode the simulated no3 n in the iamr would rise by 39 6 the research provides a novel insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic systems and provides a reliable approach to practicing pn a and pdn a for cost effective nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microaerobic partial nitrification and anammox partial denitrification and anammox reaction kinetics mathematical model nitrogen metabolic network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process partial nitritation and anammox pn a process can reduce 100 carbon source and 60 aeration requirements li et al 2011 the pn a process can be implemented as two stage or one stage strategies and one stage is more common with less complexity lower footprint and lower capital investment than the two stage counterpart lackner et al 2014 the metabolic balance of multiple microorganisms plays a critical in the achievement of the one stage pn a process a microaerobic system is an oxygen limited system characterized by dissolved oxygen do less than 1 0 mg l 1 chen et al 2020 the microaerobic system is favorable for partial nitritation since the affinity for do of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob is higher than that of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob wen et al 2017 the microaerobic system is also feasible for conducting pn a process innerebner et al 2007 ji et al 2019 windey et al 2005 in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the development of the microaerobic process in treating wastewater characterized by low ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn meng and coworkers constructed a novel upflow microaerobic sludge reactor to treat piggery wastewater with a cod tn of about 0 84 under the do of about 0 3 mg l 1 with feeding of 307 0 mg cod l 1 and 366 9 mg tn l 1 the proposed one stage microaerobic system achieved an average tn removal efficiency of 87 2 meng et al 2015 meng et al 2018 also demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of a single stage integrated fixed film microaerobic process in removing nitrogen from low cod tn wastewater zhang and coworkers obtained a high tn removal efficiency of about 90 4 in an upflow microaerobic reactor with a do of 0 41 mg l 1 when treating the synthetic wastewater with 70 mg tn l 1and 70 mg cod l 1 zhang et al 2019 in these cases pn a was the crucial process for effective nitrogen removal revealed by the analyses of mass balance and or microbial community however the nitrogen metabolism in the single stage microaerobic process is complex involving combined kinetics of various reactions and the nitrogen metabolic network in the microaerobic process is not quantified yet therefore it is significant to clarify the nitrogen metabolic networks for insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic processes mathematical model is a powerful tool and widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp which can be divided into deterministic model based on first engineering principles first principle model and data driven model based on machine learning algorithms bagheri et al 2015 gernaey et al 2004 first principle model represented by activated sludge models asm can describe the system s physical chemical and biological kinetics henze et al 2000 and data driven model focuses on the prediction rather than interpretability gernaey et al 2004 the classic asm is designed to simulate the operation of activated sludge systems for treating domestic wastewater it has been expanded to many fields by calibrating and or adding parameters including industrial wastewater treatment wu et al 2016 microalgal growth with nutrient removal wágner et al 2016 and bioplastic recovery ribeiro et al 2022 nevertheless there is still no consensus on the parameter calibration that a certain scenario can be governed by different sets of model parameters gernaey et al 2004 exploring basic kinetics and summarizing corresponding model could be beneficial to deeply understand the nitrogen removal mechanism in microaerobic process which has not been systematically studied a single stage intermittent aeration microaerobic reactor iamr was constructed and continuously performed for 140 days to treat piggery wastewater with a cod tn of about 0 96 sun et al 2021 with the cod nh4 n and tn of 258 5 235 5 and 335 2 mg l 1 in the piggery wastewater as influent the removal efficiency achieved 77 9 94 6 and 82 6 respectively the present work aims to reveal the metabolic pathways and kinetics of various biochemical reactions involved in nitrogen removal in the microaerobic system the iamr was continuously performed for another 57 days under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 throughout the operation cod and nitrogen components in the reactor were regularly analyzed metagenomic sequencing and kinetic assays of the microaerobic sludge were conducted and a qualitative nitrogen metabolic network was constructed based on the metagenomics and kinetics results given these results a kinetics based mathematical model was proposed to quantify the nitrogen metabolic network this work provides a novel insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic processes and a reliable approach to practicing pn a 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale iamr operation and monitoring the lab scale iamr was made of plexiglass with a total volume of 10 l divided into a 7 l reaction zone and a 3 l gas liquid solid separation zone as shown in fig 1 a microporous aerator was fixed to the bottom of the reaction zone for aeration six sampling ports marked as a b c d e and f from bottom to top were set on the reaction zone at equal distances a temperature controller was used to keep the internal temperature of 32 c the iamr was operated continuously with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h but in an intermittent aeration mode aerating for 18 min and intermitting for 6 min alternately the intermittent aeration frequency was set up based on the previous studies li et al 2011 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2021 do in the reaction zone was maintained at 0 2 mg l 1 within aeration phases the feed used in this study was piggery wastewater collected from the underground storage tank of a local small breeding farm harbin china 126 46 e 45 69 n the cod and tn in raw piggery wastewater were in the range of 178 0 673 5 and 208 4 403 2 mg l 1 respectively to ensure the activity of aob and anammox bacteria the piggery wastewater was pretreated with an aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove and stabilize cod bonassa et al 2021 sun et al 2021 the detailed sbr operation method can be found in our previous study sun et al 2021 cod nh4 n and tn in the sbr pretreated piggery wastewater averaged 254 9 238 2 and 260 8 mg l 1 and the cod tn was 0 98 inoculated with aerobic activated sludge collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant the iamr had been operated for 140 days previously and an average cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency of 77 9 94 6 and 82 9 were obtained respectively sun et al 2021 in the present research the iamr was continuously operated for another 57 days to study the nitrogen metabolic network in the microaerobic system influent and effluent of the reactor were sampled daily the mixture around port f was also sampled in the aeration phase to measure the bulk pollutants concentration in the iamr the activated sludge in the iamr was collected on day 57 for kinetic assays the inoculum and activated sludge taken on day 57 were collected for the analysis of metagenomic sequencing 2 2 chemical analysis cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n kjeldahl nitrogen tkn mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 tn was measured by a tn analyzer analytik jena multi n c 2100 do and ph were measured with a do meter wtw multi 3510 ids and a ph meter switzerland mettler toledo delta320 respectively 2 3 metagenomic sequencing metagenomic sequencing was conducted to reveal the orthologous genes and metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen metabolism in the iamr dna was extracted by e z n a soil dna kit omega usa the extracted dna was entrusted to the sangon biotech shanghai co ltd to construct the gene library the length of dna fragment in the gene library is 500 bp the sequencing system is illumina hiseq the kegg metabolic pathways were illustrated on the pathview website luo et al 2017 which qualitatively revealed a nitrogen metabolic network 2 4 kinetic assays to understand the reaction kinetics involved in nitrogen metabolism of the iamr the kinetic rate of the collected microaerobic sludge was tested with the specific substrate s respectively the kinetic assays were conducted in three groups as follows 1 oxygen uptake rate our in the aerobic oxidation of nh4 n no2 n and cod moussa et al 2005 wu et al 2021 2 transformation rate of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n under aerobic or anaerobic condition respectively including aerobic ammonium oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation anammox heterotrophic nitrite reduction i e heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and heterotrophic nitrate reduction heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and nitrate respiration 3 interaction of anammox with heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or nitrate respiration respectively each of the tests has been conducted in triplicate refer to section 1 of supplementary information for the detailed kinetic assay methods in the interaction assays no3 n reduced by nitrate respiration is postulated as r of the total nitrate reduced in each assay based on the reaction kinetics a first order differential equation set eq 1 was established to estimate the r 1 d s no 2 nr d t r d s no 3 dn 3 d t d s no 2 am d t d s no 2 nr d t d s no 2 dn 2 d t d s nh 4 am d t 1 32 d s no 2 am d t s nh 4 0 s 0 where s nh4 am and s no2 am are the nh4 n and no2 n reacted by anammox s no2 nr is the no2 n produced by nitrate respiration s no2 dn2 is the no2 n reacted by heterotrophic nitrite denitrification s no3 dn3 is the no3 n reacted in heterotrophic nitrate reduction s nh4 0 was the initial nh4 n in the assay s 0 2 5 algorithm for kinetic parameters monod kinetics eq 2 1 has usually been used to describe substrate utilization by microorganisms the linear fitting algorithm based on the integration of the monod equation is generally performed to estimate kinetic parameters i e the maximum reaction rate μmax and half saturation coefficient ks as shown in eq 2 2 robinson and characklis 1984 2 1 r d s d t μ max s k s s 2 2 1 t ln s 0 s y μ max k s 1 k s s 0 s t x where s 0 and s are the substrate concentration at the initial moment t 0 and a specific time t respectively the linear fitting algorithm would be unreliable when the random error is more than 0 5 particular discussion see section 2 of supplementary information thereby a higher stability algorithm eq 3 based on the finite element and genetic algorithm ga was proposed to solve the μmax and ks in the algorithm substance concentration at sampling point i 1 si 1 was used to predict the substance concentration at the next sampling point i si and the optimum μmax and ks were obtained by minimizing the prediction error δ e the time from sampling point i 1 to i is evenly divided into k intervals δt then k 1 calculation nodes node 0 k are generated the initial substance concentration at the calculation node 0 si 1 0 is si 1 and the substance concentration at calculation node k si 1 k is the predicted value at the sampling point i s i 3 s i s i 1 k s i 1 j s i 1 j 1 μ m a x s i 1 j 1 δ t k s s i 1 j 1 s i 1 0 s i 1 i 1 2 n j 0 1 2 k the mean square error mse generally represents δ e but mse is more sensitive to measurement errors at sampling points with high concentrations relative mean square error remse is defined to normalize the effect of various concentration points on δ e as eq 4 4 remse 1 n 1 i 0 n s i s i s i 2 ga was used to minimize remse and obtain the optimum μmax and ks the flow diagram of ga used in the present research is shown in fig s6 supplementary information python package geatpy was used to conduct ga table 1 illustrates the symbols and measured values of μmax and ks of various reactions involved in the nitrogen metabolic network the codes and data involved in ga have been uploaded to the github website section 3 of supplementary information 2 6 mathematical model metagenomics sequencing and kinetic assays indicated that aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation anammox heterotrophic nitrite denitrification heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and nitrate respiration formed the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr sections 3 2 and 3 3 a novel mathematical model was proposed to integrate the kinetic equations of the above reactions for quantifying the nitrogen metabolic network chemoheterotrophic denitrification processes heterotrophic nitrate denitrification heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and nitrate respiration would be limited in the iamr due to the insufficient cod in the low cod tn wastewater therefore a correction factor f cod is introduced into the model to characterize the cod limitation in the chemoheterotrophic denitrification processes the f cod is the ratio of the actual cod removal rate to the potential cod removal rate eq 5 5 f cod l cod r dn 2 nlt r dn 3 nlt r nr nlt r cao nlt r cad nlt where l cod is the actual cod removal rate of the iamr r dn 2 nlt r dn 3 nlt r nr nlt r cao nlt r cad nlt are the cod utilization rate of nitrite denitrification nitrate denitrification nitrate respiration cod aerobic oxidation and cod anaerobic digestion respectively the sum represents the potential cod removal rate in the iamr neither aerobic bacteria nor anaerobic bacteria reach the maximum reactivity under oxygen limited conditions two single parameter do inhibition equations are therefore introduced into the proposed model to quantify the actual reaction rates of aerobic processes eq 6 and anaerobic processes eq 7 henze et al 1999 oh and silverstein 1999 in the iamr respectively 6 r c o r r r n l t d do do k do 7 r c o r r r n l t d k do k do do where r n l t d and r c o r r are the kinetic reaction rates without and with do inhibition respectively the do half saturation coefficient k do of aerobic ammonia oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation and cod aerobic oxidation process can be derived from the oxygen uptake assays the k do of each chemoheterotrophic denitrification process was 0 2 mg l 1 henze et al 1999 oh and silverstein 1999 though no k do of anammox k do am has been reported the r c o r r of anammox under do of 0 2 mg l 1 can be estimated to be 0 75 times of r n l t d according to the previous reports kalvelage et al 2011 varas et al 2015 yan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 therefore the model introduces an inhibition constant factor i do am of 0 75 for the do inhibition on anammox the model introduces another inhibition constant factor i do cad of 0 00 to describe the do inhibition on cod anaerobic digestion which should not occur during the aerating phases in the iamr the established model and related parameters are elaborated in tables s2 s3 and s4 supplementary information the model validation was carried out using the independent data collected from the iamr during the steady period 44th 57th days a nonparametric permutation test was conducted with 10000 permutations to evaluate the validity of the model and p value 0 05 was identified no statistical significance between the simulation results and measured data loomer et al 2019 the codes and data involved in the model have been uploaded to the github website section 3 of supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of the iamr performance of the iamr during the 57 day operation was shown in fig 2 cod nh4 n and tn removal reached a steady phase since the 44th day within the steady period 44th 57th days the cod removal efficiency and removal rate averaged 79 0 and 0 64 kg m 3 d 1 respectively fig 2a with the average nh4 n removal efficiency and removal rate of 87 2 and 0 61 kg m 3 d 1 the tn removal efficiency and removal rate reached about 73 6 and 0 55 kg m 3 d 1 in the steady period fig 2b tkn removal rate in the steady period was counted as 0 62 kg m 3d 1 cod nh4 n and no3 n in bulk were 60 64 34 28 and 25 51 mg l 1 in the steady period similar to that in the effluent fig 2 no2 n in bulk was 0 46 mg l 1 but obviously lower by 66 4 than that in the effluent 1 37 mg l 1 in the steady period the average ratio of cod removed to tn removed was as low as 1 17 much lower than that required by heterotrophic nitrite denitrification 1 71 or nitrate denitrification 2 86 saggar et al 2013 indicating the existence of anammox 3 2 orthologous genes and metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen removal the kegg pathway of nitrogen metabolism in the iamr is shown in fig 3 since the no2 n and no3 n in influent were very low fig 2c k02575 nrt k15576 nrta k15577 nrtb k15578 nrtc and k15579 nrtd related to active transport of no2 n and no3 n were significantly down regulated because nh4 n was the main nitrogen pollutant in influent fig 2b the up regulated genes formed a complex network from nh4 n oxidation to n2 generation anammox was enhanced considerably confirming the existence of anammox interestingly the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process was also strengthened in dnra no3 n acts as an electron sink first to be reduced to no2 n through nitrate respiration then reduced to nh4 n cole and brown 1980 megonigal et al 2014 dnra cannot remove no3 n from a biosystem like denitrification but the converted no2 n and nh4 n can be reused by other processes such as anammox as shown in fig 4 among all the orthologous genes the top 5 are k00370 narg k00371 narh k15864 nirs k00374 nari and k00376 nosz all related to denitrification denitrification has the highest abundance of orthologous genes detected followed by dnra and nitrite oxidization in sequence the functional gene of nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction narg and narh are involved in the top three processes indicating the high activity of the conversion between no2 n and no3 n the orthologous genes abundance of anammox is ranked fourth and k00368 nirk k15864 nirs k20934 hzs and k20935 hdh related to anammox were all detected the orthologous genes abundance of nitrification is lower than anammox and ranked fifth nitrogen fixation is the lowest and assimilatory nitrate reduction is the second lowest the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr has been identified through analyzing the metabolic pathways and orthologous genes of nitrogen removal fig 5 in the network nitrogen fixation and assimilatory nitrate reduction are marginal because they are commonly in plants and algae and sensitive to nh4 n guerrero 1985 rice and tiedje 1989 but the activity of each process in the network needs to be further determined 3 3 kinetics of reactions involved in nitrogen metabolic network 3 3 1 oxygen uptake assays and oxygen uptake rate aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation processes as the main oxygen consuming processes will compete for do in the iamr to understand the oxygen utilization kinetics of those processes oxygen uptake assays were conducted using nh4cl nh4 n nano2 no2 n or ch3coona cod as the unique oxygen consuming substrate respectively the oxygen utilization profile of each assay is illustrated in fig s2 supplementary information to avoid the negative impact of stagnant periods at the beginning of the assay data of do between 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 were selected for calculating the monod parameters the results table 1 showed that the k do of aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation k do ao k do no and k do cao was 0 46 0 21 and 0 03 mg l 1 and the μ do of aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation processes μ do ao μ do no and μ do cao are 1 52 0 11 and 0 07 mgo2 g vss 1 min 1 under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 in the iamr the our of ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod aerobic oxidation drop to 0 46 0 05 and 0 06 mgo2 gvss 1 min 1 only 30 3 48 8 and 87 0 of μ do ao μ do no and μ do cao respectively in addition since ch3coona can be fully biochemically oxidized the cod utilization rate of cod aerobic oxidation was estimated to be 0 06 mg cod g vss 1 min 1 by our hussain et al 2021 ryu et al 2022 the assay results showed that aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms have the strongest do affinity but have the weakest our on the contrary aob have the lowest do affinity but the strongest our the results indicated that low cod tn in the wastewater restricted the metabolism of aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the iamr which was favorable for ammonia oxidation the kinetic results also suggested that nob has a higher oxygen affinity than aob the k do ao and k do no obtained in this work were both in the range reported in the literatures 0 033 1 51 and 0 09 1 76 mg l 1 table 1 the results are different from conventional wisdom garrido et al 1997 wiesmann 1994 where k do no is higher than k do ao enabling the nob elimination but are similar to the results reported in nowka et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2020a it appears that nob in the iamr was k strategists i e nitrospira sun et al 2021 which has a lower oxygen half saturation coefficient than aob under low do conditions nowka et al 2015 wang et al 2020a nevertheless the our of nob is still much lower than that of aob probably resulting from the competition of anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification for no2 n thereby the no2 n utilization kinetics of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were also investigated 3 3 2 kinetics of nitrogenous substrate utilization substrate utilization kinetics of nh4 n in aerobic ammonia oxidation no3 n in heterotrophic nitrate reduction and no2 n in heterotrophic nitrite denitrification anammox and nitrite oxidation were investigated the substrate utilization profile of each assay is shown in fig s3 supplementary information in the kinetic assays of anammox the ratio of consumed no2 n to consumed nh4 n δno2 n δnh4 n and produced no3 n to consumed nh4 n δno3 n δnh4 n averaged 1 37 and 0 27 close to the theoretical stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 in anammox reaction windey et al 2005 the monod parameters of each process are shown in table 1 the ks is an important parameter in biological processes and bacterial ecology lotti et al 2014 but the ks of nitrogenous nitrogen substrates are inconsistent in previous studies for example thalla et al 2010 reported that the ks of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation is in the range of 1 64 4 94 mg l 1 but jih et al 2008 considered it is 0 19 0 26 mg l 1 herein we summarized the ks related to the nitrogenous nitrogen substrates from 40 related literatures and presented the ks range in table 1 the ks obtained in this work were all within the range the μmax of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation μ nh 4 ao is 0 26 mg n g vss 1 min 1 much higher than other nitrogen reaction processes the ks of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation k nh 4 ao is 2 94 mg l 1 since the average nh4 n in the iamr in the steady period is about 34 28 mg l 1 fig 2 the ammonia oxidation rate is 92 1 of μ nh 4 ao the results indicated that the nh4 n in the iamr slightly inhibited aerobic ammonia oxidation however the actual reaction rate of aerobic ammonia oxidation in the iamr dropped to 0 07 mg n g vss 1 min 1 with the serious inhibition of do 30 3 the ks of no2 n of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification k no 2 am k no 2 no and k no 2 dn 2 are 0 71 0 36 and 0 70 mg l 1 respectively the μmax of no2 n of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification μ no 2 am μ no 2 no and μ no 2 dn 2 are 0 12 0 06 and 0 07 mg n g vss 1 min 1 respectively in the steady period the average no2 n in the iamr is 0 46 mg l 1 fig 2 considering the do inhibition the no2 n utilization rates of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 mg n g vss 1 min 1 the results showed that anammox reaction rate was obviously higher than nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification nob was not the dominant nitrite consumer in the iamr though it has the highest affinity for do and no2 n this was attributed to iamr s intermittent aeration which interferes with the critical enzymes of nob and limits its metabolism ge et al 2014 li et al 2018 for no3 n utilization in heterotrophic nitrate reduction the μmax μ no 3 dn 3 and ks k no 3 dn 3 is 0 04 mg n g vss 1 min 1 and 0 64 mg l 1 respectively since the average no3 n in the iamr in the steady period is about 25 51 mg l 1 fig 2 the actual rate of heterotrophic nitrate reduction with do inhibition is 0 02 mg n g vss 1 min 1 the nitrogen removal rates of heterotrophic nitrate reduction and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were much lower than anammox confirming the dominance of anammox in the iamr cod anaerobic digestion occurred in the heterotrophic nitrite and nitrate reduction processes indicated by a consumed cod tn of 7 8 and 10 4 respectively fig 6 the cod utilization rate of cod anaerobic digestion can be obtained by subtracting the cod utilization rate of heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or heterotrophic nitrate reduction from the observed cod utilization rate in each assay the cod utilization profiles of the cod anaerobic digestion in all assays are approximately linear with a similar slope fig 6 the cod anaerobic digestion rate is calculated to be 0 23 mg cod g vss 1 min 1 through linear regression the powerful cod utilization potential of anaerobic digestion could inhibit the heterotrophic denitrification in the iamr 3 3 3 kinetics of anammox with heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or nitrate respiration the activity of anammox in a biosystem is affected by organics concentration and heterotrophic denitrification zhu et al 2017 it is necessary to understand the interaction effect between anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification positive effect 1 1 2 negative effect 1 1 2 and no interaction effect 1 1 2 a group of comprehensive assays of no2 n utilization of anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were conducted in those assays the cod and nh4 n are sufficient and the no2 n was the only limited substrate section 1 2 4 of supplementary information the no2 n utilization rate in the comprehensive assays fig 7 a c was faster than that in the assays of anammox or heterotrophic nitrite denitrification fig s3 of supplementary information the no2 n utilization rate was fitted by combining the kinetic equations of heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and anammox the results fig 7a c showed that the fitting profiles are very close to the observed experimental profiles indicating no interaction effect between anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification in the presence of cod because the reaction conditions of dnra and heterotrophic nitrate denitrification are very similar to each other cole and brown 1980 guerrero 1985 megonigal et al 2014 the kinetics rate of dnra and nitrate denitrification can not be revealed independently therefore there is a possibility of co occurrence of heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and dnra in heterotrophic nitrate reduction assays on the one hand no significant accumulation of nh4 n was observed in all assays indicating a weak process of dnra in the iamr on the other hand no3 n is still possible to be reduced to no2 n through nitrate respiration the first step of dnra the produced no2 n would be utilized by anammox to reduce nh4 n in the reaction system to confirm this view we performed a series of assays with sufficient cod nh4 n and no3 n section 1 2 4 of supplementary information as illustrated in fig 7d 7f simultaneous reduction of no3 n and nh4 n were observed visibly confirming the existence of nitrate respiration in the iamr no3 n reduced by nitrate respiration is postulated as r of the total nitrate reduced in assays according to eq 1 r is calculated as 84 6 using ga each simulated nh4 n reaction profile fitted well with the corresponding observed nh4 n reaction profile confirming the r was credible fig 7d 7f this process is described as partial denitrification anammox pdn a in which no2 n required for anammox can be supplied by nitrate reduction castro barros et al 2017 simultaneous pn a and pdn a has been regarded as a cost effective nitrogen removal process but is normally realized in multiple stage or batch processes jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020b wu et al 2019 this work revealed that simultaneous pn a and pdn a can also be achieved in a single stage microaerobic process 3 4 mathematical model and quantification of nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr a mathematical model with limited cod and do was established to quantify the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr fig 5 combined with the kinetics of the involved essential processes table 1 the model was validated using the operational data of the iamr as it is a first principle model and independent of the operation of iamr the average simulated bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are 35 62 0 60 23 27 mg l 1 close to the actual bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n averaging 34 28 0 46 and 25 51 mg l 1 respectively fig 8 a the statistical analysis evidenced the insignificant differences between the simulated results and the measured data with the p value of 0 31 0 17 and 0 31 for bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n respectively indicating the credibility of the model as introduced in section 2 6 the reaction rate of anammox under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 was estimated to be 0 75 times of that under anaerobic condition while the cod anaerobic digestion was completely inhibited thereby the model contains two postulated inhibition factors i e i do am 0 75 and i do cad 0 00 the effect of i do am and i do cad on the robustness of the model was also investigated the remse of simulation results with the two factors change were observed in fig 8b d the i do am significantly changed the remse of nh4 n and no2 n but the effect of i do cad can be negligible the remse of nh4 n decreased with the increase of i do am but the decrease rate became very slow when the i do am was over 0 60 these results indicated that the model is robust as i do am increased from 0 00 to 1 00 the remse of no2 n first decreased and then increased the minimum remse of no2 n appeared in the range of 0 65 0 70 of i do am i do am and i do cad affected the remse of no3 n the remse of no3 n decreased with i do am increasing from 0 to 0 75 but slightly increased with the i do am further increasing from 0 75 to 1 00 on the other hand the remse of no3 n rose slowly when the i do cad increased from 0 to 0 07 but rose rapidly when the i do cad further increased the results showed that cod anaerobic digestion is very sensitive to do the reasonable i do am is 0 65 0 75 for the best fit of the model according to eq 7 the reference value of the do half inhibition constant of anammox k do am is calculated to be 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 which plays a critical role in estimating the performance of anammox in different microaerobic processes to visually view the effect of i do am and i do cad on the model as a specific example the effect of i do am on the model with i do cad of 0 0 and the effect of i do cad on the model with i do am of 0 75 are simulated and shown in fig s7 supplementary information the flux of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the nitrogen metabolic network were calculated via the established model fig 5 the input nh4 n flux is normalized to 1 n 1 unit nitrogen element as the first step of nitrogen removal aerobic ammonia oxidation oxidizes 0 49 0 59 n of nh4 n to no2 n the transformation of produced no2 n is the active and complex in the iamr most no2 n 0 37 0 43 n are simultaneously utilized by anammox with 0 28 0 33 n of unoxidized nh4 n producing 0 58 0 67 n of n2 and 0 07 0 09 n of no3 n in the remaining no2 n only 0 07 0 12 n of no2 n is denitrified to n2 while 0 13 0 17 n of no2 n is further oxidized to no3 n the 0 08 0 13 n of no3 n is reduced to no2 n by nitrate respiration and then reutilized by anammox heterotrophic nitrate denitrification is relatively weak with only 0 01 0 02 n of no3 n reduced to n2 the nitrogen metabolic network indicated that simultaneous pn a and pdn a were vital to the tn removal in the iamr no3 n accumulation no3 n generated tn removed is one of the thorny problems in the long term operation of single stage anammox based systems du et al 2015 the no3 n accumulation in the iamr is 9 7 less than the theoretical 11 of pn a windey et al 2005 this could be attributed to the intermittent aeration for inhibiting nob ge et al 2014 li et al 2018 as well as pdn a for reducing nitrate if the iamr were changed to continuous aeration the no3 n production would rise by 39 6 calculated by the model this work revealed that intermittent aeration in a continuous system also inhibits the growth of nob nevertheless 66 of no3 n is produced by nitrite oxidation revealed by the model this implied that it is still tough to completely suppress nob in the microaerobic system fortunately the pdn a in the iamr reduced 84 6 of the produced no3 n to no2 n calculated from the model relieving the risk of no3 n accumulation therefore promoting the activity of pdn a should be a new way of reducing no3 n accumulation in microaerobic systems 4 conclusion the nitrogen metabolic network in the single stage microaerobic system iamr was first quantified through the metagenomic sequencing kinetics and mathematical model main conclusions include the monod kinetic parameters of various reactions involved in nitrogen metabolism were estimated using a novel algorithm with high reliability based on ga and the finite element method a kinetic based mathematical model was proposed and verified by a nonparametric permutation test with a significance level of 0 05 the kinetic based mathematical model revealed that pn a and pdn a were the dominant approaches to nitrogen removal and the pdn a as the primary no3 n reduction process removed 84 6 of the total no3 n the oxygen half inhibition constant of anammox was calibrated to be 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 filling the gap in quantifying do inhibition on anammox nob can be well suppressed using intermittent aeration in the continuous system but nitrate production would be increased by 39 6 in continuous aeration mode credit authorship contribution statement zhenju sun data curation

15444,a single stage intermittent aeration microaerobic reactor iamr has been developed for the cost effective nitrogen removal from piggery wastewater with a low ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod to total nitrogen tn in this study a quantified nitrogen metabolic network was constructed based on the metagenomics reaction kinetics and mathematical model to provide a revealing insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in the iamr metagenomics revealed that a complex nitrogen metabolic network including aerobic ammonia and nitrite oxidation anammox denitrification via nitrate and nitrite and nitrate respiration existed in the iamr a novel method for solving kinetic parameters with high stability was developed based on a genetic algorithm use this method to calculate the kinetics of various reactions involved in nitrogen metabolism kinetics revealed that simultaneous partial nitritation anammox pn a and partial denitrification anammox pdn a were the dominant approaches to nitrogen removal in the iamr finally a kinetics based model was proposed for quantitatively describing the nitrogen metabolic network under the limitation of cod 58 67 of nitrogen was removed via the anammox based processes pn a and pdn a but only 7 12 and 1 2 of nitrogen were removed via heterotrophic denitrification of nitrite and nitrate respectively the half inhibition constant of dissolved oxygen do on anammox was simulated as 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 filling the gap in quantifying do inhibition on anammox high frequency intermittent aeration was identified as the crucial measure to suppress nitrite oxidizing bacteria although it has a high affinity for do and no2 n in continuous aeration mode the simulated no3 n in the iamr would rise by 39 6 the research provides a novel insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic systems and provides a reliable approach to practicing pn a and pdn a for cost effective nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microaerobic partial nitrification and anammox partial denitrification and anammox reaction kinetics mathematical model nitrogen metabolic network data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction compared with the traditional nitrification denitrification process partial nitritation and anammox pn a process can reduce 100 carbon source and 60 aeration requirements li et al 2011 the pn a process can be implemented as two stage or one stage strategies and one stage is more common with less complexity lower footprint and lower capital investment than the two stage counterpart lackner et al 2014 the metabolic balance of multiple microorganisms plays a critical in the achievement of the one stage pn a process a microaerobic system is an oxygen limited system characterized by dissolved oxygen do less than 1 0 mg l 1 chen et al 2020 the microaerobic system is favorable for partial nitritation since the affinity for do of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob is higher than that of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob wen et al 2017 the microaerobic system is also feasible for conducting pn a process innerebner et al 2007 ji et al 2019 windey et al 2005 in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the development of the microaerobic process in treating wastewater characterized by low ratio of chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn meng and coworkers constructed a novel upflow microaerobic sludge reactor to treat piggery wastewater with a cod tn of about 0 84 under the do of about 0 3 mg l 1 with feeding of 307 0 mg cod l 1 and 366 9 mg tn l 1 the proposed one stage microaerobic system achieved an average tn removal efficiency of 87 2 meng et al 2015 meng et al 2018 also demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of a single stage integrated fixed film microaerobic process in removing nitrogen from low cod tn wastewater zhang and coworkers obtained a high tn removal efficiency of about 90 4 in an upflow microaerobic reactor with a do of 0 41 mg l 1 when treating the synthetic wastewater with 70 mg tn l 1and 70 mg cod l 1 zhang et al 2019 in these cases pn a was the crucial process for effective nitrogen removal revealed by the analyses of mass balance and or microbial community however the nitrogen metabolism in the single stage microaerobic process is complex involving combined kinetics of various reactions and the nitrogen metabolic network in the microaerobic process is not quantified yet therefore it is significant to clarify the nitrogen metabolic networks for insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic processes mathematical model is a powerful tool and widely used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp which can be divided into deterministic model based on first engineering principles first principle model and data driven model based on machine learning algorithms bagheri et al 2015 gernaey et al 2004 first principle model represented by activated sludge models asm can describe the system s physical chemical and biological kinetics henze et al 2000 and data driven model focuses on the prediction rather than interpretability gernaey et al 2004 the classic asm is designed to simulate the operation of activated sludge systems for treating domestic wastewater it has been expanded to many fields by calibrating and or adding parameters including industrial wastewater treatment wu et al 2016 microalgal growth with nutrient removal wágner et al 2016 and bioplastic recovery ribeiro et al 2022 nevertheless there is still no consensus on the parameter calibration that a certain scenario can be governed by different sets of model parameters gernaey et al 2004 exploring basic kinetics and summarizing corresponding model could be beneficial to deeply understand the nitrogen removal mechanism in microaerobic process which has not been systematically studied a single stage intermittent aeration microaerobic reactor iamr was constructed and continuously performed for 140 days to treat piggery wastewater with a cod tn of about 0 96 sun et al 2021 with the cod nh4 n and tn of 258 5 235 5 and 335 2 mg l 1 in the piggery wastewater as influent the removal efficiency achieved 77 9 94 6 and 82 6 respectively the present work aims to reveal the metabolic pathways and kinetics of various biochemical reactions involved in nitrogen removal in the microaerobic system the iamr was continuously performed for another 57 days under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 throughout the operation cod and nitrogen components in the reactor were regularly analyzed metagenomic sequencing and kinetic assays of the microaerobic sludge were conducted and a qualitative nitrogen metabolic network was constructed based on the metagenomics and kinetics results given these results a kinetics based mathematical model was proposed to quantify the nitrogen metabolic network this work provides a novel insight into the nitrogen removal mechanism in single stage microaerobic processes and a reliable approach to practicing pn a 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale iamr operation and monitoring the lab scale iamr was made of plexiglass with a total volume of 10 l divided into a 7 l reaction zone and a 3 l gas liquid solid separation zone as shown in fig 1 a microporous aerator was fixed to the bottom of the reaction zone for aeration six sampling ports marked as a b c d e and f from bottom to top were set on the reaction zone at equal distances a temperature controller was used to keep the internal temperature of 32 c the iamr was operated continuously with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h but in an intermittent aeration mode aerating for 18 min and intermitting for 6 min alternately the intermittent aeration frequency was set up based on the previous studies li et al 2011 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2021 do in the reaction zone was maintained at 0 2 mg l 1 within aeration phases the feed used in this study was piggery wastewater collected from the underground storage tank of a local small breeding farm harbin china 126 46 e 45 69 n the cod and tn in raw piggery wastewater were in the range of 178 0 673 5 and 208 4 403 2 mg l 1 respectively to ensure the activity of aob and anammox bacteria the piggery wastewater was pretreated with an aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr to remove and stabilize cod bonassa et al 2021 sun et al 2021 the detailed sbr operation method can be found in our previous study sun et al 2021 cod nh4 n and tn in the sbr pretreated piggery wastewater averaged 254 9 238 2 and 260 8 mg l 1 and the cod tn was 0 98 inoculated with aerobic activated sludge collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant the iamr had been operated for 140 days previously and an average cod nh4 n and tn removal efficiency of 77 9 94 6 and 82 9 were obtained respectively sun et al 2021 in the present research the iamr was continuously operated for another 57 days to study the nitrogen metabolic network in the microaerobic system influent and effluent of the reactor were sampled daily the mixture around port f was also sampled in the aeration phase to measure the bulk pollutants concentration in the iamr the activated sludge in the iamr was collected on day 57 for kinetic assays the inoculum and activated sludge taken on day 57 were collected for the analysis of metagenomic sequencing 2 2 chemical analysis cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n kjeldahl nitrogen tkn mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 tn was measured by a tn analyzer analytik jena multi n c 2100 do and ph were measured with a do meter wtw multi 3510 ids and a ph meter switzerland mettler toledo delta320 respectively 2 3 metagenomic sequencing metagenomic sequencing was conducted to reveal the orthologous genes and metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen metabolism in the iamr dna was extracted by e z n a soil dna kit omega usa the extracted dna was entrusted to the sangon biotech shanghai co ltd to construct the gene library the length of dna fragment in the gene library is 500 bp the sequencing system is illumina hiseq the kegg metabolic pathways were illustrated on the pathview website luo et al 2017 which qualitatively revealed a nitrogen metabolic network 2 4 kinetic assays to understand the reaction kinetics involved in nitrogen metabolism of the iamr the kinetic rate of the collected microaerobic sludge was tested with the specific substrate s respectively the kinetic assays were conducted in three groups as follows 1 oxygen uptake rate our in the aerobic oxidation of nh4 n no2 n and cod moussa et al 2005 wu et al 2021 2 transformation rate of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n under aerobic or anaerobic condition respectively including aerobic ammonium oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation anammox heterotrophic nitrite reduction i e heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and heterotrophic nitrate reduction heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and nitrate respiration 3 interaction of anammox with heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or nitrate respiration respectively each of the tests has been conducted in triplicate refer to section 1 of supplementary information for the detailed kinetic assay methods in the interaction assays no3 n reduced by nitrate respiration is postulated as r of the total nitrate reduced in each assay based on the reaction kinetics a first order differential equation set eq 1 was established to estimate the r 1 d s no 2 nr d t r d s no 3 dn 3 d t d s no 2 am d t d s no 2 nr d t d s no 2 dn 2 d t d s nh 4 am d t 1 32 d s no 2 am d t s nh 4 0 s 0 where s nh4 am and s no2 am are the nh4 n and no2 n reacted by anammox s no2 nr is the no2 n produced by nitrate respiration s no2 dn2 is the no2 n reacted by heterotrophic nitrite denitrification s no3 dn3 is the no3 n reacted in heterotrophic nitrate reduction s nh4 0 was the initial nh4 n in the assay s 0 2 5 algorithm for kinetic parameters monod kinetics eq 2 1 has usually been used to describe substrate utilization by microorganisms the linear fitting algorithm based on the integration of the monod equation is generally performed to estimate kinetic parameters i e the maximum reaction rate μmax and half saturation coefficient ks as shown in eq 2 2 robinson and characklis 1984 2 1 r d s d t μ max s k s s 2 2 1 t ln s 0 s y μ max k s 1 k s s 0 s t x where s 0 and s are the substrate concentration at the initial moment t 0 and a specific time t respectively the linear fitting algorithm would be unreliable when the random error is more than 0 5 particular discussion see section 2 of supplementary information thereby a higher stability algorithm eq 3 based on the finite element and genetic algorithm ga was proposed to solve the μmax and ks in the algorithm substance concentration at sampling point i 1 si 1 was used to predict the substance concentration at the next sampling point i si and the optimum μmax and ks were obtained by minimizing the prediction error δ e the time from sampling point i 1 to i is evenly divided into k intervals δt then k 1 calculation nodes node 0 k are generated the initial substance concentration at the calculation node 0 si 1 0 is si 1 and the substance concentration at calculation node k si 1 k is the predicted value at the sampling point i s i 3 s i s i 1 k s i 1 j s i 1 j 1 μ m a x s i 1 j 1 δ t k s s i 1 j 1 s i 1 0 s i 1 i 1 2 n j 0 1 2 k the mean square error mse generally represents δ e but mse is more sensitive to measurement errors at sampling points with high concentrations relative mean square error remse is defined to normalize the effect of various concentration points on δ e as eq 4 4 remse 1 n 1 i 0 n s i s i s i 2 ga was used to minimize remse and obtain the optimum μmax and ks the flow diagram of ga used in the present research is shown in fig s6 supplementary information python package geatpy was used to conduct ga table 1 illustrates the symbols and measured values of μmax and ks of various reactions involved in the nitrogen metabolic network the codes and data involved in ga have been uploaded to the github website section 3 of supplementary information 2 6 mathematical model metagenomics sequencing and kinetic assays indicated that aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation anammox heterotrophic nitrite denitrification heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and nitrate respiration formed the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr sections 3 2 and 3 3 a novel mathematical model was proposed to integrate the kinetic equations of the above reactions for quantifying the nitrogen metabolic network chemoheterotrophic denitrification processes heterotrophic nitrate denitrification heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and nitrate respiration would be limited in the iamr due to the insufficient cod in the low cod tn wastewater therefore a correction factor f cod is introduced into the model to characterize the cod limitation in the chemoheterotrophic denitrification processes the f cod is the ratio of the actual cod removal rate to the potential cod removal rate eq 5 5 f cod l cod r dn 2 nlt r dn 3 nlt r nr nlt r cao nlt r cad nlt where l cod is the actual cod removal rate of the iamr r dn 2 nlt r dn 3 nlt r nr nlt r cao nlt r cad nlt are the cod utilization rate of nitrite denitrification nitrate denitrification nitrate respiration cod aerobic oxidation and cod anaerobic digestion respectively the sum represents the potential cod removal rate in the iamr neither aerobic bacteria nor anaerobic bacteria reach the maximum reactivity under oxygen limited conditions two single parameter do inhibition equations are therefore introduced into the proposed model to quantify the actual reaction rates of aerobic processes eq 6 and anaerobic processes eq 7 henze et al 1999 oh and silverstein 1999 in the iamr respectively 6 r c o r r r n l t d do do k do 7 r c o r r r n l t d k do k do do where r n l t d and r c o r r are the kinetic reaction rates without and with do inhibition respectively the do half saturation coefficient k do of aerobic ammonia oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation and cod aerobic oxidation process can be derived from the oxygen uptake assays the k do of each chemoheterotrophic denitrification process was 0 2 mg l 1 henze et al 1999 oh and silverstein 1999 though no k do of anammox k do am has been reported the r c o r r of anammox under do of 0 2 mg l 1 can be estimated to be 0 75 times of r n l t d according to the previous reports kalvelage et al 2011 varas et al 2015 yan et al 2019 yin et al 2016 therefore the model introduces an inhibition constant factor i do am of 0 75 for the do inhibition on anammox the model introduces another inhibition constant factor i do cad of 0 00 to describe the do inhibition on cod anaerobic digestion which should not occur during the aerating phases in the iamr the established model and related parameters are elaborated in tables s2 s3 and s4 supplementary information the model validation was carried out using the independent data collected from the iamr during the steady period 44th 57th days a nonparametric permutation test was conducted with 10000 permutations to evaluate the validity of the model and p value 0 05 was identified no statistical significance between the simulation results and measured data loomer et al 2019 the codes and data involved in the model have been uploaded to the github website section 3 of supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance of the iamr performance of the iamr during the 57 day operation was shown in fig 2 cod nh4 n and tn removal reached a steady phase since the 44th day within the steady period 44th 57th days the cod removal efficiency and removal rate averaged 79 0 and 0 64 kg m 3 d 1 respectively fig 2a with the average nh4 n removal efficiency and removal rate of 87 2 and 0 61 kg m 3 d 1 the tn removal efficiency and removal rate reached about 73 6 and 0 55 kg m 3 d 1 in the steady period fig 2b tkn removal rate in the steady period was counted as 0 62 kg m 3d 1 cod nh4 n and no3 n in bulk were 60 64 34 28 and 25 51 mg l 1 in the steady period similar to that in the effluent fig 2 no2 n in bulk was 0 46 mg l 1 but obviously lower by 66 4 than that in the effluent 1 37 mg l 1 in the steady period the average ratio of cod removed to tn removed was as low as 1 17 much lower than that required by heterotrophic nitrite denitrification 1 71 or nitrate denitrification 2 86 saggar et al 2013 indicating the existence of anammox 3 2 orthologous genes and metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen removal the kegg pathway of nitrogen metabolism in the iamr is shown in fig 3 since the no2 n and no3 n in influent were very low fig 2c k02575 nrt k15576 nrta k15577 nrtb k15578 nrtc and k15579 nrtd related to active transport of no2 n and no3 n were significantly down regulated because nh4 n was the main nitrogen pollutant in influent fig 2b the up regulated genes formed a complex network from nh4 n oxidation to n2 generation anammox was enhanced considerably confirming the existence of anammox interestingly the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process was also strengthened in dnra no3 n acts as an electron sink first to be reduced to no2 n through nitrate respiration then reduced to nh4 n cole and brown 1980 megonigal et al 2014 dnra cannot remove no3 n from a biosystem like denitrification but the converted no2 n and nh4 n can be reused by other processes such as anammox as shown in fig 4 among all the orthologous genes the top 5 are k00370 narg k00371 narh k15864 nirs k00374 nari and k00376 nosz all related to denitrification denitrification has the highest abundance of orthologous genes detected followed by dnra and nitrite oxidization in sequence the functional gene of nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction narg and narh are involved in the top three processes indicating the high activity of the conversion between no2 n and no3 n the orthologous genes abundance of anammox is ranked fourth and k00368 nirk k15864 nirs k20934 hzs and k20935 hdh related to anammox were all detected the orthologous genes abundance of nitrification is lower than anammox and ranked fifth nitrogen fixation is the lowest and assimilatory nitrate reduction is the second lowest the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr has been identified through analyzing the metabolic pathways and orthologous genes of nitrogen removal fig 5 in the network nitrogen fixation and assimilatory nitrate reduction are marginal because they are commonly in plants and algae and sensitive to nh4 n guerrero 1985 rice and tiedje 1989 but the activity of each process in the network needs to be further determined 3 3 kinetics of reactions involved in nitrogen metabolic network 3 3 1 oxygen uptake assays and oxygen uptake rate aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation processes as the main oxygen consuming processes will compete for do in the iamr to understand the oxygen utilization kinetics of those processes oxygen uptake assays were conducted using nh4cl nh4 n nano2 no2 n or ch3coona cod as the unique oxygen consuming substrate respectively the oxygen utilization profile of each assay is illustrated in fig s2 supplementary information to avoid the negative impact of stagnant periods at the beginning of the assay data of do between 0 1 4 0 mg l 1 were selected for calculating the monod parameters the results table 1 showed that the k do of aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation k do ao k do no and k do cao was 0 46 0 21 and 0 03 mg l 1 and the μ do of aerobic ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod oxidation processes μ do ao μ do no and μ do cao are 1 52 0 11 and 0 07 mgo2 g vss 1 min 1 under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 in the iamr the our of ammonia oxidation nitrite oxidation and cod aerobic oxidation drop to 0 46 0 05 and 0 06 mgo2 gvss 1 min 1 only 30 3 48 8 and 87 0 of μ do ao μ do no and μ do cao respectively in addition since ch3coona can be fully biochemically oxidized the cod utilization rate of cod aerobic oxidation was estimated to be 0 06 mg cod g vss 1 min 1 by our hussain et al 2021 ryu et al 2022 the assay results showed that aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms have the strongest do affinity but have the weakest our on the contrary aob have the lowest do affinity but the strongest our the results indicated that low cod tn in the wastewater restricted the metabolism of aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms in the iamr which was favorable for ammonia oxidation the kinetic results also suggested that nob has a higher oxygen affinity than aob the k do ao and k do no obtained in this work were both in the range reported in the literatures 0 033 1 51 and 0 09 1 76 mg l 1 table 1 the results are different from conventional wisdom garrido et al 1997 wiesmann 1994 where k do no is higher than k do ao enabling the nob elimination but are similar to the results reported in nowka et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2020a it appears that nob in the iamr was k strategists i e nitrospira sun et al 2021 which has a lower oxygen half saturation coefficient than aob under low do conditions nowka et al 2015 wang et al 2020a nevertheless the our of nob is still much lower than that of aob probably resulting from the competition of anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification for no2 n thereby the no2 n utilization kinetics of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were also investigated 3 3 2 kinetics of nitrogenous substrate utilization substrate utilization kinetics of nh4 n in aerobic ammonia oxidation no3 n in heterotrophic nitrate reduction and no2 n in heterotrophic nitrite denitrification anammox and nitrite oxidation were investigated the substrate utilization profile of each assay is shown in fig s3 supplementary information in the kinetic assays of anammox the ratio of consumed no2 n to consumed nh4 n δno2 n δnh4 n and produced no3 n to consumed nh4 n δno3 n δnh4 n averaged 1 37 and 0 27 close to the theoretical stoichiometry of 1 32 and 0 26 in anammox reaction windey et al 2005 the monod parameters of each process are shown in table 1 the ks is an important parameter in biological processes and bacterial ecology lotti et al 2014 but the ks of nitrogenous nitrogen substrates are inconsistent in previous studies for example thalla et al 2010 reported that the ks of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation is in the range of 1 64 4 94 mg l 1 but jih et al 2008 considered it is 0 19 0 26 mg l 1 herein we summarized the ks related to the nitrogenous nitrogen substrates from 40 related literatures and presented the ks range in table 1 the ks obtained in this work were all within the range the μmax of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation μ nh 4 ao is 0 26 mg n g vss 1 min 1 much higher than other nitrogen reaction processes the ks of nh4 n of aerobic ammonia oxidation k nh 4 ao is 2 94 mg l 1 since the average nh4 n in the iamr in the steady period is about 34 28 mg l 1 fig 2 the ammonia oxidation rate is 92 1 of μ nh 4 ao the results indicated that the nh4 n in the iamr slightly inhibited aerobic ammonia oxidation however the actual reaction rate of aerobic ammonia oxidation in the iamr dropped to 0 07 mg n g vss 1 min 1 with the serious inhibition of do 30 3 the ks of no2 n of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification k no 2 am k no 2 no and k no 2 dn 2 are 0 71 0 36 and 0 70 mg l 1 respectively the μmax of no2 n of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification μ no 2 am μ no 2 no and μ no 2 dn 2 are 0 12 0 06 and 0 07 mg n g vss 1 min 1 respectively in the steady period the average no2 n in the iamr is 0 46 mg l 1 fig 2 considering the do inhibition the no2 n utilization rates of anammox nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were 0 04 0 02 and 0 01 mg n g vss 1 min 1 the results showed that anammox reaction rate was obviously higher than nitrite oxidation and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification nob was not the dominant nitrite consumer in the iamr though it has the highest affinity for do and no2 n this was attributed to iamr s intermittent aeration which interferes with the critical enzymes of nob and limits its metabolism ge et al 2014 li et al 2018 for no3 n utilization in heterotrophic nitrate reduction the μmax μ no 3 dn 3 and ks k no 3 dn 3 is 0 04 mg n g vss 1 min 1 and 0 64 mg l 1 respectively since the average no3 n in the iamr in the steady period is about 25 51 mg l 1 fig 2 the actual rate of heterotrophic nitrate reduction with do inhibition is 0 02 mg n g vss 1 min 1 the nitrogen removal rates of heterotrophic nitrate reduction and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were much lower than anammox confirming the dominance of anammox in the iamr cod anaerobic digestion occurred in the heterotrophic nitrite and nitrate reduction processes indicated by a consumed cod tn of 7 8 and 10 4 respectively fig 6 the cod utilization rate of cod anaerobic digestion can be obtained by subtracting the cod utilization rate of heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or heterotrophic nitrate reduction from the observed cod utilization rate in each assay the cod utilization profiles of the cod anaerobic digestion in all assays are approximately linear with a similar slope fig 6 the cod anaerobic digestion rate is calculated to be 0 23 mg cod g vss 1 min 1 through linear regression the powerful cod utilization potential of anaerobic digestion could inhibit the heterotrophic denitrification in the iamr 3 3 3 kinetics of anammox with heterotrophic nitrite denitrification or nitrate respiration the activity of anammox in a biosystem is affected by organics concentration and heterotrophic denitrification zhu et al 2017 it is necessary to understand the interaction effect between anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification positive effect 1 1 2 negative effect 1 1 2 and no interaction effect 1 1 2 a group of comprehensive assays of no2 n utilization of anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification were conducted in those assays the cod and nh4 n are sufficient and the no2 n was the only limited substrate section 1 2 4 of supplementary information the no2 n utilization rate in the comprehensive assays fig 7 a c was faster than that in the assays of anammox or heterotrophic nitrite denitrification fig s3 of supplementary information the no2 n utilization rate was fitted by combining the kinetic equations of heterotrophic nitrite denitrification and anammox the results fig 7a c showed that the fitting profiles are very close to the observed experimental profiles indicating no interaction effect between anammox and heterotrophic nitrite denitrification in the presence of cod because the reaction conditions of dnra and heterotrophic nitrate denitrification are very similar to each other cole and brown 1980 guerrero 1985 megonigal et al 2014 the kinetics rate of dnra and nitrate denitrification can not be revealed independently therefore there is a possibility of co occurrence of heterotrophic nitrate denitrification and dnra in heterotrophic nitrate reduction assays on the one hand no significant accumulation of nh4 n was observed in all assays indicating a weak process of dnra in the iamr on the other hand no3 n is still possible to be reduced to no2 n through nitrate respiration the first step of dnra the produced no2 n would be utilized by anammox to reduce nh4 n in the reaction system to confirm this view we performed a series of assays with sufficient cod nh4 n and no3 n section 1 2 4 of supplementary information as illustrated in fig 7d 7f simultaneous reduction of no3 n and nh4 n were observed visibly confirming the existence of nitrate respiration in the iamr no3 n reduced by nitrate respiration is postulated as r of the total nitrate reduced in assays according to eq 1 r is calculated as 84 6 using ga each simulated nh4 n reaction profile fitted well with the corresponding observed nh4 n reaction profile confirming the r was credible fig 7d 7f this process is described as partial denitrification anammox pdn a in which no2 n required for anammox can be supplied by nitrate reduction castro barros et al 2017 simultaneous pn a and pdn a has been regarded as a cost effective nitrogen removal process but is normally realized in multiple stage or batch processes jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020b wu et al 2019 this work revealed that simultaneous pn a and pdn a can also be achieved in a single stage microaerobic process 3 4 mathematical model and quantification of nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr a mathematical model with limited cod and do was established to quantify the nitrogen metabolic network in the iamr fig 5 combined with the kinetics of the involved essential processes table 1 the model was validated using the operational data of the iamr as it is a first principle model and independent of the operation of iamr the average simulated bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n are 35 62 0 60 23 27 mg l 1 close to the actual bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n averaging 34 28 0 46 and 25 51 mg l 1 respectively fig 8 a the statistical analysis evidenced the insignificant differences between the simulated results and the measured data with the p value of 0 31 0 17 and 0 31 for bulk nh4 n no2 n and no3 n respectively indicating the credibility of the model as introduced in section 2 6 the reaction rate of anammox under the do of 0 2 mg l 1 was estimated to be 0 75 times of that under anaerobic condition while the cod anaerobic digestion was completely inhibited thereby the model contains two postulated inhibition factors i e i do am 0 75 and i do cad 0 00 the effect of i do am and i do cad on the robustness of the model was also investigated the remse of simulation results with the two factors change were observed in fig 8b d the i do am significantly changed the remse of nh4 n and no2 n but the effect of i do cad can be negligible the remse of nh4 n decreased with the increase of i do am but the decrease rate became very slow when the i do am was over 0 60 these results indicated that the model is robust as i do am increased from 0 00 to 1 00 the remse of no2 n first decreased and then increased the minimum remse of no2 n appeared in the range of 0 65 0 70 of i do am i do am and i do cad affected the remse of no3 n the remse of no3 n decreased with i do am increasing from 0 to 0 75 but slightly increased with the i do am further increasing from 0 75 to 1 00 on the other hand the remse of no3 n rose slowly when the i do cad increased from 0 to 0 07 but rose rapidly when the i do cad further increased the results showed that cod anaerobic digestion is very sensitive to do the reasonable i do am is 0 65 0 75 for the best fit of the model according to eq 7 the reference value of the do half inhibition constant of anammox k do am is calculated to be 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 which plays a critical role in estimating the performance of anammox in different microaerobic processes to visually view the effect of i do am and i do cad on the model as a specific example the effect of i do am on the model with i do cad of 0 0 and the effect of i do cad on the model with i do am of 0 75 are simulated and shown in fig s7 supplementary information the flux of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the nitrogen metabolic network were calculated via the established model fig 5 the input nh4 n flux is normalized to 1 n 1 unit nitrogen element as the first step of nitrogen removal aerobic ammonia oxidation oxidizes 0 49 0 59 n of nh4 n to no2 n the transformation of produced no2 n is the active and complex in the iamr most no2 n 0 37 0 43 n are simultaneously utilized by anammox with 0 28 0 33 n of unoxidized nh4 n producing 0 58 0 67 n of n2 and 0 07 0 09 n of no3 n in the remaining no2 n only 0 07 0 12 n of no2 n is denitrified to n2 while 0 13 0 17 n of no2 n is further oxidized to no3 n the 0 08 0 13 n of no3 n is reduced to no2 n by nitrate respiration and then reutilized by anammox heterotrophic nitrate denitrification is relatively weak with only 0 01 0 02 n of no3 n reduced to n2 the nitrogen metabolic network indicated that simultaneous pn a and pdn a were vital to the tn removal in the iamr no3 n accumulation no3 n generated tn removed is one of the thorny problems in the long term operation of single stage anammox based systems du et al 2015 the no3 n accumulation in the iamr is 9 7 less than the theoretical 11 of pn a windey et al 2005 this could be attributed to the intermittent aeration for inhibiting nob ge et al 2014 li et al 2018 as well as pdn a for reducing nitrate if the iamr were changed to continuous aeration the no3 n production would rise by 39 6 calculated by the model this work revealed that intermittent aeration in a continuous system also inhibits the growth of nob nevertheless 66 of no3 n is produced by nitrite oxidation revealed by the model this implied that it is still tough to completely suppress nob in the microaerobic system fortunately the pdn a in the iamr reduced 84 6 of the produced no3 n to no2 n calculated from the model relieving the risk of no3 n accumulation therefore promoting the activity of pdn a should be a new way of reducing no3 n accumulation in microaerobic systems 4 conclusion the nitrogen metabolic network in the single stage microaerobic system iamr was first quantified through the metagenomic sequencing kinetics and mathematical model main conclusions include the monod kinetic parameters of various reactions involved in nitrogen metabolism were estimated using a novel algorithm with high reliability based on ga and the finite element method a kinetic based mathematical model was proposed and verified by a nonparametric permutation test with a significance level of 0 05 the kinetic based mathematical model revealed that pn a and pdn a were the dominant approaches to nitrogen removal and the pdn a as the primary no3 n reduction process removed 84 6 of the total no3 n the oxygen half inhibition constant of anammox was calibrated to be 0 37 0 60 mg l 1 filling the gap in quantifying do inhibition on anammox nob can be well suppressed using intermittent aeration in the continuous system but nitrate production would be increased by 39 6 in continuous aeration mode credit authorship contribution statement zhenju sun data curation
