1155,the term ecotechnology has been used since the early 1970s to describe combinations of practices relating to the environment and technological intervention despite its common usage there seems to be little consensus on its practical meaning in order to better define the term we conducted a systematic review with a thematic synthesis of all definitions of the term we searched a suite of bibliographic databases to collate literature referring to the term ecotechnology in various ways all explicit definitions were extracted from articles and were critically appraised to identify rich and broad definitions using thematic synthesis we generate a conceptual framework for definitions of the term ecotechnology based on themes that emerge across all explicit definitions we test this conceptual model using examples of ecotechnology identified from the articles relating to carbon and nutrients we identified 1221 articles referring to the term ecotechnology across 9 bibliographic databases of which 657 were unique articles of the 77 carbon and nutrients articles providing definitions almost half used the term ecotechnology as a buzzword some 38 themes were identified across the 49 explicit definitions and these were clustered into 9 groups combining processes integrating nature and society good for society good for nature profitability efficiency making nature work for society making society work for nature improving processes learning from the environment components equipment machinery hard technology and processes and behaviours soft technology as a result we developed a conceptual framework for the term ecotechnology which can serve as a useful concept unifying and gathering efforts around a common vision we also developed a working definition for the purpose of a project we were involved in based on the framework proposed keywords ecotech environmental engineering circular economy green economy bioeconomy ecotechnology 1 introduction 1 1 background it is generally recognized that humanity is facing a number of critical environmental challenges that without proper management can have devastating impacts on the natural environment and human welfare scholars have identified nine earth system processes or planetary boundaries which control conditions on this planet and in essence how habitable it is for humans benndorf 1995 rockström et al 2009 of these critical boundaries it is estimated that those for genetic biodiversity and biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus have already been crossed while climate change and land system change in critical risk zones steffen et al 2015 awareness of this situation is driving an on going paradigm shift in how we manage resources design and use techsnology and make decisions in society the 17 internationally agreed upon sustainable development goals from 2015 are a clear example of the growing consensus on the need for action the term ecotechnology was purportedly first proposed in 1971 by aida 1995 since this time it has increased in use across a range of different academic and public resources including published books fig 1 since the mid 2000s however the term appears to be used less frequently in some cases reducing in popularity in search engines such as google fig 2 however the term is still being used in published academic literature beyond this period fig 3 the brundtland report from 1987 brundtland 1987 is often cited as the beginning of the sustainability movement since then a broad diversity of concepts have emerged which attempt to define the foundations of what sustainability means and conceptualize how it can be achieved the search for solutions to meet the challenges of sustainability has also given rise to new terminology in the field of technology such as ecological engineering green technology and eco technology in 2015 the term ecotechnology was used as one of the themes for a funding call by the joint baltic sea research and development programme bonus https www bonusportal org which is supported by member states around the baltic sea together with the european union the call defined the theme eco technological approaches to achieve good ecological status in the baltic sea and called for proposals investigating methods for managing waste air and water pollution as well as restoration of marine habitats https www bonusportal org programme competitive calls bonus call 2015 blue baltic however while the call defined areas where ecotechnologies could be applied it did not explicitly define the term itself despite its common usage there seems to be little consensus on its practical meaning as exemplified in the bonus call ecotechnology is used in a variety of contexts and there is a lack of clarity about what it means and what technologies they can include while this lack of clarity allows for an openness to innovation and inclusion of new thinking there is also the risk of it becoming a buzzword without true meaning in the case of the bonus programme this lack of clarity also makes it difficult to bring together project stakeholders around a common understanding of the basis for the project we therefore identified a need to systematically review the literature on the use of the term ecotechnology and identify themes consistent in all explicit and example based definitions as a basis for the future work of the bonus return project this common understanding of ecotechnology was felt vital for the performance of our project its communication with stakeholders and the broader ecology community 1 2 role of stakeholders in defining the topic the topic for this review was initially proposed during a discussion between subject and methodology experts as part of bonus return led by the stockholm environment institute the discussion focused on the difficulty in defining the term ecotechnology in a way that is specific broadly accepted and understood as a result we identified a need to better understand how the term has been used to date across the scientific literature we identified thematic analysis and the production of a conceptual model for the term as appropriate methods to for this assessment the consortium leading the bonus return project acted as an expert stakeholder group and comments from the consortium members were used to revise this process and manuscript 1 3 objectives the primary question for this systematic review is how is the term ecotechnology used in research literature this review had the aims of comprehensively identifying studies that mention the term ecotechnology and investigating how the term has been used across the evidence base more specifically we have aimed to assess what groups of technologies are regarded as ecotechnologies and how broad the definitions are we summarise our findings in a conceptual framework the review has the following key question components population s scientific research articles in traditional academic literature outcome s definitions of the term ecotechnologies either explicit provided as definitions or implicit assessed as definitions based on the type of technology described study type s any research study including primary research articles commentaries reviews 2 methods systematic review is a gold standard means of identifying collating and synthesising a body of evidence on a narrow focused topic pullin and stewart 2006 higgins and green 2011 the methods were conducted in accordance to those proposed within an a priori systematic review protocol see supplementary file 1 and the review was conducted according to the cee guidelines for systematic reviews cee 2013 and best practice methodology for thematic synthesis thomas and harden 2008 2 1 searches we searched for evidence across a range of bibliographic databases for academic literature referring to the word ecotechnology we searched a total of 9 bibliographic databases see table 1 using a basic search string that encompasses the three main synonyms and their derivatives for the term ecotechnology which can be spelled in three ways ecotechnolog or eco technolog or eco technolog bibliographic database searches were performed in english since we are interested how the term is used in english only and it has not broadly been translated into other languages 2 2 searches for grey literature we focus here on how the academic literature has used the term ecotechnology and we have therefore not made efforts to search for grey literature 2 3 estimating the comprehensiveness of the search since our search is very simple we have not tested its comprehensiveness however we performed a scoping exercise prior to drafting the protocol outlined here where we assessed the possible synonyms and varieties of spelling that have been used for the term our search string reflects lessons learned during that scoping exercise we have identified articles that cite other authors within their definitions and we have included these additional articles where not already included in our search results 2 4 other sources of evidence all citation definitions identified during examination of the evidence base were screened for possible definitions of the term ecotechnology that may have been missed by our searches all relevant articles including primary source definitions were added in to the database manually 2 5 subsetting the literature since the bonus return project focuses on ecotechnologies with respect to carbon and nutrients we took a subset of the literature to make a more detailed summary of evidence relating to carbon and nutrients we did this by performing a search within our de duplicated search results for articles mentioning carbon or nutrients in their title or abstract as follows carbon or organic matter or nutrient or nitrogen or nitrate or nitrite or ammoni or phosphate or phosphorus 2 6 article retrieval we attempted to retrieve full text versions of all articles using institutional subscriptions from the warsaw university of life sciences a list of unobtainable articles is provided in supplementary file 2 2 7 screening articles for relevance all studies were screened according to the inclusion criteria outlined below at the same time as full text coding prior to this we conducted an initial comparison phase where four reviewers screened and coded a subset of 20 of studies discussing each study in turn before two reviewers completed full text screening and coding of the entire evidence base all returned search results should have mention the term ecotechnology in their title abstract or keywords due to the nature of the search and as a result the exclusion rate was very low all exclusion decisions were therefore reassessed by an additional reviewer before being finalised 2 8 inclusion criteria population s scientific articles in traditional academic literature outcome s definitions of the term ecotechnology explicit provided as definitions implicit assessed as definitions based on the type of technology described or citations references provided following use of the term study type s any research study including primary research articles commentaries reviews a further screening criterion was used when screening the subset of articles relating to carbon and nutrients intervention s any intervention undertaken for the purposes of reducing and or reusing carbon including organic matter and nutrients compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus we have provided a list of articles excluded during screening with reasons for exclusion provided in all cases see supplementary file 3 articles within the carbon and nutrients subset that provided an example based definition were coded for emergent eco technologies see below for all other articles only those referring to explicit definitions were taken on to critical appraisal meta data extraction and coding described below explicit definitions are inherently more valid than implicit definitions i e they are of relatively higher external validity and so the remaining synthesis focused primarily on explicit definitions alone 2 9 critical appraisal prior to synthesis each explicit definition was critically appraised these definitions were coded as rich or thin based on the amount of information provided thin definitions included those that explained only one half of the term ecotechnology for example referring to technologies used in ecological systems all allocations of thin definitions were justified descriptively by the coding reviewer and these decisions were discussed with another reviewer to reach agreement before being finalised coding studies as thin definitions occurred where there was insufficient information to apply the definition in practice for example where the term technology was not defined but was used in the definition in addition each explicit definition was coded as being either broad or limited in its applicability broad definitions referred to ecotechnologies across biomes or sectors whilst limited definitions described ecotechnologies within a specific context or field for example within aquatic ecosystems critical appraisal categories rich and thin broad and limited were used to examine the evidence base as a whole 2 10 meta data extraction and coding meta data extraction extracting descriptive information and coding assigning predefined categories was performed when considering full texts at which the schema in supplementary file 4 was applied to each study all coding was performed in eppi reviewer 4 thomas et al 2010 explicit definitions for the term ecotechnology were extracted as quotes using line by line coding within the eppi reviewer 4 software this coding was validated to ensure accuracy by double checking against highlighted text in pdf documents within eppi reviewer definitions were stored within a review database in the software thereby assigning each quotation to a specific location within the text of each pdf when complete the database was extracted from eppi reviewer into a spreadsheet database containing both qualitative data and the meta data and coding described above meta data and coding extraction was trialled by two coders and their outputs compared for between 16 articles all discrepancies were discussed along with inconsistencies in reporting terminology prior to coding the remainder of the evidence articles providing example based definitions within the carbon and nutrients subset were further coded based on the named ecotechnology for each article codes were added for every new ecotechnology mentioned populating a list of interventions specific to carbon and nutrients 2 11 synthesis narrative synthesis was performed by tabulating articles their definitions and key descriptive variables for explicit and example based definitions separately we have also examined patterns in the way the term ecotechnology is spelled used and defined within articles data from articles was synthesised qualitatively using thematic synthesis thomas and harden 2008 briefly thematic synthesis is the secondary research allegory of thematic analysis which aims to identify key messages from qualitative data and then combine these ideas into a broad conceptual framework that explains the system as a whole similarly thematic synthesis identifies themes within individual studies that can be combined into one framework in this case explaining what the term ecotechnology means in a variety of ways practically speaking studies reporting explicit definitions were examined in turn and emergent themes brief textual summaries of concepts were extracted iteratively as each article was read these themes were then considered independently of the evidence base and duplicate or overlapping themes were combined or redefined for clarity the result was a list of concepts reported across the evidence base the next step was to group similar themes into clusters of related concepts we then produced a framework linking these concepts the framework aimed to identify contrasts and emergent theories that linked contrasting themes finally the list of ecotechnologies extracted from example based definitions within the carbon and nutrients subset were tested again the conceptual framework adapting the framework where necessary to ensure functionality 3 results 3 1 the review process a total of 1221 search results were identified across the 9 databases searched providing 657 unique articles mentioning the word ecotechnology in some form see fig 4 of the 657 unique articles mentioning ecotechnology the first publication occurred in 1977 with an increase to around 55 publications per year in 2016 fig 5 there is a small peak in publications that occurs around 1995 with a subsequent drop around two years later a total of 156 articles were identified from the subset of articles relevant to carbon and nutrient with 100 of these obtainable in full text following full text assessment 4 articles were excluded as not being relevant to carbon and nutrients of the included articles 10 articles provided explicit definitions of the term ecotechnology whilst 73 articles provided examples of ecotechnologies some articles provided both only 5 articles provided citations for the term ecotechnology which were examined to ensure the citing sources had been included in the search results of the remaining 501 articles i e those not relevant for carbon and nutrients 230 were obtainable in full text following screening of these full texts 39 articles provided explicit definitions of the term ecotechnology some 191 articles were excluded at this stage since they provided only citations example based definitions not relating to carbon or nutrients or lacked definitions altogether the explicit definitions were combined across all relevant articles n 49 and a conceptual model was produced a list of examples of ecotechnology relating to carbon and nutrients was assembled and this was used to validate the draft conceptual model see emergent ecotechnologies for carbon and nutrients below 3 2 terminology the term ecotechnology or similar appeared to be used as a buzzword in a large proportion of the evidence base for carbon and nutrients 30 out of 77 articles referred to ecotechnologies only in the titles abstracts or keywords of those 14 references were only made in abstracts 9 only in keywords and 1 only in the title a total of 47 articles referred to ecotechnology in the main text fig 6 shows the frequency of the various spellings and permutations of ecotechnology across the carbon and nutrients subset of the evidence ecotechnology is the most frequently used term across all four word locations title abstract keywords main text followed by eco technology and ecotechnological plurals of ecotechnologies and eco technologies were more commonly used in abstracts and main texts some terms were only used in main texts but are perhaps more obscure ecotechnologists ecotechnologically and eco technological some permutations that were not part of the search string were highlighted including eco tech ecotechnique ecotechnical and technoecosystems the latter term however refers more to the system than the technology a large number of articles were authored by groups from multiple institutions with 19 articles authored by national collaborations and 31 by international collaborations table 2 shows the lead author affiliation country demonstrating that the usa 9 articles japan 7 china 6 and germany 5 have featured most often as lead author affiliation collaborations between authors from within one continent have most frequently been carried out within europe 6 articles with those within australasia 2 north america 2 and asia 1 less common none were published from african collaborations few articles were produced by single authors 14 3 3 types of definition a total of 34 of the 49 explicit definitions were judged to be rich as opposed to thin the 15 thin definitions failed to define technology e g chohji et al 1997 brzezinski 2005 lacked clarity e g miyawaki 1998 or were more of a description of processes rather than a clear definition e g piñeiro et al 2013 themes within thin definitions were synthesised where possible for example concepts relating to nature or society but not for what is meant by technology explicit definitions were broadly applicable to all sectors of environmental management and society in 38 out of 49 cases examples of limited definitions included those that referred only to agriculture abe and wakatsuki 2011 and aquatic ecosystems benndorf 1995 none of the explicit definitions was considered to be restrictively limited in breadth such that the definition became unrelatable to other systems however 3 4 the thematic coding process and conceptual model a total of 38 unique themes in definitions of the term ecotechnology were coded across all articles with explicit definitions see fig 7 and supplementary file 5 for details these themes were grouped into 9 clusters or grouped themes as described in fig 7 based on overlap in scope the process by which articles emergent themes and clusters were collated can be found in supplementary file 6 each of these 9 grouped themes forms a central theme in our conceptual model the 9 grouped themes were again grouped into contrasting themes e g good for society and good for nature or related themes e g making nature work for society and profitability efficiency these spectra of contrasting and related themes were then grouped into three overarching groups that related to 1 the type of technology that is employed 2 the nature of the benefits produced by using the technology and 3 the process by which the technology causes a change in outcome within this final group relating to processes we structured a spectrum from ecotechnologies that involved society and nature working together to ecotechnologies that pitched society and nature against one another for the primary benefit of one or other beneficiary our conceptual model that was produced from the synthesis of these clusters is shown in fig 8 these clusters represented three key concepts the type of technology the benefits of the intervention and the process through which the ecotechnology functions the type of technology definitions spanned from hard technologies components equipment and materials to soft technologies behaviours and processes we have termed this dichotomy hard versus soft the benefits of the intervention were described as being for the good of nature 26 articles for the good of society 18 articles or for both 7 articles we have termed this range the nature society spectrum the processes through which the ecotechnology functions span definitions involving manipulation of nature to suit society or the opposite making society work for nature such command of the environment definitions include aspects of profitability or efficiency processes that combine multiple procedures integrating nature and society work holistically or deal with complexity when integrating nature and society highlighting coexistence or harmony similarly some of these definitions describe improving processes and learning from nature for these process definitions there was a spectrum between the combination of society and nature e g holistic approaches 22 articles and society versus nature e g command or use of the environment 59 articles nine articles provided explicit definitions that spanned 5 or 6 emergent themes with all other articles mentioning fewer independent concepts table 3 these definitions may thus be considered as being rich in information although one is limited in scope and rather impenetrable in language zhang et al 1998 refers to agriculture the following themes were shared across three or more definitions low impact on the environment n 4 efficiency of anthropogenic processes n 4 complexity holistic approach n 3 design or command of the environment n 3 and recycling and reuse of resources n 3 the following were grouped themes that were shared across three or more of these 9 information rich definitions profitability efficiency n 6 improving processes learning from the environment n 5 combining processes integrating nature and society n 4 good for nature n 4 making nature work for society n 4 good for society n 3 these nine definitions provided rich information regarding the benefits and the process part of our conceptual model fig 8 however only two provided rich information regarding the technology i e hard versus soft many definitions did make references to activities practices means and measures for example implying that soft technologies should be considered as ecotechnologies only four articles across all explicit definitions made reference to hard technology see supplementary files 5 and 6 we mapped the four most information rich definitions onto our conceptual model as shown in fig 9 this demonstrates that even within this small group of the most rich definitions there is variation in the scope of the information contained and that some definitions e g chou et al 2007 are cover a greater breadth of themes within the model it is also important to note that none of these definitions described whether technologies were hard or soft 3 5 emergent ecotechnologies for carbon and nutrients a total of 38 examples of ecotechnologies were identified across 73 articles that related to carbon and nutrients based on the definitions provided within the citing articles these ecotechnologies were coded according to the 9 emergent clusters of themes in the conceptual model see supplementary file 7 this process was used to validate the conceptual model to assess whether it functions relative to real examples of technologies and modify the model where necessary observations regarding this mapping are provided in the discussion below following thematic synthesis of the example ecotechnologies we modified our conceptual model to reflect the fact that interventions lie on a spectrum between hard and soft rather than existing as a dichotomy no further modifications were deemed necessary and the ecotechnologies were judged to fit well onto the model 3 6 citation analysis for explicit definitions a total of 2572 citations were found on google scholar for the 49 articles with explicit definitions see additional file 5 four articles were cited over 100 times between 212 and 293 citations each aida 1983 straškraba 1985 leff 1986 swaminathan 1993 a detailed analysis of the intention behind these citations would perhaps identify which explicit definitions were represented by these citations however since the definitions themselves contribute only part of the articles content it is not possible to assume a high citation rate indicates acceptance of the definition furthermore poor or inaccurate definitions may also elicit citation by subsequent authors 4 discussion 4 1 ecotechnology as a buzzword almost half of the references to ecotechnology in the evidence base 30 of 77 were made in titles abstracts and keywords alone i e not in the main text this indicates the use of a buzzword i e a term that carries a particular weight in the readership particularly in the 10 articles that mentioned the term only in titles or keywords this use of the term as a buzzword is comparatively common relative to the number of explicit definitions 30 buzzword usages relative to 26 rich and broad explicit definitions there was some use of terminology that was uncommon across the evidence base for example technoecosystems and ecotechnique similarly authors spelled the term in a variety of ways that could hamper identification of the evidence base using search facilities on bibliographic databases e g eco technology eco tech ecotechnology and eco technology we therefore suggest that those wishing to use the term agree on a consistent spelling in future to facilitate identification for example using ecotechnology which was the most common spelling the majority of papers were multi authored and involved collaborations between institutions often across countries this suggests that the definitions and examples provided in these articles are representative of broad communities of researchers and there is unlikely to be a problem related to isolated schools of thought having discrepancies in definitions the use of buzzwords to tag articles a belonging to a specific concept may prove useful at a particular point in time e g uniting researchers and their publications around a certain concept however buzzwords that relate to ill defined vague or very broad concepts can lead to misunderstandings and prevent people from working together palmer et al 1997 in addition when these fuzzy buzzwords are replaced by other synonyms there is a risk of collating an incomplete and potentially biased evidence base 4 2 relation to ecological engineering several articles defined ecotechnology as a synonym for ecological engineering e g kuusemets and mander 1999 whilst others made a clear distinction between the two terms for example mitsch and jørgensen 2003 state that we consider ecological engineering and ecotechnology as similar but agree that the former term involves mostly creation and restoration of ecosystems while the latter term involves managing ecosystems we have avoided including ecological engineering in this thematic synthesis since the evidence base on the use of this term is extensive however the definitions that we have identified include creation and restoration as well as management 4 3 validation of the conceptual model coding of the 38 example ecotechnologies resulted in several observations regarding our conceptual model as follows 1 many technologies are on the spectrum of hard to soft since they involve a physical alteration of a natural system through both biological or physical additions and processes or behaviours these lie between pure behaviour changes or pure technological manipulations 2 it is inherently difficult to ascertain whether ecotechnologies are undertaken for nature or for society since there will be direct and indirect benefits to both some technologies are used primarily for the purpose of reducing human impacts whilst others are used for the improvement of natural ecosystems 3 it is challenging to know whether ecotechnologies were primarily used for the purposes of profitability although all processes are used with the aim of increasing or optimising efficiency 4 it is not always clear whether the ecotechnology is making nature work for society or making society work for nature this may reflect differences in terminology for example restoration lies more on the side of making society work for nature whilst constructed wetlands for water treatment lies more on the side of making nature work for society in practice however these technologies may not be different similarly this may reflect the fact that the term ecotechnology is used to imply mutual benefits for society and nature when this is not genuinely the desired aim of the intervention although important these issues above relate to how ecotechnologies are described in the reviewed literature the authors perhaps did not set out to provide a clear definition but are providing one unintentionally as such the descriptions may not intend to define both the eco and technology aspect of the term thus the observations above have not been particularly influential in further developing our conceptual model for the term ecotechnology 4 4 towards a universal working definition our conceptual model is built on explicit definitions from 49 articles across an extensive evidence base collated through a reliable repeatable and comprehensive systematic review none of the explicit definitions was deemed to be appropriate for the purposes of the bonus return project primarily since so few defined technology in sufficient detail for example it was not clear to us whether the term ecotechnology include practices and behaviours or political and decision support tools since none of the definitions in the literature dealt with this explicitly we identified a need for more clarity the earliest available explicit definition of the term ecotechnology is provided in aida 1983 the object of ecotechnology is to develop a scientific method for bringing about harmony or coexistence between the natural system and the artificial system however this is more of a description of purpose than an explicit definition per se and does not reflect the nuances of the 9 clusters in our conceptual model we have produced the following definition through consensus across the 6 partner institutions in the bonus return project this definition evolved through several iterations during discussions amongst experts see supplementary file 8 these evolutions reflected the need to refer to anthropogenic practices or processes and to the concept of at least do no harm eco technologies are human interventions in social ecological systems in the form of practices and or biological physical and chemical processes designed to minimise harm to the environment and provide services of value to society this definition encompasses all key aspects of our conceptual model including the type of technology practices and or biological physical and chemical processes the benefits designed to minimise harm to the environment and provide services of value to society and the process human interventions in social ecological systems 5 conclusions we have systematically reviewed and synthesised existing published definitions for the term ecotechnology in the academic literature we have produced an evidence based summary and conceptual model of these definitions and have used examples of ecotechnologies used for carbon and nutrients to refine this conceptual model finally we have produced our own definition that builds on the evidence and makes use of our conceptual model the explicit definitions identified across the evidence base are typically broad encompassing both physical biological or chemical interventions and behaviours or practices as such many of these definitions extend to any anthropogenic activity using lessons from or exploiting processes within nature for the good of the environment and or society because of this breadth any definition of the term ecotechnology will likely need further clarification for example within the bonus return project the additional clarification is made that we are interested in interventions to reduce and reuse carbon and nutrients compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus however we feel that the definition produced herein is a useful point of departure for those who chose to use the word ecotechnology in the future analysis of the use of the term ecotechnology suggests that the word is most often used as a buzzword the danger with buzzwords is that they are applied in widely varied contexts with differing intentions resulting in misunderstandings or a hollow term that lacks meaning however buzzwords often gain popularity because they trigger an emotional reaction or conceptual picture that resonate strongly with many people in this sense buzzwords can be very powerful tools for uniting people around common concepts indeed given the existing environmental crisis we are keenly in need of common visions to unite common action the strength of the sustainable development goals sdgs is not so much the targets as it is the uniting of people around a common goal while we are not likely to achieve all of the targets included in the sdgs the striving for them will surely move the world in a more sustainable direction similarly the concept of ecotechnology can serve as a vision or tool for reaching our sustainability goals the definitions of ecotechnology in this study imply a technology that is good for nature and good for society this study has highlighted some of the intricacies embedded within the term and developed a framework which can be used as a common reference for discussing how to achieve this balance between nature and society there are of course trade offs and there will be disagreement about the proper way to proceed overcoming these disagreements will require dialogue the use of more explicit definitions and transparent positioning of arguments will make the dialogue process easier the conceptual framework of ecotechnology proposed in this study can be a useful tool for users of ecotechnologies to position their arguments and clarify their worldviews in this way we can transform the term ecotechnologies from a buzzword to a useful concept for creating common visions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1155,the term ecotechnology has been used since the early 1970s to describe combinations of practices relating to the environment and technological intervention despite its common usage there seems to be little consensus on its practical meaning in order to better define the term we conducted a systematic review with a thematic synthesis of all definitions of the term we searched a suite of bibliographic databases to collate literature referring to the term ecotechnology in various ways all explicit definitions were extracted from articles and were critically appraised to identify rich and broad definitions using thematic synthesis we generate a conceptual framework for definitions of the term ecotechnology based on themes that emerge across all explicit definitions we test this conceptual model using examples of ecotechnology identified from the articles relating to carbon and nutrients we identified 1221 articles referring to the term ecotechnology across 9 bibliographic databases of which 657 were unique articles of the 77 carbon and nutrients articles providing definitions almost half used the term ecotechnology as a buzzword some 38 themes were identified across the 49 explicit definitions and these were clustered into 9 groups combining processes integrating nature and society good for society good for nature profitability efficiency making nature work for society making society work for nature improving processes learning from the environment components equipment machinery hard technology and processes and behaviours soft technology as a result we developed a conceptual framework for the term ecotechnology which can serve as a useful concept unifying and gathering efforts around a common vision we also developed a working definition for the purpose of a project we were involved in based on the framework proposed keywords ecotech environmental engineering circular economy green economy bioeconomy ecotechnology 1 introduction 1 1 background it is generally recognized that humanity is facing a number of critical environmental challenges that without proper management can have devastating impacts on the natural environment and human welfare scholars have identified nine earth system processes or planetary boundaries which control conditions on this planet and in essence how habitable it is for humans benndorf 1995 rockström et al 2009 of these critical boundaries it is estimated that those for genetic biodiversity and biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus have already been crossed while climate change and land system change in critical risk zones steffen et al 2015 awareness of this situation is driving an on going paradigm shift in how we manage resources design and use techsnology and make decisions in society the 17 internationally agreed upon sustainable development goals from 2015 are a clear example of the growing consensus on the need for action the term ecotechnology was purportedly first proposed in 1971 by aida 1995 since this time it has increased in use across a range of different academic and public resources including published books fig 1 since the mid 2000s however the term appears to be used less frequently in some cases reducing in popularity in search engines such as google fig 2 however the term is still being used in published academic literature beyond this period fig 3 the brundtland report from 1987 brundtland 1987 is often cited as the beginning of the sustainability movement since then a broad diversity of concepts have emerged which attempt to define the foundations of what sustainability means and conceptualize how it can be achieved the search for solutions to meet the challenges of sustainability has also given rise to new terminology in the field of technology such as ecological engineering green technology and eco technology in 2015 the term ecotechnology was used as one of the themes for a funding call by the joint baltic sea research and development programme bonus https www bonusportal org which is supported by member states around the baltic sea together with the european union the call defined the theme eco technological approaches to achieve good ecological status in the baltic sea and called for proposals investigating methods for managing waste air and water pollution as well as restoration of marine habitats https www bonusportal org programme competitive calls bonus call 2015 blue baltic however while the call defined areas where ecotechnologies could be applied it did not explicitly define the term itself despite its common usage there seems to be little consensus on its practical meaning as exemplified in the bonus call ecotechnology is used in a variety of contexts and there is a lack of clarity about what it means and what technologies they can include while this lack of clarity allows for an openness to innovation and inclusion of new thinking there is also the risk of it becoming a buzzword without true meaning in the case of the bonus programme this lack of clarity also makes it difficult to bring together project stakeholders around a common understanding of the basis for the project we therefore identified a need to systematically review the literature on the use of the term ecotechnology and identify themes consistent in all explicit and example based definitions as a basis for the future work of the bonus return project this common understanding of ecotechnology was felt vital for the performance of our project its communication with stakeholders and the broader ecology community 1 2 role of stakeholders in defining the topic the topic for this review was initially proposed during a discussion between subject and methodology experts as part of bonus return led by the stockholm environment institute the discussion focused on the difficulty in defining the term ecotechnology in a way that is specific broadly accepted and understood as a result we identified a need to better understand how the term has been used to date across the scientific literature we identified thematic analysis and the production of a conceptual model for the term as appropriate methods to for this assessment the consortium leading the bonus return project acted as an expert stakeholder group and comments from the consortium members were used to revise this process and manuscript 1 3 objectives the primary question for this systematic review is how is the term ecotechnology used in research literature this review had the aims of comprehensively identifying studies that mention the term ecotechnology and investigating how the term has been used across the evidence base more specifically we have aimed to assess what groups of technologies are regarded as ecotechnologies and how broad the definitions are we summarise our findings in a conceptual framework the review has the following key question components population s scientific research articles in traditional academic literature outcome s definitions of the term ecotechnologies either explicit provided as definitions or implicit assessed as definitions based on the type of technology described study type s any research study including primary research articles commentaries reviews 2 methods systematic review is a gold standard means of identifying collating and synthesising a body of evidence on a narrow focused topic pullin and stewart 2006 higgins and green 2011 the methods were conducted in accordance to those proposed within an a priori systematic review protocol see supplementary file 1 and the review was conducted according to the cee guidelines for systematic reviews cee 2013 and best practice methodology for thematic synthesis thomas and harden 2008 2 1 searches we searched for evidence across a range of bibliographic databases for academic literature referring to the word ecotechnology we searched a total of 9 bibliographic databases see table 1 using a basic search string that encompasses the three main synonyms and their derivatives for the term ecotechnology which can be spelled in three ways ecotechnolog or eco technolog or eco technolog bibliographic database searches were performed in english since we are interested how the term is used in english only and it has not broadly been translated into other languages 2 2 searches for grey literature we focus here on how the academic literature has used the term ecotechnology and we have therefore not made efforts to search for grey literature 2 3 estimating the comprehensiveness of the search since our search is very simple we have not tested its comprehensiveness however we performed a scoping exercise prior to drafting the protocol outlined here where we assessed the possible synonyms and varieties of spelling that have been used for the term our search string reflects lessons learned during that scoping exercise we have identified articles that cite other authors within their definitions and we have included these additional articles where not already included in our search results 2 4 other sources of evidence all citation definitions identified during examination of the evidence base were screened for possible definitions of the term ecotechnology that may have been missed by our searches all relevant articles including primary source definitions were added in to the database manually 2 5 subsetting the literature since the bonus return project focuses on ecotechnologies with respect to carbon and nutrients we took a subset of the literature to make a more detailed summary of evidence relating to carbon and nutrients we did this by performing a search within our de duplicated search results for articles mentioning carbon or nutrients in their title or abstract as follows carbon or organic matter or nutrient or nitrogen or nitrate or nitrite or ammoni or phosphate or phosphorus 2 6 article retrieval we attempted to retrieve full text versions of all articles using institutional subscriptions from the warsaw university of life sciences a list of unobtainable articles is provided in supplementary file 2 2 7 screening articles for relevance all studies were screened according to the inclusion criteria outlined below at the same time as full text coding prior to this we conducted an initial comparison phase where four reviewers screened and coded a subset of 20 of studies discussing each study in turn before two reviewers completed full text screening and coding of the entire evidence base all returned search results should have mention the term ecotechnology in their title abstract or keywords due to the nature of the search and as a result the exclusion rate was very low all exclusion decisions were therefore reassessed by an additional reviewer before being finalised 2 8 inclusion criteria population s scientific articles in traditional academic literature outcome s definitions of the term ecotechnology explicit provided as definitions implicit assessed as definitions based on the type of technology described or citations references provided following use of the term study type s any research study including primary research articles commentaries reviews a further screening criterion was used when screening the subset of articles relating to carbon and nutrients intervention s any intervention undertaken for the purposes of reducing and or reusing carbon including organic matter and nutrients compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus we have provided a list of articles excluded during screening with reasons for exclusion provided in all cases see supplementary file 3 articles within the carbon and nutrients subset that provided an example based definition were coded for emergent eco technologies see below for all other articles only those referring to explicit definitions were taken on to critical appraisal meta data extraction and coding described below explicit definitions are inherently more valid than implicit definitions i e they are of relatively higher external validity and so the remaining synthesis focused primarily on explicit definitions alone 2 9 critical appraisal prior to synthesis each explicit definition was critically appraised these definitions were coded as rich or thin based on the amount of information provided thin definitions included those that explained only one half of the term ecotechnology for example referring to technologies used in ecological systems all allocations of thin definitions were justified descriptively by the coding reviewer and these decisions were discussed with another reviewer to reach agreement before being finalised coding studies as thin definitions occurred where there was insufficient information to apply the definition in practice for example where the term technology was not defined but was used in the definition in addition each explicit definition was coded as being either broad or limited in its applicability broad definitions referred to ecotechnologies across biomes or sectors whilst limited definitions described ecotechnologies within a specific context or field for example within aquatic ecosystems critical appraisal categories rich and thin broad and limited were used to examine the evidence base as a whole 2 10 meta data extraction and coding meta data extraction extracting descriptive information and coding assigning predefined categories was performed when considering full texts at which the schema in supplementary file 4 was applied to each study all coding was performed in eppi reviewer 4 thomas et al 2010 explicit definitions for the term ecotechnology were extracted as quotes using line by line coding within the eppi reviewer 4 software this coding was validated to ensure accuracy by double checking against highlighted text in pdf documents within eppi reviewer definitions were stored within a review database in the software thereby assigning each quotation to a specific location within the text of each pdf when complete the database was extracted from eppi reviewer into a spreadsheet database containing both qualitative data and the meta data and coding described above meta data and coding extraction was trialled by two coders and their outputs compared for between 16 articles all discrepancies were discussed along with inconsistencies in reporting terminology prior to coding the remainder of the evidence articles providing example based definitions within the carbon and nutrients subset were further coded based on the named ecotechnology for each article codes were added for every new ecotechnology mentioned populating a list of interventions specific to carbon and nutrients 2 11 synthesis narrative synthesis was performed by tabulating articles their definitions and key descriptive variables for explicit and example based definitions separately we have also examined patterns in the way the term ecotechnology is spelled used and defined within articles data from articles was synthesised qualitatively using thematic synthesis thomas and harden 2008 briefly thematic synthesis is the secondary research allegory of thematic analysis which aims to identify key messages from qualitative data and then combine these ideas into a broad conceptual framework that explains the system as a whole similarly thematic synthesis identifies themes within individual studies that can be combined into one framework in this case explaining what the term ecotechnology means in a variety of ways practically speaking studies reporting explicit definitions were examined in turn and emergent themes brief textual summaries of concepts were extracted iteratively as each article was read these themes were then considered independently of the evidence base and duplicate or overlapping themes were combined or redefined for clarity the result was a list of concepts reported across the evidence base the next step was to group similar themes into clusters of related concepts we then produced a framework linking these concepts the framework aimed to identify contrasts and emergent theories that linked contrasting themes finally the list of ecotechnologies extracted from example based definitions within the carbon and nutrients subset were tested again the conceptual framework adapting the framework where necessary to ensure functionality 3 results 3 1 the review process a total of 1221 search results were identified across the 9 databases searched providing 657 unique articles mentioning the word ecotechnology in some form see fig 4 of the 657 unique articles mentioning ecotechnology the first publication occurred in 1977 with an increase to around 55 publications per year in 2016 fig 5 there is a small peak in publications that occurs around 1995 with a subsequent drop around two years later a total of 156 articles were identified from the subset of articles relevant to carbon and nutrient with 100 of these obtainable in full text following full text assessment 4 articles were excluded as not being relevant to carbon and nutrients of the included articles 10 articles provided explicit definitions of the term ecotechnology whilst 73 articles provided examples of ecotechnologies some articles provided both only 5 articles provided citations for the term ecotechnology which were examined to ensure the citing sources had been included in the search results of the remaining 501 articles i e those not relevant for carbon and nutrients 230 were obtainable in full text following screening of these full texts 39 articles provided explicit definitions of the term ecotechnology some 191 articles were excluded at this stage since they provided only citations example based definitions not relating to carbon or nutrients or lacked definitions altogether the explicit definitions were combined across all relevant articles n 49 and a conceptual model was produced a list of examples of ecotechnology relating to carbon and nutrients was assembled and this was used to validate the draft conceptual model see emergent ecotechnologies for carbon and nutrients below 3 2 terminology the term ecotechnology or similar appeared to be used as a buzzword in a large proportion of the evidence base for carbon and nutrients 30 out of 77 articles referred to ecotechnologies only in the titles abstracts or keywords of those 14 references were only made in abstracts 9 only in keywords and 1 only in the title a total of 47 articles referred to ecotechnology in the main text fig 6 shows the frequency of the various spellings and permutations of ecotechnology across the carbon and nutrients subset of the evidence ecotechnology is the most frequently used term across all four word locations title abstract keywords main text followed by eco technology and ecotechnological plurals of ecotechnologies and eco technologies were more commonly used in abstracts and main texts some terms were only used in main texts but are perhaps more obscure ecotechnologists ecotechnologically and eco technological some permutations that were not part of the search string were highlighted including eco tech ecotechnique ecotechnical and technoecosystems the latter term however refers more to the system than the technology a large number of articles were authored by groups from multiple institutions with 19 articles authored by national collaborations and 31 by international collaborations table 2 shows the lead author affiliation country demonstrating that the usa 9 articles japan 7 china 6 and germany 5 have featured most often as lead author affiliation collaborations between authors from within one continent have most frequently been carried out within europe 6 articles with those within australasia 2 north america 2 and asia 1 less common none were published from african collaborations few articles were produced by single authors 14 3 3 types of definition a total of 34 of the 49 explicit definitions were judged to be rich as opposed to thin the 15 thin definitions failed to define technology e g chohji et al 1997 brzezinski 2005 lacked clarity e g miyawaki 1998 or were more of a description of processes rather than a clear definition e g piñeiro et al 2013 themes within thin definitions were synthesised where possible for example concepts relating to nature or society but not for what is meant by technology explicit definitions were broadly applicable to all sectors of environmental management and society in 38 out of 49 cases examples of limited definitions included those that referred only to agriculture abe and wakatsuki 2011 and aquatic ecosystems benndorf 1995 none of the explicit definitions was considered to be restrictively limited in breadth such that the definition became unrelatable to other systems however 3 4 the thematic coding process and conceptual model a total of 38 unique themes in definitions of the term ecotechnology were coded across all articles with explicit definitions see fig 7 and supplementary file 5 for details these themes were grouped into 9 clusters or grouped themes as described in fig 7 based on overlap in scope the process by which articles emergent themes and clusters were collated can be found in supplementary file 6 each of these 9 grouped themes forms a central theme in our conceptual model the 9 grouped themes were again grouped into contrasting themes e g good for society and good for nature or related themes e g making nature work for society and profitability efficiency these spectra of contrasting and related themes were then grouped into three overarching groups that related to 1 the type of technology that is employed 2 the nature of the benefits produced by using the technology and 3 the process by which the technology causes a change in outcome within this final group relating to processes we structured a spectrum from ecotechnologies that involved society and nature working together to ecotechnologies that pitched society and nature against one another for the primary benefit of one or other beneficiary our conceptual model that was produced from the synthesis of these clusters is shown in fig 8 these clusters represented three key concepts the type of technology the benefits of the intervention and the process through which the ecotechnology functions the type of technology definitions spanned from hard technologies components equipment and materials to soft technologies behaviours and processes we have termed this dichotomy hard versus soft the benefits of the intervention were described as being for the good of nature 26 articles for the good of society 18 articles or for both 7 articles we have termed this range the nature society spectrum the processes through which the ecotechnology functions span definitions involving manipulation of nature to suit society or the opposite making society work for nature such command of the environment definitions include aspects of profitability or efficiency processes that combine multiple procedures integrating nature and society work holistically or deal with complexity when integrating nature and society highlighting coexistence or harmony similarly some of these definitions describe improving processes and learning from nature for these process definitions there was a spectrum between the combination of society and nature e g holistic approaches 22 articles and society versus nature e g command or use of the environment 59 articles nine articles provided explicit definitions that spanned 5 or 6 emergent themes with all other articles mentioning fewer independent concepts table 3 these definitions may thus be considered as being rich in information although one is limited in scope and rather impenetrable in language zhang et al 1998 refers to agriculture the following themes were shared across three or more definitions low impact on the environment n 4 efficiency of anthropogenic processes n 4 complexity holistic approach n 3 design or command of the environment n 3 and recycling and reuse of resources n 3 the following were grouped themes that were shared across three or more of these 9 information rich definitions profitability efficiency n 6 improving processes learning from the environment n 5 combining processes integrating nature and society n 4 good for nature n 4 making nature work for society n 4 good for society n 3 these nine definitions provided rich information regarding the benefits and the process part of our conceptual model fig 8 however only two provided rich information regarding the technology i e hard versus soft many definitions did make references to activities practices means and measures for example implying that soft technologies should be considered as ecotechnologies only four articles across all explicit definitions made reference to hard technology see supplementary files 5 and 6 we mapped the four most information rich definitions onto our conceptual model as shown in fig 9 this demonstrates that even within this small group of the most rich definitions there is variation in the scope of the information contained and that some definitions e g chou et al 2007 are cover a greater breadth of themes within the model it is also important to note that none of these definitions described whether technologies were hard or soft 3 5 emergent ecotechnologies for carbon and nutrients a total of 38 examples of ecotechnologies were identified across 73 articles that related to carbon and nutrients based on the definitions provided within the citing articles these ecotechnologies were coded according to the 9 emergent clusters of themes in the conceptual model see supplementary file 7 this process was used to validate the conceptual model to assess whether it functions relative to real examples of technologies and modify the model where necessary observations regarding this mapping are provided in the discussion below following thematic synthesis of the example ecotechnologies we modified our conceptual model to reflect the fact that interventions lie on a spectrum between hard and soft rather than existing as a dichotomy no further modifications were deemed necessary and the ecotechnologies were judged to fit well onto the model 3 6 citation analysis for explicit definitions a total of 2572 citations were found on google scholar for the 49 articles with explicit definitions see additional file 5 four articles were cited over 100 times between 212 and 293 citations each aida 1983 straškraba 1985 leff 1986 swaminathan 1993 a detailed analysis of the intention behind these citations would perhaps identify which explicit definitions were represented by these citations however since the definitions themselves contribute only part of the articles content it is not possible to assume a high citation rate indicates acceptance of the definition furthermore poor or inaccurate definitions may also elicit citation by subsequent authors 4 discussion 4 1 ecotechnology as a buzzword almost half of the references to ecotechnology in the evidence base 30 of 77 were made in titles abstracts and keywords alone i e not in the main text this indicates the use of a buzzword i e a term that carries a particular weight in the readership particularly in the 10 articles that mentioned the term only in titles or keywords this use of the term as a buzzword is comparatively common relative to the number of explicit definitions 30 buzzword usages relative to 26 rich and broad explicit definitions there was some use of terminology that was uncommon across the evidence base for example technoecosystems and ecotechnique similarly authors spelled the term in a variety of ways that could hamper identification of the evidence base using search facilities on bibliographic databases e g eco technology eco tech ecotechnology and eco technology we therefore suggest that those wishing to use the term agree on a consistent spelling in future to facilitate identification for example using ecotechnology which was the most common spelling the majority of papers were multi authored and involved collaborations between institutions often across countries this suggests that the definitions and examples provided in these articles are representative of broad communities of researchers and there is unlikely to be a problem related to isolated schools of thought having discrepancies in definitions the use of buzzwords to tag articles a belonging to a specific concept may prove useful at a particular point in time e g uniting researchers and their publications around a certain concept however buzzwords that relate to ill defined vague or very broad concepts can lead to misunderstandings and prevent people from working together palmer et al 1997 in addition when these fuzzy buzzwords are replaced by other synonyms there is a risk of collating an incomplete and potentially biased evidence base 4 2 relation to ecological engineering several articles defined ecotechnology as a synonym for ecological engineering e g kuusemets and mander 1999 whilst others made a clear distinction between the two terms for example mitsch and jørgensen 2003 state that we consider ecological engineering and ecotechnology as similar but agree that the former term involves mostly creation and restoration of ecosystems while the latter term involves managing ecosystems we have avoided including ecological engineering in this thematic synthesis since the evidence base on the use of this term is extensive however the definitions that we have identified include creation and restoration as well as management 4 3 validation of the conceptual model coding of the 38 example ecotechnologies resulted in several observations regarding our conceptual model as follows 1 many technologies are on the spectrum of hard to soft since they involve a physical alteration of a natural system through both biological or physical additions and processes or behaviours these lie between pure behaviour changes or pure technological manipulations 2 it is inherently difficult to ascertain whether ecotechnologies are undertaken for nature or for society since there will be direct and indirect benefits to both some technologies are used primarily for the purpose of reducing human impacts whilst others are used for the improvement of natural ecosystems 3 it is challenging to know whether ecotechnologies were primarily used for the purposes of profitability although all processes are used with the aim of increasing or optimising efficiency 4 it is not always clear whether the ecotechnology is making nature work for society or making society work for nature this may reflect differences in terminology for example restoration lies more on the side of making society work for nature whilst constructed wetlands for water treatment lies more on the side of making nature work for society in practice however these technologies may not be different similarly this may reflect the fact that the term ecotechnology is used to imply mutual benefits for society and nature when this is not genuinely the desired aim of the intervention although important these issues above relate to how ecotechnologies are described in the reviewed literature the authors perhaps did not set out to provide a clear definition but are providing one unintentionally as such the descriptions may not intend to define both the eco and technology aspect of the term thus the observations above have not been particularly influential in further developing our conceptual model for the term ecotechnology 4 4 towards a universal working definition our conceptual model is built on explicit definitions from 49 articles across an extensive evidence base collated through a reliable repeatable and comprehensive systematic review none of the explicit definitions was deemed to be appropriate for the purposes of the bonus return project primarily since so few defined technology in sufficient detail for example it was not clear to us whether the term ecotechnology include practices and behaviours or political and decision support tools since none of the definitions in the literature dealt with this explicitly we identified a need for more clarity the earliest available explicit definition of the term ecotechnology is provided in aida 1983 the object of ecotechnology is to develop a scientific method for bringing about harmony or coexistence between the natural system and the artificial system however this is more of a description of purpose than an explicit definition per se and does not reflect the nuances of the 9 clusters in our conceptual model we have produced the following definition through consensus across the 6 partner institutions in the bonus return project this definition evolved through several iterations during discussions amongst experts see supplementary file 8 these evolutions reflected the need to refer to anthropogenic practices or processes and to the concept of at least do no harm eco technologies are human interventions in social ecological systems in the form of practices and or biological physical and chemical processes designed to minimise harm to the environment and provide services of value to society this definition encompasses all key aspects of our conceptual model including the type of technology practices and or biological physical and chemical processes the benefits designed to minimise harm to the environment and provide services of value to society and the process human interventions in social ecological systems 5 conclusions we have systematically reviewed and synthesised existing published definitions for the term ecotechnology in the academic literature we have produced an evidence based summary and conceptual model of these definitions and have used examples of ecotechnologies used for carbon and nutrients to refine this conceptual model finally we have produced our own definition that builds on the evidence and makes use of our conceptual model the explicit definitions identified across the evidence base are typically broad encompassing both physical biological or chemical interventions and behaviours or practices as such many of these definitions extend to any anthropogenic activity using lessons from or exploiting processes within nature for the good of the environment and or society because of this breadth any definition of the term ecotechnology will likely need further clarification for example within the bonus return project the additional clarification is made that we are interested in interventions to reduce and reuse carbon and nutrients compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus however we feel that the definition produced herein is a useful point of departure for those who chose to use the word ecotechnology in the future analysis of the use of the term ecotechnology suggests that the word is most often used as a buzzword the danger with buzzwords is that they are applied in widely varied contexts with differing intentions resulting in misunderstandings or a hollow term that lacks meaning however buzzwords often gain popularity because they trigger an emotional reaction or conceptual picture that resonate strongly with many people in this sense buzzwords can be very powerful tools for uniting people around common concepts indeed given the existing environmental crisis we are keenly in need of common visions to unite common action the strength of the sustainable development goals sdgs is not so much the targets as it is the uniting of people around a common goal while we are not likely to achieve all of the targets included in the sdgs the striving for them will surely move the world in a more sustainable direction similarly the concept of ecotechnology can serve as a vision or tool for reaching our sustainability goals the definitions of ecotechnology in this study imply a technology that is good for nature and good for society this study has highlighted some of the intricacies embedded within the term and developed a framework which can be used as a common reference for discussing how to achieve this balance between nature and society there are of course trade offs and there will be disagreement about the proper way to proceed overcoming these disagreements will require dialogue the use of more explicit definitions and transparent positioning of arguments will make the dialogue process easier the conceptual framework of ecotechnology proposed in this study can be a useful tool for users of ecotechnologies to position their arguments and clarify their worldviews in this way we can transform the term ecotechnologies from a buzzword to a useful concept for creating common visions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was

1156,ecosystem services es are a powerful tool in assessing the relationships that people have with their surrounding tangible environment and the more distant intangible global benefits ecoservices

introduction sustainable development implemented in its many guises for more than 25 years is based on the convergence of the three pillars economic development social equity and environmental protection coupled with good governance progress has been made in developing adoption and assessment frameworks with the derivation of sustainable development metrics and improved business and government participation in the sustainability precepts embodied in the sustainable development goals sdgs drexhage and murphy 2010 un 2015 however their widespread adoption remains elusive and implementation continues to be difficult even though existing business models and approaches were declared to be unsustainable at the world economic forum in 2010 waughray 2011 and in numerous documents and public statements since there has been limited notable progress towards changed business practice and governance suggested methodologies have yet to find the political entry points required to make real progress hydrological ecoservices are global multi scalar and fundamental to human and environmental well being underpinning a myriad of interconnected dynamic systems haines young and potschin 2013 costanza et al 2014 young et al 2015 anthropogenic activities and urbanisation have replaced or modified these hydrological ecoservices and their natural processes of cycling and rejuvenation significant portions of the globe are now given over to activities such as agriculture forestry fisheries energy production and mining that interdict or displace ecoservices provided through natural processes un water 2013 ipcc synthesis report 2014 bourke et al 2015 young et al 2015 however these industry activities and sectors remain crucial for strengthening food and water security globally therefore the impact of these production systems must be reduced or modified or communities and the environment will remain vulnerable and potentially at risk alternative options in water and land use are therefore required at local and global scales that are transferable to catchments of any size the productive focus can then shift towards enhancing source water quality and land use optimisation through a transformative process that encourages a move from traditional single use rural landscapes to an ecosystem services es based multi functional landscape creating a framework that encourages innovative and novel pathways to a more holistic and integrated management approach to land use land cover lulc changes that can deliver the sdgs 2 an ecoservices approach a suggested methodology for implementing the sdgs the european union eu ratified the biodiversity action plan bap in 2006 since then its implementation has increased the broader communities understanding of the drivers of biodiversity loss including climate change and how biodiversity is linked with other sectoral activities european commission 2010a implementing the bap objectives highlighted the basic role and fundamental importance of ecosystem dynamics and has strengthened the need for better managed outcomes to facilitate mitigation and adaption to climate change european commission 2010b highlighting the need to deliver sustainability across the all agricultural production urban and industrial sectors clearly a necessity if any of the sdg s are to be delivered multi functionality represents a new challenge for stakeholders operating in these sectors both regulators and operators need to manage natural resources or natural capital to achieve the environmental standards of the relevant eu policies roebeling et al 2014 while also maintaining viable and sustainable integrated dynamic ecoservices this can be measured by the enhancement in the services provided by functional agro ecosystems peri urban urban and environmental systems mea 2005 brauman et al 2007 polasky et al 2015 whilst agricultural systems are often the dominant land use multi functional land use considers integrating alternate nature based land management practices such as pasture transitions to agro forestry seppelt et al 2013 volk 2013 wang et al 2015 and can include nature based solutions for mining and urbanisation the spatial mosaic of variable land use types and intensities are decisive in the provision of water related ecosystem services and will create synergies with other aspects of landscapes e g soil conservation habitat protection the re allocation of critical water resources without understanding these interdependencies often has unintended and irreversible consequences for ecosystem functions and its services understanding these interdependencies is crucial to reducing biodiversity loss and ecosystem functionality esf impairment associated with land use intensification pilaš et al 2011 seppelt et al 2012 mcknight et al 2015 2 1 water the key ingredient the concept of water as part of a natural capital asset that is available to all independent nation states is an important one and it forms part of the global services economy seppelt et al 2012 over the next 25 years an ever increasingly urbanised planet coupled with climate change and population shifts will continue to exert significant pressure on the level and complexity of natural capital allocation and trade offs are required fig 1 trade offs that at the same time must act to minimise ecosystem degradation and deliver sustainable outcomes in multiple sectors and scales coles and hall 2012 given the cross sectoral nature of the inter relationships scale factors and environmental interdependencies a revised valuation commoditisation and governance approach is required fig 2 a failure to recognise the need to operationalise an integrative analytical framework will undermine the capacity of our natural capital and industrial complex to provide for future societal demands with the food health energy and environment the sectors most at risk iges 2015 however achieving food energy and water security is an enormous challenge due to the size and diversity of societal and environmental needs by the same token growing insecurities threaten the safe operating space of human society rockström et al 2009 the prevailing paradigm presents technological approaches to agricultural intensification as the most viable solution to increasing food production despite its severe and negative impacts on the environment daily and de clerck 2014 even while our resource use is not yet meeting the minimum threshold required to obtain just social conditions for humanity including meeting global food and income needs raworth 2012 2 2 alternative strategies until recently ecosystem services es have largely been treated as if they have no value with ecosystems frequently managed for short term gain at the expense of broader longer term societal benefits bourke et al 2015 therefore it makes sense to create a process in which the adoption of an integrated perspective positions water primacy at its core with the focus aimed at a more secure and sustainable future thus by linking the biophysical aspects of ecosystems with human benefits through the notion of es the basis for determining value and the trade offs ecological socio cultural economic and monetary for the loss of ecosystem functionality esf can be established see figs 1 and 2 by establishing es metrics that are both spatially and temporally explicit and at scales meaningful for policy formation or best practice interventions further analysis of action impact can be undertaken prior to implementation fig 2 in addition to innovative technologies a new framework that enables assessment of the interconnectedness of environment and ecoservices industry and economics and social and national interests is required the triple bottom line approach currently used by governments and industry for examining the effectiveness efficiency and economics of decisions has proven to be limited in its understanding of this interconnectedness and therefore invites reinvention coles and hall 2012 a space in which production and water supply systems can be managed as multifunctional multi criteria accredited systems rather than focus on a single use system one that also provides for increased resource use efficiency and promoting the integration of es based lulc with the key elements included such as improving and maintaining soil health food productivity water quality and system functionality fig 2 3 the framework based on the preceding discussion it is obvious that integrated analytical frameworks are required to determine the impact resilience short to long term beneficiaries and losses of various human endeavours improved es based best management practices bmps can provide tangible societal benefits in ways which are both directly financially beneficial through improved quality of life and environmentally sustainable while increasing net productive capacity mea 2005 teeb 2010 shortle and jordan 2014 mcintyre et al 2015 whether this is from subsistence farming or artisan mining or from large scale mining and agricultural developments or increased urbanisation there are significant and often cumulative negative impacts on our global natural capital assets particularly soil and water that are resulting in a variety and scale of often irreversible loss of services linking the biophysical aspects of ecosystems with human benefits through the notion of es esf provides the essential basis to assess and value the trade offs ecological socio cultural economic and monetary involved in the loss of esf whether this be temporary or permanent these approaches by necessity are required to be delivered at local national and global scales however the mechanisms do not currently exist that allow this to occur given the fascination for profitability stakeholder shareholder returns short term goals and cycles in both industry and governments such that a significant shift in thinking industry practice governance and community expectation is self evident 3 1 changed practice and policy levers in addressing these issues in a practical sense there is an ongoing need for monitoring of the natural and productive resource base and the human impacts on natural capital within this extended environment maes et al 2015 this requires not only scientific expertise but also wider cooperative efforts from industry policy makers local government and others potschin and haines young 2013 coles 2014 the challenge remains of improving and maintaining soil health food productivity and water quality globally whilst improving agro ecosystem functionality resource use efficiency and promoting the integration of es esf based lulc scenarios this framework requires that catchments and operations associated with agricultural production and water supply systems are assessed on a multifunctional multi criteria basis rather than focus on single use systems i e single use cropping with the integration of key esf elements and best management practices as a focus for revised industry approaches to sustainable production fig 3 incorporating multi functionality represents

1156,ecosystem services es are a powerful tool in assessing the relationships that people have with their surrounding tangible environment and the more distant intangible global benefits ecoservices are often studied in parallel or viewed as linear and this misunderstanding or ignorance of the complex interaction among ecoservices may lead to poor or inappropriate land and water management decisions quantitatively understanding and establishing the risk to the complex functional relationships among es impacted by the introduction of alternate production systems requires a new pathway to better decision making ecoservices are often interrelated in dynamic and complex ways and provide an avenue if appropriately coupled to a more balanced land use land cover lulc multifunctional production system variable land use intensities and landscape configurations impact differentially on selected ecosystem functions and services anthropogenic activities impact this functionality and require an innovative analytical approach to building an integrated multifunctional es analytical framework imesaf an approach that spans diverse fields of inquiry an imesaf would need to incorporate a variety of ecoservices based best practice production systems that can elucidate balanced land use scenarios to deliver better environmental and productivity outcomes in addition this framework requires policy economic sustainability monitoring and evaluation indices to provide guidance on intermediate and long term effects of an ecoservices based production and planning system this paper provides a synthesis of ideas for creating the framework and how it may underpin balanced land use and investment choices keywords water ecosystems sustainability policy ecoservices es imesaf 1 introduction sustainable development implemented in its many guises for more than 25 years is based on the convergence of the three pillars economic development social equity and environmental protection coupled with good governance progress has been made in developing adoption and assessment frameworks with the derivation of sustainable development metrics and improved business and government participation in the sustainability precepts embodied in the sustainable development goals sdgs drexhage and murphy 2010 un 2015 however their widespread adoption remains elusive and implementation continues to be difficult even though existing business models and approaches were declared to be unsustainable at the world economic forum in 2010 waughray 2011 and in numerous documents and public statements since there has been limited notable progress towards changed business practice and governance suggested methodologies have yet to find the political entry points required to make real progress hydrological ecoservices are global multi scalar and fundamental to human and environmental well being underpinning a myriad of interconnected dynamic systems haines young and potschin 2013 costanza et al 2014 young et al 2015 anthropogenic activities and urbanisation have replaced or modified these hydrological ecoservices and their natural processes of cycling and rejuvenation significant portions of the globe are now given over to activities such as agriculture forestry fisheries energy production and mining that interdict or displace ecoservices provided through natural processes un water 2013 ipcc synthesis report 2014 bourke et al 2015 young et al 2015 however these industry activities and sectors remain crucial for strengthening food and water security globally therefore the impact of these production systems must be reduced or modified or communities and the environment will remain vulnerable and potentially at risk alternative options in water and land use are therefore required at local and global scales that are transferable to catchments of any size the productive focus can then shift towards enhancing source water quality and land use optimisation through a transformative process that encourages a move from traditional single use rural landscapes to an ecosystem services es based multi functional landscape creating a framework that encourages innovative and novel pathways to a more holistic and integrated management approach to land use land cover lulc changes that can deliver the sdgs 2 an ecoservices approach a suggested methodology for implementing the sdgs the european union eu ratified the biodiversity action plan bap in 2006 since then its implementation has increased the broader communities understanding of the drivers of biodiversity loss including climate change and how biodiversity is linked with other sectoral activities european commission 2010a implementing the bap objectives highlighted the basic role and fundamental importance of ecosystem dynamics and has strengthened the need for better managed outcomes to facilitate mitigation and adaption to climate change european commission 2010b highlighting the need to deliver sustainability across the all agricultural production urban and industrial sectors clearly a necessity if any of the sdg s are to be delivered multi functionality represents a new challenge for stakeholders operating in these sectors both regulators and operators need to manage natural resources or natural capital to achieve the environmental standards of the relevant eu policies roebeling et al 2014 while also maintaining viable and sustainable integrated dynamic ecoservices this can be measured by the enhancement in the services provided by functional agro ecosystems peri urban urban and environmental systems mea 2005 brauman et al 2007 polasky et al 2015 whilst agricultural systems are often the dominant land use multi functional land use considers integrating alternate nature based land management practices such as pasture transitions to agro forestry seppelt et al 2013 volk 2013 wang et al 2015 and can include nature based solutions for mining and urbanisation the spatial mosaic of variable land use types and intensities are decisive in the provision of water related ecosystem services and will create synergies with other aspects of landscapes e g soil conservation habitat protection the re allocation of critical water resources without understanding these interdependencies often has unintended and irreversible consequences for ecosystem functions and its services understanding these interdependencies is crucial to reducing biodiversity loss and ecosystem functionality esf impairment associated with land use intensification pilaš et al 2011 seppelt et al 2012 mcknight et al 2015 2 1 water the key ingredient the concept of water as part of a natural capital asset that is available to all independent nation states is an important one and it forms part of the global services economy seppelt et al 2012 over the next 25 years an ever increasingly urbanised planet coupled with climate change and population shifts will continue to exert significant pressure on the level and complexity of natural capital allocation and trade offs are required fig 1 trade offs that at the same time must act to minimise ecosystem degradation and deliver sustainable outcomes in multiple sectors and scales coles and hall 2012 given the cross sectoral nature of the inter relationships scale factors and environmental interdependencies a revised valuation commoditisation and governance approach is required fig 2 a failure to recognise the need to operationalise an integrative analytical framework will undermine the capacity of our natural capital and industrial complex to provide for future societal demands with the food health energy and environment the sectors most at risk iges 2015 however achieving food energy and water security is an enormous challenge due to the size and diversity of societal and environmental needs by the same token growing insecurities threaten the safe operating space of human society rockström et al 2009 the prevailing paradigm presents technological approaches to agricultural intensification as the most viable solution to increasing food production despite its severe and negative impacts on the environment daily and de clerck 2014 even while our resource use is not yet meeting the minimum threshold required to obtain just social conditions for humanity including meeting global food and income needs raworth 2012 2 2 alternative strategies until recently ecosystem services es have largely been treated as if they have no value with ecosystems frequently managed for short term gain at the expense of broader longer term societal benefits bourke et al 2015 therefore it makes sense to create a process in which the adoption of an integrated perspective positions water primacy at its core with the focus aimed at a more secure and sustainable future thus by linking the biophysical aspects of ecosystems with human benefits through the notion of es the basis for determining value and the trade offs ecological socio cultural economic and monetary for the loss of ecosystem functionality esf can be established see figs 1 and 2 by establishing es metrics that are both spatially and temporally explicit and at scales meaningful for policy formation or best practice interventions further analysis of action impact can be undertaken prior to implementation fig 2 in addition to innovative technologies a new framework that enables assessment of the interconnectedness of environment and ecoservices industry and economics and social and national interests is required the triple bottom line approach currently used by governments and industry for examining the effectiveness efficiency and economics of decisions has proven to be limited in its understanding of this interconnectedness and therefore invites reinvention coles and hall 2012 a space in which production and water supply systems can be managed as multifunctional multi criteria accredited systems rather than focus on a single use system one that also provides for increased resource use efficiency and promoting the integration of es based lulc with the key elements included such as improving and maintaining soil health food productivity water quality and system functionality fig 2 3 the framework based on the preceding discussion it is obvious that integrated analytical frameworks are required to determine the impact resilience short to long term beneficiaries and losses of various human endeavours improved es based best management practices bmps can provide tangible societal benefits in ways which are both directly financially beneficial through improved quality of life and environmentally sustainable while increasing net productive capacity mea 2005 teeb 2010 shortle and jordan 2014 mcintyre et al 2015 whether this is from subsistence farming or artisan mining or from large scale mining and agricultural developments or increased urbanisation there are significant and often cumulative negative impacts on our global natural capital assets particularly soil and water that are resulting in a variety and scale of often irreversible loss of services linking the biophysical aspects of ecosystems with human benefits through the notion of es esf provides the essential basis to assess and value the trade offs ecological socio cultural economic and monetary involved in the loss of esf whether this be temporary or permanent these approaches by necessity are required to be delivered at local national and global scales however the mechanisms do not currently exist that allow this to occur given the fascination for profitability stakeholder shareholder returns short term goals and cycles in both industry and governments such that a significant shift in thinking industry practice governance and community expectation is self evident 3 1 changed practice and policy levers in addressing these issues in a practical sense there is an ongoing need for monitoring of the natural and productive resource base and the human impacts on natural capital within this extended environment maes et al 2015 this requires not only scientific expertise but also wider cooperative efforts from industry policy makers local government and others potschin and haines young 2013 coles 2014 the challenge remains of improving and maintaining soil health food productivity and water quality globally whilst improving agro ecosystem functionality resource use efficiency and promoting the integration of es esf based lulc scenarios this framework requires that catchments and operations associated with agricultural production and water supply systems are assessed on a multifunctional multi criteria basis rather than focus on single use systems i e single use

1157,wetlands impact on the hydrological cycle material transport and biogeochemical processes and they are indispensable habitats for valuable species in the present study the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model which includes complex interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes was extended to incorporate coordinate transformation from rectangular coordinate to longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale and the higher latitude region by implementing a map factor and a non uniform grid this revised model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia west siberian lowland and hokkaido island in japan to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region the model reproduced qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the flat region of both wetlands and revealed the connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow in the flat region of the wetlands this result also indicates the effectiveness of hypothesis that horizontal transport component is predominant as a first approximation this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region and also would play an important role in the further understanding of biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum in continental scale keywords coordinate transformation higher latitude region eco hydrology model terrestrial aquatic continuum 1 introduction recently some studies have started to reconsider the importance of inland waters including rivers lakes and groundwater so called boundless biogeochemical cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 nakayama 2016 inland waters play a role in transport mineralization and sequestration of carbon a comprehensive analysis has revealed a global co2 evasion degassing rate of 2 1pgc year from inland waters rivers and lakes which is much higher than previous estimates of 1 2pgc year aufdenkampe et al 2011 and 1 4pgc year tranvik et al 2009 and has also predicted global hotspots where 70 per cent of the flux occurs over just 20 per cent of the land surface raymond et al 2013 in particular surface water groundwater interactions around wetlands and riparian areas make the processes complicated water movement drives carbon storage and fluxes further the observed co2 evasion is unreliable due to the presence of peatlands and permafrost in the boreal arctic zone lauerwald et al 2015 this result implies the model needs to capture the effects of extensive peat cover snowmelt and permafrost more accurately there is a great development in grid based eco hydrology models in rectangular coordinate system one of the authors has so far developed a process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 which can simulate iteratively nonlinear interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes it also includes down scaling process from regional simulation to local simulation with finer resolution however the mercator s projection often presents a misleading view of the world map because of the excessive distortion of area in the higher latitude regions vieux 2001 so when we apply this type of model into broader area in such as continental or global scale its application is limited because curvature in earth and distortion through map projection may increase at the corner of projection at polar zone or the higher latitude so the application of this model needs a conversion of governing equations through the implementation of map factor and non uniform grid particularly in horizontal transport components in this study the original nice was extended to include coordinate transformation from original rectangular coordinate system to longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale or in the higher latitude by implementing map factor and non uniform grid there is a hypothesis in case of building this new model as follows horizontal transport component is predominant in regional hydrologic cycle as a first approximation the model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region simulated results of hydrologic cycle were compared between with the original model and after coordinate transformation nice revealed the importance of connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow the effect of its connectivity on micro topographic change through heterogeneous sedimentation their relation to vegetation succession and vice versa as reported in previous studies reeve et al 2000 this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region without the use of complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model this advanced model will be also helpful for the improvement of understanding biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region and boundless biogeochemical cycles along the terrestrial aquatic continuum for global environmental change cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 2 regional overview of west siberian lowland and hokkaido island in japan west siberian lowland wsl contains the world s most extensive peatlands smith et al 2004 in particular boreal and subarctic peatlands in such as wsl store about 15 30 per cent of the world s soil carbon as peat limpens et al 2008 and affect the dynamics of greenhouse gases such as methane wetlands have also important influences on hydrologic cycle provides important role on biogeochemical process and helps preserve valuable species the wsl includes most of the lower ob river basin and is located in permafrost transition fig 1 so the lower ob is frequently inundated during spring and summer whereas the middle and the upper ob are different in hydrological regime and watershed management it is important to evaluate eco hydrological processes there by applying advanced process based model on the other hand hokkaido island is located in northern japanese region kushiro wetland 176 7km2 the largest wetland in japan is located in the eastern part of this island fig 1 and has been forced by conversion to urban or agricultural uses since the end of 19th century the japanese government started a new project the kushiro mire conservation plan to restore the meandering river channel and to reduce the sediment load influx for mire recovery in 2002 ministry of environment 2004 one of the authors has intensively studied this area by applying nice and quantified the impacts of groundwater level change sediment deposition and nutrient availability on the complex alder invasion pattern and vice versa nakayama 2012 2013 nakayama and watanabe 2004 3 material and methods 3 1 process based eco hydrology model the original nice is consisted by complex sub compartments surface hydrology model such as hillslope and stream flows land surface model including urban and crop process groundwater model regional atmospheric model mass transport model in sediment and nutrient and vegetation succession model etc the model applies rectangular coordinate system after albers projection or utm projection nakayama 2014 2015 the model also includes surface groundwater interactions assimilating land surface processes to describe variations of lai leaf area index and fpar fraction of photosynthetically active radiation derived from satellite data 3 2 up scaling of process based nice through coordinate transformation in the case of mercator s projection all the metrics in horizontal plane are equal because angles or shapes are conserved there therefore the map factor m ϕ is calculated in the followings 1 m ϕ sec ϕ where x a θ y a tan ϕ a ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 δ y a sec ϕ δ ϕ where ϕ and θ are the latitude and longitude a is a radius of the earth x and y are the length from the projection origin respectively table 1 is variation of distortion and map factor m ϕ in 5 5 grids calculated in eq 1 and shows the distortion δy and the m ϕ value increase in the higher latitude this means there are variations in the flow path lengths between model elements that are artificially driven by the mercator s projection so the horizontal transport components in nice should be converted to revise actual length the governing equations of nice about surface hydrology based on kinematic wave theory and groundwater flow based on three dimensional partial differential equation are described in rectangular coordinate system in the following eqs 2 and 3 nakayama and watanabe 2004 2 q t c q x c r x t cos θ x b x 3 x k x x h g x y k y y h g y z k z z h g z w s s h g t where q is discharge c is propagation velocity r is effective rainfall intensity b x is flow width θ x is slope angle h g is hydraulic potential head k ii i x y z is hydraulic conductivity w is volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water s s is specific storage respectively eqs 2 and 3 are converted by applying map factor in the following 4 q t c m ϕ q x c r x t cos θ x b x 5 x m ϕ 2 k x x h g x y m ϕ 2 k y y h g y z k z z h g z w s s h g t where θ x tan 1 m ϕ δz l b x b x m ϕ c is the propagation velocity at θ x respectively in this way the revised nice can be applicable to global scale through up scaling by applying non uniform grid and map factor into slope angle topography flow width propagation velocity and hydraulic conductivity 3 3 model input data six hour re analyzed data of downward radiation precipitation atmospheric pressure air

specific storage of porous material and specific yield based on the previous materials national snow and ice data center 2013 3 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama and shankman 2013 in the hillslope

with a resolution of 10km and 0 15 respectively fig 1 the upper land layer was set at 0 2m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200m from the sea surface simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6h for 2000 2001 after 1 year of warm up period until equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated in hydrologic geomorphic and ecological parameters as detailed in the author s previous studies nakayama 2014 2015 4 results 4 1 effect of spatio temporal scales on eco hydrological processes in japanese wetland one of the author s previous study showed that soil moisture and groundwater levels had decreased around the alder invasion in the mire because of river channelization and increased sediment load nakayama 2012 2013 which reveals positive feedbacks between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes the simulated results show complex distribution of hydrologic cycle more clearly in the downstream of kushiro mire on hokkaido island fig 2 which reveals the higher accuracy in the mire after down scaling and considering feedback processes δx 100m this result indicates the close connectivity between surface water and groundwater around river corridors nakayama 2013 the simulation system developed after up scaling δx 1km reproduces qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the mire where the hydrologic cycle is little affected by topography in comparison to the steeper upstream region fig 2 this result reveals that the revised eqs 4 and 5 are applicable on an assumption that horizontal transport components predominate as a first approximation the simulated results of groundwater level were compared between longitude latitude and rectangular coordinate systems in the entire hokkaido island fig 3 though the difference in spatial resolution affects the reproduction of peak value of groundwater level around the mountain area the general characteristics can be reproduced reasonably even in the coarser resolution δx 5km in comparison with the finer resolution δx 1km fig 3c and d though the patterns in surface water co2 in stream networks have been seldom explored teodoru et al 2009 first order streams such as smaller streams that typically appear on mountainous regions contribute to the larger co2 efflux to the atmosphere butman and raymond 2011 this result implies that we have to choose the best resolution depending on the final objective more importance is that the simulated groundwater levels are similar between after the coordinate transformation δx 0 05 and with the original one δx 5km in the same way as river discharge fig 3b and d this result indicates the effectiveness of conversion of governing equations through the implementation of map factor and non uniform grid and the model can be applicable to continental scale 4 2 evaluation of inundated water level in lower ob river in west siberia nice can simulate both groundwater and surface water because it incorporates surface water groundwater interaction in addition to geomorphic changes and vegetation succession processes nakayama 2013 nakayama and shankman 2013 this interaction is complicated in the west siberian lowlands because there are large flat regions expand shallow aquifer with little flow occur and continuous or discontinuous permafrost heterogeneously distributed fig 1 nice includes various sub compartments to simulate this hydrodynamic iteratively because the groundwater level g w l is one of the dominant factors influencing methane emission in wetlands it is important to calibrate the g w l simulated by nice with observed values in the west siberian lowland near tomsk 56 51 18 n 82 50 54 e during 10 may and 18 september 2012 fig 4 the simulated result indicated that the source area of methane emission kim et al 2011 is related to groundwater dynamics because the observed level was reliable only as a relative value we assumed that the absolute level would be 2 0m below the observed value based on our field survey experience the observed value revealed a gradual decrease until the end of july followed by a sudden recovery with an amplitude of about 15 20cm fig 4 when the wetland ch4 flux becomes maximal smith et al 2004 the result derived from the model shows that the level is sensitive to certain parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k h specific storage s s and specific yield s y the model result after the calibration procedure case 2 could reproduce the amplitude minimum value and date of the g w l in the wetland by considering the best value within the ranges documented previously for west siberia and other wetlands carey and woo 1999 borren and bleuten 2006 reeve et al 2006 letts et al 2000 we evaluated the spatial distribution of the g w l in the entire ob river basin the simulated result in a longitude latitude coordinate was compared with that in a rectangular coordinate fig 5a and b the simulated groundwater level with δx 0 15 in fig 5b reproduces reasonably the spatial characteristics of the hydrologic cycle with δx 10km in fig 5a although there are some discrepancies in the upstream of the ob river and the downstream of the yenisei river due to differences in water head as boundary conditions this simulated result agrees well with previous studies employing more simplified models niu et al 2007 fan et al 2013 the g w l reveals shallower in the southern wsl where methane emission is greater which indicates that the groundwater level is the dominant factor affecting methane emission in the wetland smith et al 2004 fig 5d shows inundated flow in the lower ob river in july 1998 spring snowmelt season simulated by nice the model simulated higher inundation in the downstream of ob river during snowmelt runoff and reproduced reasonably inundated water level estimated by multisatellite approaches frappart et al 2010 in fig 5c this result revealed connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow and improved the mechanism of nonlinear interaction around low altitude region described reeve et al 2000 it is necessary to clarify the effect of different latitude on hydrologic change in the future because the distortion and the map factor increase in the higher latitude 5 discussion the revised nice sheds light on the extension of the traditional grid based models in rectangular coordinate nakayama 2011 2015 nakayama and shankman 2013 nakayama and watanabe 2008 applicable to the higher latitude or continental scale while the model improved the accuracy of hydrologic cycle after inclusion of down scaling and feedback processes nakayama 2013 the up scaling is also effective to grasp the general eco hydrologic characteristics in the mire flat region fig 2 the eco hydrologic process after the up scaling is not so restricted than that after the down scaling except the flat region where backwater effect is predominant nakayama and watanabe 2004 because there is usually scale dependent similarity with complex ecosystem metabolism brown et al 2004 it is further necessary to develop multi scaled hierarchy model to bridge the gap between ecosystems at various scales deegan et al 2012 though hydrologic cycle simulated by the revised nice agreed reasonably with that in the original one figs 3 and 5 there were slightly some discrepancies in high altitude regions the simulated result reveals that the hypothesis described in section 1 is satisfied and that the revised eqs 4 and 5 are applicable in the higher latitude region as a first approximation while it is possible to completely modify the entire governing equations of nice to complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model it will require considerable labor and be anticipated that there is not so much difference in the simulated results because the horizontal component is generally much larger than the vertical one it is also necessary to quantify the effect of coordinate transformation on hydrologic change in different latitude and elevation gradient because we need to revise the governing equations as the distortion and the map factor increase in the higher latitude and steep gradient regions table 1 through better understanding of the complex coupling of the hydrologic carbon cycle in the higher latitude region the uncertainty associated with the bottom up approach will be reduced and incorporation of terrestrial aquatic linkages will be facilitated jenerette and lal 2005 in particular extreme climatic events such as droughts or floods fig 5d nakayama 2011 nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013 also have the potential to affect the carbon cycle concurrently and can initiate delayed or long lasting responses on both the regional and global scales reichstein et al 2013 the accuracy of hydrologic cycle in extreme is also related to the sensitivity of parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k h specific storage s s and specific yield s y as shown in fig 4 it is urgently necessary to quantify the dynamics of hydrologic carbon interaction beyond the steady state or equilibrium niu et al 2007 fan et al 2013 furthermore the water cycle has been changed in various regions by anthropogenic activities irrigation domestic and industrial water use and construction of water reservoirs weirs and desalination plants gleick and palaniappan 2010 and these should be incorporated into the model to improve accuracy the impact of hydrologic cycle on changes in biogeochemical cycle bauer et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 differs from that caused by direct human modification and anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle burning of fossil fuels industrial emissions and emissions caused by change in land use raupach 2011 there are many needs for the application of the new simulation system through coordinate transformation to the broader area or the higher latitude region because it does not use complicated spherical coordinate system and is easy to extend the traditional rectangular coordinate system this might also help to improve the understanding of biogeochemical cycle in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum for global environmental change 6 conclusion in this study nice was extended to include coordinate transformation applicable to the higher latitude region or continental scale by implementing a map factor and a non uniform grid the revised model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region the simulation system after coordinate transformation reproduced qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the flat region of both wetlands the revised model also revealed the connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow in the flat region of the wetlands this result indicates the effectiveness of hypothesis that horizontal transport component is predominant as a first approximation this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region without the use of complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model this result also would play an important role in the improvement in understanding of biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum in continental scale conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research

1157,wetlands impact on the hydrological cycle material transport and biogeochemical processes and they are indispensable habitats for valuable species in the present study the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model which includes complex interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes was extended to incorporate coordinate transformation from rectangular coordinate to longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale and the higher latitude region by implementing a map factor and a non uniform grid this revised model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia west siberian lowland and hokkaido island in japan to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region the model reproduced qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the flat region of both wetlands and revealed the connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow in the flat region of the wetlands this result also indicates the effectiveness of hypothesis that horizontal transport component is predominant as a first approximation this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region and also would play an important role in the further understanding of biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum in continental scale keywords coordinate transformation higher latitude region eco hydrology model terrestrial aquatic continuum 1 introduction recently some studies have started to reconsider the importance of inland waters including rivers lakes and groundwater so called boundless biogeochemical cycle cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 nakayama 2016 inland waters play a role in transport mineralization and sequestration of carbon a comprehensive analysis has revealed a global co2 evasion degassing rate of 2 1pgc year from inland waters rivers and lakes which is much higher than previous estimates of 1 2pgc year aufdenkampe et al 2011 and 1 4pgc year tranvik et al 2009 and has also predicted global hotspots where 70 per cent of the flux occurs over just 20 per cent of the land surface raymond et al 2013 in particular surface water groundwater interactions around wetlands and riparian areas make the processes complicated water movement drives carbon storage and fluxes further the observed co2 evasion is unreliable due to the presence of peatlands and permafrost in the boreal arctic zone lauerwald et al 2015 this result implies the model needs to capture the effects of extensive peat cover snowmelt and permafrost more accurately there is a great development in grid based eco hydrology models in rectangular coordinate system one of the authors has so far developed a process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 which can simulate iteratively nonlinear interactions between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes it also includes down scaling process from regional simulation to local simulation with finer resolution however the mercator s projection often presents a misleading view of the world map because of the excessive distortion of area in the higher latitude regions vieux 2001 so when we apply this type of model into broader area in such as continental or global scale its application is limited because curvature in earth and distortion through map projection may increase at the corner of projection at polar zone or the higher latitude so the application of this model needs a conversion of governing equations through the implementation of map factor and non uniform grid particularly in horizontal transport components in this study the original nice was extended to include coordinate transformation from original rectangular coordinate system to longitude latitude coordinate system applicable to continental scale or in the higher latitude by implementing map factor and non uniform grid there is a hypothesis in case of building this new model as follows horizontal transport component is predominant in regional hydrologic cycle as a first approximation the model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region simulated results of hydrologic cycle were compared between with the original model and after coordinate transformation nice revealed the importance of connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow the effect of its connectivity on micro topographic change through heterogeneous sedimentation their relation to vegetation succession and vice versa as reported in previous studies reeve et al 2000 this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region without the use of complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model this advanced model will be also helpful for the improvement of understanding biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region and boundless biogeochemical cycles along the terrestrial aquatic continuum for global environmental change cole et al 2007 battin et al 2009 2 regional overview of west siberian lowland and hokkaido island in japan west siberian lowland wsl contains the world s most extensive peatlands smith et al 2004 in particular boreal and subarctic peatlands in such as wsl store about 15 30 per cent of the world s soil carbon as peat limpens et al 2008 and affect the dynamics of greenhouse gases such as methane wetlands have also important influences on hydrologic cycle provides important role on biogeochemical process and helps preserve valuable species the wsl includes most of the lower ob river basin and is located in permafrost transition fig 1 so the lower ob is frequently inundated during spring and summer whereas the middle and the upper ob are different in hydrological regime and watershed management it is important to evaluate eco hydrological processes there by applying advanced process based model on the other hand hokkaido island is located in northern japanese region kushiro wetland 176 7km2 the largest wetland in japan is located in the eastern part of this island fig 1 and has been forced by conversion to urban or agricultural uses since the end of 19th century the japanese government started a new project the kushiro mire conservation plan to restore the meandering river channel and to reduce the sediment load influx for mire recovery in 2002 ministry of environment 2004 one of the authors has intensively studied this area by applying nice and quantified the impacts of groundwater level change sediment deposition and nutrient availability on the complex alder invasion pattern and vice versa nakayama 2012 2013 nakayama and watanabe 2004 3 material and methods 3 1 process based eco hydrology model the original nice is consisted by complex sub compartments surface hydrology model such as hillslope and stream flows land surface model including urban and crop process groundwater model regional atmospheric model mass transport model in sediment and nutrient and vegetation succession model etc the model applies rectangular coordinate system after albers projection or utm projection nakayama 2014 2015 the model also includes surface groundwater interactions assimilating land surface processes to describe variations of lai leaf area index and fpar fraction of photosynthetically active radiation derived from satellite data 3 2 up scaling of process based nice through coordinate transformation in the case of mercator s projection all the metrics in horizontal plane are equal because angles or shapes are conserved there therefore the map factor m ϕ is calculated in the followings 1 m ϕ sec ϕ where x a θ y a tan ϕ a ln tan π 4 ϕ 2 δ y a sec ϕ δ ϕ where ϕ and θ are the latitude and longitude a is a radius of the earth x and y are the length from the projection origin respectively table 1 is variation of distortion and map factor m ϕ in 5 5 grids calculated in eq 1 and shows the distortion δy and the m ϕ value increase in the higher latitude this means there are variations in the flow path lengths between model elements that are artificially driven by the mercator s projection so the horizontal transport components in nice should be converted to revise actual length the governing equations of nice about surface hydrology based on kinematic wave theory and groundwater flow based on three dimensional partial differential equation are described in rectangular coordinate system in the following eqs 2 and 3 nakayama and watanabe 2004 2 q t c q x c r x t cos θ x b x 3 x k x x h g x y k y y h g y z k z z h g z w s s h g t where q is discharge c is propagation velocity r is effective rainfall intensity b x is flow width θ x is slope angle h g is hydraulic potential head k ii i x y z is hydraulic conductivity w is volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water s s is specific storage respectively eqs 2 and 3 are converted by applying map factor in the following 4 q t c m ϕ q x c r x t cos θ x b x 5 x m ϕ 2 k x x h g x y m ϕ 2 k y y h g y z k z z h g z w s s h g t where θ x tan 1 m ϕ δz l b x b x m ϕ c is the propagation velocity at θ x respectively in this way the revised nice can be applicable to global scale through up scaling by applying non uniform grid and map factor into slope angle topography flow width propagation velocity and hydraulic conductivity 3 3 model input data six hour re analyzed data of downward radiation precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature air humidity wind speed fpar fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and lai leaf area index were input to the model after interpolation of era interium ecmwf 2013 in inverse proportion to the distance back calculated in each grid observed meteorological data of bmds baseline meteorological data in siberia created by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology 2011 in west siberia and amedas automated meteorological data acquisition system collected by the japan meteorological agency 2000 2001 in northern japan were also used to correct era precipitation because the ecmwf precipitation usually had the least reliability and underestimated observed peak values nakayama 2011 nakayama and shankman 2013 mean elevation was calculated by using a global digital elevation model dem gtopo30 u s geological survey 1996a in west siberia wetland 161 stream channels were selected out from river network data hydro1k u s geological survey 1996b by evaluating pfafstetter level and strahler stream order and previous materials in the following mean river width for lower ob 2km biancamaria et al 2009 main ob s channel 3km kouraev et al 2004 land cover was categorized on the basis of global land cover 2000 european commission 2013 the model used reliable parameters as much as possible from valuable information such as peat type peat depth and geology etc in west siberian lowland peatland gis database national snow and ice data center 2013 the geological structures were also divided into four types on the basis of hydraulic conductivity the specific storage of porous material and specific yield based on the previous materials national snow and ice data center 2013 3 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 nakayama and shankman 2013 in the hillslope hydrology flow depth and discharge on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads at sea boundary constant head was set at 0m the simulation areas were 500km wide by 460km long in the albers wgs 1984 coordinates and 6 5 wide by 4 5 long in longitude latitude coordinates these areas were discretized with a grid spacing of 1 5km and 0 05 in the horizontal direction and into 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layers finer at the upper layers in the vertical direction in northern japanese region hokkaido island fig 1 in the west siberia wetland the simulation was conducted about 2100km wide by 3000km long with a resolution of 10km and 0 15 respectively fig 1 the upper land layer was set at 0 2m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200m from the sea surface simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6h for 2000 2001 after 1 year of warm up period until equilibrium the simulated results were respectively calibrated and validated in hydrologic geomorphic and ecological parameters as detailed in the author s previous studies nakayama 2014 2015 4 results 4 1 effect of spatio temporal scales on eco hydrological processes in japanese wetland one of the author s previous study showed that soil moisture and groundwater levels had decreased around the alder invasion in the mire because of river channelization and increased sediment load nakayama 2012 2013 which reveals positive feedbacks between hydrologic geomorphic and ecological processes the simulated results show complex distribution of hydrologic cycle more clearly in the downstream of kushiro mire on hokkaido island fig 2 which reveals the higher accuracy in the mire after down scaling and considering feedback processes δx 100m this result indicates the close connectivity between surface water and groundwater around river corridors nakayama 2013 the simulation system developed after up scaling δx 1km reproduces qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the mire where the hydrologic cycle is little affected by topography in comparison to the steeper upstream region fig 2 this result reveals that the revised eqs 4 and 5 are applicable on an assumption that horizontal transport components predominate as a first approximation the simulated results of groundwater level were compared between longitude latitude and rectangular coordinate systems in the entire hokkaido island fig 3 though the difference in spatial resolution affects the reproduction of peak value of groundwater level around the mountain area the general characteristics can be reproduced reasonably even in the coarser resolution δx 5km in comparison with the finer resolution δx 1km fig 3c and d though the patterns in surface water co2 in stream networks have been seldom explored teodoru et al 2009 first order streams such as smaller streams that typically appear on mountainous regions contribute to the larger co2 efflux to the atmosphere butman and raymond 2011 this result implies that we have to choose the best resolution depending on the final objective more importance is that the simulated groundwater levels are similar between after the coordinate transformation δx 0 05 and with the original one δx 5km in the same way as river discharge fig 3b and d this result indicates the effectiveness of conversion of governing equations through the implementation of map factor and non uniform grid and the model can be applicable to continental scale 4 2 evaluation of inundated water level in lower ob river in west siberia nice can simulate both groundwater and surface water because it incorporates surface water groundwater interaction in addition to geomorphic changes and vegetation succession processes nakayama 2013 nakayama and shankman 2013 this interaction is complicated in the west siberian lowlands because there are large flat regions expand shallow aquifer with little flow occur and continuous or discontinuous permafrost heterogeneously distributed fig 1 nice includes various sub compartments to simulate this hydrodynamic iteratively because the groundwater level g w l is one of the dominant factors influencing methane emission in wetlands it is important to calibrate the g w l simulated by nice with observed values in the west siberian lowland near tomsk 56 51 18 n 82 50 54 e during 10 may and 18 september 2012 fig 4 the simulated result indicated that the source area of methane emission kim et al 2011 is related to groundwater dynamics because the observed level was reliable only as a relative value we assumed that the absolute level would be 2 0m below the observed value based on our field survey experience the observed value revealed a gradual decrease until the end of july followed by a sudden recovery with an amplitude of about 15 20cm fig 4 when the wetland ch4 flux becomes maximal smith et al 2004 the result derived from the model shows that the level is sensitive to certain parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k h specific storage s s and specific yield s y the model result after the calibration procedure case 2 could reproduce the amplitude minimum value and date of the g w l in the wetland by considering the best value within the ranges documented previously for west siberia and other wetlands carey and woo 1999 borren and bleuten 2006 reeve et al 2006 letts et al 2000 we evaluated the spatial distribution of the g w l in the entire ob river basin the simulated result in a longitude latitude coordinate was compared with that in a rectangular coordinate fig 5a and b the simulated groundwater level with δx 0 15 in fig 5b reproduces reasonably the spatial characteristics of the hydrologic cycle with δx 10km in fig 5a although there are some discrepancies in the upstream of the ob river and the downstream of the yenisei river due to differences in water head as boundary conditions this simulated result agrees well with previous studies employing more simplified models niu et al 2007 fan et al 2013 the g w l reveals shallower in the southern wsl where methane emission is greater which indicates that the groundwater level is the dominant factor affecting methane emission in the wetland smith et al 2004 fig 5d shows inundated flow in the lower ob river in july 1998 spring snowmelt season simulated by nice the model simulated higher inundation in the downstream of ob river during snowmelt runoff and reproduced reasonably inundated water level estimated by multisatellite approaches frappart et al 2010 in fig 5c this result revealed connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow and improved the mechanism of nonlinear interaction around low altitude region described reeve et al 2000 it is necessary to clarify the effect of different latitude on hydrologic change in the future because the distortion and the map factor increase in the higher latitude 5 discussion the revised nice sheds light on the extension of the traditional grid based models in rectangular coordinate nakayama 2011 2015 nakayama and shankman 2013 nakayama and watanabe 2008 applicable to the higher latitude or continental scale while the model improved the accuracy of hydrologic cycle after inclusion of down scaling and feedback processes nakayama 2013 the up scaling is also effective to grasp the general eco hydrologic characteristics in the mire flat region fig 2 the eco hydrologic process after the up scaling is not so restricted than that after the down scaling except the flat region where backwater effect is predominant nakayama and watanabe 2004 because there is usually scale dependent similarity with complex ecosystem metabolism brown et al 2004 it is further necessary to develop multi scaled hierarchy model to bridge the gap between ecosystems at various scales deegan et al 2012 though hydrologic cycle simulated by the revised nice agreed reasonably with that in the original one figs 3 and 5 there were slightly some discrepancies in high altitude regions the simulated result reveals that the hypothesis described in section 1 is satisfied and that the revised eqs 4 and 5 are applicable in the higher latitude region as a first approximation while it is possible to completely modify the entire governing equations of nice to complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model it will require considerable labor and be anticipated that there is not so much difference in the simulated results because the horizontal component is generally much larger than the vertical one it is also necessary to quantify the effect of coordinate transformation on hydrologic change in different latitude and elevation gradient because we need to revise the governing equations as the distortion and the map factor increase in the higher latitude and steep gradient regions table 1 through better understanding of the complex coupling of the hydrologic carbon cycle in the higher latitude region the uncertainty associated with the bottom up approach will be reduced and incorporation of terrestrial aquatic linkages will be facilitated jenerette and lal 2005 in particular extreme climatic events such as droughts or floods fig 5d nakayama 2011 nakayama and watanabe 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013 also have the potential to affect the carbon cycle concurrently and can initiate delayed or long lasting responses on both the regional and global scales reichstein et al 2013 the accuracy of hydrologic cycle in extreme is also related to the sensitivity of parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k h specific storage s s and specific yield s y as shown in fig 4 it is urgently necessary to quantify the dynamics of hydrologic carbon interaction beyond the steady state or equilibrium niu et al 2007 fan et al 2013 furthermore the water cycle has been changed in various regions by anthropogenic activities irrigation domestic and industrial water use and construction of water reservoirs weirs and desalination plants gleick and palaniappan 2010 and these should be incorporated into the model to improve accuracy the impact of hydrologic cycle on changes in biogeochemical cycle bauer et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 differs from that caused by direct human modification and anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle burning of fossil fuels industrial emissions and emissions caused by change in land use raupach 2011 there are many needs for the application of the new simulation system through coordinate transformation to the broader area or the higher latitude region because it does not use complicated spherical coordinate system and is easy to extend the traditional rectangular coordinate system this might also help to improve the understanding of biogeochemical cycle in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum for global environmental change 6 conclusion in this study nice was extended to include coordinate transformation applicable to the higher latitude region or continental scale by implementing a map factor and a non uniform grid the revised model was applied to two different wetlands of northern eurasia to evaluate eco hydrological processes in the higher latitude region the simulation system after coordinate transformation reproduced qualitatively the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater level in the flat region of both wetlands the revised model also revealed the connectivity between groundwater and inundated flow in the flat region of the wetlands this result indicates the effectiveness of hypothesis that horizontal transport component is predominant as a first approximation this new simulation system would be effective as one of the methods to expand a grid based model to a broader area or the higher latitude region without the use of complicated spherical coordinate system of global climate model this result also would play an important role in the improvement in understanding of biogeochemical activity in the higher latitude region along terrestrial aquatic continuum in continental scale conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research

davies et al 2016 in this context ecological restoration which is the process of assisting the recovery of a degraded or damaged ecosystem bradshaw 1987 ser 2004 helps in combating such aggravated environmental conditions and in imparting resilience to an area of concern conservation of biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of es that it provides are now increasingly becoming the focus of ecosystem based natural resource management badola et al 2010 everard 2016 recorded findings from rapid ecological assessments of rejuvenated sub catchments exploring non marketed aspects of restored aquatic taxa as a contribution to societal rejuvenation systemic assessment and recognition of multiple ecosystem service value systems in decision making is essential for inspiring community based socio environmentally regenerative management davies et al 2016 effects of different restoration approaches on recovery of es are poorly studied despite wide recognition of the links between biodiversity functional traits and ecosystem services de bello et al 2010 society of ecological restoration international ser 2004 has put forth a list of 9 ecosystem attributes as a guideline for measuring restoration success but financial time and manpower restrictions reduce its feasibility to utmost 3 major attributes diversity vegetation structure and ecological processes ruiz jaen and aide 2005 considerable effort has been put into evaluation of tropical forest resources yet discrepancies remain mayaux et al 2005 raha et al 2014 forest assessment data provide no insights into the recovery of forest biodiversity or es lost because of forest conversion or degradation merely these figures reflect the widespread establishment of plantations chazdon 2008 stronger collaborative efforts are required to collect data and monitor trends to raise awareness and monitor progress towards sustainable forest management luque et al 2017 mondal and southworth 2010 necessitated more small scale case tudies to understand the effect of different management strategies on forest over transitions and long term monitoring of dry tropical ecosystems in india there have been a number of localized successes in regeneration of ecosystems everard 2015 2016 yet most of them covered narrow aspects over the last decade west bengal has pioneered involvement of tribal communities of midnapore and purulia districts in protecting local forests to encourage natural regeneration mishra roy 2002 singh 2008 midnapore west being primarily lateritic faces the immediate challenge of decreasing productivity and water scarcity due to land degradation pradhan et al 2012 here is when geospatial technologies come handy to monitor landscape level alterations the district witnesses scarce assessments through remote sensing viz sudhakar et al 1992 chowdhury et al 2009 shit and maiti 2012 raha et al 2014 and ghosh 2015 although midnapore west district possesses 24 24 of its geographical area under forest cover raha et al 2014 and forest departments have apparently shifted from profit based to sustainability based management the selected landscape at gurguripal is unique in blending forest and wetland patches within a watershed our preference towards this case study also underpins the fact that it stands upon repeated initiatives of conservation by government in collaboration with people s participation on a previously denuded undulating lateritic landscape facing severe erosion in the past there has been no documentation of its ecological structure and integrative functions so far in this context the main objectives of the paper revolve around following themes i to throw light on the history of watershed management primearely water conservation strategies undertaken in the 1990s through modification of gullies construction of multiple earthen bundhs etc for sustainable management of the said environment to characterize the wetlands formed within the forest with respect to the quality and extent of water indicator for surface water provisioning service ii to establish the multi decadal recovery assessment of the ecodegraded landscape at gurguripal forest with the help of remote sensing and geographic information system rs gis technology at regional and local scales 1990 2005 for quantifying land use land cover lulc changes as well as forest cover vegetation changes as proxies for soil moisture enhancement supported with ground truth information on phytosociology stand structure as an indicator of biomass and realted ecosystem services iii to prepare an inventory of the floral and faunal components major terrestrial and aquatic taxa to indicate the biodiversity potential of the site during 2006 2015 this is also proxy for habitat maintenance iv to assess physicochemical parameters of forest soil with respect to nutrient carbon moisture etc as indicators of ecological processes for defining the present condition as compared to a degraded land v to portray socio ecological impact of the forest on humans indicating material or nutrition provisioning and related cultural es 2 materials and methods the entire scope of work with its temporal and spatial civerage is presented in table 1 2 1 study area 2 1 1 physiography gurguripal forest located within a rural belt of midnapore west district synonymous paschim medinipur west bengal india coordinates 22 25 8 n 22 29 n 87 11 7 e 87 16 2 e lying on a downstream portion of river kangsabati kansai figs 1 and 2 comprises of fairly undulating topography at approximately 65msl elevation possessing combined soil pattern alluvial soil in the eastern and lateritic upland in the western portion of the district much of this area is waterlogged especially the tract bounded by the kansai river on the south and the silai river on the north the selected forest wetland covering an area of 5 10km2 falls under micro watershed category nrsc 2014 and may be tagged as secondary forest since it was established through re growth on abandoned land with plantations mayaux et al 2005 the climate of the zone is sub humid and tropical monsoon type oppressive heat 47 c and high relative humidity during summers heavy annual rainfall average 1600mm during monsoons and chilly winters lowest 8 c are the important climatic facets dhdr 2011 as such vegetation of this area is basically dry evergreen and sparsely deciduous forest geographically the selected forest is the south easternmost extension of a larger continuous range of forest in the district known as khasjangal trailokyapur fig 1 2 1 2 forest wetland characterization generally a forest study gives an impression of tree community structure but in our study we wished to include the study of wetlands exclusively originating due to forest functions and the special management for soil and water conservation in the past hence by stating characterization of forest wetland complex table 1 we meant to present the striking features of the complementary systems together post rejuvenation viz morphometry location water retention physicochemical attributes biotic components and human dependence out of many wetlands of variable size and mostly ephemeral present within the micro watershed zone of gurguripal three perennial water bodies confined behind constructed earthen dams with adjoining channels were monitored regularly during 2012 2015 table 5 fig 2 other primary information especially prior conservation plans in the forest and current activities were collected from forest offices appendix e 2 2 geospatial analysis ground truth verification was performed using gps device garmin taking certain ground control points gcps arcgis 9 software aided for preparation of location maps showing the study area fig 1 actual pattern of land use land cover was mapped upon ground truth verification of gurguripal forest and surrounding areas in association with google earth during 2015 fig 2 study of long term changes in vegetation cover and trends in forest profile over last few decades at gurguripal forest integrated analyses of free imageries from satellites using temporal series of digital data accessed from landsat 30m resolution of the years 1990 and 2014 2015 respectively the details of data sources are listed in table 2 available cloud free map data was utilized for its suitability for vegetation studies gps locations were superimposed on the google map image in order to find out the detailed geomorphologic configuration of the area and to demarcate the area of interest aoi the raw images were atmospherically and geometrically corrected then processed using erdas imagine 10 software to obtain lulc maps whose accuracy was estimated using eighty sample points collected through a gps during field survey it reveals that percentages of overall classification accuracy 0 86 as well as kappa statistics 0 84 were in acceptable range which proves a good agreement between satellite derived and ground based lulc information k p o p e 1 p e where kappa statistics k is estimated by the actual p o and predicted p e values the supervised classification into 8 standard classes output at 1 25 000 scale followed maximum likelihood method figs 3 4 and 5 the quantities of each class were compared in each category at landscape scale over a span of 25 years afterwards two individual ndvi maps 1991 and 2015 based on multi temporal imagery were prepared and assessed to detect areas of forest cover change at regional scale 1 50 000 and modified with isodata iterative self organizing data analysis technique algorithm following protocols of chakraborty et al 2014 and davies et al 2016 technical expertise in performing these analyses was sought from the remote sensing department of vidyasagar university duly acknowledged 2 3 recording of abiotic features recording quality of freshwater was a part of the wetland characterization and is known to govern the living constituents of aquatic system the physicochemical parameters of surface water collected seasonally from the selected wetlands assessed with the aid of water quality checker towa 22 a japan in field and titrimetric method in laboratory following apha 2005 viz temperature ph electrical conductivity turbidity total dissolved solids tds chlorinity dissolved oxygen do and biological oxygen demand bod5 during 2006 2012 6 years data were retrieved from the author s previous work mallick and chakraborty 2014 2015 since the soil milieu influences variety of flora or fauna inhabiting it and vice versa the study of soil parameters holds significance from both biodiversity and es point of view nutrient cycling is usually measured indirectly by estimating nutrient availability ruiz jaen and aide 2005 robinson and lundholm 2012 utilized organic carbon content of the soil as an indicator of carbon storage soil quality had no previous records from the specific forested land site hence was compared to samples from a degraded site in the region a preliminary assessment of samples collected from few plots depth 0 20cm during 2015 could be done after a soil sample was air dried for 48h in hot air oven ground and sieved through 1mm mesh and preserved to measure ph and electrical conductivity ec the soil was mixed with deionised water in 1 2 ratio w v a glass electrode ph metre and ec metre was used respectively organic carbon oc of soil tested by modified walkley black procedure available nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k and water holding capacity whc were analyzed mechanically or titrimetrically following methods given by kalra and maynard 1991 and anonymous 2011 professional help on additional tests was sought from scientific agencies duly acknowledged 2 4 biodiversity documentation the detailed study of aquatic organisms concentrated on zooplankton phytoplankton and macrophytes macrophytes were recorded from the wetlands to compare their diversity and surface coverage over 2006 2012 and identified consulting pradhan et al 2005 and fassett 2006 zooplankton and phytoplankton samples were collected in two phases over 6 years 2006 2012 and 2011 2012 using nylobolt plankton nets 65μm and 25μm mesh size respectively 100 l of water volume was filtered from each sampling site and preserved in 5 buffered formaldehyde taxonomic and quantitative study of phytoplankton and zooplankton were done under phase contrast microscope model no zeiss 1000 1098 following desikachary 1959 and standard references mallick and chakraborty 2015 respectively fishes were recorded with the help of local fishermen as well as personal observation diversity of other common aquatic animals table 1 such as molluscs arthropods amphibians etc was listed by regular observations in the recent decade and identified with the help of literature online biodiversity portal fauna of west bengal 1992 additional guidelines for faunal assessment were taken from everard 2016 one of the reasons to select detailed plankton study as compared to remaining faunal components for a longer tenure was their residential nature ease of capturing and power of bioindication mallick and chakraborty 2015 study of terrestrial plant diversity including information on local names as available and categories trees shrubs and herbs surveyed visually since 2006 covered fringe areas surrounding the gurguripal forest photographs were taken and key plant parts were collected to prepare herbaria and preserved at the botany department in the university as voucher specimen for proper identification as acknowledged with regard to terrestrial fauna of the study area soil arthropods were extracted using pitfall trap or modified tullgren extractor rakshit and chanda 2017 other invertebrate and vertebrate diversity were counted through general observation bird census and active search techniques kutt 1997 hill 2005 and oral history but without using any kind of trap and identified through standard literature ali 1996 fauna of west bengal 1992 2 5 phytosociological studies first challenges in quantifying forest es involve having relatively comprehensive data on stand structure and composition these data are indeed essential to provide information for es indicators that may be relevant for producing maps to support management and planning luque et al 2017 a stand is an area of forest or woodland with a relatively uniform structure that can be managed as a single unit mcelhinny 2002 analyses on forest vegetation table 1 adopted methodologies of misra 1968 nautiyal and kaechele 2008 and bhakat and kundu 2011 all remaining investigations along with quantification of trees split to young and mature plant classes using quadrats were performed inside the study area eco park tree heights measured using both abney s level and hypsometer were expressed in feets ft stand density expressed as trees per acre tpa or stems ha 1 sph to compare diameter at breast height dbh in inches in canopy density was measured using canopy densiometer at selected stands in percentage the vegetation data were also processed for frequency f relative abundance ra pielou s evenness richness index according to curtis and mcintosh 1950 and shannon wiener species diversity index h population structure of tree species was studied by determining the number of individuals in different diameter classes starting from 1 5cm to 50 55cm appendix d 2 6 socio cultural study this aspect of gurguripal was assessed with the help of interviews in the form of semi structured conversations relating the history composition management consequences and extent of forest resources used by inhabitants community involvement in water management uses of plants following mallick et al 2014 etc opportunistically by personal communication endorsed by discussions with local people during surveys interviews and cross references were conducted using participatory rural appraisal pra technique chambers 1994 human usage indices were calculated by assigning each qualitative value a score viz low 1 medium 2 high 3 then a total score summed for all activities was obtained for each time frame modified from mehta et al 2008 for enumerating the different categories of es on the basis of people s perceptions in combination with the summarized results from contrasting habitat types a similar 4 point scale was employed indicator variables showing no little medium or high changes are jotted on the 0 3 scale proportionately finally summing up for each millenium ecosystem assessment ma category 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological history of gurguripal forest being a dry and laterite zone most of the land area at gurguripal khasjangal was unproductive and agriculture was mainly rain fed in the historical times in some cases people used to do seasonal agriculture by encroaching forest land most of the villagers used to compensate for their livelihood by way of illegal boulder mining and tree falling moreover the villagers primarily women had to walk miles to fetch water from the adjoining kansai river mainly for drinking as such hot season worsened the situation initially the gurguripal area developed abundant shorea robusta sal forests along with its usual associates table 6 due to indiscriminate felling the area became gradually denuded and soil erosion progressed at an ever increasing pace the area was first planted up during 1965 1966 by the east medinipur forest division later on panchet soil conservation division purulia took up this area for afforestation again in 1979 1980 and successfully covered up the area but every time indiscriminate deforestation by the local people to make their livelihood rendered the area devoid of trees and severe soil erosion set in converting the site into a degraded one such a scenario prevailing at the state level has been elaborated by raha et al 2014 under such circumstances rupnarayan forest division took up the job of convincing the local people about the hazards of soil erosion and importance of afforestation and soil moisture conservation in socio economic upliftment of the people of the region the forests under each division are managed with active cooperation of the forest protection committees target was fixed for providing additional source of income to these poor people vis à vis creating a green cover on this vast stretch of land with the intervention of mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mnrega anonymous 1996 thus an area of 455ha of land was taken up for afforestation work during 1990 apart from plantations considerable structural works viz earthen dams check dams gully plugs etc had been executed sufficient numbers of earthen dams 35 reported were constructed for efficient ground water recharging as well as to arrest silt and gullies were modified to reduce horizontal seepage and increase vertical percolation of water so that ground water recharging could be elevated as a reflection of surface water table the area began to be protected with the help of the local villagers and developed as a picnic spot and nature resort on account of the excellent ground water recharging and pumping of water from the wells quite a good extent of land which was lying unutilized in the past was brought under multiple crop cultivation availability of drinking water facilitated the inhabitants as a relief in a nutshell such initiative brought about an overall positive impact in the mentioned area the forest has been further declared as an ecotourism park in january 2007 with erection of a watch tower and picnic and boating facilities for visitors 3 2 abiotic monitoring prevailing environmental conditions are essential for studying ecosystem processes forest cover is known to raise the precipitation events at global scale brogna et al 2017 pérez hoyos et al 2016 confirm a strong coupling between rainfall water table depth vegetation and soil 3 2 1 water quality overall data on physicochemical parameters hint for a clean aquatic system apha 2005 table 3 indicates widest ranges for turbidity and lowest fluctuation for bod the altered turbidity and tds may be attributed to the inflow of silt from the surroundings into the wetlands especially during monsoons making it murkier and the converse making it clearer during winters the range of ph recorded was 5 75 8 31 implying slightly acidic to slightly alkaline nature of the surface waters also the do 2 20 6 52 was suitable for survival of many aquatic organisms mallick and chakraborty 2015 variations in the physicochemical parameters of the water through different seasons and years showed no distinct trend probably implicating a dynamic forest environment over time 3 2 2 soil quality lateritic soils are characterized by acidic ph low npk and high iron content raychaudhuri 1980 according to older data by chakravarti and chakravarti 1957 erosion in undulating laterite soils of midnapore varied from slight to very high soils were acidic with ph 5 5 6 5 poor organic matter and available phosphate experimental soil sample was slightly acidic with an average ph 5 68 table 4 as the usual trait of laterite but was less acidic than that assessed by duan et al 2010 and more than that of degraded land and rakshit and chanda 2017 ec of 0 04ds cm shows that the study area is low in salinity which was again much lesser than that of a neighbouring degraded land and wasteland rakshit and chanda 2017 although the mean nutrient content values of the forest soil n 132 83 p 7 23 k 108 8kg ha oc of 0 74 seemed enhanced from degraded soil table 4 in line with findings of singh et al 2012 they still were low as per indian agricultural research institute i a r i standards anonymous 2011 yet fulfilled the general niches of sal forests gautam and devoe 2005 chattoraj 2016 there is significant potential for increasing oc through restoration of degraded soils and widespread adoption of soil conservation practices everard et al 2016 fallow uplands covering majority of this district have thin topsoil and very low water holding capacity jana et al 2012 out of all soil attributes of a nearby degraded land it came across that soil moisture content was significantly higher in the forested area table 4 whc of 60 82 at gurguripal corroborate that of ghosh 2015 and shit et al 2015 reporting high soil moisture with high soil bonding capacity due to denser vegetation supported by social forestry programmes raha et al 2014 increased stability of soil aggregates upon wetting is perceived as a benefit to soil conservation because it reflects reductions in the rates of soil erosion from intense rainfall events barrios 2007 3 3 forest wetland characterization the source of water in selected wetlands of the study area 22 25 56 02 n 87 13 2 91 e is through accumulation of rainwater and supply from ground water as a result of watershed management a total of 35 constructions had been built during 1990 1995 forest report field survey reported that majority of temporary or permanent wetlands indicated in blue fig 2 have been formed by embankment or blocking water channels gullies through plugs and bundhs as a part of ecorestoration a detailed resume of perennial catchments in close vicinity to forest trees g1 g3 at gurguripal are available in mallick and chakraborty 2015 g3 is isolated with earthen bundhs whereas only g2 receives water from overflow out of largest one g1 in upper basin in addition to rainwater accumulation table 5 lele 2009 highlight that structural changes in ecosystems can influence several watershed processes fig 2 depicts that scattered vegetation covers major portion of the study area having patches of forest interspersed with fallow land settlement and cultivable land which concentrate more towards the river bank in the south 3 4 geospatial analysis 3 4 1 areal dynamics change detection fig 3 illustrates outcome of ndvi computation values coded by shades of colours as an indicator of the presence and condition of green vegetation it implies that the canopy density has increased over 25 years implicative of regeneration whereas decrease in vegetation cover and health over a regional scale might be due to clearing of trees outside forest premises due to lack of management and as a mark of encroachment for human settlement or agriculture positive ndvi being typically between about 0 1 and 0 6 values at the higher end of the range indicating increased photosynthetic activity and a greater density of the canopy nath and acharjee 2013 previous studies have highlighted the influence of local factors and contaminating variables influencing ndvi values davies et al 2016 since landscape elements are not isolated and intensive water conservation process must have obvious impacts on adjacent areas the larger scale digital study acted vital to provide preliminary information on the trends of vegetation in a study of river basin in midnapore shit and maiti 2012 and ghosh 2015 reported severe gully erosion over these years 1990 2015 evident from the ndvi calculation and change of vegetation cover though the erosion rate in all parts of the study area has not been same the change matrix based on ndvi derived image values used for interpreting decadal changes in forest cover in and around the study area for specific years 1991 and 2015 spanning over 24 years is presented in fig 4 conversion statistics revealed maximum change of pixels occurring in the class open forest to scrub whereas least unchanged pixels occurred for water agricultural practice and bare land table in fig 4 the river water contributed hugely to the total surface water percentage and hence masked the area of enhanced lentic water bodies at local scale aoi similar to the hurdles of spatial and spectral limitations faced by davies et al 2016 overall the graph indicates flourishing of forest types as three of the conversions towards degrading quality of forest encountered decrease in 2015 since 1991 viz very dense to dense forest 36 25 27 38km2 dense to open 20 61 2 33km2 and scrubs to bare land 38 69 23 32km2 besides the extracted thematic information on the entire tract faintly supports the impact of small scale restoration on the complex forest extent rejuvenation from 1991 to 2015 the delivery and benefits obtained from a particular ecosystem service do not always occur in the same spatial or temporal scale maass et al 2005 for instance as reflected in our study freshwater provisioning service emanated from the whole watershed mainly the dense forest but the benefits of their delivery tended to concentrate at lowlands of the region agriculture and production sites simultaneously soil fertility maintenance is locally benefited on the other hand watershed management activities initiated in the 1990s reported from midnapore forest division have delivered benefits almost 1 2 decade later bilsborrow 2009 and ghosh 2015 have emphasized the lack of sufficient data and the existence of missing links due to dynamic environment as reasons for difficult assessment of the past physical environment particularly for comparing with the present scenario ahouansou et al 2015 and davies et al 2016 stated a limitation that meteorological archive data are often not available in a sufficient spatial and temporal resolution there is a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost data coverage and security restrictions nagendra and rocchini 2008 3 4 2 trends in lulc after the supervised classification of gurguripal images quantifying the spatial extent of lulc categories fig 5 from maps of 1990 and 2014 extending to midnapore town yielded land cover classes with highest percentage of area occupied by forests in both years of interest 6405ha and 7598 57ha respectively followed by fallow land 3857 69ha 2746 67ha respectively fig 5 shows decrease of areas in categories of vacant land fallow land laterite outcrop water body river bed and vegetation in descending order of proportions holding percentages 7 79 5 44 1 54 0 30 0 23 and 0 13 respectively anonymous 1996 asserted distribution of forest area by land use as dense forest 2 moderately dense forest 32 open forest 19 scrub forest 3 plantation 23 and others 21 in erstwhile undivided midnapore district extension of forest cover outside forest land has suffered a setback in south west bengal during the last decade raha et al 2014 noteworthy is the substantial increase of proportions of forest area 5 84 and agriculture land 6 03 which is definitely a good indication of successful afforestation practice and expansion of crop cultivation owing to improved water availability and irrigation facilities in the present as compared to the past unclassified category includes indistinct land use pixels and or errors however an enlargement of settlement area 3 is a common phenomenon for most urban areas to carry the growing human population though the sprawl pattern evident from fig 5 has been observed to invade the fallow land instead of forest continuums this reflects minimum disturbance to prevailing condition of forests of the zone even if forests are the dominant land cover their effects on hydrological indicators may be dampened by the effects of other land covers brogna et al 2017 our observation on the lulc pattern was found to be similar to other studies where forest cover declined in unmanaged areas gu and subramanian 2014 but increased in areas managed by communities davies et al 2016 mondal and southworth 2010 reported a gain of 15 3 forest cover in their study of teak plantation dominated park which is understandable due to its protected status but did not compare species level forest quality between dates as weighted against our study 5 84 which investigates biodiversity development in and around an unprotected but community managed forest this study affirms other studies reporting positive reforestation trends perz and skole 2003 arroyo mora et al 2005 however these regenerated forests are mostly not ecologically equivalent to the original ones lugo et al 1993 kandziora et al 2013 felt that freely available land cover information is rather coarse and insufficient needing alternative official spatial information sources there is an increase of es values based on the finer resolution data soil erosion decreases exponentially with intensification in vegetation cover samanta and bhunia 2016 thus our study may assume the same objectives of ongoing participatory sal coppice and conservation area management are not to increase the forest cover rather these management tools are aimed at reducing the vulnerability of forestland from encroachment and denudation alam et al 2008 3 5 biodiversity monitoring our approach is lined up with that of robinson and lundholm 2012 who quantified plant species diversity invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity as indicators for habitat provisioning 3 5 1 inventory on aquatic biota forty three 43 phytoplankton species were present at the investigated wetlands belonging to 5 divisions of algae details of their diversity are provided in appendix b zygnematales was the most speciose group and euglenophytes was the least the wetlands g1 and g2 together comprising 13 macrophyte species appendix a seemed to reach climax community dominated by schoenoplectiella articulata and nymphoides indica certain macrophytic species were observed at the study site during earlier field visits 2006 but were no more spotted recently but few others were persistent over years mallick and chakraborty 2014 presence of drosera burmanni a semi terrestrial carnivorous plant acting as flagship species rare at regional scale adds to the importance of gurguripal the vital role of zooplankton as indicators of aquatic ecosystems has long been established one hundred one 101 zooplankton species were found to inhabit the selected water bodies during the course of study as listed with their frequencies relative abundances succession and seasonal population dynamics by mallick and chakraborty 2014 2015 the relationships among densities of zooplankton and the major physicochemical factors were regressively analyzed by the same authors other animals invertebrates and vertebrates are listed in appendix c all pointing towards a high biodiversity potential of the managed site as compared to degraded site although no published survey data are available it can be assumed that aquatic taxa were severely diminished as key water dependent constituents of formerly degraded catchment ecosystems everard 2016 3 5 2 inventory on terrestrial biota 3 5 2 1 floral diversity 94 species angiospermic plant species belonging to 47 families were identified while inventorying the study site for recent years appendix a whereas historical data could provide sparse glimpse of flora some of which are enlisted table 6 during the afforestation project 1990s rows of eucalyptus sp gliricidia sepium etc were planted along the boundary plantation of acacia mangium was found desirable for soil conservation in combination with conventional miscellaneous species as associates in the present study site as compared to tectona grandis and dalbergia sissoo in case of corbett tiger reserve badola et al 2010 presently the floral diversity of the study site and its surroundings composed of 37 tree forms 22 shrubs and 34 herbs out of which majority are known to bear one or more values except weeds or those which the respondents couldn t relate to in total fabaceae acted as the family consisting largest representatives followed by poaceae and lamiaceae it had the greatest number of individuals belonging to family dipterocarpaceae with single species similar to the results 468 of ganguli et al 2016 table 6 hints that angiosperms flourishing in earlier times state forest report 2006 2007 did alter their distribution in the present studied site performed comparison mirrors that certain trees like a mangium adina cordifolia eucalyptus sp madhuca indica syzygium cuminii etc managed to persist right from the beginning till date whereas others like anacardium occidentale diospyros melanoxylon schleichera oleosa and terminalia arjuna were subsequently added at the same time 7 of the species well known previously could not be spotted for the current inventory chazdon 2008 stated that new forests emerging in human impacted landscapes will not match the original old growth forests in species composition at the same time there remain many unexplored resources within the study site associates of the sal trees and total species diversity in coppice sal forests are also found to vary spatially alam et al 2008 bhakat and kundu 2011 kushwaha and nandy 2012 ganguli et al 2016 recorded 7 out of 10 of the sal associates same as those found in the current study the current study area may be categorized as production forests subjected to a silvicultural system of harvesting and planting or natural regeneration which are relatively species poor as asserted by gamfeldt et al 2013 badola et al 2010 show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components rakshit and chanda 2017 stated most dominant floral component of nearby wasteland as evolvulus nummularius with others mostly weeds and grass species singha et al 2017 noted 71 mushroom species from gurguripal forest many edible and medicinally important which we couldn t cover they ascribed such richness in mushroom diversity to availability of ample degradable matter which increase the soil fertility and to the favourable moist environment prevailing under the thick canopy of dense forest mushroom diversity has been known to be positively correlated with healthy ecosystem in tropical forests arnolds 1988 these findings also act as indirect evidences of the enhanced soil moisture productivity level as well as biodiversity potential of the present study area 3 5 2 2 phytosociological analysis the use of tree size diversity as a structural attribute vertical strata or horizontal distribution provides a diversity of micro habitats for wildlife zenner and hibbs 2000 stand density ranged 390 660 tpa 964 1631 sph resembling that of an old sal forest 928 sph gautam and devoe 2005 corresponding with 1195 tpa by ganguli et al 2016 1006 tpa 30cm dbh by kushwaha and nandy 2012 the trees were not homogenously distributed as there existed disturbed amidst undisturbed stands in a study of tropical dry evergreen forest by baithalu et al 2013 tree density drastically declined by 57 from 1992 to 2012 3284 1460 tpa our records of sal were with species richness of 35 from south west bengal vegetation heights canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance according to mehta et al 2008 canopy density ranged from 49 04 82 32 in monsoons as compared to 29 41 47 07 during post monsoon our finding of moderately closed canopy corroborates with that of duan et al 2010 letting ample sunlight available for development of understory melastoma sp dominating in this case the present study revealed a maximum of 7 woody plant species per quadrat which is at par with the results of gamfeldt et al 2013 and 2 5 from sacred forests by ganguli et al 2016 out of the 6 frequency classes of the heights of important trees appendix d class iv 50 59ft was the most frequent 42 considering only the most dominant species of this study site sal tree heights ranged 25 35 4ft 30 60ft on average and their dbh ranged 19 8 30 1 inches i e the usual height of coppice sal in northern tropical dry deciduous forest bhuyan et al 2003 but did not match growth characteristics of old sal forest gautam and devoe 2005 of the 8 frequency classes of girth trees belonging to class v 14 0 14 99 in were most frequent 34 8 previous records of the district stated maximum number and volume of stems in the diameter class 1 9 3 5 inches for sal stratum whereas in 3 9 7 5in class when all other strata are included anonymous 1996 baithalu et al 2013 reported a declined tree density by 68 7 in lower girth class of 10 30cm 3 4 11 9in the number density of saplings and seedlings in any forest can be considered to be the regeneration potential of the forest nautiyal and kaechele 2008 bhuyan et al 2003 likewise regeneration was profuse within the study site as 36 of total trees plants enumerated via quadrats comprised of the saplings of sal palm or melastoma sp similar to findings of ganguli et al 2016 in contrary to the poor rate attributed by baithalu et al 2013 aide and cavelier 1994 identified degraded soils to be the most important barrier to forest regeneration in highly degraded grasslands the population structure and community indices calculated from quadrat analysis table 7 reflected 4 eudominant and 4 characteristic species each within the forest stands resulting in a moderate shannon wiener diversity index 1 07 and a low evenness 0 449 as compared to 1 88 and 0 71 respectively ganguli et al 2016 h value ranging 0 83 4 1 has been earlier reported for sal forests by many rasingam and parthasarthy 2009 sal was the most dominant tree covering maximum area in the forest throughout in line with findings of joshi 2012 ghosh 2015 and ganguli et al 2016 the eudominance of acid tolerant and aluminium al accumulator plant melastoma malabathricum within forest stands table 7 might reveal considerable concentrations of al in the soil watanabe et al 1998 and adds to the phytoremediation es potential as well 3 5 2 3 faunal diversity there always exists a positive correlation between biodiversity and measures of the varieties and or complexity of arrangement of structural components within an ecosystem mcelhinny 2002 appendix c reveals a total faunal richness of 248 combining aquatic and terrestrial in forest as compared to only 36 at degraded site invertebrate diversity is likely to be greatest in heterogeneous habitats containing a variety of structural arrangements oliver et al 1998 which was lacking in degraded site which thereby possessed the reverse since the study could not employ rigorous sampling except for zooplankton the list may not be taken as exhaustive for valid comparison with alternate cases but it does give an overview of the habitat longino et al 2002 demonstrate that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness the local wild animals available seem to be less as few are residential while many exhibit temporal stay present inventory fig 6 outnumbered wildlife reported previously in the area bhuyan et al 2003 das and ghosh 2014 but was obviously lesser than that in a protected reserve badola et al 2010 hill and hamer 2004 placed birds and lepidopterans as the most frequently studied taxa to assess impacts of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on biodiversity in tropical forests forest trees along with the surrounding sylvan environs provide safe sanctuary for a good number of birds pandit and bhakat 2007 the variety of floral assemblage and abundance of fruiting and flowering plants in forest fringe area of gurguripal appeared to be responsible for higher faunal diversity than forest plantation zone supporting the similar results of duan et al 2010 and kandziora et al 2013 araújo et al 2015 asserted that land restoration practices may recover the density of soil fauna very fast araneae coleoptera and formicidae respond sensitively to land degradation and restoration practice and are suggested as indicator groups for restoration success our results appendix c are supported by the assumption that aquatic taxa are severely diminished as key water dependent constituents of formerly degraded catchment ecosystems davies et al 2016 being embedded within forest the wetlands also offer a safe freshwater pool for migratory birds and many animals a prominent example is elephants using the forest tracts as their migratory corridor evident from their pugmarks pra reported increased conflict of elephants with villagers recently sometimes attacking with a 60 member herd which may indicate the fragmentation of forests similar to findings by badola et al 2010 and several others alam et al 2008 lugo et al 1993 focused on the importance of managed forest stands as species refuge and more importantly as tools for restoring species richness in degraded sites 3 6 socio cultural links to es the es framework advanced by the millennium ecosystem assessment ma 2005 spans a broad range of often non substitutable economic and non economic values flowing to humanity from nature in line with this the present study encompassed broader categories of es than either everard 2016 or chakraborty 2017 over larger span of time timber based forest products tfp formed approx 40 of the forest produce that is locally collected year round while non timber forest products ntfp constitutes approx 60 broad categories depicted in table 8 of the produce leaf collection emerges as a main attraction for the poor as sal leaves are sold to the town for processed products a large number of forest fringe people both tribals and non tribals not only depend on the surrounding plant resources for ntfps but also protect a good number of plant species through village sacred groves pandit and bhakat 2007 post monsoon seems to see a greater usage of the forest than during other seasons table 9 adding present forest usage indices of studied human activities equalling 22 as compared to past sum of indices i e 7 insinuates an increase of 214 3 in forest use fig 7 such calculations were supported by feedback from the local people s perception hunting of game by tribes has dramatically decreased whereas most of the parameters bring forth an enhanced utilization of forest by them the es evaluation table 10 places restored area score 52 superior to degraded land score 9 crossman et al 2013 observed that land cover data is commonly used as proxy for mapping erosion prevention nutrient and sediment retention services primary data on soil fertility were considered by swetnam et al 2011 with respect to 10 parameters which measured human environment interactions e g agricultural expansion kandziora et al 2013 quantified potential indicators of provisioning services in germany at a 0 5 scale similar to the grades employed in the present study but yielded data sources were not their own barbier et al 2008 realistically represented how es change with habitat conversion maass et al 2005 reflected reduced provisioning and regulating services upon transformation of tropical dry forest to other land use socioecological units having similar social context with the present work which indicates proportionate reduction in value of es from areas of dense forest to bare land obtained from pra table 10 forested habitats certainly contribute considerably to production functioning than the other habitat types kandziora et al 2013 no single tree species was able to promote all services gamfeldt et al 2013 species richness estimates are relatively easy to obtain and relate to the ability to manage ecosystems under limited information about species gamfeldt et al 2013 comparison of es of restored forests with that of degraded scrubland mirrors the major contribution to particular regulatory functions by the former water cycle and soil conservation whereas abundance to a provisioning service fastidious species habitat by the latter contrary to this wasteland vegetation may be found to support a great diversity of pollinating insects due to the abundance of nectar producing flowering vegetation kandziora et al 2013 thus the level of degradation should be kept in mind before drawing conclusions results of soil analyses in the current paper with enhanced moisture is backed up by shit et al s 2015 survey showing that majority of farmers of the area believed in improved soil water retention regarding recreational values tourism in the studied forest are greater than in the surrounding lands but lag much behind other protected forests of the state badola et al 2010 benefits from cultural es continue to be overlooked in many forest assessments because of the difficulties associated with measuring them yet such values are important to understand how people use and value nature luque et al 2017 almost 80 of respondents affirmed the prosperity of forest health in last 30 years except in the last decade where they observed constancy our retrospective analysis corroborates with the findings of calvo alvarado et al 2009 who showed that forest re growth was the result of multiple socioeconomic factors lugo et al 1993 pointed that well directed human actions provide us with the means to conserve biodiversity and restore it in locations previously degraded increasing es capacity within degraded catchments provides a basis for enhancing life prospects of local people everard 2016 community based assessments are necessary components of multiscale assessments as they capture the real life human scale experiences of changes in ecosystems and human wellbeing folke et al 2005 everard 2016 since humans are the end receivers of es derived from any ecosystem it was a faster and suitable option to collect information from them and pool their feedback in the form of quantifiable scores therefore ecorestored forest revealed higher values of es spreading widely over all categories as compared to non restored areas overall it can be concluded that community participation is the core element for ensuring the sustainability of resources chakraborty et al 2009 4 conclusion ecosystems always stand upon intricate interplay of linked web of components but it is difficult to measure all variables in short term forest ecosystem studies nautiyal and kaechele 2008 instead of delving into individual aspects too deeply we strived to sketch a picture of the hitherto neglected and insignificant landscape holistically which has been silently serving the populace post rejuvenation we chose indicators from each category of es provisioning regulating and production along with preliminary biodiversity survey and rs techniques to explain the changing conditions in order to characterize the study area to the fullest it is explicit from our study had the government aided human intervention for small scale damming and channelizing actions not been executed to provide physical support in the sloping terrains the nature would have failed in preventing the large scale soil erosion and reducing the water to run off excessively this holds significance in a drought prone laterite zone gurguripal where the increased vertical percolation elevated the water table underneath leading to increase in soil moisture content and compaction rendering the soil more suitable for forest regeneration and growth the visible outcome in this area after decades being so formed perennial wetlands inside forests that would have otherwise ended up being seasonal and the greener vegetation cover that have been quantified through rs tools alternatively we would have missed the whole lot of aquatic community inventoried in the paper plankton for instance from the forest environment in addition to the terrestrial organisms enumeration of aquatic biota added a new dimension to the sketch of studied forest ecosystem the healthier forest wetland ecosystem tends to have far reaching effects on human well being by providing more goods tangible and non tangible vital services esp drinking water source and livelihood to the rural people than these systems would have separately served for and obviously contrastingly higher than degraded one evident from anecdotes and pictures the paper succeeds to add the knowledge base for biodiversity at local scale with a record on rare species along with evaluation of the potential es from a rejuvenated forest wetland ecosystem as for the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the secondary forest with respect to fringe areas but higher as compared to a degraded reference site it is implicit that animals are easily spotted while being attracted by their diverse food sources present outside the said forest though they prefer to dwell within the forest in a safer habitat as such lulc patterns that generate greater ecosystem service production may not always lead to greater biodiversity conservation wentz et al 2008 in the case of floral inventory only 4 out of 37 trees showed common occurrence while analysing vegetation characteristics of the forest the phytosociological data and soil properties reciprocated similar values as other sal forests of the region but with a notably higher whc than degraded land it was not possible to perfectly compare the biota due to insufficient sampling approaches or predominant abiotic attributes before and after the restoration activity due to lack of relevant historical 30 years old scientific records in this specific site it is difficult to compare case studies when using different spatiotemporal assessment data kandziora et al 2013 our effort contributed to throw light on the constructive role of conservation measures in maintaining forest resilience intricate relationship between various components and processes in a habitat the local people s participation in accelerating natural recovery the importance of geospatial techniques in capturing the past and nevertheless the role of public perception in evaluating es collected inputs from selected indicator variables at this juncture would definitely enable us to compare cases predict the future trajectory of the said ecosystem and plan the management options more suited to better trade offs relating to human welfare the study sets a benchmark for future studies enabling comparison of real life datasets related to forest es particularly in a data deficient scenario faced by authors currently therefore after knowing the multifaceted values of the small yet significant study area it is imperative to continue monitoring of the present landscape lest the

geographical area under forest cover raha et al 2014 and forest departments have apparently shifted from profit based to sustainability based management the selected landscape at gurguripal is unique in blending forest and wetland patches within a watershed our preference towards this case study also underpins the fact that it stands upon repeated initiatives of conservation by government in collaboration with people s participation on a previously denuded undulating lateritic landscape facing severe erosion in the past there has been no documentation of its ecological structure and integrative functions so far in this context the main objectives of the paper revolve around following themes i to throw light on the history of watershed management primearely water conservation

structured conversations relating the history composition management consequences and extent of forest resources used by inhabitants community involvement in water management uses of plants following mallick et al 2014 etc opportunistically by personal communication endorsed by discussions with local people during surveys interviews and cross references were conducted using participatory rural appraisal pra technique chambers 1994 human usage indices were calculated by assigning each qualitative value a score viz low 1 medium 2 high 3 then a total score summed for all activities was obtained for each time frame modified from mehta et al 2008 for enumerating the different categories of es on the basis of people s perceptions in combination with the summarized results from contrasting habitat types a similar 4 point scale was employed indicator variables showing no little medium or high changes are jotted on the 0 3 scale proportionately finally summing up for each millenium ecosystem assessment ma category 3 results and discussion 3 1 ecological history of gurguripal forest being a dry and laterite zone most of the land area at gurguripal khasjangal was unproductive and agriculture was mainly rain fed in the historical times in some cases people used to do seasonal agriculture by encroaching forest land most of the villagers used to compensate for their livelihood by way of illegal boulder mining and tree falling moreover the villagers primarily women had to walk miles to fetch water from the adjoining kansai river mainly for drinking as such hot season worsened the situation initially the gurguripal area developed abundant shorea robusta sal forests along with its usual associates table 6 due to indiscriminate felling the area became gradually denuded and soil erosion progressed at an ever increasing pace the area was first planted up during 1965 1966 by the east medinipur forest division later on panchet soil conservation division purulia took up this area for afforestation again in 1979 1980 and successfully covered up the area but every time indiscriminate deforestation by the local people to make their livelihood rendered the area devoid of trees and severe soil erosion set in converting the site into a degraded one such a scenario prevailing at the state level has been elaborated by raha et al 2014 under such circumstances rupnarayan forest division took up the job of convincing the local people about the hazards of soil erosion and importance of afforestation and soil moisture conservation in socio economic upliftment of the people of the region the forests under each division are managed with active cooperation of the forest protection committees target was fixed for providing additional source of income to these poor people vis à vis creating a green cover on this vast stretch of land with the intervention of mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mnrega anonymous 1996 thus an area of 455ha of land was taken up for afforestation work during 1990 apart from plantations considerable structural works viz earthen dams check dams gully plugs etc had been executed sufficient numbers of earthen dams 35 reported were constructed for efficient ground water recharging as well as to arrest silt and gullies were modified to reduce horizontal seepage and increase vertical percolation of water so that ground water recharging could be elevated as a reflection of surface water table the area began to be protected with the help of the local villagers and developed as a picnic spot and nature resort on account of the excellent ground water recharging and pumping of water from the wells quite a good extent of land which was lying unutilized in the past was brought under multiple crop cultivation availability of drinking water facilitated the inhabitants as a relief in a nutshell such initiative brought about an overall positive impact in the mentioned area the forest has been further declared as an ecotourism park in january 2007 with erection of a watch tower and picnic and boating facilities for visitors 3 2 abiotic monitoring prevailing environmental conditions are essential for studying ecosystem processes forest cover is known to raise the precipitation events at global scale brogna et al 2017 pérez hoyos et al 2016 confirm a strong coupling between rainfall water table depth vegetation and soil 3 2 1 water quality overall data on physicochemical parameters hint for a clean aquatic system apha 2005 table 3 indicates widest ranges for turbidity and lowest fluctuation for bod the altered turbidity and tds may be attributed to the inflow of silt from the surroundings into the wetlands especially during monsoons making it murkier and the converse making it clearer during winters the range of ph recorded was 5 75 8 31 implying slightly acidic to slightly alkaline nature of the surface waters also the do 2 20 6 52 was suitable for survival of many aquatic organisms mallick and chakraborty 2015 variations in the physicochemical parameters of the water through different seasons and years showed no distinct trend probably implicating a dynamic forest environment over time 3 2 2 soil quality lateritic soils are characterized by acidic ph low npk and high iron content raychaudhuri 1980 according to older data by chakravarti and chakravarti 1957 erosion in undulating laterite soils of midnapore varied from slight to very high soils were acidic with ph 5 5 6 5 poor organic matter and available phosphate experimental soil sample was slightly acidic with an average ph 5 68 table 4 as the usual trait of laterite but was less acidic than that assessed by duan et al 2010 and more than that of degraded land and rakshit and chanda 2017 ec of 0 04ds cm shows that the study area is low in salinity which was again much lesser than that of a neighbouring degraded land and wasteland rakshit and chanda 2017 although the mean nutrient content values of the forest soil n 132 83 p 7 23 k 108 8kg ha oc of 0 74 seemed enhanced from degraded soil table 4 in line with findings of singh et al 2012 they still were low as per indian agricultural research institute i a r i standards anonymous 2011 yet fulfilled the general niches of sal forests gautam and devoe 2005 chattoraj 2016 there is significant potential for increasing oc through restoration of degraded soils and widespread adoption of soil conservation practices everard et al 2016 fallow uplands covering majority of this district have thin topsoil and very low water holding capacity jana et al 2012 out of all soil attributes of a nearby degraded land it came across that soil moisture content was significantly higher in the forested area table 4 whc of 60 82 at gurguripal corroborate that of ghosh 2015 and shit et al 2015 reporting high soil moisture with high soil bonding capacity due to denser vegetation supported by social forestry programmes raha et al 2014 increased stability of soil aggregates upon wetting is perceived as a benefit to soil conservation because it reflects reductions in the rates of soil erosion from intense rainfall events barrios 2007 3 3 forest wetland characterization the source of water in selected wetlands of the study area 22 25 56 02 n 87 13 2 91 e is through accumulation of rainwater and supply from ground water as a result of watershed management a total of 35 constructions had been built during 1990 1995 forest report field survey reported that majority of temporary or permanent wetlands indicated in blue fig 2 have been formed by embankment or blocking water channels gullies through plugs and bundhs as a part of ecorestoration a detailed resume of perennial catchments in close vicinity to forest trees g1 g3 at gurguripal are available in mallick and chakraborty 2015 g3 is isolated with earthen bundhs whereas only g2 receives water from overflow out of largest one g1 in upper basin in addition to rainwater accumulation table 5 lele 2009 highlight that structural changes in ecosystems can influence several watershed processes fig 2 depicts that scattered vegetation covers major portion of the study area having patches of forest interspersed with fallow land settlement and cultivable land which concentrate more towards the river bank in the south 3 4 geospatial analysis 3 4 1 areal dynamics change detection fig 3 illustrates outcome of ndvi computation values coded by shades of colours as an indicator of the presence and condition of green vegetation it implies that the canopy density has increased over 25 years implicative of regeneration whereas decrease in vegetation cover and health over a regional scale might be due to clearing of trees outside forest premises due to lack of management and as a mark of encroachment for human settlement or agriculture positive ndvi being typically between about 0 1 and 0 6 values at the higher end of the range indicating increased photosynthetic activity and a greater density of the canopy nath and acharjee 2013 previous studies have highlighted the influence of local factors and contaminating variables influencing ndvi values davies et al 2016 since landscape elements are not isolated and intensive water conservation process must have obvious impacts on adjacent areas the larger scale digital study acted vital to provide preliminary information on the trends of vegetation in a study of river basin in midnapore shit and maiti 2012 and ghosh 2015 reported severe gully erosion over these years 1990 2015 evident from the ndvi calculation and change of vegetation cover though the erosion rate in all parts of the study area has not been same the change matrix based on ndvi derived image values used for interpreting decadal changes in forest cover in and around the study area for specific years 1991 and 2015 spanning over 24 years is presented in fig 4 conversion statistics revealed maximum change of pixels occurring in the class open forest to scrub whereas least unchanged pixels occurred for water agricultural practice and bare land table in fig 4 the river water contributed hugely to the total surface water percentage and hence masked the area of enhanced lentic water bodies at local scale aoi similar to the hurdles of spatial and spectral limitations faced by davies et al 2016 overall the graph indicates flourishing of forest types as three of the conversions towards degrading quality of forest encountered decrease in 2015 since 1991 viz very dense to dense forest 36 25 27 38km2 dense to open 20 61 2 33km2 and scrubs to bare land 38 69 23 32km2 besides the extracted thematic information on the entire tract faintly supports the impact of small scale restoration on the complex forest extent rejuvenation from 1991 to 2015 the delivery and benefits obtained from a particular ecosystem service do not always occur in the same spatial or temporal scale maass et al 2005 for instance as reflected in our study freshwater provisioning service emanated from the whole watershed mainly the dense forest but the benefits of their delivery tended to concentrate at lowlands of the region agriculture and production sites simultaneously soil fertility maintenance is locally benefited on the other hand watershed management activities initiated in the 1990s reported from midnapore forest division have delivered benefits almost 1 2 decade later bilsborrow 2009 and ghosh 2015 have emphasized the lack of sufficient data and the existence of missing links due to dynamic environment as reasons for difficult assessment of the past physical environment particularly for comparing with the present scenario ahouansou et al 2015 and davies et al 2016 stated a limitation that meteorological archive data are often not available in a sufficient spatial and temporal resolution there is a glaring gap in the easy availability of hyperspectral and hyperspatial satellite data in the tropics due to reasons of cost data coverage and security restrictions nagendra and rocchini 2008 3 4 2 trends in lulc after the supervised classification of gurguripal images quantifying the spatial extent of lulc categories fig 5 from maps of 1990 and 2014 extending to midnapore town yielded land cover classes with highest percentage of area occupied by forests in both years of interest 6405ha and 7598 57ha respectively followed by fallow land 3857 69ha 2746 67ha respectively fig 5 shows decrease of areas in categories of vacant land fallow land laterite outcrop water body river bed and vegetation in descending order of proportions holding percentages 7 79 5 44 1 54 0 30 0 23 and 0 13 respectively anonymous 1996 asserted distribution of forest area by land use as dense forest 2 moderately dense forest 32 open forest 19 scrub forest 3 plantation 23 and others 21 in erstwhile undivided midnapore district extension of forest cover outside forest land has suffered a setback in south west bengal during the last decade raha et al 2014 noteworthy is the substantial increase of proportions of forest area 5 84 and agriculture land 6 03 which is definitely a good indication of successful afforestation practice and expansion of crop cultivation owing to improved water availability and irrigation facilities in the present as compared to the past unclassified category includes indistinct land use pixels and or errors however an enlargement of settlement area 3 is a common phenomenon for most urban areas to carry the growing human population though the sprawl pattern evident from fig 5 has been observed to invade the fallow land instead of forest continuums this reflects minimum disturbance to prevailing condition of forests of the zone even if forests are the dominant land cover their effects on hydrological indicators may be dampened by the effects of other land covers brogna et al 2017 our observation on the lulc pattern was found to be similar to other studies where forest cover declined in unmanaged areas gu and subramanian 2014 but increased in areas managed by communities davies et al 2016 mondal and southworth 2010 reported a gain of 15 3 forest cover in their study of teak plantation dominated park which is understandable due to its protected status but did not compare species level forest quality between dates as weighted against our study 5 84 which investigates biodiversity development in and around an unprotected but community managed forest this study affirms other studies reporting positive reforestation trends perz and skole 2003 arroyo mora et al 2005 however these regenerated forests are mostly not ecologically equivalent to the original ones lugo et al 1993 kandziora et al 2013 felt that freely available land cover information is rather coarse and insufficient needing alternative official spatial information sources there is an increase of es values based on the finer resolution data soil erosion decreases exponentially with intensification in vegetation cover samanta and bhunia 2016 thus our study may assume the same objectives of ongoing participatory sal coppice and conservation area management are not to increase the forest cover rather these management tools are aimed at reducing the vulnerability of forestland from encroachment and denudation alam et al 2008 3 5 biodiversity monitoring our approach is lined up with that of robinson and lundholm 2012 who quantified plant species diversity invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity as indicators for habitat provisioning 3 5 1 inventory on aquatic biota forty three 43 phytoplankton species were present at the investigated wetlands belonging to 5 divisions of algae details of their diversity are provided in appendix b zygnematales was the most speciose group and euglenophytes was the least the wetlands g1 and g2 together comprising 13 macrophyte species appendix a seemed to reach climax community dominated by schoenoplectiella articulata and nymphoides indica certain macrophytic species were observed at the study site during earlier field visits 2006 but were no more spotted recently but few others were persistent over years mallick and chakraborty 2014 presence of drosera burmanni a semi terrestrial carnivorous plant acting as flagship species rare at regional scale adds to the importance of gurguripal the vital role of zooplankton as indicators of aquatic ecosystems has long been established one hundred one 101 zooplankton species were found to inhabit the selected water bodies during the course of study as listed with their frequencies relative abundances succession and seasonal population dynamics by mallick and chakraborty 2014 2015 the relationships among densities of zooplankton and the major physicochemical factors were regressively analyzed by the same authors other animals invertebrates and vertebrates are listed in appendix c all pointing towards a high biodiversity potential of the managed site as compared to degraded site although no published survey data are available it can be assumed that aquatic taxa were severely diminished as key water dependent constituents of formerly degraded catchment ecosystems everard 2016 3 5 2 inventory on terrestrial biota 3 5 2 1 floral diversity 94 species angiospermic plant species belonging to 47 families were identified while inventorying the study site for recent years appendix a whereas historical data could provide sparse glimpse of flora some of which are enlisted table 6 during the afforestation project 1990s rows of eucalyptus sp gliricidia sepium etc were planted along the boundary plantation of acacia mangium was found desirable for soil conservation in combination with conventional miscellaneous species as associates in the present study site as compared to tectona grandis and dalbergia sissoo in case of corbett tiger reserve badola et al 2010 presently the floral diversity of the study site and its surroundings composed of 37 tree forms 22 shrubs and 34 herbs out of which majority are known to bear one or more values except weeds or those which the respondents couldn t relate to in total fabaceae acted as the family consisting largest representatives followed by poaceae and lamiaceae it had the greatest number of individuals belonging to family dipterocarpaceae with single species similar to the results 468 of ganguli et al 2016 table 6 hints that angiosperms flourishing in earlier times state forest report 2006 2007 did alter their distribution in the present studied site performed comparison mirrors that certain trees like a mangium adina cordifolia eucalyptus sp madhuca indica syzygium cuminii etc managed to persist right from the beginning till date whereas others like anacardium occidentale diospyros melanoxylon schleichera oleosa and terminalia arjuna were subsequently added at the same time 7 of the species well known previously could not be spotted for the current inventory chazdon 2008 stated that new forests emerging in human impacted landscapes will not match the original old growth forests in species composition at the same time there remain many unexplored resources within the study site associates of the sal trees and total species diversity in coppice sal forests are also found to vary spatially alam et al 2008 bhakat and kundu 2011 kushwaha and nandy 2012 ganguli et al 2016 recorded 7 out of 10 of the sal associates same as those found in the current study the current study area may be categorized as production forests subjected to a silvicultural system of harvesting and planting or natural regeneration which are relatively species poor as asserted by gamfeldt et al 2013 badola et al 2010 show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components rakshit and chanda 2017 stated most dominant floral component of nearby wasteland as evolvulus nummularius with others mostly weeds and grass species singha et al 2017 noted 71 mushroom species from gurguripal forest many edible and medicinally important which we couldn t cover they ascribed such richness in mushroom diversity to availability of ample degradable matter which increase the soil fertility and to the favourable moist environment prevailing under the thick canopy of dense forest mushroom diversity has been known to be positively correlated with healthy ecosystem in tropical forests arnolds 1988 these findings also act as indirect evidences of the enhanced soil moisture productivity level as well as biodiversity potential of the present study area 3 5 2 2 phytosociological analysis the use of tree size diversity as a structural attribute vertical strata or horizontal distribution provides a diversity of micro habitats for wildlife zenner and hibbs 2000 stand density ranged 390 660 tpa 964 1631 sph resembling that of an old sal forest 928 sph gautam and devoe 2005 corresponding with 1195 tpa by ganguli et al 2016 1006 tpa 30cm dbh by kushwaha and nandy 2012 the trees were not homogenously distributed as there existed disturbed amidst undisturbed stands in a study of tropical dry evergreen forest by baithalu et al 2013 tree density drastically declined by 57 from 1992 to 2012 3284 1460 tpa our records of sal were with species richness of 35 from south west bengal vegetation heights canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance according to mehta et al 2008 canopy density ranged from 49 04 82 32 in monsoons as compared to 29 41 47 07 during post monsoon our finding of moderately closed canopy corroborates with that of duan et al 2010 letting ample sunlight available for development of understory melastoma sp dominating in this case the present study revealed a maximum of 7 woody plant species per quadrat which is at par with the results of gamfeldt et al 2013 and 2 5 from sacred forests by ganguli et al 2016 out of the 6 frequency classes of the heights of important trees appendix d class iv 50 59ft was the most frequent 42 considering only the most dominant species of this study site sal tree heights ranged 25 35 4ft 30 60ft on average and their dbh ranged 19 8 30 1 inches i e the usual height of coppice sal in northern tropical dry deciduous forest bhuyan et al 2003 but did not match growth characteristics of old sal forest gautam and devoe 2005 of the 8 frequency classes of girth trees belonging to class v 14 0 14 99 in were most frequent 34 8 previous records of the district stated maximum number and volume of stems in the diameter class 1 9 3 5 inches for sal stratum whereas in 3 9 7 5in class when all other strata are included anonymous 1996 baithalu et al 2013 reported a declined tree density by 68 7 in lower girth class of 10 30cm 3 4 11 9in the number density of saplings and seedlings in any forest can be considered to be the regeneration potential of the forest nautiyal and kaechele 2008 bhuyan et al 2003 likewise regeneration was profuse within the study site as 36 of total trees plants enumerated via quadrats comprised of the saplings of sal palm or melastoma sp similar to findings of ganguli et al 2016 in contrary to the poor rate attributed by baithalu et al 2013 aide and cavelier 1994 identified degraded soils to be the most important barrier to forest regeneration in highly degraded grasslands the population structure and community indices calculated from quadrat analysis table 7 reflected 4 eudominant and 4 characteristic species each within the forest stands resulting in a moderate shannon wiener diversity index 1 07 and a low evenness 0 449 as compared to 1 88 and 0 71 respectively ganguli et al 2016 h value ranging 0 83 4 1 has been earlier reported for sal forests by many rasingam and parthasarthy 2009 sal was the most dominant tree covering maximum area in the forest throughout in line with findings of joshi 2012 ghosh 2015 and ganguli et al 2016 the eudominance of acid tolerant and aluminium al accumulator plant melastoma malabathricum within forest stands table 7 might reveal considerable concentrations of al in the soil watanabe et al 1998 and adds to the phytoremediation es potential as well 3 5 2 3 faunal diversity there always exists a positive correlation between biodiversity and measures of the varieties and or complexity of arrangement of structural components within an ecosystem mcelhinny 2002 appendix c reveals a total faunal richness of 248 combining aquatic and terrestrial in forest as compared to only 36 at degraded site invertebrate diversity is likely to be greatest in heterogeneous habitats containing a variety of structural arrangements oliver et al 1998 which was lacking in degraded site which thereby possessed the reverse since the study could not employ rigorous sampling except for zooplankton the list may not be taken as exhaustive for valid comparison with alternate cases but it does give an overview of the habitat longino et al 2002 demonstrate that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness the local wild animals available seem to be less as few are residential while many exhibit temporal stay present inventory fig 6 outnumbered wildlife reported previously in the area bhuyan et al 2003 das and ghosh 2014 but was obviously lesser than that in a protected reserve badola et al 2010 hill and hamer 2004 placed birds and lepidopterans as the most frequently studied taxa to assess impacts of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on biodiversity in tropical forests forest trees along with the surrounding sylvan environs provide safe sanctuary for a good number of birds pandit and bhakat 2007 the variety of floral assemblage and abundance of fruiting and flowering plants in forest fringe area of gurguripal appeared to be responsible for higher faunal diversity than forest plantation zone supporting the similar results of duan et al 2010 and kandziora et al 2013 araújo et al 2015 asserted that land restoration practices may recover the density of soil fauna very fast araneae coleoptera and formicidae respond sensitively to land degradation and restoration practice and are suggested as indicator groups for restoration success our results appendix c are supported by the assumption that aquatic taxa are severely diminished as key water dependent constituents of formerly degraded catchment ecosystems davies et al 2016 being embedded within forest the wetlands also offer a safe freshwater pool for migratory birds and many animals a prominent example is elephants using the forest tracts as their migratory corridor evident from their pugmarks pra reported increased conflict of elephants with villagers recently sometimes attacking with a 60 member herd which may indicate the fragmentation of forests similar to findings by badola et al 2010 and several others alam et al 2008 lugo et al 1993 focused on the importance of managed forest stands as species refuge and more importantly as tools for restoring species richness in degraded sites 3 6 socio cultural links to es the es framework advanced by the millennium ecosystem assessment ma 2005 spans a broad range of often non substitutable economic and non economic values flowing to humanity from nature in line with this the present study encompassed broader categories of es than either everard 2016 or chakraborty 2017 over larger span of time timber based forest products tfp formed approx 40 of the forest produce that is locally collected year round while non timber forest products ntfp constitutes approx 60 broad categories depicted in table 8 of the produce leaf collection emerges as a main attraction for the poor as sal leaves are sold to the town for processed products a large number of forest fringe people both tribals and non tribals not only depend on the surrounding plant resources for ntfps but also protect a good number of plant species through village sacred groves pandit and bhakat 2007 post monsoon seems to see a greater usage of the forest than during other seasons table 9 adding present forest usage indices of studied human activities equalling 22 as compared to past sum of indices i e 7 insinuates an increase of 214 3 in forest use fig 7 such calculations were supported by feedback from the local people s perception hunting of game by tribes has dramatically decreased whereas most of the parameters bring forth an enhanced utilization of forest by them the es evaluation table 10 places restored area score 52 superior to degraded land score 9 crossman et al 2013 observed that land cover data is commonly used as proxy for mapping erosion prevention nutrient and sediment retention services primary data on soil fertility were considered by swetnam et al 2011 with respect to 10 parameters which measured human environment interactions e g agricultural expansion kandziora et al 2013 quantified potential indicators of provisioning services in germany at a 0 5 scale similar to the grades employed in the present study but yielded data sources were not their own barbier et al 2008 realistically represented how es change with habitat conversion maass et al 2005 reflected reduced provisioning and regulating services upon transformation of tropical dry forest to other land use socioecological units having similar social context with the present work which indicates proportionate reduction in value of es from areas of dense forest to bare land obtained from pra table 10 forested habitats certainly contribute considerably to production functioning than the other habitat types kandziora et al 2013 no single tree species was able to promote all services gamfeldt et al 2013 species richness estimates are relatively easy to obtain and relate to the ability to manage ecosystems under limited information about species gamfeldt et al 2013 comparison of es of restored forests with that of degraded scrubland mirrors the major contribution to particular regulatory functions by the former water cycle and soil conservation whereas abundance to a provisioning service fastidious species habitat by the latter contrary to this wasteland vegetation may be found to support a great diversity of pollinating insects due to the abundance of nectar producing flowering vegetation kandziora et al 2013 thus the level of degradation should be kept in mind before drawing conclusions results of soil analyses in the current paper with enhanced moisture is backed up by shit et al s 2015 survey showing that majority of farmers of the area believed in improved soil water retention regarding recreational values tourism in the studied forest are greater than in the surrounding lands but lag much behind other protected forests of the state badola et al 2010 benefits from cultural es continue to be overlooked in many forest assessments because of the difficulties associated with measuring them yet such values are important to understand how people use and value nature luque et al 2017 almost 80 of respondents affirmed the prosperity of forest health in last 30 years except in the last decade where they observed constancy our retrospective analysis corroborates with the findings of calvo alvarado et al 2009 who showed that forest re growth was the result of multiple socioeconomic factors lugo et al 1993 pointed that well directed human actions provide us with the means to conserve biodiversity and restore it in locations previously degraded increasing es capacity within degraded catchments provides a basis for enhancing life prospects of local people everard 2016 community based assessments are necessary components of multiscale assessments as they capture the real life human scale experiences of changes in ecosystems and human wellbeing folke et al 2005 everard 2016 since humans are the end receivers of es derived from any ecosystem it was a faster and suitable option to collect information from them and pool their feedback in the form of quantifiable scores therefore ecorestored forest revealed higher values of es spreading widely over all categories as compared to non restored areas overall it can be concluded that community participation is the core element for ensuring the sustainability of resources chakraborty et al 2009 4 conclusion ecosystems always stand upon intricate interplay of linked web of components but it is difficult to measure all variables in short term forest ecosystem studies nautiyal and kaechele 2008 instead of delving into individual aspects too deeply we strived to sketch a picture of the hitherto neglected and insignificant landscape holistically which has been silently serving the populace post rejuvenation we chose indicators from each category of es provisioning regulating and production along with preliminary biodiversity survey and rs techniques to explain the changing conditions in order to characterize the study area to the fullest it is explicit from our study had the government aided human intervention for small scale damming and channelizing actions not been executed to provide physical support in the sloping terrains the nature would have failed in preventing the large scale soil erosion and reducing the water to run off excessively this holds significance in a drought prone laterite zone gurguripal where the increased vertical percolation elevated the water table underneath leading to increase in soil moisture content and compaction rendering the soil more suitable for forest regeneration and growth the visible outcome in this area after decades being so formed perennial wetlands inside forests that would have otherwise ended up being seasonal and the greener vegetation cover that have been quantified through rs tools alternatively we would have missed the whole lot of aquatic community inventoried in the paper plankton for instance from the forest environment in addition to the terrestrial organisms enumeration of aquatic biota added a new dimension to the sketch of studied forest ecosystem the healthier forest wetland ecosystem tends to have far reaching effects on human well being by providing more goods tangible and non tangible vital services esp drinking water source and livelihood to the rural people than these systems would have separately served for and obviously contrastingly higher than degraded one evident from anecdotes and pictures the paper succeeds to add the knowledge base for biodiversity at local scale with a record on rare species along with evaluation of the potential es from a rejuvenated forest wetland ecosystem as for the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the secondary forest with respect to fringe areas but higher as compared to a degraded reference site it is implicit that animals are easily spotted while being attracted by their diverse food sources present outside the said forest though they prefer to dwell within the forest in a safer habitat as such lulc patterns that generate greater ecosystem service production may not always lead to greater biodiversity conservation wentz et al 2008 in the case of floral inventory only 4 out of 37 trees showed common occurrence while analysing vegetation characteristics of the forest the phytosociological data and soil properties reciprocated similar values as other sal forests of the region but with a notably higher whc than degraded land it was not possible to perfectly compare the biota due to insufficient sampling approaches or predominant abiotic attributes before and after the restoration activity due to lack of relevant historical 30 years old scientific records in this specific site it is difficult to compare case studies when using different spatiotemporal assessment data kandziora et al 2013 our effort contributed to throw light on the constructive role of conservation measures in maintaining forest resilience intricate relationship between various components and processes in a habitat the local people s participation in accelerating natural recovery the importance of geospatial techniques in capturing the past and nevertheless the role of public perception in evaluating es collected inputs from selected indicator variables at this juncture would definitely enable us to compare cases predict the future trajectory of the said ecosystem and plan the management options more suited to better trade offs relating to human welfare the study sets a benchmark for future studies enabling comparison of real life datasets related to forest es particularly in a data deficient scenario faced by authors currently therefore after knowing the multifaceted values of the small yet significant study area it is imperative to continue monitoring of the present landscape lest the improvements caused by restorative actions may dwindle conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgement

bioconcentration of sr al cu ni zn mn fe and cd in t latifolia and by evaluating trace element pollution in the examined ponds the concentration of trace elements in the bottom sediments of the examined ponds was diverse and exceeded the levels of the geo chemical background for cu ni zn mn fe cd and sr in spite of substantial accumulation of trace elements in the examined ponds these did not exceed the pel probable effects levels which would indicate a negative impact of the metals under consideration on living organisms most elements accumulated mainly in the roots except for cd which dominated in leaves the results indicate that concentrations of cu zn and cd in the roots were comparable to the concentration of these elements in the bottom sediments showing a bioindicative role of these parts of t latifolia the highest bcf bioconcentration factor values were found for mn and cd and the lowest bcf values were found for al and fe the tf translocation factor levels in the

leaves fig 1 cadmium is characterized by high mobility in the environment and is easily accumulated by plants maciołek et al 2013 according to samecka cymerman et al 2011 uptake of potentially toxic elements by plant rhizomes is usually much lower than in the case of macro components which is due to defensive mechanisms however in the case of cadmium the abovementioned concentrations were found in all examined parts of t latifolia originating from the examined ponds due to substantial contamination of bottom sediments by that element table 3 fertilizers e g superphosphates constitute an important source of cd in the rural environment and may contain from 10 to 100 mg kg of this metal satarug et al 2003 their common and long term application leads to the contamination of soils and

values whereas in the case of sr mn ni and cd substantially increased levels were found table 4 the strontium content in the plants varies with respect to its content in sediments and may reach high concentrations the increased content of mn in the rhizomes of t latifolia in relation to physiological demand 10 25 mg kg may be a characteristic feature of the species and indicate a positive impact of this macrophyte on the purification of manganese compounds from water and bottom sediments the strong cumulative characteristics of the leaves of t latifolia in relation to manganese in comparison with other water plants has been confirmed by letachowicz et al 2006 demirezen and aksoy 2006 teuchies et al 2013 klink et al 2013 and parzych et al 2016 nickel is easily taken up by plants and transported to the above ground parts and with excess it accumulates in roots generally its content in plants varies from 0 1 to 5 0 mg kg and after exceeding 10 mg kg it can have a toxic impact kabata pendias and pendias 1999 the results indicate that concentrations of cu zn and cd in the roots were comparable to the concentrations of the relative element in bottom sediments tables 3 and 4

stage sub species and species kabata pendias and pendias 1999 in the case of fe and al very high concentrations were detected in the roots in reference to their content in leaves which may indicate the existence of a physiological barrier limiting the transfer of iron and aluminum compounds from underground to above ground shoots parzych et al 2016 hozhina et al 2001 according to kabata pendias and pendias 1999 fe is a low mobility element in plants and mostly accumulates in underground parts the relationship between the content of studied trace elements in the organs of t latifolia was arranged into the following sequence mn fe al sr zn ni cu cd in leaves and fe al mn zn sr ni cu cd in rhizomes and roots among the examined trace elements sr ni and mn mainly accumulated in the roots of t latifolia roots leaves rhizomes while al cu zn and fe dominated in roots roots rhizomes leaves and cd in leaves leaves rhizomes roots on a basis of a non parametric kruskal wallis test the statistical significance between the content of trace elements in leaves rhizomes and roots of t latifolia was established table 4 statistically significant differences in the concentrations of all examined trace elements were found which indicates different physicochemical conditions in the examined ponds 3 3 bioconcentration and translocation factors in order to compare the content of the analyzed trace elements in organs of t latifolia to their content in bottom sediments bioconcentration factors bcf were used the highest mean bcf values were discovered in the roots sr al zn ni cu mn and fe and in the leaves cd of t latifolia fig 2 the highest bcf values were found for manganese from 1 04 in rhizomes to 10 5 in roots and cadmium from 3 48 in roots to 5 95 in leaves and the lowest values were found for aluminum from 0 01 in leaves to 0 47 in rhizomes and iron from 0 02 in leaves to 0 94 in roots the high bcf values of mn and cd result from the high bio accessibility of these elements from bottom sediments due to favorable ph levels table 1 bcf values 10 are difficult to characterize since both bottom sediments and contaminants inflowing from outside can be the source of these elements in the case of bcf 10 pollutants constitute a dominating source of elements chiarenzelli et al 2001 the wide range of bcf values in leaves rhizomes and roots indicate diverse physical and chemical conditions between the ponds under consideration the mean bcf values were used to form the following decreasing sequences leaves cd mn sr ni cu zn fe al rhizomes cd sr ni mn cu zn fe al roots mn cd ni sr zn cu fe al by means of translocation factors tf the mobility of trace elements between the examined organs of t latifolia was shown table 5 tf levels 1 0 indicate low mobility tf 1

in the case of mn 4 02 cd 1 45 sr 1 39 and ni 1 22 and from roots to rhizomes in the case of cd 2 00 in other cases mobility was low tf 1 the lowest level of translocation was found in the case of al compounds tf 0 18 and fe tf 0 15 which confirms the low mobility of these elements kabata pendias and pendias 1999 and is in accordance with research done by hozhina et al 2001 and parzych et al 2016 the tf levels in the case of mn cd sr and ni show that t latifolia can be potentially used in phytoextraction processes due to the easy translocation of these metals from rhizomes to leaves table 5 yoon et al 2006 increased mobility of trace metals in the environment has an impact on their accumulation in plants table 4 parzych 2016 3 4 characteristics of pollutants in ponds in order to identify the factors determining the chemical composition of bottom sediments and organs of t latifolia factor analysis was applied pca by means of the main components two independent factors were separated

moreover in głobino there is an enterprise which deals with the sale of fertilizers plant protection products and the production of animal fodder fertilizers very often contain a high quantity of heavy metals zwonitzer et al 2003 the ponds in swołowo and runowo sławieńskie are surrounded mainly by farm fields where natural and chemical fertilizers are used and by farm buildings from which there can be leakages of liquid manure moreover the higher acidity of bottom sediments in these ponds table 3 may have increased the bioavailability of trace elements for the organs of t latifolia

with other water plants has been confirmed by letachowicz et al 2006 demirezen and aksoy 2006 teuchies et al 2013 klink et al 2013 and parzych et al 2016 nickel is easily taken up by plants and transported to the above ground parts and with excess it accumulates in roots generally its content in plants varies from 0 1 to 5 0 mg kg and after exceeding 10 mg kg it can have a toxic impact kabata pendias and pendias 1999 the results indicate that concentrations of cu zn and cd in the roots were comparable to the concentrations of the relative element in bottom sediments tables 3 and 4 showing a bioindicative role of the body parts of t latifolia copper is an element with low mobility in plants and is highly diverse depending on the part of the plant the phase of plant development stage sub species and species kabata pendias and pendias 1999 in the case of fe and al very high concentrations were detected in the roots in reference to their content in leaves which may indicate the existence of a physiological barrier limiting the transfer of iron and aluminum compounds from underground to above ground shoots parzych et al 2016 hozhina et al 2001 according to kabata pendias and pendias 1999 fe is a low mobility element in plants and mostly accumulates in underground parts the relationship between the content of studied trace elements in the organs of t latifolia was arranged into the following sequence mn fe al sr zn ni cu cd in leaves and fe al mn zn sr ni cu cd in rhizomes and roots among the examined trace elements sr ni and mn mainly accumulated in the roots of t latifolia roots leaves rhizomes while al cu zn and fe dominated in roots roots rhizomes leaves and cd in leaves leaves rhizomes roots on a basis of a non parametric kruskal wallis test the statistical significance between the content of trace elements in leaves rhizomes and roots of t latifolia was established table 4 statistically significant differences in the concentrations of all examined trace elements were found which indicates different physicochemical conditions in the examined ponds 3 3 bioconcentration and translocation factors in order to compare the content of the analyzed trace elements in organs of t latifolia to their content in bottom sediments bioconcentration factors bcf were used the highest mean bcf values were discovered in the roots sr al zn ni cu mn and fe and in the leaves cd of t latifolia fig 2 the highest bcf values were found for manganese from 1 04 in rhizomes to 10 5 in roots and cadmium from 3 48 in roots to 5 95 in leaves and the lowest values were found for aluminum from 0 01 in leaves to 0 47 in rhizomes and iron from 0 02 in leaves to 0 94 in roots the high bcf values of mn and cd result from the high bio accessibility of these elements from bottom sediments due to favorable ph levels table 1 bcf values 10 are difficult to characterize since both bottom sediments and contaminants inflowing from outside can be the source of these elements in the case of bcf 10 pollutants constitute a dominating source of elements chiarenzelli et al 2001 the wide range of bcf values in leaves rhizomes and roots indicate diverse physical and chemical conditions between the ponds under consideration the mean bcf values were used to form the following decreasing sequences leaves cd mn sr ni cu zn fe al rhizomes cd sr ni mn cu zn fe al roots mn cd ni sr zn cu fe al by means of translocation factors tf the mobility of trace elements between the examined organs of t latifolia was shown table 5 tf levels 1 0 indicate low mobility tf 1 indicates no mobility and tf 1 indicates high mobility of an element between the organs of t latifolia under consideration baker and brooks 1989 the highest mobility from rhizomes to leaves was found in the case of mn 4 02 cd 1 45 sr 1 39 and ni 1 22 and from roots to rhizomes in the case of cd 2 00 in other cases mobility was low tf 1 the lowest level of translocation was found in the case of al compounds tf 0 18 and fe tf 0 15 which confirms the low mobility of these elements kabata pendias and pendias 1999 and is in accordance with research done by hozhina et al 2001 and parzych et al 2016 the tf levels in the case of mn cd sr and ni show that t latifolia can be potentially used in phytoextraction processes due to the easy translocation of these metals from rhizomes to leaves table 5 yoon et al 2006 increased mobility of trace metals in the environment has an impact on their accumulation in plants table 4 parzych 2016 3 4 characteristics of pollutants in ponds in order to identify the factors determining the chemical composition of bottom sediments and organs of t latifolia factor analysis was applied pca by means of the main components two independent factors were separated explaining 59 of the variability variance in the chemical composition of the examined organs of t latifolia and bottom sediments table 6 factor 1 f1 explained 41 of the variability and comprised zn fe al and cu characterized by very high negative factor loads metals constituting factor 1 showed high concentrations in bottom sediments and the roots of t latifolia tables 3 and 4 the quantity of zinc and copper in the environment increases due to use of chemicals and fertilizers both natural and artificial zwonitzer et al 2003 another significant source of trace metals can also be uncontrolled discharges from domestic sewage directly into rivers and water reservoirs vardanyan and angole 2006 skwierawski 2010 szymczyk and świtajska 2013 bąk and dąbkowski 2013 showed that storm water runoff in urban areas is often contaminated by heavy metals especially compounds of zinc and copper factor 2 f2 explaining 18 of the variance comprised sr and mn characterized by high positive factor loads both strontium and manganese are characterized by high chemical activity and bioavailability in slightly alkaline soils research has shown that sr fosters the accumulation of mn in plant shoots the origin of manganese in bottom sediments is the result of plant protection preparations and fertilizers strontium is an additive in paints kabata pendias and pendias 1999 3 5 effect of land use on the pollution status of ponds by the application of ward s method the examined ponds were grouped as to their degree of similarity regarding the quantity of accumulated trace elements sr al cu ni zn mn fe and cd in bottom sediments and the organs of t latifolia fig 3 the obtained results confirm that the type of catchment area has a substantial impact on the mass of contaminants flowing into ponds gałczyńska and kot 2010 in group a four ponds situated in bierkowo niewierowo kusowo and bruskowo wielkie bi ni ku bw were characterized by a moderate content of most of the examined metals those ponds were surrounded mainly by rural housing developments and farms table 1 in the neighborhood of bierkowo there is a municipal waste dump area and in bruskowo wielkie there is a poultry slaughterhouse in group b the ponds located in ręblino and siemianice re and si were characterized by a relatively low concentration of trace elements in sediments and the organs of t latifolia these ponds were surrounded mainly by rural farm housing and partially by a forest complex which had a positive impact on the quality of bottom sediments and the chemical composition of t latifolia in group c the ponds located in the villages of głobino kobylnica swołowo and runowo sławieńskie gł ko sw rs showed increased concentrations of most trace elements both in bottom sediments and the organs of t latifolia the villages of głobino and kobylnica in the close vicinity of the city of słupsk are under the influence of municipal dust which is a carrier of many trace elements parzych jonczak 2014b moreover in głobino there is an enterprise which deals with the sale of fertilizers plant protection products and the production of animal fodder fertilizers very often contain a high quantity of heavy metals zwonitzer et al 2003 the ponds in swołowo and runowo sławieńskie are surrounded mainly by farm fields where natural and chemical fertilizers are used and by farm buildings from which there can be leakages of liquid manure moreover the higher acidity of bottom sediments in these ponds table 3 may have increased the bioavailability of trace elements for the organs of t latifolia gworek 2006 falkowski et al 2000 4 conclusions the bottom sediments of the examined ponds were characterized by diverse reactions from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline and a diverse organic matter content the concentrations of trace elements in the bottom sediments were diverse and exceeded the geochemical background values for most metals while not exceeding the index pel rate which would indicate a negative impact of the contaminants under consideration on living organisms according to the lawa classification the bottom sediments were classified according to the content of ni as class i quality due to the zn content as class i ii due to cu as class ii and in the case of cd as class ii iii i e moderately heavily contaminated most examined elements sr al cu ni zn mn and fe accumulated mainly in the roots except for cd which dominated in the leaves of t latifolia the results indicate that concentrations of cu zn and cd in the roots were comparable to the concentration of the relative element in bottom sediments showing a bioindicative role for the body parts of t latifolia the highest bcf values were found for cd from 3 48 in roots to 5 95 in leaves and for mn from 1 04 in rhizomes to 10 5 in roots and the lowest for al from 0 01 in leaves to 0 47 in rhizomes and fe from 0 02 in leaves to 0 94 in roots the high bcf values for mn and cd are the result of the high bio accessibility of these elements from bottom sediments due to favorable ph levels the tf levels in the case of mn cd sr and ni show that t latifolia can be potentially used for phytoextraction processes due to the easy translocation of these metals from rhizomes to leaves conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical
