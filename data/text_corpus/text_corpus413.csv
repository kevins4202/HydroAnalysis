2065,to cope with the negative impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in basins positive measures such as interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource policies have been implemented worldwide and these measures have had an obvious effect on the discharges of large rivers however for small and medium sized rivers the impact is still unclear due to a deficiency in river discharge data to answer this question the haihe river basin hrb located in the core area of economic development in north china was selected as a typical research area remote sensing hydrological station technology which combines unmanned aerial vehicles uavs satellite remote sensing and in situ surveying was applied to obtain the monthly scale discharges of 16 small and medium sized river sections in the last 20 years 2000 2020 in addition an accuracy evaluation and spatiotemporal change analysis of the discharge results which were influenced by interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource management policies were also carried out the results show that 1 10 of the 16 river sections in the basin had a downward trend in the past 20 years with an average annual decrease of 2 13 and these sections were located in the plain areas the remaining 6 sections located in the mountain areas had an upward trend with an average annual increase of 1 72 2 we found that the river discharges of small and medium sized rivers recovered with a lag that reached 3 11 years for the 16 rivers and this lag for the mountain rivers was 3 9 years and for the plain rivers it was 8 11 years and 3 the main cause of this lag was the heavy exploitation of groundwater in the basin which led to increased water volume from interbasin water transfers mainly to supplement groundwater resources while surface water resources could not be quickly and sufficiently supplemented to restore them to the original natural discharge our research not only unmasks the changes of small and medium sized river discharge in areas strongly affected by human activities but also helps people to better understand the response of small and medium sized river discharges to the complex environmental changes incurred by climate change and serious human activities keywords river discharge recovery lag small and medium sized rivers remote sensing hydrological station climate change human activities data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is an important substance and energy cycle process in the earth system that is affected by many factors among these factors climate change and human activities are the two most significant factors liu et al 2019 climate change and human activities have jointly promoted global change on various spatial scales affecting precipitation and evaporation in basins and thus affecting water cycle processes runoff and regional water balances piao et al 2010 yang et al 2016 in recent years the rapid growth of population and increasing water demand have posed severe challenges to water resources many countries are facing increasingly serious water resource shortages in 2020 3 6 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation services 2 3 billion lacked basic sanitation services and more than 2 billion people lived in water stressed countries without access to safe drinking water 2021 state of climate services therefore decision and policy makers need to consider the consequences of climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle to achieve optimal water resource management we need to change the current situation by changing the impact of human activities and effective river restoration river restoration refers to measures such as changing the channel adjacent riparian and the input of substances in rivers wohl et al 2015 at present under the dual impacts of climate change and human activities people are mainly concerned about the changes in the response mechanism of large rivers especially the changes in the ecosystems and discharges of large rivers due to changes in human activities arias et al 2012 chapman et al 2016 ranasinghe et al 2019 for example from 1962 to 1971 u s army corps of engineers diverted water from the kissimme river since 1992 more than 70 km of the kissimme river has been restored to a winding river which not only restored the flow but also doubled the dissolved oxygen concentration in the river with significant ecological benefits colangelo 2014 koebel et al 2014 some researchers have also searched for the response mechanism of dammed rivers by manipulating the discharges of dams to achieve the goals of downstream ecosystems grill et al 2015 researchers have adopted many methods to study the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes on a large watershed scale including hydrological modeling wang et al 2013 climate elasticity yang and yang 2011 zheng et al 2009 budyko coupling elasticity liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b and its decomposition method sun et al 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 hydrological sensitivity method guo et al 2014 zuo et al 2014 tomer schilling framework method tomer and schilling 2009 ye et al 2013 time trend method zhang et al 2012 and paired catchment method bart and hope 2010 zégre et al 2010 in addition the modified double mass curve mdmc wei and zhang 2010 and improved double mass curve idmc aryal and zhu 2020 have been used in several studies because they have the advantages of not requiring long term hydrological and climate records or detailed hydrological properties of the watershed wei et al 2013 however the impacts of climate change and human activities have been less studied at the small and medium sized river scales when a river s control basin is less than 200 km² it is defined as a small to medium sized river the water ecological environment is closely related to small and medium sized rivers variations in the discharges of small and medium sized rivers can directly affect their coastal ecosystems comiti et al 2009 kenney et al 2012 at the same time small and medium sized rivers are widely distributed and the total discharge of those cannot be ignored which plays a very important role in agricultural irrigation along riverbanks meanwhile the water in a river can play a role in soil and water conservation and coordinate the sustainable development of the water ecological environment lorenz et al 2009 sufficient long time series discharge is the premise of these studies but in small and medium sized rivers these data are very scarce fu et al 2019 methods used to obtain water resource data mainly include traditional hydrological stations hydrological models and remote sensing technology however the total number of hydrological stations in the world has been greatly reduced due to the insufficient supply of funds and shortages of maintenance management personnel calmant and seyler 2006 in the 1980s approximately 2000 hydrological stations around the world were closed hannah et al 2011 from 1995 to 2000 the number of hydrological stations reporting discharge data to the wmo global runoff data center decreased by 90 conway et al 2009 for the above reasons measured long term discharge data of some rivers especially small and medium sized rivers are very scarce and hydrological research is seriously limited hydrological models can improve the spatial coverage of river discharge information commonly used hydrological models include empirical hydrological models refsgaard et al 2010 conceptual hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 and distributed semidistributed hydrological models zhang et al 2013a these models rely on measured data from hydrological stations and model parameters are difficult to obtain especially in areas without data currently remote sensing technology has many applications in river discharge monitoring due to its advantages such as fast data acquisition rich data resources and traceability of historical information bishop et al 2011 heiden et al 2007 zarco tejada et al 2005 due to spatial resolution limitations satellite remote sensing technology is still insufficient in the direct or indirect data collection of small and medium sized rivers garambois and monnier 2015 shi et al 2020 in contrast low altitude uav remote sensing can be used to quickly acquire high resolution remote sensing data without time limits and is easy to operate kerr and purkis 2018 zhao et al 2017 combined high resolution uavs with ground monitoring to fit the shape of river cross sections to measure the discharge of small rivers lewin and gibbard 2010 used high precision terrain data obtained by uavs to inspect river terraces to analyze the evolutionary process of river channels in other words compared with satellite remote sensing uavs have more value and reliability in discharge estimation in 2019 yang et al 2019a 2019b proposed an effective river discharge calculation method remote sensing hydrological station rshs technology based on domestic and foreign remote sensing discharge estimation methods this method uses the high accuracy and accessibility of uav data to combine uav data with classical hydrological formulas to estimate river discharge in areas lacking data in this study we combined rshs technology with high resolution satellite remote sensing images to analyze the response mechanism of small and medium sized river discharges under the influence of climate change and human activities and proposed a hypothesis in which a river discharge recovery lag exists three steps were carried out 1 using uavs to obtain the cross section image data of small and medium sized rivers establish a three dimensional digital river model and coupling uav data with high resolution remote sensing data to obtain long time series monthly scale river discharge data 2 exploring the lag time and specific impact behind the response of small and medium sized rivers to climate change and human activities and 3 determining the impacts of river discharge response lag on water resources and water ecology in a basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb 112 120 e 35 43 n was selected because it is a heavily economically developed region and is affected by climate change as well as serious human activities bao et al 2012 the mongolian plateau yellow river and bohai sea are the northern southwestern and eastern boundaries respectively fig 1 accounting for 3 3 of the national total the area of the hrb is 317 800 km2 60 and 40 of which are mountains in the western and northern parts and plains in the eastern and southern parts respectively the hrb has a semihumid to semiarid climate and is located in the continental monsoon climate region liu and wei 1989 the annual average temperature is 10 60 c and the annual average precipitation is approximately 508 05 mm 2000 2020 precipitation in the past 120 years in the basin has changed during different stages during the third period between 1989 and 2020 studies have shown that the annual precipitation in the hrb increased significantly with an upward trend of 11 82 mm 10a and varied most significantly in summer and autumn chen et al 2022 in regard to seasonal precipitation changes in the third period the climate pattern of the hrb changed due to the influence of climate change and human activities together with changes in the underlying surface and the stability of seasonal precipitation changed the probability of seasonal disasters in the hrb with precipitation in summer and autumn as the main source of precipitation is significantly higher than before yu et al 2014 huang et al 2019 since the 1980 s the population in the hrb has continuously increased zhu 2007 the urban population increased from 22 89 million in 1980 to 87 23 million in 2010 the urbanization rate increased from 24 in 1980 to 53 7 in 2010 an increase of 29 7 the average total water resources in the hrb over many years is 37 2 billion m3 and the per capita water resources in the basin are approximately 305 m3 at the same time the areas of cultivated land and grain production in the hrb continued to increase in 2010 the total grain output was 57 86 million tons accounting for 10 of the national total which consumes much irrigation water to alleviate the serious shortages of water resources the country has conducted interbasin water transfers through measures such as diverting water from the yellow river and south to north water diversion in the past 20 years liu et al 2021 among them the east line of the south to north water diversion project was opened in may 2013 and the middle line was opened in december 2014 the total water delivery volume can reach 100 241 billion m3 effectively reducing the overuse of surface water and groundwater resources fu and yang 2019 to obtain discharge data from small and medium sized rivers in the hrb 16 sections of small and medium sized rivers in the hrb were examined considering the differences between rivers in mountain areas and plain areas we chose 5 representative sections in mountain areas and 11 representative sections in plain areas where in situ experiments including uav flights hydraulic parameter measurements and depth surveys were carried out to characterize variations in small and medium sized river discharge in the hrb 2 2 methods 2 2 1 remote sensing hydrological station technology in this study we used the rshs lou et al 2020 lou et al 2022 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b yang et al 2020 technique to calculate the river discharges of the 16 river sections the establishment of an rshs mainly includes the following four steps construction of a digital river section model calculation of water surface width in long term series calculation of river discharge in long term series and evaluation of river discharge accuracy fig 2 1 construction of a digital river section model the topographic information of the river can be accurately extracted by digitizing the natural river the uav is used to obtain high resolution and low altitude remote sensing data around the river that are then combined with the local measured water depth and velocity data to construct a digital river model through the generated digital river section model we can obtain the wet perimeter and river cross section corresponding to any water surface width and then use the manning formula to calculate the flow velocity the digital river section model is corrected by the measured flow velocity of the day and the river discharge is calculated by the long term series of water surface width data 2 calculation of water surface width in long term series taking advantage of the normalized difference water index ndwi in identifiable water bodies the historical remote sensing data from satellite and subpixel decomposition methods are used to calculate the water surface width of long term series to avoid the error caused by the width of the water surface of a single section we choose the straight channel where the section is located with basically the same hydraulic parameters after calculating the water surface width of this section of the channel it is divided by the length of the channel to obtain the average water surface width to replace the water surface width of the section the specific method is to process the remote sensing data of sentinel 2 and landsat series through google earth engine to obtain monthly scale ndwi data extract the monthly water surface area within a certain length of river reach and use the ratio of the water surface area to the length of the river reach to obtain the monthly water surface area the average water surface width is expressed as follows 1 w a water l w a t e r where w is the average water width of the river section a water is the water surface area of the river section and l water is the length of the river section 3 calculation of river discharge in long term series since the shape and topography of the river channel in the selected section do not change much it can be considered that there is a one to one correspondence between the river water width and the discharge wang et al 2020 according to the obtained long term water surface width combined with the digital river section model the water depth water level area of river cross section wet perimeter and hydraulic radius corresponding to the water surface width are calculated and then the flow velocity is calculated according to the manning formula yang et al 2019a 2019b yin et al 2020 the river discharge calculation uses the slope area method as an important formula for river discharge calculation in hydraulics huang et al 2018 the slope area method has been widely used in many studies to calculate discharge in open channels or natural channels with stable flow rates lefavour and alsdorf 2005 sichangi et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the formulas mentioned are as follows 2 v k n r 2 3 j 1 2 3 r a l 4 q v a where v is the velocity m s a is the area of the river cross section m2 which is determined by the water depth and the water surface width q is the river discharge m3 s k is a conversion factor m1 3 s regarded as 1 in this study n is the roughness coefficient l is the wet perimeter r is the hydraulic radius and j is the hydraulic gradient the roughness and hydraulic gradient corresponding to each rshs are shown in the table 1 4 evaluation of river discharge accuracy 5 rmse q c q m n 2 6 nse 1 t 1 t q m t q c t 2 t 1 t q m t q m 2 where qm is the in situ discharge qc is the estimated discharge q m denotes the mean value of the in situ discharge t is the number of simulation calculations and n represents the total number of observations the nse varies from to 1 and 1 indicates the optimal status in which the simulated discharge equals the in situ measurements 2 2 2 lag calculation method to explore the lag of small and medium river discharge to climate change and human water resource management activities this study proposes a method to quantify the lag time the factors affecting river discharge such as temperature precipitation and human activities are regarded as independent variables these factors are all time varying variables the river discharge is regarded as the dependent variable and the formulas are as follows 7 x 1 f 1 t 8 x 2 f 2 t 9 x n f n t 10 y f x 1 x 2 x n where t refers to the time and x1 x2 xn are the factors affecting river discharge such as temperature precipitation land use cover change lucc interbasin water transfer project and efficient water resource policies y refers to the river discharge differentials are taken on both sides of the formula 11 dy dt df d x 1 d x 1 dt df d x 2 d x 2 dt df d x n d x n dt the changing trend of the dependent variable and the independent variable is not a single linear relationship we can infer that when the second derivative of y river discharge is equal to 0 the corresponding t is not necessarily the same as the corresponding t when the second derivative of x1 temperature x2 precipitation or xn so on is equal to 0 therefore we define the lag time as the difference between the t corresponding to the second derivative of the dependent variable equal to 0 and the maximum value of t corresponding to the second derivative of the respective dependent variable equal to 0 the formula is as follows 12 l a g t i m e t f m a x t 1 t 2 t n where lag time is the river discharge response lag time t f refers to the value of t when the second derivative of f equals 0 and t n refers to the value of t when the second derivative of xn equals 0 since the specific forms of the function are uncertain we use abrupt detection in mk detection to determine the t value in the following section the independent variables we consider are mainly summarized as climate change and human activities in this study the independent variables we consider in terms of climate change are temperature and precipitation and in terms of human activities we consider the amount of diverted water across river basins the lag calculation method is as follows fig 3 step 1 mann kendall s test is used to identify abrupt points in the trends of independent variables climate change and human activities step 2 mann kendall s test is used to identify abrupt points in the trend of dependent variables river discharge step 3 the lag time is calculated 2 2 3 mann kendall s test mann kendall s test does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and the lack of some data will not affect the results it is not disturbed by a few outliers and has strong applicability blahusiakova and matouskova 2015 the nonparametric mann kendall test was used to detect the trends and abrupt points of river discharge precipitation and air temperature in small and medium sized rivers in the hrb a hypothesis test based on the mann kendall s statistic ufi for a significance level of a was applied to all variables the following test was performed to prove or disprove an assumption that is was there any statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend for the variables the test statistic is calculated by the following formula jianyun et al 2007 13 u f i s i e s i var s i 14 s k i 1 k r i 15 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j where xi is the variable which is an independent and identically distributed random variable with a sample of n the expected value e sk and variance var sk can be estimated as follows 16 e s i i i 1 4 17 var s i i i 1 2 i 5 72 the null hypothesis h0 indicates that ufi is not statistically significant that is no significant warming cooling or wetting drying trend is accepted if u f i u α 2 where u α 2 is the standard normal deviation alternatively it is accepted that h1 that is ufi is statistically significant if u f i u α 2 a positive ufi value denotes a positive trend and a negative ufi value denotes a negative trend then according to the inverse time series xn xn 1 x1 ufi can be calculated again by the definition of ubi ufi i n n 1 1 the curve of ufi and ubi could be plotted if there is a match point between the two curves and the trend of the series is statistically significant the match point is regarded as the breaking point of the series 2 2 4 linear regression model a linear regression model can be used to fit the changing trend of long term series data we used the linear regression model to fit the variation trends of the average annual discharge precipitation and temperature of 16 rivers in the past 20 years quantified the degree of variation and combined the mk test to determine the trend change up or down the use of linear regression models was carried out in originpro 2021 software https www originlab com doc en origin help lr algorithm the algorithm is as follows for a given dataset x i y i i 1 2 n where is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable β 0 and β 1 are parameters and ε i is a random error term with mean e ε i 0 and variance v a r ε i σ 2 linear regression fits the data to a model of the following form 18 y i β 0 β 1 x i ε i the least squares estimation is used to minimize the sum of the n squared deviations 19 i 1 n y i β 0 β 1 x i 2 the estimated parameters of the linear model can be computed as 20 β 1 sxy sxx 21 β 0 y β 1 x where 22 x 1 n i 1 n x i y 1 n i 1 n y i 23 sxy i 1 n x i y i s x x i 1 n x i 2 u n c o r r e c t e d 24 sxy i 1 n x i x y i y s x x i 1 n x i x 2 c o r r e c t e d therefore we estimate the regression function as follows 25 y β 0 β 1 x 2 3 data in this study four kinds of satellite images and uav images were used as data sources and combined with the hydraulic parameters of field observations a three dimensional digital river section model was established to obtain long term river discharge data using a dji mavic air 2 uav high definition camera and gps positioning high spatial resolution 5 5 cm images were collected on 16 medium and small sized river sections in the hrb with the help of the professional uav image processing software pix4d we could obtain high precision images based on image synthesis aerial triangulation point cloud encryption spatial information calibration and generate centimeter level digital surface models dsms and digital orthophotos doms to construct a digital river section model we collected elevation information from dsms to invert overwater and underwater topography simultaneously open and free satellite imagery including sentinel 2 st2 landsat 8 ls8 landsat 7 ls7 and landsat5 ls5 series of images were utilized as a data source to identify the width of the river water body at a monthly scale from 2000 to 2020 google earth engine gee https earthengine google com was used to quickly complete image projection image stitching and cutting on the cloud platform and the green light band and near infrared light band were used to calculate the ndwi to improve the extraction accuracy of the river width from landsat data and solve the problem of spatial scale in consistency between sentinel 2 and landsat data the statistical regression downscaling method was adopted in this study wu and liu 2015 in addition the flow velocity and water depth of each section were measured on site the flow velocity was measured with an ls300 a rotameter and calculated by the three point method which was taken as the average flow velocity of each section the water depth was measured by a deeper sonar detector the average water depth of multiple points was combined with the dsm river elevation information obtained by the uav to simulate the distribution and cross sectional area of the river discharge and multiplied by the actual flow rate to obtain the river discharge there were 35 meteorological stations in the study area and the locations are shown in fig 1 temperature and precipitation data were used to analyze the variation trend and significance of temperature and precipitation in the hrb over the past 20 years table 2 summarizes these datasets 3 results 3 1 section information and validation of the rshs to investigate the response of small and medium sized river discharge to climate change and human activities experiments were conducted in 16 areas of the hrb we determined the survey sections in the 16 areas obtained dem and dom data by using an uav and established 16 rshss by measuring hydraulic parameters such as water depth river width and flow velocity of the section among them 5 sections were located in mountain areas namely zf xj sxl sjd and yc the remaining 11 sections were located in the plain area namely qm bzs xx xxz mz hsw hhz ddw lq gt and bhd among them the rivers in the plains are more affected by human activities than the rivers in the mountain areas the locations of these rshss and the corresponding digital river section models and landscapes are shown in fig 4 we evaluated the estimation accuracy of the river discharge data and conducted a correlation analysis between the 2017 monthly average discharge at the sxl station retrieved by the rshs and the 2017 monthly average discharge measured by the sxl hydrological station the linear relationship between the two was significant fig 5 where r2 0 93 and the overall simulation accuracy was evaluated where the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was 0 86 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 50 m3 s which indicates that the rshs method is suitable for small and medium sized rivers in the hrb in november 2017 the water transfer from the cetian reservoir to the guanting reservoir passed through this section therefore the average discharge in that month was much larger than that in other months to eliminate the influence of this point on the linear relationship fitting and accuracy evaluation the simulation and measured data in november 2017 were removed for accuracy verification where r2 0 63 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was 0 65 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 37 m3 s the accuracy of the rshs method is within an acceptable range and is suitable for this area 3 2 temporal and spatial variation in discharge in small and medium sized rivers over 20 years through the establishment of the rshs the monthly scale discharge hydrographs from 16 small and medium sized rivers in the hrb in the last 20 years were calculated among them the discharge of the gt station was only calculated until july 2018 because afterward the government conducted water conservancy projects and built cofferdams upstream the 16 river long team discharge linear fitting trends were obtained fig 6 the trend of the annual average discharge of these rivers in the last 20 years was tested by the mk trend test method the discharge of small and medium sized rivers in the hrb generally had a downward trend xu et al 2020 han and zhang 2021 from the trend analysis the figure shows that the annual average discharge of 6 river sections in the hrb had an upward trend of which 3 were statistically significant at the level of α 0 1 which were the m xj m yc and m sjd sites the prefix m indicates that the river section is in the mountain area and the z values were 3 59 3 53 and 2 92 respectively the annual average discharge of the remaining 10 sections showed a downward trend of which the p xxz and p mz sites the prefix p indicates that the river section is in the plain area were running dry in 2013 and 2005 respectively which was statistically significant at the level of α 0 1 and the z values were 4 16 and 2 32 respectively liu and du 2017 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 3 3 detecting the abrupt points of the discharge and its difference between the early period and late period the mk test was used to identify the abrupt points of the annual average discharge of 14 rshss the p mz and p xxz sites were not tested because they started drying up in 2013 and 2005 we think there was no sudden change before 2020 as shown in fig 7 the abrupt points of these 14 stations were within the range from 2011 to 2019 in terms of time distribution only 3 of the 14 sites had abrupt times between 2011 and 2014 namely m sxl m yc and m xj of which m sxl s abrupt time was 2011 m yc s abrupt time was 2012 and m xj s abrupt time was 2014 the abrupt time of the remaining 11 stations was between 2015 and 2019 and the abrupt points of m gt and m sjd occurred in 2015 in 2016 there were 3 sites with abrupt points namely p hsw p hhz and p lq from 2017 to 2019 a total of 6 abrupt changes occurred namely m zf p bhd p bzs p xx p ddw and p qm the abrupt times of p ddw and p qm were the latest and both occurred in 2019 comparing the mean value of the annual average discharge before and after the abrupt time it can be seen that the mean value of the 14 stations annual discharge after the abrupt time was greater than before among them the annual average discharge at the m yc and m zf stations increased significantly by 47 16 and 44 79 respectively at the same time the annual average discharge at the m sjd m sxl m xj p lq and p qm stations also increased significantly by 28 93 15 62 17 96 14 43 and 14 98 respectively in contrast the annual average discharge of p bzs p xx p hsw and p hhz increased by 2 81 2 79 5 05 and 6 30 respectively it can be concluded that the annual average discharge of these rivers increased after the sudden change which was mainly due to the increase in rainfall in the hrb in the last 20 years and the reduction in human use of surface water resources in recent years bao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 3 4 variations and abrupt points of key natural factors and human activities natural factors which include precipitation and temperature exhibited abrupt points the time series of precipitation in the hrb from 2000 to 2019 is shown in fig 8 a precipitation in the hrb had an upward trend over the past 20 years and the linear fitting trend was 3 09 mm a the maximum value of annual average precipitation in this period occurred in 2016 which was 614 2 mm and the minimum value was 400 4 mm which occurred in 2002 the results of the m k test showed that the precipitation in the hrb had an insignificant downward trend before 2004 and then after a period of fluctuation there was a sudden change in the trend in 2008 and an upward trend after 2008 bao et al 2014 hao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the time series of temperature in the hrb from 2000 to 2019 is shown in fig 8 b the temperature in the hrb had a slight upward trend in fluctuation in the past 20 years and the linear fitting trend was 0 017 c a the results of the m k test showed that the temperature in the hrb fluctuated in the first 15 years without an obvious abrupt point however the abrupt time of the trend occurred in 2015 and then had an upward trend from the results the temperature increase in the hrb was not significant han et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 compared with the impact of the increase in precipitation over the last 20 years on river discharge the impact of temperature on river discharge can be ignored in regard to human activities water supply was an important factor affecting river discharge annual water supply data in the hrb were compiled from the haihe river resources bulletin and the results are shown in fig 9 in the past 20 years the proportion of surface water supply and groundwater supply had an obvious downward trend as the total water supply decreased slightly the resulting water supply shortage was mainly supplemented by interbasin water transfer and other water sources during this period the surface water supply decreased from 13 66 1010 m3 to 8 30 1010 m3 decreasing by 39 27 and the groundwater supply decreased from 26 30 1010 m3 to 14 70 1010 m3 decreasing by 43 80 while the interbasin water transfer increased from 0 to 109 74 1010 m3 variations in human activities such as water supply also had abrupt points the whole water supply structure changed suddenly in 2003 since 2003 the surface water supply decreased by 39 30 compared with the previous year at the same time the required water supply was supplemented by interbasin water transfers in 2000 the water supply of the hrb was mainly composed of the surface water supply and groundwater supply accounting for 34 1 and 65 6 respectively no interbasin water transfer measures were taken by 2003 the water supply proportions of the surface water source groundwater source interbasin water transfer and other water sources were 20 6 69 3 9 6 and 0 5 respectively which began to change significantly by 2020 the proportions of surface water sources groundwater sources interbasin water transfers and other water sources reached 22 3 39 7 29 5 and 8 5 respectively we can see that under the background of the increasing shortage of sea and river water resources human beings have made significant changes in water intake since 2003 mainly by reducing the water supply from surface water sources and groundwater sources in the basin and increasing interbasin water transfers to supplement water consumption by people 3 5 lag of discharge response in small and medium rivers since 2003 people have attempted to improve the shortage of water resources in the hrb from the aspect of water intake and to increase the discharge in the river channel through eco environmental water replenishment haihe river basin water resources bulletin from 2000 to 2020 at the same time the variation trend of precipitation in the hrb had a sudden change in 2008 and showed an upward trend after this sudden change these scenarios had a positive impact on the river discharge but it can be seen from the conclusions in section 3 2 that after the increase in precipitation in the hrb in 2008 the discharge trend of small rivers in the hrb did not change immediately instead there was a lag as shown in fig 10 the year of sudden change in the trend of small and medium sized rivers was later than 2008 which lagged by 3 11 years the m sxl station had a sudden change in the discharge trend only after 3 years while the p ddw and p lq stations started responding after 11 years the response of small and medium sized rivers in the haihe mountain area was generally faster than that in the plain area the lag year of stations in the haihe mountain area was 3 9 years while that in the plain area was 8 11 years among the points in mountain areas m sxl had the fastest response with a lag year of 3 years followed by m yc with a lag year of 4 years while the lag time of m xj m gt and m sjd was relatively long with m xj being 6 years and m gt and m sjd being 7 years at the same time the lag time of m zf in mountain areas was the longest at 9 years in the plain area the stations with long response times were mainly concentrated in the central area except for the two points that have been drought the lag time of p hsw p hhz and p qm was 8 years that of p bzs was 9 years that of p bhd and p xx was 10 years and that of p ddw and p lq was the longest both of which were 11 years there was a spatial difference in the lag time of the river discharge response which was mainly due to the uneven spatial distribution of human water intake and ecological environmental water replenishment 4 discussion 4 1 why does the discharge response of small and medium rivers lag because there was a lag there was no immediate increase but there was a trend of increasing after several years in the response of small and medium sized river discharge to climate change and human activities fig 10 the main reason for the lag was the excessive exploitation of groundwater in the hrb according to statistics during the period from 2000 to 2010 the amount of groundwater supply far exceeded the amount of groundwater resources by the end of 2011 the excess water was 424 58 billion m3 haihe river basin water resources bulletin from 2000 to 2011 in 10 of the 11 years groundwater consumption was greater than groundwater resources this resulted in most of the increased water volume caused by increased precipitation and human interbasin water transfer being added to the groundwater source which reduced the part of the supplemented surface runoff and increased the amount of groundwater resources lv et al 2012 fu and yang 2019 the amount of water supplemented to surface water resources in the early stage was not enough to offset the impact of human overextraction there was a lag in the response of river discharge over the past 60 years the hrb has faced severe water shortages and related environmental problems and the per capita water resources are only 305 m3 which is equivalent to 1 7 of the chinese average and 1 27 of the world average han and zhang 2021 yang et al 2022 in this context to meet the needs of social and economic development the groundwater in the hrb has been overexploited su et al 2020 chen et al 2021 at the end of the 1990s the groundwater level decreased at a rate of 1 m yr making it one of the most depleted aquifers in the world the period from 2003 to 2014 was divided into water diversion phase i and the average annual water transfer during this period was 4 18 1010 m3 after 2015 it was divided into snwd phase ii and the average annual water transfer during this period was 8 34 1010 m3 haihe river basin water resources bulletin fig 11 the average annual water transfer volume of phase ii doubled compared to that of phase i we think that the measure of interbasin water transfer has been implemented since 2003 and at the end of 2014 the south to north water transfer project began to significantly increase the amount of water transfer to supplement groundwater and surface water sources in fact a combination of water use reduction and diversion can slow or even reverse groundwater depletion in the basin and increase runoff in the basin although this takes a certain amount of time 3 11 years indicating that human intervention can affect the availability of water resources and that persistence has a positive impact afshar et al 2020 chaussard et al 2017 water diversion projects have been used to divert water to the hrb as a substitute for local water resources reducing the use of water extracted from surface and groundwater sources to meet the growing water demand part of the diverted water is used for domestic and industrial use due to the high cost of interbasin water transfer and the quality of water that can meet drinking water standards fu and yang 2019 in addition irrigation water is mainly provided through groundwater abstraction which has been reduced in recent years through improved cropping regimes and water saving measures such as drip and microsprinkler irrigation techniques fang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2007 due to the increase in population the proportion of domestic water and industrial water in the total water consumption will increase in the future in the future water transfer will be mainly used for domestic water and industrial water which will help alleviate the increasing water pressure and stabilize groundwater on the plains of the hrb yang et al 2022 resources are very important and the excess water during the flood season in the water transfer project is used to supplement arid rivers and lakes and increase the surface water resources in the basin the difference in river discharge response lag time between the haihe mountain area and plain area is mainly caused by the variation in water intake caused by population density areas with large population densities have more water intake and the groundwater deficit is more serious su et al 2020 chen et al 2021 areas with small population densities have less water intake and the groundwater deficit is lower as interbasin water transfers started in 2003 to supplement the haihe river water resources and hrb precipitation showed an upward trend in 2008 the annual average discharge trend of the six medium and small sized rivers in the mountain area had a sudden change from 2011 to 2017 and the mean value after the sudden change was significantly higher than that before the sudden change the annual average discharge of 8 small and medium sized rivers in the plain area showed a sudden change from 2016 to 2019 and the mean value after the sudden change increased significantly compared with that before the sudden change there are still 2 rivers in the setting off state and it can be considered that their annual average discharge has not changed suddenly and has not yet responded to climate change and human activities the discharge response time of rivers in mountain areas mainly occurred before 2015 and that of rivers in plain areas mainly occurred after 2015 before the south to north water transfer project was connected i e in phase i the water transfer project mainly relied on the yellow river and luanhe river to supplement the groundwater and surface water sources in the hrb with an average annual water transfer volume of 4 18 1010 m3 at the same time the annual average ecological water replenishment during this period was 0 87 1010 m3 after distribution this amount of water transfer and make up volume was sufficient to supplement the river discharge in the haihe mountain area where the population density is small the water intake is small and groundwater exploitation is not serious however in areas where the population density is large the water intake is large and groundwater exploitation is serious zhang et al 2022 after the middle route of the south to north water transfer project was opened at the end of 2014 i e phase ii the water transfer project mainly supplemented the groundwater source and surface water source of the hrb by diverting water from the danjiangkou reservoir with an average annual water transfer volume of 8 34 1010 m3 the annual average ecological water replenishment during this period was 4 03 1010 m3 compared with phase i the annual average water volume of phase ii increased by 4 16 1010 m3 and the annual average ecological water replenishment increased by 3 16 1010 m3 this part of the water was used to supplement the groundwater and surface water sources which led to an overall upward trend of the groundwater level in the plain area of the hrb long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 and the surface water source was supplemented at the same time as the groundwater source as a result most of the annual average discharge trends of small and medium sized rivers in the plain area suddenly changed from 2016 to 2019 and the mean value after the sudden change was significantly higher than that before the abrupt change 4 2 key factors affecting river discharge recovery lag time the population increase as well its spatial distribution and lucc are the two main reasons for the lag response of small and medium sized rivers in this region there is a large difference in population density between the haihe mountain area and plain area which is the main reason for the difference in river response lag years between the mountain area and plain area in fact the main driving factor of river discharge reduction in the hrb in the past 50 years has been human activities yang and tian 2009 the population density in mountain areas has increased from 172 cap km2 in the past 20 years to 197 cap km2 an increase of 14 53 fig 12 the population density in the plain area increased from 767 cap km2 to 988 cap km2 an increase of 28 81 the population density in plain areas is 4 5 times that in mountain areas and the growth rate is much higher than that in mountain areas the maximum and minimum observed values upper and lower quartiles and median response lag years of each station in mountain areas are smaller than those in plain areas the impact of population density on surface water resources is mainly reflected in water intake wan et al 2020 water intake directly changes the river discharge population growth and social development may be the main reasons for increasing agricultural industrial and domestic water use thus reducing the total discharge taking 2010 as an example its irrigation industrial and domestic water consumption was 24 75 billion m3 5 18 billion m3 and 5 92 billion m3 respectively the precipitation in that year was 533 60 mm and the surface water resources were only 14 90 billion m3 the water use in the whole hrb seriously exceeds the standard among which irrigation water accounts for the largest proportion reflecting the water use situation in the region to a certain extent variations in grassland and forest land use types in the haihe mountain area and cultivated land in the plain area are also the reasons for the difference in river response lag years between the mountain area and plain area the type of land use in mountain areas dominated by forest and grassland causes the regional water consumption to be mainly evapotranspiration and surface water resources and basically does not consume groundwater resources however for the land use type in the plain area dominated by cultivated land due to the shortage of surface water resources the wide area of cultivated land and large water consumption irrigation needs to be carried out by exploiting groundwater resources li et al 2020 fu et al 2020 part of the irrigation water is consumed by crops part of it infiltrates into the soil and part of it is transmitted to the atmosphere in the form of evaporation the water consumed is mainly from groundwater resources zhang et al 2022 as shown in fig 13 from 2000 to 2015 more than 85 of the area in the haihe mountain area was forestland and grassland while more than 90 of the area in the plain area was cultivated land yang et al 2021 in fact at the watershed scale different types of land use have a significant impact on surface water resources land use first changes soil conditions soil erosion and biodiversity and then changes the underlying surface thus affecting runoff production the impact of lucc on water resources is mainly reflected in two aspects evapotranspiration and infiltration of different land cover which has a significant impact on surface water resources and groundwater resources yang et al 2014 the increase in vegetation coverage promotes the interception of the forest canopy and the development of vegetation roots also increases the regulation and water storage capacity of soil sun et al 2020 all these factors extend the duration of the rainfall runoff process reduce the peak runoff and increase the base flow in the dry season at the same time the actual evapotranspiration of cultivated land is higher than that of grassland due to the high density deep root system and large vegetation coverage in addition forest vegetation covers a large area which is closely related to the atmosphere and increases the evapotranspiration of the watershed the cultivated land in the plain area mainly affects the runoff from may to august and the lai changes significantly from may to august on the other hand the evapotranspiration of farmland especially the corn wheat rotation farming system widely in practice in the southern part of the basin is much higher than the annual precipitation especially in the growth of farmland in july and august the lai of farmland is greater than that of woodland and grassland and the water storage capacity of farmland increases during this period groundwater exploitation is greater than that of other periods which has a serious impact on groundwater resources wu et al 2014 4 3 influences of river discharge recovery lag on watershed ecosystems due to the shortage of water resources and the heavy exploitation of groundwater in the hrb the response of small and medium sized rivers to flow changes lags under the background of increased precipitation and human interbasin water transfer the discharge in rivers does not increase immediately but starts to increase after 3 11 years this reflects the fact that in a basin with overdeveloped water resources measures such as interbasin water transfer and ecological water replenishment can change the trend of river discharge reduction in the basin but the river discharge reduction will continue for several years in fact the water in rivers is very important for human survival and is the core part of the biosphere it maintains the biodiversity of rivers and land the water ecological environment and rivers represent the relationship between the whole and the individual changes in river discharge can directly affect riverbank ecosystems comiti et al 2009 kenney et al 2012 the decreasing river discharge leads to the continuous degradation of the river ecosystem some once healthy rivers with rich biodiversity only have drought and pollution resistant species due to the reduction in discharge for a long time discharge changes have been considered a key driver of changes in river structure and function affecting the behavior and morphology of a series of aquatic and riparian organisms bunn and arthington 2002 fausch et al 2001 for example the extremely low discharge caused by excessive water intake increases the water temperature and pollutant concentration beyond the allowable level for biological survival or reproduction the degradation of river ecosystems may be related to a variety of complex mechanisms given the scale of river degradation around the world it generally takes ten years for ecosystems to recover due to the lag of the river response this time may be extended again as shown in fig 14 there are four landscape maps which represent m sxl m xj p bhd and p xxz there are four partial enlargements in each map to help identify the shore area the vegetation coverage along the bank is divided into three categories by visual interpretation high coverage middle coverage and low coverage of grassland vegetation when the coverage of grassland vegetation in the square area extracted from the bank of the corresponding river is less than 0 25 it is deemed low vegetation coverage when it is greater than 0 25 and less than 0 75 it is deemed medium vegetation coverage and when it is greater than 0 75 it deemed high vegetation coverage we discovered that the riverbank ecosystems of p bhd and p xxz have been completely degraded they are very desolate only covered by some weeds the two maps above are the landscape maps of stations m sxl and m xj the average annual discharge of these two rivers has increased in the past 20 years and there is no possibility of set off their river bank ecosystems remain good under field observations there are fish in the river channel and the grassland and vegetation along the bank are lush it is clear that the difference in lag time will directly affect the restoration and protection of riverbank ecosystems 4 4 limitations and challenges through field experiments and rshs technology we found that there is a lag time between the abrupt change in small and medium sized river discharge and the abrupt change in variables climate change and human activities that affect discharge therefore we propose that the discharge of small and medium sized rivers has an annual scale response mechanism to climate change and human activities however the response mechanism and method still need further research 1 quantitative studies of lag years are needed to separate the respective impacts of human activities and climate change by using other methods such as mdmc wei and zhang 2010 due to the small and medium sized rivers we studied the hydrological data collected by hydrological stations are lacking at the same time the river width is narrow when calculating the discharge and the image quality of the landsat 5 satellite was poor before 2000 therefore it is difficult to calculate the long term series discharge matching the meteorological data since 1956 therefore the long term relationship between discharge and climate cannot be established 2 a more detailed study of the impact of each variable on the lag years is needed not just generalized to climate change and human activities such as elevation elevation slope regional vegetation cover distance to large river streams etc 3 there may be a high degree of autocorrelation in annual river discharge data which affects the results of the mk test foroumandi et al 2021 foroumandi et al 2022 although rshs is reliable and effective this method still has some shortcomings for example the accuracy of river width extraction can be greatly affected due to the negative impact of cloud cover on the visible and near infrared bands of satellite remote sensing in addition limited by the spatial resolution of current satellite remote sensing data it is difficult to identify water bodies whose river width exceeds the highest observation accuracy of satellite remote sensing using satellite remote sensing data with higher spatial resolution is an effective way to solve this problem 5 conclusion in this study rshs technology uavs and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite remote sensing were used to retrieve the monthly discharge data of 16 small and medium sized river sections in the hrb over the last 20 years we found that 1 in the past 20 years the discharge of small and medium rivers in the hrb has decreased in the plain area and increased in the mountain area all discharges of 10 stations in the plain area of the hrb showed a downward trend and discharges of 6 stations in the mountain area showed an upward trend 2 under the background of the increase in precipitation interbasin water transfer and ecological environment replenishment to supply water resources the discharges of small and medium sized rivers did not increase immediately but there was a response lag period with a lag between 3 and 11 years rivers in mountain areas had a lag from 3 9 years and that in plain areas was slower with a lag of 8 11 years 3 compared with large rivers the increase in precipitation and active water resource management measures did not cause the discharge of small and medium sized rivers to quickly return to the original state demonstrating an obvious lag although the change in river discharge will take several years to occur the implementation of these measures is necessary and effective to restore the health of water resources in the basin this study affirms the role of water transfer projects and other measures in the restoration of water resources in basins with serious impacts from human activities under the background of global change and provides a new perspective on human efforts to change the current situation of water shortages credit authorship contribution statement hezhen lou conceptualization software methodology formal analysis writing review editing hao li data curation

2065,to cope with the negative impacts of climate change and human activities on water resources in basins positive measures such as interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource policies have been implemented worldwide and these measures have had an obvious effect on the discharges of large rivers however for small and medium sized rivers the impact is still unclear due to a deficiency in river discharge data to answer this question the haihe river basin hrb located in the core area of economic development in north china was selected as a typical research area remote sensing hydrological station technology which combines unmanned aerial vehicles uavs satellite remote sensing and in situ surveying was applied to obtain the monthly scale discharges of 16 small and medium sized river sections in the last 20 years 2000 2020 in addition an accuracy evaluation and spatiotemporal change analysis of the discharge results which were influenced by interbasin water transfer projects and efficient water resource management policies were also carried out the results show that 1 10 of the 16 river sections in the basin had a downward trend in the past 20 years with an average annual decrease of 2 13 and these sections were located in the plain areas the remaining 6 sections located in the mountain areas had an upward trend with an average annual increase of 1 72 2 we found that the river discharges of small and medium sized rivers recovered with a lag that reached 3 11 years for the 16 rivers and this lag for the mountain rivers was 3 9 years and for the plain rivers it was 8 11 years and 3 the main cause of this lag was the heavy exploitation of groundwater in the basin which led to increased water volume from interbasin water transfers mainly to supplement groundwater resources while surface water resources could not be quickly and sufficiently supplemented to restore them to the original natural discharge our research not only unmasks the changes of small and medium sized river discharge in areas strongly affected by human activities but also helps people to better understand the response of small and medium sized river discharges to the complex environmental changes incurred by climate change and serious human activities keywords river discharge recovery lag small and medium sized rivers remote sensing hydrological station climate change human activities data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is an important substance and energy cycle process in the earth system that is affected by many factors among these factors climate change and human activities are the two most significant factors liu et al 2019 climate change and human activities have jointly promoted global change on various spatial scales affecting precipitation and evaporation in basins and thus affecting water cycle processes runoff and regional water balances piao et al 2010 yang et al 2016 in recent years the rapid growth of population and increasing water demand have posed severe challenges to water resources many countries are facing increasingly serious water resource shortages in 2020 3 6 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation services 2 3 billion lacked basic sanitation services and more than 2 billion people lived in water stressed countries without access to safe drinking water 2021 state of climate services therefore decision and policy makers need to consider the consequences of climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle to achieve optimal water resource management we need to change the current situation by changing the impact of human activities and effective river restoration river restoration refers to measures such as changing the channel adjacent riparian and the input of substances in rivers wohl et al 2015 at present under the dual impacts of climate change and human activities people are mainly concerned about the changes in the response mechanism of large rivers especially the changes in the ecosystems and discharges of large rivers due to changes in human activities arias et al 2012 chapman et al 2016 ranasinghe et al 2019 for example from 1962 to 1971 u s army corps of engineers diverted water from the kissimme river since 1992 more than 70 km of the kissimme river has been restored to a winding river which not only restored the flow but also doubled the dissolved oxygen concentration in the river with significant ecological benefits colangelo 2014 koebel et al 2014 some researchers have also searched for the response mechanism of dammed rivers by manipulating the discharges of dams to achieve the goals of downstream ecosystems grill et al 2015 researchers have adopted many methods to study the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff changes on a large watershed scale including hydrological modeling wang et al 2013 climate elasticity yang and yang 2011 zheng et al 2009 budyko coupling elasticity liang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013b and its decomposition method sun et al 2014 wang and hejazi 2011 hydrological sensitivity method guo et al 2014 zuo et al 2014 tomer schilling framework method tomer and schilling 2009 ye et al 2013 time trend method zhang et al 2012 and paired catchment method bart and hope 2010 zégre et al 2010 in addition the modified double mass curve mdmc wei and zhang 2010 and improved double mass curve idmc aryal and zhu 2020 have been used in several studies because they have the advantages of not requiring long term hydrological and climate records or detailed hydrological properties of the watershed wei et al 2013 however the impacts of climate change and human activities have been less studied at the small and medium sized river scales when a river s control basin is less than 200 km² it is defined as a small to medium sized river the water ecological environment is closely related to small and medium sized rivers variations in the discharges of small and medium sized rivers can directly affect their coastal ecosystems comiti et al 2009 kenney et al 2012 at the same time small and medium sized rivers are widely distributed and the total discharge of those cannot be ignored which plays a very important role in agricultural irrigation along riverbanks meanwhile the water in a river can play a role in soil and water conservation and coordinate the sustainable development of the water ecological environment lorenz et al 2009 sufficient long time series discharge is the premise of these studies but in small and medium sized rivers these data are very scarce fu et al 2019 methods used to obtain water resource data mainly include traditional hydrological stations hydrological models and remote sensing technology however the total number of hydrological stations in the world has been greatly reduced due to the insufficient supply of funds and shortages of maintenance management personnel calmant and seyler 2006 in the 1980s approximately 2000 hydrological stations around the world were closed hannah et al 2011 from 1995 to 2000 the number of hydrological stations reporting discharge data to the wmo global runoff data center decreased by 90 conway et al 2009 for the above reasons measured long term discharge data of some rivers especially small and medium sized rivers are very scarce and hydrological research is seriously limited hydrological models can improve the spatial coverage of river discharge information commonly used hydrological models include empirical hydrological models refsgaard et al 2010 conceptual hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 and distributed semidistributed hydrological models zhang et al 2013a these models rely on measured data from hydrological stations and model parameters are difficult to obtain especially in areas without data currently remote sensing technology has many applications in river discharge monitoring due to its advantages such as fast data acquisition rich data resources and traceability of historical information bishop et al 2011 heiden et al 2007 zarco tejada et al 2005 due to spatial resolution limitations satellite remote sensing technology is still insufficient in the direct or indirect data collection of small and medium sized rivers garambois and monnier 2015 shi et al 2020 in contrast low altitude uav remote sensing can be used to quickly acquire high resolution remote sensing data without time limits and is easy to operate kerr and purkis 2018 zhao et al 2017 combined high resolution uavs with ground monitoring to fit the shape of river cross sections to measure the discharge of small rivers lewin and gibbard 2010 used high precision terrain data obtained by uavs to inspect river terraces to analyze the evolutionary process of river channels in other words compared with satellite remote sensing uavs have more value and reliability in discharge estimation in 2019 yang et al 2019a 2019b proposed an effective river discharge calculation method remote sensing hydrological station rshs technology based on domestic and foreign remote sensing discharge estimation methods this method uses the high accuracy and accessibility of uav data to combine uav data with classical hydrological formulas to estimate river discharge in areas lacking data in this study we combined rshs technology with high resolution satellite remote sensing images to analyze the response mechanism of small and medium sized river discharges under the influence of climate change and human activities and proposed a hypothesis in which a river discharge recovery lag exists three steps were carried out 1 using uavs to obtain the cross section image data of small and medium sized rivers establish a three dimensional digital river model and coupling uav data with high resolution remote sensing data to obtain long time series monthly scale river discharge data 2 exploring the lag time and specific impact behind the response of small and medium sized rivers to climate change and human activities and 3 determining the impacts of river discharge response lag on water resources and water ecology in a basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb 112 120 e 35 43 n was selected because it is a heavily economically developed region and is affected by climate change as well as serious human activities bao et al 2012 the mongolian plateau yellow river and bohai sea are the northern southwestern and eastern boundaries respectively fig 1 accounting for 3 3 of the national total the area of the hrb is 317 800 km2 60 and 40 of which are mountains in the western and northern parts and plains in the eastern and southern parts respectively the hrb has a semihumid to semiarid climate and is located in the continental monsoon climate region liu and wei 1989 the annual average temperature is 10 60 c and the annual average precipitation is approximately 508 05 mm 2000 2020 precipitation in the past 120 years in the basin has changed during different stages during the third period between 1989 and 2020 studies have shown that the annual precipitation in the hrb increased significantly with an upward trend of 11 82 mm 10a and varied most significantly in summer and autumn chen et al 2022 in regard to seasonal precipitation changes in the third period the climate pattern of the hrb changed due to the influence of climate change and human activities together with changes in the underlying surface and the stability of seasonal precipitation changed the probability of seasonal disasters in the hrb with precipitation in summer and autumn as the main source of precipitation is significantly higher than before yu et al 2014 huang et al 2019 since the 1980 s the population in the hrb has continuously increased zhu 2007 the urban population increased from 22 89 million in 1980 to 87 23 million in 2010 the urbanization rate increased from 24 in 1980 to 53 7 in 2010 an increase of 29 7 the average total water resources in the hrb over many years is 37 2 billion m3 and the per capita water resources in the basin are approximately 305 m3 at the same time the areas of cultivated land and grain production in the hrb continued to increase in 2010 the total grain output was 57 86 million tons accounting for 10 of the national total which consumes much irrigation water to alleviate the serious shortages of water resources the country has conducted interbasin water transfers through measures such as diverting water from the yellow river and south to north water diversion in the past 20 years liu et al 2021 among them the east line of the south to north water diversion project was opened in may 2013 and the middle line was opened in december 2014 the total water delivery volume can reach 100 241 billion m3 effectively reducing the overuse of surface water and groundwater resources fu and yang 2019 to obtain discharge data from small and medium sized rivers in the hrb 16 sections of small and medium sized rivers in the hrb were examined considering the differences between rivers in mountain areas and plain areas we chose 5 representative sections in mountain areas and 11 representative sections in plain areas where in situ experiments including uav flights hydraulic parameter measurements and depth surveys were carried out to characterize variations in small and medium sized river discharge in the hrb 2 2 methods 2 2 1 remote sensing hydrological station technology in this study we used the rshs lou et al 2020 lou et al 2022 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b yang et al 2020 technique to calculate the river discharges of the 16 river sections the establishment of an rshs mainly includes the following four steps construction of a digital river section model calculation of water surface width in long term series calculation of river discharge in long term series and evaluation of river discharge accuracy fig 2 1 construction of a digital river section model the topographic information of the river can be accurately extracted by digitizing the natural river the uav is used to obtain high resolution and low altitude remote sensing data around the river that are then combined with the local measured water depth and velocity data to construct a digital river model through the generated digital river section model we can obtain the wet perimeter and river cross section corresponding to any water surface width and then use the manning formula to calculate the flow velocity the digital river section model is corrected by the measured flow velocity of the day and the river discharge is calculated by the long term series of water surface width data 2 calculation of water surface width in long term series taking advantage of the normalized difference water index ndwi in identifiable water bodies the historical remote sensing data from satellite and subpixel decomposition methods are used to calculate the water surface width of long term series to avoid the error caused by the width of the water surface of a single section we choose the straight channel where the section is located with basically the same hydraulic parameters after calculating the water surface width of this section of the channel it is divided by the length of the channel to obtain the average water surface width to replace the water surface width of the section the specific method is to process the remote sensing data of sentinel 2 and landsat series through google earth engine to obtain monthly scale ndwi data extract the monthly water surface area within a certain length of river reach and use the ratio of the water surface area to the length of the river reach to obtain the monthly water surface area the average water surface width is expressed as follows 1 w a water l w a t e r where w is the average water width of the river section a water is the water surface area of the river section and l water is the length of the river section 3 calculation of river discharge in long term series since the shape and topography of the river channel in the selected section do not change much it can be considered that there is a one to one correspondence between the river water width and the discharge wang et al 2020 according to the obtained long term water surface width combined with the digital river section model the water depth water level area of river cross section wet perimeter and hydraulic radius corresponding to the water surface width are calculated and then the flow velocity is calculated according to the manning formula yang et al 2019a 2019b yin et al 2020 the river discharge calculation uses the slope area method as an important formula for river discharge calculation in hydraulics huang et al 2018 the slope area method has been widely used in many studies to calculate discharge in open channels or natural channels with stable flow rates lefavour and alsdorf 2005 sichangi et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the formulas mentioned are as follows 2 v k n r 2 3 j 1 2 3 r a l 4 q v a where v is the velocity m s a is the area of the river cross section m2 which is determined by the water depth and the water surface width q is the river discharge m3 s k is a conversion factor m1 3 s regarded as 1 in this study n is the roughness coefficient l is the wet perimeter r is the hydraulic radius and j is the hydraulic gradient the roughness and hydraulic gradient corresponding to each rshs are shown in the table 1 4 evaluation of river discharge accuracy 5 rmse q c q m n 2 6 nse 1 t 1 t q m t q c t 2 t 1 t q m t q m 2 where qm is the in situ discharge qc is the estimated discharge q m denotes the mean value of the in situ discharge t is the number of simulation calculations and n represents the total number of observations the nse varies from to 1 and 1 indicates the optimal status in which the simulated discharge equals the in situ measurements 2 2 2 lag calculation method to explore the lag of small and medium river discharge to climate change and human water resource management activities this study proposes a method to quantify the lag time the factors affecting river discharge such as temperature precipitation and human activities are regarded as independent variables these factors are all time varying variables the river discharge is regarded as the dependent variable and the formulas are as follows 7 x 1 f 1 t 8 x 2 f 2 t 9 x n f n t 10 y f x 1 x 2 x n where t refers to the time and x1 x2 xn are the factors affecting river discharge such as temperature precipitation land use cover change lucc interbasin water transfer project and efficient water resource policies y refers to the river discharge differentials are taken on both sides of the formula 11 dy dt df d x 1 d x 1 dt df d x 2 d x 2 dt df d x n d x n dt the changing trend of the dependent variable and the independent variable is not a single linear relationship we can infer that when the second derivative of y river discharge is equal to 0 the corresponding t is not necessarily the same as the corresponding t when the second derivative of x1 temperature x2 precipitation or xn so on is equal to 0 therefore we define the lag time as the difference between the t corresponding to the second derivative of the dependent variable equal to 0 and the maximum value of t corresponding to the second derivative of the respective dependent variable equal to 0 the formula is as follows 12 l a g t i m e t f m a x t 1 t 2 t n where lag time is the river discharge response lag time t f refers to the value of t when the second derivative of f equals 0 and t n refers to the value of t when the second derivative of xn equals 0 since the specific forms of the function are uncertain we use abrupt detection in mk detection to determine the t value in the following section the independent variables we consider are mainly summarized as climate change and human activities in this study the independent variables we consider in terms of climate change are temperature and precipitation and in terms of human activities we consider the amount of diverted water across river basins the lag calculation method is as follows fig 3 step 1 mann kendall s test is used to identify abrupt points in the trends of independent variables climate change and human activities step 2 mann kendall s test is used to identify abrupt points in the trend of dependent variables river discharge step 3 the lag time is calculated 2 2 3 mann kendall s test mann kendall s test does not require samples to follow a certain distribution and the lack of some data will not affect the results it is not disturbed by a few outliers and has strong applicability blahusiakova and matouskova 2015 the nonparametric mann kendall test was used to detect the trends and abrupt points of river discharge precipitation and air temperature in small and medium sized rivers in the hrb a hypothesis test based on the mann kendall s statistic ufi for a significance level of a was applied to all variables the following test was performed to prove or disprove an assumption that is was there any statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend for the variables the test statistic is calculated by the following formula jianyun et al 2007 13 u f i s i e s i var s i 14 s k i 1 k r i 15 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j where xi is the variable which is an independent and identically distributed random variable with a sample of n the expected value e sk and variance var sk can be estimated as follows 16 e s i i i 1 4 17 var s i i i 1 2 i 5 72 the null hypothesis h0 indicates that ufi is not statistically significant that is no significant warming cooling or wetting drying trend is accepted if u f i u α 2 where u α 2 is the standard normal deviation alternatively it is accepted that h1 that is ufi is statistically significant if u f i u α 2 a positive ufi value denotes a positive trend and a negative ufi value denotes a negative trend then according to the inverse time series xn xn 1 x1 ufi can be calculated again by the definition of ubi ufi i n n 1 1 the curve of ufi and ubi could be plotted if there is a match point between the two curves and the trend of the series is statistically significant the match point is regarded as the breaking point of the series 2 2 4 linear regression model a linear regression model can be used to fit the changing trend of long term series data we used the linear regression model to fit the variation trends of the average annual discharge precipitation and temperature of 16 rivers in the past 20 years quantified the degree of variation and combined the mk test to determine the trend change up or down the use of linear regression models was carried out in originpro 2021 software https www originlab com doc en origin help lr algorithm the algorithm is as follows for a given dataset x i y i i 1 2 n where is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable β 0 and β 1 are parameters and ε i is a random error term with mean e ε i 0 and variance v a r ε i σ 2 linear regression fits the data to a model of the following form 18 y i β 0 β 1 x i ε i the least squares estimation is used to minimize the sum of the n squared deviations 19 i 1 n y i β 0 β 1 x i 2 the estimated parameters of the linear model can be computed as 20 β 1 sxy sxx 21 β 0 y β 1 x where 22 x 1 n i 1 n x i y 1 n i 1 n y i 23 sxy i 1 n x i y i s x x i 1 n x i 2 u n c o r r e c t e d 24 sxy i 1 n x i x y i y s x x i

combined with the hydraulic parameters of field observations a three dimensional digital river section model was established to obtain long term river discharge data using a dji mavic air 2 uav high definition camera and gps positioning high spatial resolution 5 5 cm images were collected on 16 medium and small sized river sections in the hrb with the help of the professional uav image processing software pix4d we could obtain high precision images based on image synthesis aerial triangulation point cloud encryption spatial information calibration and generate centimeter level digital surface models dsms and digital orthophotos doms to construct a digital river section model we collected elevation information from dsms to invert overwater and underwater topography simultaneously open and free satellite imagery including sentinel 2 st2 landsat 8 ls8 landsat 7 ls7 and landsat5 ls5 series of images were utilized as a data source to identify the width of the river water body at a monthly scale from 2000 to 2020 google earth engine gee https earthengine google com was used to quickly complete image projection image stitching and cutting on the cloud platform and the green light band and near infrared light band were used to calculate the ndwi to improve the extraction accuracy of the river width from landsat data and solve the problem of spatial scale in consistency between sentinel 2 and landsat data the statistical regression downscaling method was adopted in this study wu and liu 2015 in addition the flow velocity and water depth of each section were measured on site the flow velocity was measured with an ls300 a rotameter and calculated by the three point method which was taken as the average flow velocity of each section the water depth was measured by a deeper sonar detector the average water depth of multiple points was combined with the dsm river elevation information obtained by the uav to simulate the distribution and cross sectional area of the river discharge and multiplied by the actual flow rate to obtain the river discharge there were 35 meteorological stations in the study area and the locations are shown in fig 1 temperature and precipitation data were used to analyze the variation trend and significance of temperature and precipitation in the hrb over the past 20 years table 2 summarizes these datasets 3 results 3 1 section information and validation of the rshs to investigate the response of small and medium sized river discharge to climate change and human activities experiments were conducted in 16 areas of the hrb we determined the survey sections in the 16 areas obtained dem and dom data by using an uav and established 16 rshss by measuring hydraulic parameters such as water depth river width and flow velocity of the section among them 5 sections were located in mountain areas namely zf xj sxl sjd and yc the remaining 11 sections were located in the plain area namely qm bzs xx xxz mz hsw hhz ddw lq gt and bhd among them the rivers in the plains are more affected by human activities than the rivers in the mountain areas the locations of these rshss and the corresponding digital river section models and landscapes are shown in fig 4 we evaluated the estimation accuracy of the river discharge data and conducted a correlation analysis between the 2017 monthly average discharge at the sxl station retrieved by the rshs and the 2017 monthly average discharge measured by the sxl hydrological station the linear relationship between the two was significant fig 5 where r2 0 93 and the overall simulation accuracy was evaluated where the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was 0 86 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 50 m3 s which indicates that the rshs method is suitable for small and medium sized rivers in the hrb in november 2017 the water transfer from the cetian reservoir to the guanting reservoir passed through this section therefore the average discharge in that month was much larger than that in other months to eliminate the influence of this point on the linear relationship fitting and accuracy evaluation the simulation and measured data in november 2017 were removed for accuracy verification where r2 0 63 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was 0 65 and the root mean square error rmse was 0 37 m3 s the accuracy of the rshs method is within an acceptable range and is suitable for this area 3 2 temporal and spatial variation in discharge in small and medium sized rivers over 20 years through the establishment of the rshs the monthly scale discharge hydrographs from 16 small and medium sized rivers in the hrb in the last 20 years were calculated among them the discharge of the gt station was only calculated until july 2018 because afterward the government conducted water conservancy projects and built cofferdams upstream the 16 river long team discharge linear fitting trends were obtained fig 6 the trend of the annual average discharge of these rivers in the last 20 years was tested by the mk trend test method the discharge of small and medium sized rivers in the hrb generally had a downward trend xu et al 2020 han and zhang 2021 from the trend analysis the figure shows that the annual average discharge of 6 river sections in the hrb had an upward trend of which 3 were statistically significant at the level of α 0 1 which were the m xj m yc and m sjd sites the prefix m indicates that the river section is in the mountain area and the z values were 3 59 3 53 and 2 92 respectively the annual average discharge of the remaining 10 sections showed a downward trend of which the p xxz and p mz sites the prefix p indicates that the river section is in the plain area were running dry in 2013 and 2005 respectively which was statistically significant at the level of α 0 1 and the z values were 4 16 and 2 32 respectively liu and du 2017 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 3 3 detecting the abrupt points of the discharge and its difference between the early period and late period the mk test was used to identify the abrupt points of the annual average discharge of 14 rshss the p mz and p xxz sites were not tested because they started drying up in 2013 and 2005 we think there was no sudden change before 2020 as shown in fig 7 the abrupt points of these 14 stations were within the range from 2011 to 2019 in terms of time distribution only 3 of the 14 sites had abrupt times between 2011 and 2014 namely m sxl m yc and m xj of which m sxl s abrupt time was 2011 m yc s abrupt time was 2012 and m xj s abrupt time was 2014 the abrupt time of the remaining 11 stations was between 2015 and 2019 and the abrupt points of m gt and m sjd occurred in 2015 in 2016 there were 3 sites with abrupt points namely p hsw p hhz and p lq from 2017 to 2019 a total of 6 abrupt changes occurred namely m zf p bhd p bzs p xx p ddw and p qm the abrupt times of p ddw and p qm were the latest and both occurred in 2019 comparing the mean value of the annual average discharge before and after the abrupt time it can be seen that the mean value of the 14 stations annual discharge after the abrupt time was greater than before among them the annual average discharge at the m yc and m zf stations increased significantly by 47 16 and 44 79 respectively at the same time the annual average discharge at the m sjd m sxl m xj p lq and p qm stations also increased significantly by 28 93 15 62 17 96 14 43 and 14 98 respectively in contrast the annual average discharge of p bzs p xx p hsw and p hhz increased by 2 81 2 79 5 05 and 6 30 respectively it can be concluded that the annual average discharge of these rivers increased after the sudden change which was mainly due to the increase in rainfall in the hrb in the last 20 years and the reduction in human use of surface water resources in recent years bao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 3 4 variations and abrupt points of key natural factors and human activities natural factors which include precipitation and temperature exhibited abrupt points the time series of precipitation in the hrb from 2000 to 2019 is shown in fig 8 a precipitation in the hrb had an upward trend over the past 20 years and the linear fitting trend was 3 09 mm a the maximum value of annual average precipitation in this period occurred in 2016 which was 614 2 mm and the minimum value was 400 4 mm which occurred in 2002 the results of the m k test showed that the precipitation in the hrb had an insignificant downward trend before 2004 and then after a period of fluctuation there was a sudden change in the trend in 2008 and an upward trend after 2008 bao et al 2014 hao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the time series of temperature in the hrb from 2000 to 2019 is shown in fig 8 b the temperature in the hrb had a slight upward trend in fluctuation in the past 20 years and the linear fitting trend was 0 017 c a the results of the m k test showed that the temperature in the hrb fluctuated in the first 15 years without an obvious abrupt point however the abrupt time of the trend occurred in 2015 and then had an upward trend from the results the temperature increase in the hrb was not significant han et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 compared with the impact of the increase in precipitation over the last 20 years on river discharge the impact of temperature on river discharge can be ignored in regard to human activities water supply was an important factor affecting river discharge annual water supply data in the hrb were compiled from the haihe river resources bulletin and the results are shown in fig 9 in the past 20 years the proportion of surface water supply and groundwater supply had an obvious downward trend as the total water supply decreased slightly the resulting water supply shortage was mainly supplemented by interbasin water transfer and other water sources during this period the surface water supply decreased from 13 66 1010 m3 to 8 30 1010 m3 decreasing by 39 27 and the groundwater supply decreased from 26 30 1010 m3 to 14 70 1010 m3 decreasing by 43 80 while the interbasin water transfer increased from 0 to 109 74 1010 m3 variations in human activities such as water supply also had abrupt points the whole water supply structure changed suddenly in 2003 since 2003 the surface water supply decreased by 39 30 compared with the previous year at the same time the required water supply was supplemented by interbasin water transfers in 2000 the water supply of the hrb was mainly composed of the surface water supply and groundwater supply accounting for 34 1 and 65 6 respectively no interbasin water transfer measures were taken by 2003 the water supply proportions of the surface water source groundwater source interbasin water transfer and other water sources were 20 6 69 3 9 6 and 0 5 respectively which began to change significantly by 2020 the proportions of surface water sources groundwater sources interbasin water transfers and other water sources reached 22 3 39 7 29 5 and 8 5 respectively we can see that under the background of the increasing shortage of sea and river water resources human beings have made significant changes in water intake since 2003 mainly by reducing the water supply from surface water sources and groundwater sources in the basin and increasing interbasin water transfers to supplement water consumption by people 3 5 lag of discharge response in small and medium rivers since 2003 people have attempted to improve the shortage of water resources in the hrb from the aspect of water intake and to increase the discharge in the river channel through eco environmental water replenishment haihe river basin water resources bulletin from 2000 to 2020 at the same time the variation trend of precipitation in the hrb had a sudden change in 2008 and showed an upward trend after this sudden change these scenarios had a positive impact on the river discharge but it can be seen from the conclusions in section 3 2 that after the increase in precipitation in the hrb in 2008 the discharge trend of small rivers in the hrb did not change immediately instead there was a lag as shown in fig 10 the year of sudden change in the trend of small and medium sized rivers was later than 2008 which lagged by 3 11 years the m sxl station had a sudden change in the discharge trend only after 3 years while the p ddw and p lq stations started responding after 11 years the response of small and medium sized rivers in the haihe mountain area was generally faster than that in the plain area the lag year of stations in the haihe mountain area was 3 9 years while that in the plain area was 8 11 years among the points in mountain areas m sxl had the fastest response with a lag year of 3 years followed by m yc with a lag year of 4 years while the lag time of m xj m gt and m sjd was relatively long with m xj being 6 years and m gt and m sjd being 7 years at the same time the lag time of m zf in mountain areas was the longest at 9 years in the plain area the stations with long response times were mainly concentrated in the central area except for the two points that have been drought the lag time of p hsw p hhz and p qm was 8 years that of p bzs was 9 years that of p bhd and p xx was 10 years and that of p ddw and p lq was the longest both of which were 11 years there was a spatial difference in the lag time of the river discharge response which was mainly due to the uneven spatial distribution of human water intake and ecological environmental water replenishment 4 discussion 4 1 why does the discharge response of small and medium rivers lag because there was a lag there was no immediate increase but there was a trend of increasing after several years in the response of small and medium sized river discharge to climate change and human activities fig 10 the main reason for the lag was the excessive exploitation of groundwater in the hrb according to statistics during the period from 2000 to 2010 the amount of groundwater supply far exceeded the amount of groundwater resources by the end of 2011 the excess water was 424 58 billion m3 haihe river basin water resources bulletin from 2000 to 2011 in 10 of the 11 years groundwater consumption was greater than groundwater resources this resulted in most of the increased water volume caused by increased precipitation and human interbasin water transfer being added to the groundwater source which reduced the part of the supplemented surface runoff and increased the amount of groundwater resources lv et al 2012 fu and yang 2019 the amount of water supplemented to surface water resources in the early stage was not enough to offset the impact of human overextraction there was a lag in the response of river discharge over the past 60 years the hrb has faced severe water shortages and related environmental problems and the per capita water resources are only 305 m3 which is equivalent to 1 7 of the chinese average and 1 27 of the world average han and zhang 2021 yang et al 2022 in this context to meet the needs of social and economic development the groundwater in the hrb has been overexploited su et al 2020 chen et al 2021 at the end of the 1990s the groundwater level decreased at a rate of 1 m yr making it one of the most depleted aquifers in the world the period from 2003 to 2014 was divided into water diversion phase i and the average annual water transfer during this period was 4 18 1010 m3 after 2015 it was divided into snwd phase ii and the average annual water transfer during this period was 8 34 1010 m3 haihe river basin water resources bulletin fig 11 the average annual water transfer volume of phase ii doubled compared to that of phase i we think that the measure of interbasin water transfer has been implemented since 2003 and at the end of 2014 the south to north water transfer project began to significantly increase the amount of water transfer to supplement groundwater and surface water sources in fact a combination of water use reduction and diversion can slow or even reverse groundwater depletion in the basin and increase runoff in the basin although this takes a certain amount of time 3 11 years indicating that human intervention can affect the availability of water resources and that persistence has a positive impact afshar et al 2020 chaussard et al 2017 water diversion projects have been used to divert water to the hrb as a substitute for local water resources reducing the use of water extracted from surface and groundwater sources to meet the growing water demand part of the diverted water is used for domestic and industrial use due to the high cost of interbasin water transfer and the quality of water that can meet drinking water standards fu and yang 2019 in addition irrigation water is mainly provided through groundwater abstraction which has been reduced in recent years through improved cropping regimes and water saving measures such as drip and microsprinkler irrigation techniques fang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 xia et al 2007 due to the increase in population the proportion of domestic water and industrial water in the total water consumption will increase in the future in the future water transfer will be mainly used for domestic water and industrial water which will help alleviate the increasing water pressure and stabilize groundwater on the plains of the hrb yang et al 2022 resources are very important and the excess water during the flood season in the water transfer project is used to supplement arid rivers and lakes and increase the surface water resources in the basin the difference in river discharge response lag time between the haihe mountain area and plain area is mainly caused by the variation in water intake caused by population density areas with large population densities have more water intake and the groundwater deficit is more serious su et al 2020 chen et al 2021 areas with small population densities have less water intake and the groundwater deficit is lower as interbasin water transfers started in 2003 to supplement the haihe river water resources and hrb precipitation showed an upward trend in 2008 the annual average discharge trend of the six medium and small sized rivers in the mountain area had a sudden change from 2011 to 2017 and the mean value after the sudden change was significantly higher than that before the sudden change the annual average discharge of 8 small and medium sized rivers in the plain area showed a sudden change from 2016 to 2019 and the mean value after the sudden change increased significantly compared with that before the sudden change there are still 2 rivers in the setting off state and it can be considered that their annual average discharge has not changed suddenly and has not yet responded to climate change and human activities the discharge response time of rivers in mountain areas mainly occurred before 2015 and that of rivers in plain areas mainly occurred after 2015 before the south to north water transfer project was connected i e in phase i the water transfer project mainly relied on the yellow river and luanhe river to supplement the groundwater and surface water sources in the hrb with an average annual water transfer volume of 4 18 1010 m3 at the same time the annual average ecological water replenishment during this period was 0 87 1010 m3 after distribution this amount of water transfer and make up volume was sufficient to supplement the river discharge in the haihe mountain area where the population density is small the water intake is small and groundwater exploitation is not serious however in areas where the population density is large the water intake is large and groundwater exploitation is serious zhang et al 2022 after the middle route of the south to north water transfer project was opened at the end of 2014 i e phase ii the water transfer project mainly supplemented the groundwater source and surface water source of the hrb by diverting water from the danjiangkou reservoir with an average annual water transfer volume of 8 34 1010 m3 the annual average ecological water replenishment during this period was 4 03 1010 m3 compared with phase i the annual average water volume of phase ii increased by 4 16 1010 m3 and the annual average ecological water replenishment increased by 3 16 1010 m3 this part of the water was used to supplement the groundwater and surface water sources which led to an overall upward trend of the groundwater level in the plain area of the hrb long et al 2020 yang et al 2022 and the surface water source was supplemented at the same time as the groundwater source as a result most of the annual average discharge trends of small and medium sized rivers in the plain area suddenly changed from 2016 to 2019 and the mean value after the sudden change was significantly higher than that before the abrupt change 4 2 key factors affecting river discharge recovery lag time the population increase as well its spatial distribution and lucc are the two main reasons for the lag response of small and medium sized rivers in this region there is a large difference in population density between the haihe mountain area and plain area which is the main reason for the difference in river response lag years between the mountain area and plain area in fact the main driving factor of river discharge reduction in the hrb in the past 50 years has been human activities yang and tian 2009 the population density in mountain areas has increased from 172 cap km2 in the past 20 years to 197 cap km2 an increase of 14 53 fig 12 the population density in the plain area increased from 767 cap km2 to 988 cap km2 an increase of 28 81 the population density in plain areas is 4 5 times that in mountain areas and the growth rate is much higher than that in mountain areas the maximum and minimum observed values upper and lower quartiles and median response lag years of each station in mountain areas are smaller than those in plain areas the impact of population density on surface water resources is mainly reflected in water intake wan et al 2020 water intake directly changes the river discharge population growth and social development may be the main reasons for increasing agricultural industrial and domestic water use thus reducing the total discharge taking 2010 as an example its irrigation industrial and domestic water consumption was 24 75 billion m3 5 18 billion m3 and 5 92 billion m3 respectively the precipitation in that year was 533 60 mm and the surface water resources were only 14 90 billion m3 the water use in the whole hrb seriously exceeds the standard among which irrigation water accounts for the largest proportion reflecting the water use situation in the region to a certain extent variations in grassland and forest land use types in the haihe mountain area and cultivated land in the plain area are also the reasons for the difference in river response lag years between the mountain area and plain area the type of land use in mountain areas dominated by forest and grassland causes the regional water consumption to be mainly evapotranspiration and surface water resources and basically does not consume groundwater resources however for the land use type in the plain area dominated by cultivated land due to the shortage of surface water resources the wide area of cultivated land and large water consumption irrigation needs to be carried out by exploiting groundwater resources li et al 2020 fu et al 2020 part of the irrigation water is consumed by crops part of it infiltrates into the soil and part of it is transmitted to the atmosphere in the form of evaporation the water consumed is mainly from groundwater resources zhang et al 2022 as shown in fig 13 from 2000 to 2015 more than 85 of the area in the haihe mountain area was forestland and grassland while more than 90 of the area in the plain area was cultivated land yang et al 2021 in fact at the watershed scale different types of land use have a significant impact on surface water resources land use first changes soil conditions soil erosion and biodiversity and then changes the underlying surface thus affecting runoff production the impact of lucc on water resources is mainly reflected in two aspects evapotranspiration and infiltration of different land cover which has a significant impact on surface water resources and groundwater resources yang et al 2014 the increase in vegetation coverage promotes the interception of the forest canopy and the development of vegetation roots also increases the regulation and water storage capacity of soil sun et al 2020 all these factors extend the duration of the rainfall runoff process reduce the peak runoff and increase the base flow in the dry season at the same time the actual evapotranspiration of cultivated land is higher than that of grassland due to the high density deep root system and large vegetation coverage in addition forest vegetation covers a large area which is closely related to the atmosphere and increases the evapotranspiration of the watershed the cultivated land in the plain area mainly affects the runoff from may to august and the lai changes significantly from may to august on the other hand the evapotranspiration of farmland especially the corn wheat rotation farming system widely in practice in the southern part of the basin is much higher than the annual precipitation especially in the growth of farmland in july and august the lai of farmland is greater than that of woodland and grassland and the water storage capacity of farmland increases during this period groundwater exploitation is greater than that of other periods which has a serious impact on groundwater resources wu et al 2014 4 3 influences of river discharge recovery lag on watershed ecosystems due to the shortage of water resources and the heavy exploitation of groundwater in the hrb the response of small and medium sized rivers to flow changes lags under the background of increased precipitation and human interbasin water transfer the discharge in rivers does not increase immediately but starts to increase after 3 11 years this reflects the fact that in a basin with overdeveloped water resources measures such as interbasin water transfer and ecological water replenishment can change the trend of river discharge reduction in the basin but the river discharge reduction will continue for several years in fact the water in rivers is very important for human survival and is the core part of the biosphere it maintains the biodiversity of rivers and land the water ecological environment and rivers represent the relationship between the whole and the individual changes in river discharge can directly affect riverbank ecosystems comiti et al 2009 kenney et al 2012 the decreasing river discharge leads to the continuous degradation of the river ecosystem some once healthy rivers with rich biodiversity only have drought and pollution resistant species due to the reduction in discharge for a long time discharge changes have been considered a key driver of changes in river structure and function affecting the behavior and morphology of a series of aquatic and riparian organisms bunn and arthington 2002 fausch et al 2001 for example the extremely low discharge caused by excessive water intake increases the water temperature and pollutant concentration beyond the allowable level for biological survival or reproduction the degradation of river ecosystems may be related to a variety of complex mechanisms given the scale of river degradation around the world it generally takes ten years for ecosystems to recover due to the lag of the river response this time may be extended again as shown in fig 14 there are four landscape maps which represent m sxl m xj p bhd and p xxz there are four partial enlargements in each map to help identify the shore area the vegetation coverage along the bank is divided into three categories by visual interpretation high coverage middle coverage and low coverage of grassland vegetation when the coverage of grassland vegetation in the square area extracted from the bank of the corresponding river is less than 0 25 it is deemed low vegetation coverage when it is greater than 0 25 and less than 0 75 it is deemed medium vegetation coverage and when it is greater than 0 75 it deemed high vegetation coverage we discovered that the riverbank ecosystems of p bhd and p xxz have been completely degraded they are very desolate only covered by some weeds the two maps above are the landscape maps of stations m sxl and m xj the average annual discharge of these two rivers has increased in the past 20 years and there is no possibility of set off their river bank ecosystems remain good under field observations there are fish in the river channel and the grassland and vegetation along the bank are lush it is clear that the difference in lag time will directly affect the restoration and protection of riverbank ecosystems 4 4 limitations and challenges through field experiments and rshs technology we found that there is a lag time between the abrupt change in small and medium sized river discharge and the abrupt change in variables climate change and human activities that affect discharge therefore we propose that the discharge of small and medium sized rivers has an annual scale response mechanism to climate change and human activities however the response mechanism and method still need further research 1 quantitative studies of lag years are needed to separate the respective impacts of human activities and climate change by using other methods such as mdmc wei and zhang 2010 due to the small and medium sized rivers we studied the hydrological data collected by hydrological stations are lacking at the same time the river width is narrow when calculating the discharge and the image quality of the landsat 5 satellite was poor before 2000 therefore it is difficult to calculate the long term series discharge matching the meteorological data since 1956 therefore the long term relationship between discharge and climate cannot be established 2 a more detailed study of the impact of each variable on the lag years is needed not just generalized to climate change and human activities such as elevation elevation slope regional vegetation cover distance to large river streams etc 3 there may be a high degree of autocorrelation in annual river discharge data which affects the results of the mk test foroumandi et al 2021 foroumandi et al 2022 although rshs is reliable and effective this method still has some shortcomings for example the accuracy of river width extraction can be greatly affected due to the negative impact of cloud cover on the visible and near infrared bands of satellite remote sensing in addition limited by the spatial resolution of current satellite remote sensing data it is difficult to identify water bodies whose river width exceeds the highest observation accuracy of satellite remote sensing using satellite remote sensing data with higher spatial resolution is an effective way to solve this problem 5 conclusion in this study rshs technology uavs and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite remote sensing were used to retrieve the monthly discharge data of 16 small and medium sized river sections in the hrb over the last 20 years we found that 1 in the past 20 years the discharge of small and medium rivers in the hrb has decreased in the plain area and increased in the mountain area all discharges of 10 stations in the plain area of the hrb showed a downward trend and discharges of 6 stations in the mountain area showed an upward trend 2 under the background of the increase in precipitation interbasin water transfer and ecological environment replenishment to supply water resources the discharges of small and medium sized rivers did not increase immediately but there was a response lag period with a lag between 3 and 11 years rivers in mountain areas had a lag from 3 9 years and that in plain areas was slower with a lag of 8 11 years 3 compared with large rivers the increase in precipitation and active water resource management measures did not cause the discharge of small and medium sized rivers to quickly return to the original state demonstrating an obvious lag although the change in river discharge will take several years to occur the implementation of these measures is necessary and effective to restore the health of water resources in the basin this study affirms the role of water transfer projects and other measures in the restoration of water resources in basins with serious impacts from human activities under the background of global change and provides a new perspective on human efforts to change the current situation of water shortages credit authorship contribution statement hezhen lou conceptualization software methodology formal analysis writing review editing hao li data curation

2066,the single probe heat pulse sphp technique combined with the fiber optic distributed temperature sensing dts technology can offer novel high resolution measurements of soil moisture θ over spatial scales ranging from several centimeters to several kilometers however the key limitation of this method is in obtaining the calibration relationship between θ and soil thermal conductivity λ across a specific field in a previous study a new methodology using a gaussian processes model was presented to account for the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship the model aggregated θ measurements from soil moisture sensors scattered over the sphp transect with the corresponding dts λ measurements at their locations in this study a novel methodology is tested to optimize the number and locations of soil moisture sensors required to account for the spatial variability of the λ θ relationship to achieve higher accuracy from the sphp technique the proposed methodology utilizes hierarchical clustering to analyze the information contained in the spatial structure of the sphp measurements as the soil dries from a nearly saturated condition the proposed methodology was tested using data from a field in oklahoma monte carlo simulation was performed to validate the performance of the proposed methodology the predictions obtained from the proposed methodology resulted in θ

solid water and gas that affects many soil physical properties such as density conductivity and volumetric changes haines 1923 terzaghi 1943 therefore it is a key parameter for many hydrological agricultural ecological geological and engineering applications barney et al 2009 brocca et al 2010 hassan esfahani et al 2014 krakauer et al 2014 terzaghi 1943 the spatial variability of soil moisture especially in the near surface horizons is scale dependent as it is controlled by many factors that act at different scales these factors include the soil s physical properties the properties of the vegetative cover topographical features and meteorological conditions western et al 2002 therefore the development of techniques that can accurately measure θ over a large range of spatial and temporal scales is needed to support this wide range of applications many techniques with varying degrees of accuracy and robustness have been developed to measure θ at a single location a good review of the different techniques can be found in su et al 2014 in addition another family of techniques was developed to measure θ over large scales using remote and aerial sensing and a review of such techniques can be found in wang and qu 2009 however these sensing techniques typically have coarse resolutions ranging from meters to several kilometers and need comprehensive validation using in situ measurements all the aforementioned techniques cannot address applications that require high spatial and temporal resolutions in measuring θ variability over intermediate spatial scales that range from meters to kilometers sayde et al 2010 shehata et al 2020 the modern distributed temperature sensing dts technology offers unprecedented scalability of measurements to obtain near continuous seconds high resolution few centimeters temperature measurements over a fiber optic fo extending over very large extents of up to several kilometers these high resolution temperature measurements can be combined with traditional techniques used to measure soil thermal properties and θ at point scale to extend their capacity to measure θ across scales the dts techniques to measure θ can be categorized into two categories 1 active techniques in which a power source is used to apply heating to induce temperature variation in the soil which is used to estimate soil heat capacity and or thermal conductivity and consequently θ along the fiber e g benítez buelga et al 2014 ciocca et al 2012 han et al 2022 sayde et al 2010 shehata et al 2022b and 2 passive techniques which monitor the natural temperature variations along the fiber induced in the soil due to the diurnal cycle and use it to estimate θ by estimating the soil thermal diffusivity first e g cao et al 2021 steele dunne et al 2010 or by assimilating the monitored temperature variation within a model e g dong et al 2016a 2016b one of the dts active techniques used to measure θ is the single probe heat pulse sphp technique in which a heating element embedded in the composition of the fo cable is used to apply heat pulses in soil and the slope of the linear relationship between the temperature variation during the heat pulse application and the natural logarithm of time can be used to estimate the soil thermal conductivity λ e g ciocca et al 2012 shehata et al 2022a the estimated λ can then be used to estimate θ if the relationship between the two parameters are known the λ θ relationship is however location specific as it is influenced by many soil physical and mineralogical properties such as the soil bulk density particle size distribution porosity temperature and the thermal properties of the soil particles campbell et al 1994 dong et al 2015 haynes et al 1980 therefore the actual λ θ relationship at a certain site needs to be measured directly to accurately estimate θ from the λ measurements obtained from the sphp technique in most of the previous studies the λ θ relationship was measured by coupling independent θ point measurements obtained from calibration stations scattered across the transect with the corresponding λ estimates at the locations of those stations obtained from the sphp technique ciocca et al 2012 sayde et al 2010 striegl and ii 2012 the data from these scattered calibration stations are then lumped together to generate a general relationship that was assumed to be valid over the whole sphp transect in contrast shehata et al 2022a used a gaussian processes gp model to account for the possible heterogeneity in the observed λ θ relationship at the different calibration stations to improve the accuracy of the θ estimated from the sphp technique to reach a mean and standard deviation root mean square error rmse of 0 03 0 01 m3m 3 respectively however previous studies did not provide a methodology to determine the appropriate number and the optimized locations of these calibration stations to capture the variability in the λ θ relationship along the fo dts transect hierarchical clustering hc is a method that offers an opportunity to explore the different relationships in a dataset within near similar regimes and can help quantify the similarity between different measurements hc has been used in many hydrological applications such as to study the spatial variability in rainfall and weather parameters ferstl et al 2016 ramos 2001 or groundwater quality el hames et al 2013 therefore hc could be used to improve the accuracy of the sphp technique by optimizing the number and placement of the calibration stations to capture the variability in the λ θ relationship along the fo transect the objective of this work is to test a new methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations required to encompass the variability in the λ θ relationship along an sphp dts transect using hierarchical clustering the optimization is performed by clustering the λ measurements observed as the soil dries from near saturation conditions this novel methodology can improve the performance of the sphp in providing accurate θ estimates in relatively heterogeneous fields in addition this methodology aims to maximize the value of the data collected from the calibration stations which consequently can help in reducing the overall cost of the sphp dts systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental setup the analysis of this study was performed using the dataset collected and processed by shehata et al 2022a this dataset was collected in an alfalfa covered agricultural field adjacent to the southern great plains sgp atmospheric observatory in oklahoma over 76 days within the period from march to may 2020 see fig 1 the dts data can be retrieved from the arm sgp archive https adc arm gov discovery the soil in the site is mapped as kirkland series and the surface soil texture is classified as silt loam according to the united states department of agriculture web soil survey the fo used in this study was installed at depth of 10 cm from the soil surface and extended over a total length of 600 m transect only the first 450 m was used as an sphp sensor to comply with the voltage and current limits included in the site safety requirements the soil at a few scattered locations along the fo was disturbed by wildlife during the measurement period seven heat pulses were applied to the whole length of the sphp sensor during every measurement night these heat pulses were then used to estimate λ shehata et al 2022a used a gaussian processes model to calibrate the sphp system using 19 ec 5 sensors placed at locations along the sphp fo transect at a depth of 10 cm from the surface a severe storm that occurred on april 18th precipitation 50 mm within 24 h caused the whole site to reach near saturation conditions more details about the experimental design the heating protocol and the analysis can be found in shehata et al 2022a in this study the final generated θ profiles denoted by shehata et al 2022a as θ final were used this dataset represents soil moisture with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 m and 1 day respectively over the whole length of the heated sections 450 m and a total duration of 76 days 2 2 determination of the number and locations of the required calibration curves the hypothesis investigated in this study is that the information contained in the spatial structure of the λ profiles obtained from the sphp fo cable while the soil dries up from nearly saturated conditions induced by a large precipitation event or inundation by irrigation water can be useful in clustering the data into several clusters which can guide the task of optimizing the number and allocation of the required calibration stations in this study we present and test a new methodology to optimize the number and placement of the calibration stations based on this hypothesis a flowchart of the algorithm steps is presented in fig 2 hierarchical clustering of the λ measurements was performed to assess the spatial structure of λ the euclidian distance was used as a similarity measure between the different observations then the average linkage function was used to construct the hierarchical tree and a dendrogram plot was created to represent the results the cophenetic correlation coefficient introduced by sokal and rohlf 1962 was used to assess how well the constructed hierarchical tree represents the data the cophenetic correlation coefficient is defined as 1 c l m d l m d t l m t l m d l m d 2 l m t l m t 2 where d l m and t l m are the euclidian distance and the linkage distance between the observations l and m respectively d is the mean euclidian distance for all observations and t is the mean linkage distance between all observations the closer the cophenetic correlation coefficient is to the optimal value of 1 the more the hierarchical tree is representing the actual data accurately the next step in the algorithm is to determine the number of representative clusters in the data although identifying the number of clusters is in many cases straightforward by visual inspection of the dendrogram plot two commonly used criteria to find the optimal number of clusters were also tested the first tested criterion is the variance ratio criterion vrc caliński and harabasz 1974 which is defined for a number of clusters k as follows 2 v r c k ss between ss within n obs k k 1 where ss between is the overall between cluster variance ss within is the overall within cluster variance and n obs is the number of observations the optimal number of clusters corresponds to the highest observed vrc value the second tested criterion is the davies bouldin criterion db davies and bouldin 1979 which is defined as follows 3 d b k 1 k a 1 k max a b d a d b d a b where d a is the average distance between each point in the cluster a and its centroid d b is the average distance between each point in the cluster b and its centroid and d a b is the euclidean distance between the centroids of the clusters a and b the optimal number of clusters corresponds to the smallest observed db value the function evalclusters in matlab was used to compute the values of both the vrc and db criteria corresponding to a number of clusters ranging from 2 to 50 once the optimal number of clusters was identified the percentage of the transect length represented by each cluster was calculated this information was then used to identify any clusters that would represent only a small portion of the transect length and their locations in the dataset if an examination of the area covered by the fo dts transect reveals that the variations in these small clusters are caused by factors not relevent to scope of the study then they can be neglected and treated as outliers in this study any clusters that represented less than 2 of the total transect length and or were caused by wildlife activity were considered to be outliers finally the minimum number of calibration stations was determined based on two criteria 1 each non outlier cluster has at least one station within it and 2 each selected station represented approximately the same percentage of the transect length if a cluster is represented by a single station based on the aforementioned criteria the best location for that station is determined to be the location of the cluster member that had the minimum average euclidian distance to all the other cluster members with respect to λ if a cluster was assigned a number of stations n greater than one the members of the cluster were sorted based on their average euclidian distance to all the other cluster members with respect to λ this sorted list of members was then used to subdivide the cluster into equal sized sub clusters representing the number of required stations the specific location of the required station within each sub cluster was identified to be the first member within that sub cluster in the sorted list i e the location associated with the minimum average euclidian distance to all the members of the original undivided cluster with respect to λ this methodology was tested on the data from days following the severe storm that occurred on april 18th and till the end of may once the number and locations of the calibration stations were determined using the proposed methodology the λ measurements were combined with the estimated θ final at those locations that were used in this context as virtual calibration stations and were used to train a gp model to test if this model will be able to regenerate the θ final profiles over the whole 76 days period 2 3 gp model and the validation procedure the gp models used to predict θ in this study have the same properties as the gp model used by shehata et al 2022a to predict the soil moisture profiles the models used a rational quadratic kernel with no basis function and included the following predictors which provide information about the spatial variation in soil characteristics to predict θ at spatial location i and day j 1 distance at spatial location i and day j 2 observed λ at spatial location i and day j 3 average and maximum thermal conductivity observed at spatial location i over the 76 days 4 observed average ambient temperature before applying the heat pulses at spatial location i and day j 5 average soil moisture observed at all the selected stations on that day over the 450 m transect 6 reduction in λ observed at spatial location i on the first and second days of drainage after the april 18th severe storm after which the whole site soil reached near saturation the θ profiles obtained from the trained gp models were compared against the original θ final profiles observed using the same statistical parameters used by shehata et al 2022a namely the root mean square error rmse m 3 m 3 mean bias mbe m 3 m 3 maximum absolute error mae m 3 m 3 and the normalized nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nnse unitless 2 4 validation of the methodology using a monte carlo simulation a monte carlo simulation was performed to assess if the number of calibration stations selected using the hierarchical clustering approach was adequate to represent the variability observed along the fo transect and to assess if the locations optimized from the hierarchical clustering performed better than randomly distributing the stations along the fo transect calibration stations in the range from 1 to 20 were tested with each number in that range being represented by 1000 iterations in the monte carlo simulation the maximum number of stations tested was capped at 20 because the purpose of the hc clustering is to minimize the number of stations originally scattered along the transect 20 original stations including one malfunctioning station in each iteration the following two step approach was used to select the locations of the required number of stations 1 initial locations of the calibration stations were obtained by assuming the stations to be equally spaced over the whole transect length 2 the final locations of the calibration stations were then obtained by adding a random displacement in the range from 20 to 20 m to their initial locations estimated in the first step this approach was used to avoid the unrealistic scenarios in which the stations are concentrated in a small portion of the transect the λ measurements for each iteration were combined with the estimated θ final from the selected locations and used to train a new gp model the rmse mbe mae and nnse statistical measures were again used to assess the gain in accuracy corresponding to increasing the number of calibration stations and were also used to compare the results of the monte carlo simulation against those resulting from the proposed methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the number and locations of the calibration stations the dendrogram plot representing the resulting hierarchical tree of the λ data following the severe storm on april 18th is shown in fig 3 a cophenetic correlation coefficient of 0 78 was estimated for this hierarchical tree which demonstrates that the hierarchical tree sufficiently represents the λ data the dendrogram plot indicated that the data along the whole fo transect can be split into four main clusters this is consistent with the optimal number of clusters of 4 identified by the vrc and db criteria see fig 4 two of these clusters represented a total of 2 of the transect and therefore were considered outliers especially because they mainly represented locations where the soil was disturbed around the fo cable by the observed wildlife activity in the field this highlights one of the important advantages of the proposed methodology which is its ability to identify notably different locations along the transect before installing the calibration stations these locations can then be inspected closely to identify the reason behind the observed differences which can lead to a better understanding of the processes that caused them the other two main clusters identified hereafter by clusters 1 and 2 represent 80 6 and 17 6 of the transect respectively according to the presented methodology if one station was used to represent cluster 2 four more stations will be needed in cluster 1 to have each station represent 20 of the whole transect this suggests that the minimum required number of stations is five stations nevertheless the cases of using five and ten calibration stations were both investigated to check the gain in accuracy associated with doubling the number of stations the exact locations of these stations were identified following the proposed methodology presented in section 2 2 the results of the θ profiles generated using gp models trained by the data from the selected locations are presented in fig 5 a b for the cases of five and ten calibration locations respectively the results were binned in 0 001 m3m 3 bins to generate their histogram which provided a sense of the distribution of the predictions at different error rates in comparison to the original θ final profiles using five or ten calibration stations resulted in a similar rmse of 0 03 m3m 3 with negligible bias however the probability distributions of both cases illustrate that using a larger number of calibration stations resulted in a slight reduction of the overall spreading of the θ predictions but managed to slightly increase the percentage of predictions with errors 5 this can also be inferred from the higher nnse values observed in the case with ten calibration locations the results of the monte carlo simulation for the cases of five and ten calibration locations were compared against the predictions from the proposed methodology see fig 5c f the spread of predictions from the monte carlo simulation illustrates the uncertainty associated with performing the calibration of an sphp transect based on the measurements from calibration stations scattered at random locations along its length the predictions obtained from the proposed methodology however managed to have statistics comparable to the 10 best iterations of the monte carlo simulation for the cases of five and ten selected stations this finding illustrates that for this particular case study the proposed optimization methodology for selecting the locations of the calibration stations is by far more efficient and reliable than randomly spreading the calibration locations along the fo transect the monte carlo simulation was performed to explore the impact of introducing additional calibration stations on the accuracy of the estimated θ the evolution of the different statistical measures of the predictions as the number of calibration locations increases from one to 20 is presented in fig 6 the mean and the range of all the statistical measures improved significantly as the number of calibration locations increased from one to four the mean rmse and mae dropped from 0 22 to 0 04 m3m 3 and from 0 43 to 0 15 m3m 3 respectively the mbe also dropped from 0 19 m3m 3 to near zero the gain in the accuracy improvement per the added station beyond the initial four stations was observed to be minimal which suggests that four strategically placed stations were sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of θ at this specific site 4 conclusion this study introduced a new methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations required to encompass the variability in the λ θ relationship along a single probe heat pulse distributed temperature sensing transect the essence of the new methodology is to apply hierarchical clustering i e unsupervised clustering to the λ time series observed along the fo transect while the soil dries up following a large precipitation event or heavy irrigation in other words similar clusters are automatically identified thus providing guidelines for soil probe allocation in turn the resulting clustering tree and the weights of each cluster can be used to estimate the minimum number and the best locations of the calibration stations the new methodology was applied to field data in oklahoma doe arm site and its θ predictions were compared against the results of a monte carlo simulation aimed at testing different combinations of the number of stations and their random locations the results showed that the gp model trained with the calibration stations selected by the proposed methodology had accuracy comparable to the best 10 iterations of the monte carlo simulation in which the calibration locations were assigned randomly furthermore the proposed methodology managed to provide a good estimate of the number of calibration stations required at this site to encompass the bulk of the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship nevertheless the proposed optimization methodology has limited applicability in optimizing dts systems installed in arid regions or at deep depths because reaching nearly saturated conditions required for the optimization methodology to work is difficult under those scenarios further research is needed to find alternative methodologies suitable for such conditions for example information from a period in which soil moisture increases due to a rainfall event after extremely dry initial conditions could be used to develop a similar methodology suitable for arid regions as these conditions will be easier to attain than the nearly saturated conditions utilized in this study applying the proposed methodology before deploying the calibration stations will optimize the number and the location of the stations and reduces the cost associated with calibrating large sphp fo transects in addition the proposed methodology has the potential to optimize the number of calibration stations used in passive dts installations by clustering the measured thermal diffusivity or the observed temperature variation instead of the thermal conductivity measurements used in the sphp fo transects nevertheless further studies are still needed to assess how the proposed methodology will perform in sphp fo and passive transects installed in fields with different soil types and different levels of soil

variability in the λ θ relationship along the fo transect the objective of this work is to test a new methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations required to encompass the variability in the λ θ relationship along an sphp dts transect using hierarchical clustering the optimization is performed by clustering the λ measurements observed as the soil dries from near saturation conditions this novel methodology can improve the performance of the sphp in providing accurate θ estimates in relatively heterogeneous fields in addition this methodology aims to maximize the value of the data collected from the calibration stations which consequently can help in reducing the overall cost of the sphp dts systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental setup the analysis of this study was performed using the dataset collected and processed by shehata et al 2022a this dataset was collected in an alfalfa covered agricultural field adjacent to the southern great plains sgp atmospheric observatory in oklahoma over 76 days within the period from march to may 2020 see fig 1 the dts data can be retrieved from the arm sgp archive https adc arm gov discovery the soil in the site is mapped as kirkland series and the surface soil texture is classified as silt loam according to the united states department of agriculture web soil survey the fo used in this study was installed at depth of 10 cm from the soil surface and extended over a total length of 600 m transect only the first 450 m was used as an sphp sensor to comply with the voltage and current limits included in the site safety requirements the soil at a few scattered locations along the fo was disturbed by wildlife during the measurement period seven heat pulses were applied to the whole length of the sphp sensor during every measurement night these heat pulses were then used to estimate λ shehata et al 2022a used a gaussian processes model to calibrate the sphp system using 19 ec 5 sensors placed at locations along the sphp fo transect at a depth of 10 cm from the surface a severe storm that occurred on april 18th precipitation 50 mm within 24 h caused the whole site to reach near saturation conditions more details about the experimental design the heating protocol and the analysis can be found in shehata et al 2022a in this study the final generated θ profiles denoted by shehata et al 2022a as θ final were used this dataset represents soil moisture with spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 m and 1 day respectively over the whole length of the heated sections 450 m and a total duration of 76 days 2 2 determination of the number and locations of the required calibration curves the hypothesis investigated in this study is that the information contained in the spatial structure of the λ profiles obtained from the sphp fo cable while the soil dries up from nearly saturated conditions induced by a large precipitation event or inundation by irrigation water can be useful in clustering the data into several clusters which can guide the task of optimizing the number and allocation of the required calibration stations in this study we present and test a new methodology to optimize the number and placement of the calibration stations based on this hypothesis a flowchart of the algorithm steps is presented in fig 2 hierarchical clustering of the λ measurements was performed to assess the spatial structure of λ the euclidian distance was used as a similarity measure between the different observations then the average linkage function was used to construct the hierarchical tree and a dendrogram plot was created to represent the results the cophenetic correlation coefficient introduced by sokal and rohlf 1962 was used to assess how well the constructed hierarchical tree represents the data the cophenetic correlation coefficient is defined as 1 c l m d l m d t l m t l m d l m d 2 l m t l m t 2 where d l m and t l m are the euclidian distance and the linkage distance between the observations l and m respectively d is the mean euclidian distance for all observations and t is the mean linkage distance between all observations the closer the cophenetic correlation coefficient is to the optimal value of 1 the more the hierarchical tree is representing the actual data accurately the next step in the algorithm is to determine the number of representative clusters in the data although identifying the number of clusters is in many cases straightforward by visual inspection of the dendrogram plot two commonly used criteria to find the optimal number of clusters were also tested the first tested criterion is the variance ratio criterion vrc caliński and harabasz 1974 which is defined for a number of clusters k as follows 2 v r c k ss between ss within n obs k k 1 where ss between is the overall between cluster variance ss within is the overall within cluster variance and n obs is the number of observations the optimal number of clusters corresponds to the highest observed vrc value the second tested criterion is the davies bouldin criterion db davies and bouldin 1979 which is defined as follows 3 d b k 1 k a 1 k max a b d a d b d a b where d a is the average distance between each point in the cluster a and its centroid d b is the average distance between each point in the cluster b and its centroid and d a b is the euclidean distance between the centroids of the clusters a and b the optimal number of clusters corresponds to the smallest observed db value the function evalclusters in matlab was used to compute the values of both the vrc and db criteria corresponding to a number of clusters ranging from 2 to 50 once the optimal number of clusters was identified the percentage of the transect length represented by each cluster was calculated this information was then used to identify any clusters that would represent only a small portion of the transect length and their locations in the dataset if an examination of the area covered by the fo dts transect reveals that the variations in these small clusters are caused by factors not relevent to scope of the study then they can be neglected and treated as outliers in this study any clusters that represented less than 2 of the total transect length and or were caused by wildlife activity were considered to be outliers finally the minimum number of calibration stations was determined based on two criteria 1 each non outlier cluster has at least one station within it and 2 each selected station represented approximately the same percentage of the transect length if a cluster is represented by a single station based on the aforementioned criteria the best location for that station is determined to be the location of the cluster member that had the minimum average euclidian distance to all the other cluster members with respect to λ if a cluster was assigned a number of stations n greater than one the members of the cluster were sorted based on their average euclidian distance to all the other cluster members with respect to λ this sorted list of members was then used to subdivide the cluster into equal sized sub clusters representing the number of required stations the specific location of the required station within each sub cluster was identified to be the first member within that sub cluster in the sorted list i e the location associated with the minimum average euclidian distance to all the members of the original undivided cluster with respect to λ this methodology was tested on the data from days following the severe storm that occurred on april 18th and till the end of may once the number and locations of the calibration stations were determined using the proposed methodology the λ measurements were combined with the estimated θ final at those locations that were used in this context as virtual calibration stations and were used to train a gp model to test if this model will be able to regenerate the θ final profiles over the whole 76 days period 2 3 gp model and the validation procedure the gp models used to predict θ in this study have the same properties as the gp model used by shehata et al 2022a to predict the soil moisture profiles the models used a rational quadratic kernel with no basis function and included the following predictors which provide information about the spatial variation in soil characteristics to predict θ at spatial location i and day j 1 distance at spatial location i and day j 2 observed λ at spatial location i and day j 3 average and maximum thermal conductivity observed at spatial location i over the 76 days 4 observed average ambient temperature before applying the heat pulses at spatial location i and day j 5 average soil moisture observed at all the selected stations on that day over the 450 m transect 6 reduction in λ observed at spatial location i on the first and second days of drainage after the april 18th severe storm after which the whole site soil reached near saturation the θ profiles obtained from the trained gp models were compared against the original θ final profiles observed using the same statistical parameters used by shehata et al 2022a namely the root mean square error rmse m 3 m 3 mean bias mbe m 3 m 3 maximum absolute error mae m 3 m 3 and the normalized nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nnse unitless 2 4 validation of the methodology using a monte carlo simulation a monte carlo simulation was performed to assess if the number of calibration stations selected using the hierarchical clustering approach was adequate to represent the variability observed along the fo transect and to assess if the locations optimized from the hierarchical clustering performed better than randomly distributing the stations along the fo transect calibration stations in the range from 1 to 20 were tested with each number in that range being represented by 1000 iterations in the monte carlo simulation the maximum number of stations tested was capped at 20 because the purpose of the hc clustering is to minimize the number of stations originally scattered along the transect 20 original stations including one malfunctioning station in each iteration the following two step approach was used to select the locations of the required number of stations 1 initial locations of the calibration stations were obtained by assuming the stations to be equally spaced over the whole transect length 2 the final locations of the calibration stations were then obtained by adding a random displacement in the range from 20 to 20 m to their initial locations estimated in the first step this approach was used to avoid the unrealistic scenarios in which the stations are concentrated in a small portion of the transect the λ measurements for each iteration were combined with the estimated θ final from the selected locations and used to train a new gp model the rmse mbe mae and nnse statistical measures were again used to assess the gain in accuracy corresponding to increasing the number of calibration stations and were also used to compare the results of the monte carlo simulation against those resulting from the proposed methodology 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the number and locations of the calibration stations the dendrogram plot representing the resulting hierarchical tree of the λ data following the severe storm on april 18th is shown in fig 3 a cophenetic correlation coefficient of 0 78 was estimated for this hierarchical tree which demonstrates that the hierarchical tree sufficiently represents the λ data the dendrogram plot indicated that the data along the whole fo transect can be split into four main clusters this is consistent with the optimal number of clusters of 4 identified by the vrc and db criteria see fig 4 two of these clusters represented a total of 2 of the transect and therefore were considered outliers especially because they mainly represented locations where the soil was disturbed around the fo cable by the observed wildlife activity in the field this highlights one of the important advantages of the proposed methodology which is its ability to identify notably different locations along the transect before installing the calibration stations these locations can then be inspected closely to identify the reason behind the observed differences which can lead to a better understanding of the processes that caused them the other two main clusters identified hereafter by clusters 1 and 2 represent 80 6 and 17 6 of the transect respectively according to the presented methodology if one station was used to represent cluster 2 four more stations will be needed in cluster 1 to have each station represent 20 of the whole transect this suggests that the minimum required number of stations is five stations nevertheless the cases of using five and ten calibration stations were both investigated to check the gain in accuracy associated with doubling the number of stations the exact locations of these stations were identified following the proposed methodology presented in section 2 2 the results of the θ profiles generated using gp models trained by the data from the selected locations are presented in fig 5 a b for the cases of five and ten calibration locations respectively the results were binned in 0 001 m3m 3 bins to generate their histogram which provided a sense of the distribution of the predictions at different error rates in comparison to the original θ final profiles using five or ten calibration stations resulted in a similar rmse of 0 03 m3m 3 with negligible bias however the probability distributions of both cases illustrate that using a larger number of calibration stations resulted in a slight reduction of the overall spreading of the θ predictions but managed to slightly increase the percentage of predictions with errors 5 this can also be inferred from the higher nnse values observed in the case with ten calibration locations the results of the monte carlo simulation for the cases of five and ten calibration locations were compared against the predictions from the proposed methodology see fig 5c f the spread of predictions from the monte carlo simulation illustrates the uncertainty associated with performing the calibration of an sphp transect based on the measurements from calibration stations scattered at random locations along its length the predictions obtained from the proposed methodology however managed to have statistics comparable to the 10 best iterations of the monte carlo simulation for the cases of five and ten selected stations this finding illustrates that for this particular case study the proposed optimization methodology for selecting the locations of the calibration stations is by far more efficient and reliable than randomly spreading the calibration locations along the fo transect the monte carlo simulation was performed to explore the impact of introducing additional calibration stations on the accuracy of the estimated θ the evolution of the different statistical measures of the predictions as the number of calibration locations increases from one to 20 is presented in fig 6 the mean and the range of all the statistical measures improved significantly as the number of calibration locations increased from one to four the mean rmse and mae dropped from 0 22 to 0 04 m3m 3 and from 0 43 to 0 15 m3m 3 respectively the mbe also dropped from 0 19 m3m 3 to near zero the gain in the accuracy improvement per the added station beyond the initial four stations was observed to be minimal which suggests that four strategically placed stations were sufficient to capture the heterogeneity of θ at this specific site 4 conclusion this study introduced a new methodology to optimize the number and locations of the calibration stations required to encompass the variability in the λ θ relationship along a single probe heat pulse distributed temperature sensing transect the essence of the new methodology is to apply hierarchical clustering i e unsupervised clustering to the λ time series observed along the fo transect while the soil dries up following a large precipitation event or heavy irrigation in other words similar clusters are automatically identified thus providing guidelines for soil probe allocation in turn the resulting clustering tree and the weights of each cluster can be used to estimate the minimum number and the best locations of the calibration stations the new methodology was applied to field data in oklahoma doe arm site and its θ predictions were compared against the results of a monte carlo simulation aimed at testing different combinations of the number of stations and their random locations the results showed that the gp model trained with the calibration stations selected by the proposed methodology had accuracy comparable to the best 10 iterations of the monte carlo simulation in which the calibration locations were assigned randomly furthermore the proposed methodology managed to provide a good estimate of the number of calibration stations required at this site to encompass the bulk of the spatial variability in the λ θ relationship nevertheless the proposed optimization methodology has limited applicability in optimizing dts systems installed in arid regions or at deep depths because reaching nearly saturated conditions required for the optimization methodology to work is difficult under those scenarios further research is needed to find alternative methodologies suitable for such conditions for example information from a period in which soil moisture increases due to a rainfall event after extremely dry initial conditions could be used to develop a similar methodology suitable for arid regions as these conditions will be easier to attain than the nearly saturated conditions utilized in this study applying the proposed methodology before deploying the calibration stations will optimize the number and the location of the stations and reduces the cost associated with calibrating large sphp fo transects in addition the proposed methodology has the potential to optimize the number of calibration stations used in passive dts installations by clustering the measured thermal diffusivity or the observed temperature variation instead of the thermal conductivity measurements used in the sphp fo transects nevertheless further studies are still needed to assess how the proposed methodology will perform in sphp fo and passive transects installed in fields with different soil types and different levels of soil

2067,an in depth investigation on hydrological connectivity and its relationships with water level are fundamental for regional water replenishment management in this research an integrated connectivity diagnostics and dependency analysis framework icddaf was developed for determining the optimal ecological water level in baiyangdian wetland north china it consisted of two core modules hydrological connectivity diagnostics hcd and hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis hc wlca the results were as follows 1 in the hcd module remote sensing coupling geostatistical connectivity function methods can accurately evaluate the hydrological connectivity considering the directional difference and the validity of distance range for intra annual variations the hydrological connectivity was relatively good in march at the monthly scale spring at the seasonal scale and the west east direction while relatively weak in september and summer which were related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth overall terrain and flow direction for inter annual variations it was generally weak and showed a downwards then upwards and finally downwards trend 2 in the hc wlca module multivariate copula analysis toolbox was innovatively adopted to describe the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level beta and generalized pareto distributions were selected as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level indicators respectively and frank copula was determined as the optimal joint distribution function the modelling uncertainty in the coexistence relationships was focused 3 the water level of 7 m was determined as the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment considering the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level such an icddaf can provide a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations under different water replenishment schemes aiming to achieve ecological restoration of wetlands keywords hydrological connectivity water level remote sensing geostatistical connectivity function multivariate copula analysis toolbox data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction hydrological connectivity refers to the transfer of matter energy and organisms mediated by water within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle freeman et al 2007 pringle 2003 it is not only the main abiotic driving factor of wetland ecological processes but also an important embodiment of wetland ecosystem function shao et al 2020 due to the dual impacts of climate change and human activities wetland landscapes have become fragmented and hydrological connectivity has also been seriously damaged leading to a decline in wetland biodiversity and service functions wu et al 2021 to repair the damaged ecological environment a series of water replenishment measures have been adopted for wetlands at home and abroad thus increasing the inflow and improving the water level and hydrological connectivity such as in baiyangdian wetland bydw which is the largest shallow lake in north china sun et al 2022 therefore the research on variation rules and coexistence relationships of hydrological regimes have become a hot issue of concern to international scholars and lake restoration managers singh and sinha 2019 xie et al 2020 numerous evaluation methods have been proposed to assess hydrological connectivity including in situ monitoring park and latrubesse 2017 graph theory liu et al 2019b remote sensing li et al 2022a bottleneck methods rolls et al 2018 isotope tracing lu et al 2021 connectivity index methods li et al 2021a and hydrological models tan et al 2021 for example graph theory can generalize stream networks by the geometric topological relationships of points and lines to characterize the hydrological connectivity of water bodies liu et al 2020b in addition based on landscape connectivity theory the connectivity index methods can reflect the relationships between different landscape patterns and hydrological connectivity shao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the remote sensing methods have great potential in tracking hydrological connectivity characteristics with the advantages of easy data accessibility large spatiotemporal scale and high resolution nguyen et al 2021 the amount of 131 landsat images were utilized by liu et al 2020b to explore the temporal evolutionary law and driving mechanisms of hydrological connectivity in poyang lake based on insar technology liu et al 2020a analysed the variation characteristics of hydrological connectivity in bydw and clarified the distribution pattern of hydraulic barriers however remote sensing methods only qualitatively characterize the hydrological connectivity of water bodies without providing quantitative results in recent years the geostatistical connectivity function gcf method has become an emerging approach for the quantitative evaluation of hydrological connectivity li et al 2021b tan et al 2021 by developing a connectivity index it can accurately assess hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range and achieve fine and reasonable description results tan et al 2019 adopted the gcf method to quantify the hydrological connectivity of poyang lake and demonstrated the reliability of such an approach thus it is desirable for an integrated approach coupling remote sensing technology and gcf method to comprehensively explore the evolutionary characteristics of hydrological connectivity accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity is an essential foundation for exploring the coexistence relationships among hydrological regimes generally water level is considered as the hydrological indicator with the greatest impact on hydrological connectivity and there exist inseparable coexistence relationships between them li et al 2020 tan et al 2019 the increase in inflow leads to the rise of the water level and the expansion of the flooded area further affecting hydrological connectivity distributions water replenishment management is a multi objective decision making scheme involving multiple elements such as water source volume route time and consumption the coexistence relationships would feed back to each link of regulation process and bring challenges to water replenishment management bu et al 2022 han et al 2022 thus on the basis of accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity it is necessary to reveal such relationships and take joint effects into consideration of water replenishment management thus providing support for ecological restoration of wetlands it is worth noting that modelling uncertainty generated in quantifying coexistence relationships is also a key issue that needs urgent attention however there are still insufficient studies on the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level and the uncertainty zhang et al 2017 in the hydrological field the copula analysis method has been widely used due to its advantage to effectively quantify the correlation of multiple variables luo et al 2021 zang et al 2022 employed the copula analysis method to assess the eutrophication risk for the miyun reservoir considering joint effects of water quality and water quantity the copula analysis method was adopted by cai et al 2019 to quantify the relationships between water and energy resources for coupled risk management of water energy nexus systems to date the copula based method has not been reported in the field of hydrological connectivity analysis therefore it is a very useful innovation to apply the copula analysis method to quantifying the coexistence relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level as well as modelling uncertainty in this research bydw will be employed as a case study to establish an integrated connectivity diagnostics and dependency analysis framework icddaf through the combination of remote sensing gcf and copula analysis methods the objectives are as follows 1 evaluate the variation characteristics of hydrological connectivity considering the directional difference and the validity of distance range 2 quantify the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level and modelling uncertainty and 3 determine the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment the adoption of icddaf can develop a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on the coexistence analysis between hydrological connectivity and water level offer a more useful tool for the accurate evaluation of hydrological connectivity and provide strategic references for water replenishment management 2 study area and data sources as the largest freshwater lake in the north china plain bydw fig 1 38 43 39 02 n 115 38 116 07 e covers an area of approximately 366 km2 it is located in a semiarid region with a significant semiarid temperate continental monsoon climate zhang et al 2022b due to the unique geographic location it plays an important role in conserving water sources regulating climate and maintaining biodiversity zhang et al 2022a there are 143 sub lakes and more than 3700 channels together with connections via rivers lakes fields and villages which not only creates a unique landscape but also exacerbates serious wetland fragmentation han et al 2022 although receiving water from nine upstream rivers it still faces severe ecological problems including water surface area shrinkage water pollution biological resource reduction and ecological function degradation han et al 2020 with the establishment of the xiong an new area bydw has drawn increasing attention li et al 2022b a series of efforts have been made by the chinese government to restore its ecological service functions for instance some water diversion projects including the yellow river diversion project and the south to north water diversion project have been conducted to alleviate its problems of water level decreases and water quality deterioration caused by the decrease in inflow yan et al 2017 since 1981 it has received ecological water replenishment more than 50 times within and across river basins since 2018 hebei province has coordinated multiple water sources to supply more than 4 37 billion m3 of ecological water to bydw thus maintaining a water level of approximately 7 2 m and a water surface area of more than 250 km2 and effectively improving its water ecological environment the research data included were mainly as follows 1 remote sensing image data obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https glovis usgs gov through long time series of data from 1990 to 2020 combined with remote sensing and gcf methods gcf value could be obtained to analyse variations in hydrological connectivity 2 water level data the historical data in the same period were mainly derived from the hydrological data of the haihe river basin and daqinghe river system in the hydrological yearbook of the national library of china http www nlc cn additionally the daily water level data of shifangyuan hydrological station provided by the ministry of water resources http xxfb mwr cn index html were also employed as a supplement 3 methodology 3 1 an icddaf for diagnosing hydrological connectivity variations and coexistence relationships with water levels the accurate hydrological connectivity diagnostics is important to reveal the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level therefore an icddaf fig 2 was proposed for deeply investigating hydrological connectivity variations and their coexistence relationships with water levels thus providing support for water replenishment management it mainly contains two core modules 1 hydrological connectivity diagnostics hcd module remote sensing and gcf methods were coupled to comprehensively evaluate the hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range further obtaining accurate diagnostic results 2 hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis hc wlca module copula analysis method was innovatively adopted to conduct the dependency analysis of water level and hydrological connectivity as well as the uncertainty of their relationships these two modules were closely linked through responses of hydrological connectivities to water level variations thus achieving the accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity and the rational exploration of dependency between hydrological connectivity and water level then according to the joint and conditional probability analyses efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations can be further suggested under different water replenishment schemes finally the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management could be determined considering multiple ecological objectives and requirements such as maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment 3 2 remote sensing technology landsat tm etm oli satellite remote sensing data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were chosen as the main data source during the study period 122 historical images covering bydw worldwide reference system path number 123 row number 33 were selected to assess variations in hydrological connectivity whose cloud coverage was less than 5 subsequently the remote sensing images were preprocessed by radiometric calibration atmospheric correction removal of null values image mosaicking and clipping using envi 5 3 software sánchez de miguel et al 2021 the water boundary can be delineated by an index such as the modified normalized difference water index mndwi or the normalized difference water index ndwi the mndwi can enhance the contrast between buildings and water bodies significantly and distinguish water bodies from shadows which make it more conducive to the accurate extraction of water bodies chen et al 2020 therefore the mndwi was employed to extract the water body information which can be described as follows 1 m n d w i g s w i r g s w i r where g and s w i r are the reflectance of the green and swir bands respectively to accurately extract the distribution information of water bodies in remote sensing images an otsu algorithm otsu 1979 was proposed to determine the threshold value once the histogram statistical information of mndwi grayscale images was output by envi software an optimal threshold value could be obtained according to the otsu algorithm with matlab thus separating water bodies from the background effectively finally a manual visual interpretation method was employed to check whether the extraction results conformed to the actual situation and to obtain the reference map for accuracy evaluation comparing the water body classification results obtained by manual visual interpretation with the mndwi as well as combining them with the precision evaluation module of envi software the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient parameters obtained from the confusion matrix were applied to verify the water extraction results cordeiro et al 2021 the validation results of water extraction showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were in a range of 85 99 and 0 70 0 90 respectively indicating satisfactory accuracy by the mndwi 3 3 geostatistical connectivity function method the gcf method developed by trigg et al 2013 was applied to characterizing the hydrological connectivity based on the multipoint statistics of wet dry binary state data gcf value was constructed to quantify the probability that any two target objects located within a certain distance range along a specified direction were connected it can describe the water landscape structure and reflect the internal connectivity of target objects effectively as follows 2 g c f n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where n is the total number of locations u j is the cell number z c is the threshold value z u j is the value of the cell is the product operator and i u j z c is an indicator for determining whether the variable z u j at location u j exceeds the threshold value z c if z u j z c then i u j z c 1 and it can be defined as a wet cell if i u j z c 0 then otherwise it can be defined as a dry cell it was operated from the starting location u 1 to all possible locations within the study site the higher the spatial entropy of the computational domain is the faster gcf n z c approaches zero as n increases at any given distance the gcf value refers to the proportion of connected points within a specific distance range along the given direction 0 g c f 1 the greater the hydrological connectivity is the closer the gcf value is to 1 the calculation process of the gcf value can be described as follows 1 wet dry binary grid images were obtained from the operated remote sensing data 2 the connected areas were identified and marked 3 the total number of wet cell pairs was calculated in any given direction i e along east west or south north at a given distance scale 4 the number of wet cell pairs belonging to the same connected area was calculated in combination with the above connected area marking information and 5 the fraction of connected pairs of wet cells to total pairs of wet cells was expressed as the gcf value therefore the connectivity function curve could be obtained according to the calculation of gcf values at different distance scales a simple illustrated example is presented in fig 3 3 4 copula analysis copula analysis is an effective method of constructing joint distribution and describing correlations among multiple random variables cai et al 2021b sklar 1959 first introduced the copula theorem and proposed the following let h be a joint cumulative distribution function with marginal univariate distributions f and g then there exists a unique copula c satisfying an expression of eq 3 when f and g are continuous 3 h x y c f x g y the calculation process of traditional copula analysis method tcam can be described as follows 1 conduct the multivariate correlation analysis 2 select the optimal marginal distribution from candidate distribution functions see table s1 in supplementary material by parameters estimation applying the maximum likelihood method and goodness of fit test 3 select the optimal joint distribution from candidate copula functions through the parameters estimation employing the maximum likelihood method and goodness of fit test however tcam faced two dilemmas in previous studies 1 the choice of optimal joint distribution was often limited to some fixed copula function types and 2 the maximum likelihood method was prone to local optimization and difficult to determine the reliability of the results cai et al 2021a the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat proposed by sadegh et al 2017 provides an effective approach to overcome the abovementioned limitations it contains 26 copula families including a number of copula families that have not been fully explored which expands the range of options see table s2 in supplementary material in addition local optimization and markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation methods are combined within a bayesian framework to infer parameters and construct a prediction uncertainty range of copula families thus realizing the quantification of modelling uncertainty and the robust estimation of global optimal parameter therefore mvcat was employed to describe the dependency structure of hydrological connectivity and water level and their uncertainty in mvcat a bayesian framework with a residual based gaussian likelihood function is conducted for estimating parameters and quantifying modeling uncertainty of 26 copula families when new information is acquired bayes theorem can update the prior probability of a certain hypothesis attribute all underlying modeling uncertainty to parameters and further estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters by 4 p θ y p θ p y θ p y 5 p θ y p θ p y θ 6 l θ y n 2 l n i 1 n y i y i θ 2 n where p θ and p θ y are the prior and posterior distributions of parameters respectively θ represents the estimated parameters n is the sample size y is the joint probability of the observed variables p y θ l θ y denotes the likelihood function and p y is a constant value due to the computational difficulties of bayes equations the mcmc simulation method was adopted to sample from the posterior distribution the hybrid evolution mcmc benefits from an intelligent starting point selection and employs adaptive metropolis differential evolution and snooker update algorithms to search the feasible space thus obtaining the estimated parameters of the global optimal solution together with its posterior distribution andrieu and thoms 2008 compared with the local optimization algorithm the mcmc algorithm can have a wider calculation range to ensure global optimal parameters and describe the underlying uncertainty of parameters more effectively multiple goodness of fit indicators were adopted to evaluate the performance of different marginal and joint distribution functions such as likelihood value akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which are calculated as follows yue

of gcf values at all distance scales was taken as the indicator of hydrological connectivity since bydw freezes in winter the study mainly focused on spring summer and autumn from march to november besides the hydrological connectivity in different directions of west east w e north south n s northwest southwest ne sw and northeast southeast nw se were considered the intra annual variations of gcf values in bydw from 1990 to 2020 are shown in fig 4 as seen from fig 4 the highest gcf value appeared in march while the lowest value occurred in september in addition the gcf value in spring 0 158 was significantly the highest followed by autumn 0 084 and summer 0 082 which was probably related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth phragmites australis is the most widely distributed typical plant with an area of approximately 100 km2 accounting for 32 of the total area in bydw wang et al 2012 in spring phragmites australis is in a germination stage with thin and short rhizomes reducing the resistance on water flow therefore the hydrological connectivity in spring is significantly higher than that in summer and autumn similarly the frozen water melts in march and there are few obstacles to water flow caused by the growth of phragmites australis these favourable factors make the maximum hydrological connectivity in march however phragmites australis gradually matures with thick and large rhizomes in summer the strong blocking effect on water flow makes the minimum hydrological connectivity in summer moreover the local government usually organizes the harvesting of phragmites australis in october to protect ecological environment thus improving the hydrological connectivity the results were consistent with those of li et al 2021c fig 4 shows that the highest gcf value appeared in a w e direction 0 137 which was generally consistent with the overall terrain and main flow direction of bydw next were the ne sw 0 108 and n s 0 102 directions the lowest value occurred in the nw se direction 0 087 this showed that hydrological connectivity was closely related to regional topography and the hydrological connectivity along the water flow direction was generally the highest 4 1 2 inter annual hydrological connectivity variations the inter annual gcf values of bydw at the yearly scale are shown in fig 5 the gcf values were lower than 0 15 indicating the generally weak hydrological connectivity from 1990 to 2020 the highest gcf value appeared in 1990 while the lowest value occurred in 2005 taking 2005 as the dividing line the hydrological connectivity showed a downwards and then upwards trend since the 1980s due to the climate drought demographic explosion and river blockage bydw has frequently dried up and had sharply reduced inflow runoff in 2004 approximately 160 million m3 of water resources was supplied through the yuehe diversion project since 2006 interbasin water diversion projects such as the yellow river diversion project have been implemented to alleviate its water shortage dilemma hence the hydrological connectivity has gradually improved since 2005 our results were basically consistent with those of zhang and wu 2018 however the hydrological connectivity began to decline sharply after 2015 which may be related to the unreasonable occupation of wetlands in recent years massive illegal sand mining has led to great changes in the river regime forming irregular and unstable river banks seriously affecting the hydrological connectivity park et al 2020 liu et al 2020a pointed out that hydrological barriers affected hydrological connectivity in urban areas high elevation reed grasslands and some cultivated areas within bydw yan and niu 2019 found that although the water shortage crisis was alleviated in bydw through water diversion projects its ecosystem was still degraded with aggravated plaque fragmentation resulting in a reduction in hydrological connectivity therefore the hydrological connectivity in bydw was not as good as expected and more effective measures are needed for improvement 4 2 coexistence analysis of hydrological connectivity and water level 4 2 1 dependency analysis analysing the dependency of multiple factors was a prerequisite for exploring their joint distribution characteristics fig 6 shows the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level variations at different time scales at both monthly and seasonal scales hydrological connectivity and water level indicated the consistency characteristics of firstly downwards and then upwards trends fig 6 a shows that the highest values of hydrological connectivity and water level both appeared in march while the lowest values appeared in september and june respectively the obvious abrupt change point occurred in september which was related to the phenological characteristics of phragmites australis and human activities in june the mature phragmites australis has large obstruction to hydrological connectivity and its strong evapotranspiration increases the water consumption resulting in the lowest of water level at this time subsequently local government would implement the ecological water replenishment projects in september and harvest phragmites australis in october to improve ecological environment of the wetland these efforts raised the hydrological connectivity and water level leading to the minimum of hydrological connectivity in september fig 6 b shows that the highest values of hydrological connectivity and water level both appeared in spring while the lowest values occurred in summer however fig 6 c shows that hydrological connectivity and water level had insignificant relevant characteristics at the yearly scale their statistical parameters at monthly seasonal and yearly scales were provided in tables s3 s5 of supplementary material respectively then kendall spearman and pearson correlation coefficients were used to further examine the relationships between these two variables table 1 shows that three correlation coefficients were larger than 0 with all passing the significance test at 5 therefore there was a certain positive correlation between hydrological connectivity and water level in bydw 4 2 2 marginal distributions of hydrological connectivity and water level various distribution functions e g beta gamma and normal distributions were applied to simulating the distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level with the help of mvcat the parameters bic and aic of marginal distributions were obtained as shown in table 2 for hydrological connectivity and water level the aic and bic values of beta distribution and generalized pareto distribution were the least respectively thus beta and generalized pareto distributions were chosen as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level respectively as expressed in table s6 of supplementary material their marginal distribution curves fig 7 also showed good fitting results 4 2 3 joint distribution of hydrological connectivity and water level twenty six copula functions e g frank t gaussian clayton and gumble were used to simulate the joint distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level by using the goodness test of fit the top five optimal joint distributions were the frank t gaussian clayton and gumbel copula functions as shown in table 3 and fig 8 among these copula functions the aic and bic values of the frank copula were the lowest which had a better fitting result therefore the frank copula function was determined as the optimal joint distribution function which were expressed in table s6 of supplementary material 4 2 4 modelling uncertainty the uncertainty generated in the parameter estimation process were quantified through mvcat which are shown in table 4 the local optimal parameters of tcam were expressed as fixed values which were prone to error however within the bayesian framework and mcmc simulation the posterior distributions of global optimal parameters could be estimated fig 9 as interval ranges thus realizing the characterization of modelling uncertainty and improving the estimation accuracy in addition the rmses of the estimated parameters of the top five copula functions with the best fitting by mvcat were lower than those by tcam and nses had the opposite results indicating the superiority of mvcat 5 discussion 5 1 determination of the optimal ecological water level 5 1 1 joint probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level ingeneral the coexistence relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level may create challenges for water replenishment decision therefore joint and conditional probabilities were examined to determine the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment according to the statistical distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level they were divided into four levels by the quartile method and classification criteria are shown in table 5 according to the established frank copula function the joint probabilities of 16 schemes with different hydrological connectivities and water levels are shown in fig 10 the highest joint probability 0 10 appeared in the event of a superior water level and excellent hydrological connectivity and the lowest 0 03 occurred in the event of a low water level and excellent hydrological connectivity with the improvement of water level the joint probabilities causing the same medium good and excellent hydrological connectivity events continued to increase while the low hydrological connectivity event was the opposite however with the improvement of hydrological connectivity the changing laws of joint probability causing the same low medium high and superior water level events were different in addition the joint probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level synchronization combinations low low medium medium good high and excellent superior were 0 31 indicating the strong synchronization relationships between the two hydrological indicators therefore considering joint probability results managers could take measures to regulate water level and hydrological connectivity according to whether joint events are beneficial to the ecological environment thus realizing the water replenishment management of bydw 5 1 2 conditional probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level to determine the optimal ecological water level conducive to hydrological connectivity conditional probabilities where gcf value belonged to any specific hydrological connectivity event under a specific water level were studied as shown in fig 11 with increasing water level the probability of a low hydrological connectivity event decreased while the probability of medium good and excellent hydrological connectivity events increased in addition when the water level was lower than 7 m the probability of a low hydrological connectivity event was the highest followed by medium and good hydrological connectivity events and a excellent hydrological connectivity event was the lowest however when the water level exceeded 8 m the results were completely opposite when the water level was 7 7 5 m the probability of a medium hydrological connectivity event exceeded that of a low hydrological connectivity event indicating the occurrence possibility of a medium hydrological connectivity event was the greatest at 7 7 5 m similarly the occurrence possibility of hydrological connectivity events at other levels showed that the transition range of water level was 7 5 8 m hence 7 8 m was the key water level range for the transition of the hydrological connectivity state when the water level exceeded 7 m the hydrological connectivity of bydw gradually improved which agreed with previous studies liu et al 2019a the planning outline for the xiong an new area in hebei province required that the water level of bydw should be adjusted to within 6 5 7 0 m yan et al 2020 our research results validated the rationality of government decision managment therefore combined with the baiyangdian ecological environment management and protection plan 2018 2035 managers should establish a multisource water replenishment mechanism amd make overall planning of ecological water resources that includes rivers within and across the basin reservoir water and reclaimed water through effective water replenishment management the annual ecological water replenishment of bydw should be ensured to be more than 300 million m3 and the water level should be retained above 7 m to maintain good hydrological connectivity and restore the ecological environment 5 2 advantages of icddaf the proposed icddaf incorporated hcd and hc wlca modules into an integrated framework with the aim to determine the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management accurate diagnostics of hydrological connectivity variations using hcd module can provide a solid foundation for the hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis using hc wlca module such an integrated framework has important practical guiding significance for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations the advantages of icddaf were as follows 1 through the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis hcd module could obtain accurate diagnostic results of hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range by coupling remote sensing and gcf methods for example a comprehensive index consisting of several landscape pattern indices was developed by li et al 2021c to assess the hydrological connectivity in bydw although the comprehensive index can effectively quantify the structural characteristics of hydrological connectivity the evaluation results were partial and approximate as it cannot represent the change laws of hydrological connectivity in different directions or within a certain distance range the proposed diagnostic method considered the directional difference and the validity of distance range enabling more accurate sketching of hydrological connectivity 2 hc wlca module not only extended the application of mvcat in the hydrological connectivity analysis field but also overcame the limitations of fewer distribution types and local optimization in tcam combined with the advantage that copula analysis method can effectively quantify multivariable relationships mvcat was innovatively included in the icddaf to conduct the coexistence analysis between hydrological connectivity and water level proving a new perspective for their dependency analysis moreover the global optimal parameters were quantified into interval ranges to characterize the modelling uncertainty within bayesian framework and mcmc simulation 3 icddaf could realize the regulation of water level and hydrological connectivity under different water replenishment schemes combining with the fine diagnosis of hydrological connectivity and the response analysis of connectivity to water level variations the optimal ecological water level was determined to achieve the expected ecological goals based on joint and conditional probability analyses such an icddaf can develop a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations and provide references for ecological restoration considering multiple ecological objectives 5 3 implications and future research in recent years a number of water replenishment projects have been launched for bydw enhancing the hydrodynamic conditions and improving the hydrological connectivity zeng et al 2021 however such improvement of hydrological connectivity remains two sided on the one hand the ameliorate of hydrological connectivity can improve the efficiency of material energy and biological exchanges further promoting the healthy state of ecosystem on the other hand the ameliorate of hydrological connectivity may accelerate the migration and diffusion of pollutants leading to a series of ecological problems such as the aggravation of eutrophication and the decline of aquatic biological resources wang et al 2022 dou et al 2022 pointed out that the hydrological connectivity project in wuhan urban lakes can reduce the potential risk of heavy metals in highly polluted lake sediments while it may bring secondary pollution to low pollution lakes although the hydrological connectivity project can bring positive effects on water resource utilization it may lead to secondary ecological environmental risks such as pollutant migration flood risk and environmental deterioration jiang et al 2018 for bydw a typical shallow lake its eutrophication problem has not been fundamentally solved due to the continuous accumulation of inorganic salts and organic matter in the water bodies for a long time han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 yang et al 2022 excessive hydrological connectivity and water level may change its hydrodynamic conditions intensify the diffusion of pollutants in the sediment and aggravate ecological degradation therefore it will be necessary to determine the appropriate thresholds of hydrological connectivity and water level to achieve the optimal management of shallow lakes in the future research identifying the influencing factors of hydrological connectivity will be a key issue many studies have shown that natural conditions and human activities are the main factors driving the evolution of hydrological connectivity zhang et al 2021 as for the aspect of natural conditions climate change e g precipitation and drought is the most crucial factor and some environmental factors e g soil characteristics vegetation and topography can also impact on hydrological connectivity nanda et al 2019 as for the aspect of human activities dredging cofferdams dismantlement dam construction groundwater extraction water flow regulation and diversion and land management have complex effects on hydrological connectivity robinson et al 2015 scordo et al 2023 it becomes very complicated to reveal the evolution mechanism of hydrological connectivity as so many influencing factors usually act together therefore more mechanism models e g mike efdc and swat models are desirable to be coupled into the framework to clarify the evolution process of hydrological connectivity elucidate the flow paths of matter and energy further revealing its response mechanism to hydrodynamics water quality and aquatic ecology under the background of climate change and human disturbances it is urgent to reveal the evolution law dynamic mechanism and influencing factors of hydrological connectivity with combining advanced monitoring means and model technologies thus providing references for wetland ecological restoration 6 conclusions an icddaf was proposed to determine the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management it consisted of two core modules of hcd and hc wlca playing hydrological connectivity diagnostics and hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis roles respectively it could diagnose hydrological connectivity variations considering the directional difference and validity of distance range through the combination of remote sensing and gcf methods providing more comprehensive evaluation of hydrological connectivity over traditional approaches moreover mvcat was adopted to reflect the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level and modelling uncertainty this not only extended the application of mvcat in the hydrological connectivity analysis field but also overcame the limitations of fewer distribution types and local optimization in tcam then the optimal ecological water level was determined for water replenishment practice based on the joint and conditional probability analyses of hydrological connectivity and water level in conclusion such an icddaf provided a new perspective to determine appropriate water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations considering the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level the icddaf was applied to determining the optimal water level in bydw and the results were as follows 1 for intra annual variations the hydrological connectivity was relatively good in march at the monthly scale spring at the seasonal scale and the w e direction while relatively weak in september and summer which were related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth overall terrain and flow direction for inter annual variations it was generally weak and showed a downwards and then upwards trend however it began to decline sharply after 2015 which may be related to human activities 2 beta and generalized pareto distributions were selected as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level indicators respectively and the frank copula was determined as the optimal joint distribution function the modelling uncertainty were characterized as interval ranges 3 a water level of 7 m was determined as the optimal ecological water level to maintain good hydrological connectivity and ecological restoration these results demonstrated the

2067,an in depth investigation on hydrological connectivity and its relationships with water level are fundamental for regional water replenishment management in this research an integrated connectivity diagnostics and dependency analysis framework icddaf was developed for determining the optimal ecological water level in baiyangdian wetland north china it consisted of two core modules hydrological connectivity diagnostics hcd and hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis hc wlca the results were as follows 1 in the hcd module remote sensing coupling geostatistical connectivity function methods can accurately evaluate the hydrological connectivity considering the directional difference and the validity of distance range for intra annual variations the hydrological connectivity was relatively good in march at the monthly scale spring at the seasonal scale and the west east direction while relatively weak in september and summer which were related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth overall terrain and flow direction for inter annual variations it was generally weak and showed a downwards then upwards and finally downwards trend 2 in the hc wlca module multivariate copula analysis toolbox was innovatively adopted to describe the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level beta and generalized pareto distributions were selected as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level indicators respectively and frank copula was determined as the optimal joint distribution function the modelling uncertainty in the coexistence relationships was focused 3 the water level of 7 m was determined as the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment considering the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level such an icddaf can provide a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations under different water replenishment schemes aiming to achieve ecological restoration of wetlands keywords hydrological connectivity water level remote sensing geostatistical connectivity function multivariate copula analysis toolbox data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction hydrological connectivity refers to the transfer of matter energy and organisms mediated by water within or between elements of the hydrologic cycle freeman et al 2007 pringle 2003 it is not only the main abiotic driving factor of wetland ecological processes but also an important embodiment of wetland ecosystem function shao et al 2020 due to the dual impacts of climate change and human activities wetland landscapes have become fragmented and hydrological connectivity has also been seriously damaged leading to a decline in wetland biodiversity and service functions wu et al 2021 to repair the damaged ecological environment a series of water replenishment measures have been adopted for wetlands at home and abroad thus increasing the inflow and improving the water level and hydrological connectivity such as in baiyangdian wetland bydw which is the largest shallow lake in north china sun et al 2022 therefore the research on variation rules and coexistence relationships of hydrological regimes have become a hot issue of concern to international scholars and lake restoration managers singh and sinha 2019 xie et al 2020 numerous evaluation methods have been proposed to assess hydrological connectivity including in situ monitoring park and latrubesse 2017 graph theory liu et al 2019b remote sensing li et al 2022a bottleneck methods rolls et al 2018 isotope tracing lu et al 2021 connectivity index methods li et al 2021a and hydrological models tan et al 2021 for example graph theory can generalize stream networks by the geometric topological relationships of points and lines to characterize the hydrological connectivity of water bodies liu et al 2020b in addition based on landscape connectivity theory the connectivity index methods can reflect the relationships between different landscape patterns and hydrological connectivity shao et al 2019 previous studies have shown that the remote sensing methods have great potential in tracking hydrological connectivity characteristics with the advantages of easy data accessibility large spatiotemporal scale and high resolution nguyen et al 2021 the amount of 131 landsat images were utilized by liu et al 2020b to explore the temporal evolutionary law and driving mechanisms of hydrological connectivity in poyang lake based on insar technology liu et al 2020a analysed the variation characteristics of hydrological connectivity in bydw and clarified the distribution pattern of hydraulic barriers however remote sensing methods only qualitatively characterize the hydrological connectivity of water bodies without providing quantitative results in recent years the geostatistical connectivity function gcf method has become an emerging approach for the quantitative evaluation of hydrological connectivity li et al 2021b tan et al 2021 by developing a connectivity index it can accurately assess hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range and achieve fine and reasonable description results tan et al 2019 adopted the gcf method to quantify the hydrological connectivity of poyang lake and demonstrated the reliability of such an approach thus it is desirable for an integrated approach coupling remote sensing technology and gcf method to comprehensively explore the evolutionary characteristics of hydrological connectivity accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity is an essential foundation for exploring the coexistence relationships among hydrological regimes generally water level is considered as the hydrological indicator with the greatest impact on hydrological connectivity and there exist inseparable coexistence relationships between them li et al 2020 tan et al 2019 the increase in inflow leads to the rise of the water level and the expansion of the flooded area further affecting hydrological connectivity distributions water replenishment management is a multi objective decision making scheme involving multiple elements such as water source volume route time and consumption the coexistence relationships would feed back to each link of regulation process and bring challenges to water replenishment management bu et al 2022 han et al 2022 thus on the basis of accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity it is necessary to reveal such relationships and take joint effects into consideration of water replenishment management thus providing support for ecological restoration of wetlands it is worth noting that modelling uncertainty generated in quantifying coexistence relationships is also a key issue that needs urgent attention however there are still insufficient studies on the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level and the uncertainty zhang et al 2017 in the hydrological field the copula analysis method has been widely used due to its advantage to effectively quantify the correlation of multiple variables luo et al 2021 zang et al 2022 employed the copula analysis method to assess the eutrophication risk for the miyun reservoir considering joint effects of water quality and water quantity the copula analysis method was adopted by cai et al 2019 to quantify the relationships between water and energy resources for coupled risk management of water energy nexus systems to date the copula based method has not been reported in the field of hydrological connectivity analysis therefore it is a very useful innovation to apply the copula analysis method to quantifying the coexistence relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level as well as modelling uncertainty in this research bydw will be employed as a case study to establish an integrated connectivity diagnostics and dependency analysis framework icddaf through the combination of remote sensing gcf and copula analysis methods the objectives are as follows 1 evaluate the variation characteristics of hydrological connectivity considering the directional difference and the validity of distance range 2 quantify the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level and modelling uncertainty and 3 determine the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment the adoption of icddaf can develop a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on the coexistence analysis between hydrological connectivity and water level offer a more useful tool for the accurate evaluation of hydrological connectivity and provide strategic references for water replenishment management 2 study area and data sources as the largest freshwater lake in the north china plain bydw fig 1 38 43 39 02 n 115 38 116 07 e covers an area of approximately 366 km2 it is located in a semiarid region with a significant semiarid temperate continental monsoon climate zhang et al 2022b due to the unique geographic location it plays an important role in conserving water sources regulating climate and maintaining biodiversity zhang et al 2022a there are 143 sub lakes and more than 3700 channels together with connections via rivers lakes fields and villages which not only creates a unique landscape but also exacerbates serious wetland fragmentation han et al 2022 although receiving water from nine upstream rivers it still faces severe ecological problems including water surface area shrinkage water pollution biological resource reduction and ecological function degradation han et al 2020 with the establishment of the xiong an new area bydw has drawn increasing attention li et al 2022b a series of efforts have been made by the chinese government to restore its ecological service functions for instance some water diversion projects including the yellow river diversion project and the south to north water diversion project have been conducted to alleviate its problems of water level decreases and water quality deterioration caused by the decrease in inflow yan et al 2017 since 1981 it has received ecological water replenishment more than 50 times within and across river basins since 2018 hebei province has coordinated multiple water sources to supply more than 4 37 billion m3 of ecological water to bydw thus maintaining a water level of approximately 7 2 m and a water surface area of more than 250 km2 and effectively improving its water ecological environment the research data included were mainly as follows 1 remote sensing image data obtained from the united states geological survey usgs https glovis usgs gov through long time series of data from 1990 to 2020 combined with remote sensing and gcf methods gcf value could be obtained to analyse variations in hydrological connectivity 2 water level data the historical data in the same period were mainly derived from the hydrological data of the haihe river basin and daqinghe river system in the hydrological yearbook of the national library of china http www nlc cn additionally the daily water level data of shifangyuan hydrological station provided by the ministry of water resources http xxfb mwr cn index html were also employed as a supplement 3 methodology 3 1 an icddaf for diagnosing hydrological connectivity variations and coexistence relationships with water levels the accurate hydrological connectivity diagnostics is important to reveal the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level therefore an icddaf fig 2 was proposed for deeply investigating hydrological connectivity variations and their coexistence relationships with water levels thus providing support for water replenishment management it mainly contains two core modules 1 hydrological connectivity diagnostics hcd module remote sensing and gcf methods were coupled to comprehensively evaluate the hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range further obtaining accurate diagnostic results 2 hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis hc wlca module copula analysis method was innovatively adopted to conduct the dependency analysis of water level and hydrological connectivity as well as the uncertainty of their relationships these two modules were closely linked through responses of hydrological connectivities to water level variations thus achieving the accurate diagnosis of hydrological connectivity and the rational exploration of dependency between hydrological connectivity and water level then according to the joint and conditional probability analyses efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations can be further suggested under different water replenishment schemes finally the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management could be determined considering multiple ecological objectives and requirements such as maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment 3 2 remote sensing technology landsat tm etm oli satellite remote sensing data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were chosen as the main data source during the study period 122 historical images covering bydw worldwide reference system path number 123 row number 33 were selected to assess variations in hydrological connectivity whose cloud coverage was less than 5 subsequently the remote sensing images were preprocessed by radiometric calibration atmospheric correction removal of null values image mosaicking and clipping using envi 5 3 software sánchez de miguel et al 2021 the water boundary can be delineated by an index such as the modified normalized difference water index mndwi or the normalized difference water index ndwi the mndwi can enhance the contrast between buildings and water bodies significantly and distinguish water bodies from shadows which make it more conducive to the accurate extraction of water bodies chen et al 2020 therefore the mndwi was employed to extract the water body information which can be described as follows 1 m n d w i g s w i r g s w i r where g and s w i r are the reflectance of the green and swir bands respectively to accurately extract the distribution information of water bodies in remote sensing images an otsu algorithm otsu 1979 was proposed to determine the threshold value once the histogram statistical information of mndwi grayscale images was output by envi software an optimal threshold value could be obtained according to the otsu algorithm with matlab thus separating water bodies from the background effectively finally a manual visual interpretation method was employed to check whether the extraction results conformed to the actual situation and to obtain the reference map for accuracy evaluation comparing the water body classification results obtained by manual visual interpretation with the mndwi as well as combining them with the precision evaluation module of envi software the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient parameters obtained from the confusion matrix were applied to verify the water extraction results cordeiro et al 2021 the validation results of water extraction showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were in a range of 85 99 and 0 70 0 90 respectively indicating satisfactory accuracy by the mndwi 3 3 geostatistical connectivity function method the gcf method developed by trigg et al 2013 was applied to characterizing the hydrological connectivity based on the multipoint statistics of wet dry binary state data gcf value was constructed to quantify the probability that any two target objects located within a certain distance range along a specified direction were connected it can describe the water landscape structure and reflect the internal connectivity of target objects effectively as follows 2 g c f n z c p r j 1 n i u j z c 1 where n is the total number of locations u j is the cell number z c is the threshold value z u j is the value of the cell is the product operator and i u j z c is an indicator for determining whether the variable z u j at location u j exceeds the threshold value z c if z u j z c then i u j z c 1 and it can be defined as a wet cell if i u j z c 0 then otherwise it can be defined as a dry cell it was operated from the starting location u 1 to all possible locations within the study site the higher the spatial entropy of the computational domain is the faster gcf n z c approaches zero as n increases at any given distance the gcf value refers to the proportion of connected points within a specific distance range along the given direction 0 g c f 1 the greater the hydrological connectivity is the closer the gcf value is to 1 the calculation process of the gcf value can be described as follows 1 wet dry binary grid images were obtained from the operated remote sensing data 2 the connected areas were identified and marked 3 the total number of wet cell pairs was calculated in any given direction i e along east west or south north at a given distance scale 4 the number of wet cell pairs belonging to the same connected area was calculated in combination with the above connected area marking information and 5 the fraction of connected pairs of wet cells to total pairs of wet cells was expressed as the gcf value therefore the connectivity function curve could be obtained according to the calculation of gcf values at different distance scales a simple illustrated example is presented in fig 3 3 4 copula analysis copula analysis is an effective method of constructing joint distribution and describing correlations among multiple random variables cai et al 2021b sklar 1959 first introduced the copula theorem and proposed the following let h be a joint cumulative distribution function with marginal univariate distributions f and g then there exists a unique copula c satisfying an expression of eq 3 when f and g are continuous 3 h x y c f x g y the calculation process of traditional copula analysis method tcam can be described as follows 1 conduct the multivariate correlation analysis 2 select the optimal marginal distribution from candidate distribution functions see table s1 in supplementary material by parameters estimation applying the maximum likelihood method and goodness of fit test 3 select the optimal joint distribution from candidate copula functions through the parameters estimation employing the maximum likelihood method and goodness of fit test however tcam faced two dilemmas in previous studies 1 the choice of optimal joint distribution was often limited to some fixed copula function types and 2 the maximum likelihood method was prone to local optimization and difficult to determine the reliability of the results cai et al 2021a the multivariate copula analysis toolbox mvcat proposed by sadegh et al 2017 provides an effective approach to overcome the abovementioned limitations it contains 26 copula families including a number of copula families that have not been fully explored which expands the range of options see table s2 in supplementary material in addition local optimization and markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulation methods are combined within a bayesian framework to infer parameters and construct a prediction uncertainty range of copula families thus realizing the quantification of modelling uncertainty and the robust estimation of global optimal parameter therefore mvcat was employed to describe the dependency structure of hydrological connectivity and water level and their uncertainty in mvcat a bayesian framework with a residual based gaussian likelihood function is conducted for estimating parameters and quantifying modeling uncertainty of 26 copula families when new information is acquired bayes theorem can update the prior probability of a certain hypothesis attribute all underlying modeling uncertainty to parameters and further estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters by 4 p θ y p θ p y θ p y 5 p θ y p θ p y θ 6 l θ y n 2 l n i 1 n y i y i θ 2 n where p θ and p θ y are the prior and posterior distributions of parameters respectively θ represents the estimated parameters n is the sample size y is the joint probability of the observed variables p y θ l θ y denotes the likelihood function and p y is a constant value due to the computational difficulties of bayes equations the mcmc simulation method was adopted to sample from the posterior distribution the hybrid evolution mcmc benefits from an intelligent starting point selection and employs adaptive metropolis differential evolution and snooker update algorithms to search the feasible space thus obtaining the estimated parameters of the global optimal solution together with its posterior distribution andrieu and thoms 2008 compared with the local optimization algorithm the mcmc algorithm can have a wider calculation range to ensure global optimal parameters and describe the underlying uncertainty of parameters more effectively multiple goodness of fit indicators were adopted to evaluate the performance of different marginal and joint distribution functions such as likelihood value akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse which are calculated as follows yue

of parameters of the statistical model and cv is a constant value the lower the aic and bic values are the better the model fits the closer the rmse value is to 0 and the nse value is to 1 the better the model fitting performance 4 results 4 1 diagnostic of hydrological connectivity 4 1 1 intra annual hydrological connectivity variations for the convenience of description and analysis the average of gcf values at all distance scales was taken as the indicator of hydrological connectivity since bydw freezes in winter the study mainly focused on spring summer and autumn from march to november besides the hydrological connectivity in different directions of west east w e north south n s northwest southwest ne sw and northeast southeast nw se were considered the intra annual variations of gcf values in bydw from 1990 to 2020 are shown in fig 4 as seen from fig 4 the highest gcf value appeared in march while the lowest value occurred in september in addition the gcf value in spring 0 158 was significantly the highest followed by autumn 0 084 and summer 0 082 which was probably related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth phragmites australis is the most widely distributed typical plant with an area of approximately 100 km2 accounting for 32 of the total area in bydw wang et al 2012 in spring phragmites australis is in a germination stage with thin and short rhizomes reducing the resistance on water flow therefore the hydrological connectivity in spring is significantly higher than that in summer and autumn similarly the frozen water melts in march and there are few obstacles to water flow caused by the growth of phragmites australis these favourable factors make the maximum hydrological connectivity in march however phragmites australis gradually matures with thick and large rhizomes in summer the strong blocking effect on water flow makes the minimum hydrological connectivity in summer moreover the local government usually organizes the harvesting of phragmites australis in october to protect ecological environment thus improving the hydrological connectivity the results were consistent with those of li et al 2021c fig 4 shows that the highest gcf value appeared in a w e direction 0 137 which was generally consistent with the overall terrain and main flow direction of bydw next were the ne sw 0 108 and n s 0 102 directions the lowest value occurred in the nw se direction 0 087 this showed that hydrological connectivity was closely related to regional topography and the hydrological connectivity along the water flow direction was generally the highest 4 1 2 inter annual hydrological connectivity variations the inter annual gcf values of bydw at the yearly scale are shown in fig 5 the gcf values were lower than 0 15 indicating the generally weak hydrological connectivity from 1990 to 2020 the highest gcf value appeared in 1990 while the lowest value occurred in 2005 taking 2005 as the dividing line the hydrological connectivity showed a downwards and then upwards trend since the 1980s due to the climate drought demographic explosion and river blockage bydw has frequently dried up and had sharply reduced inflow runoff in 2004 approximately 160 million m3 of water resources was supplied through the yuehe diversion project since 2006 interbasin water diversion projects such as the yellow river diversion project have been implemented to alleviate its water shortage dilemma hence the hydrological connectivity has gradually improved since 2005 our results were basically consistent with those of zhang and wu 2018 however the hydrological connectivity began to decline sharply after 2015 which may be related to the unreasonable occupation of wetlands in recent years massive illegal sand mining has led to great changes in the river regime forming irregular and unstable river banks seriously affecting the hydrological connectivity park et al 2020 liu et al 2020a pointed out that hydrological barriers affected hydrological connectivity in urban areas high elevation reed grasslands and some cultivated areas within bydw yan and niu 2019 found that although the water shortage crisis was alleviated in bydw through water diversion projects its ecosystem was still degraded with aggravated plaque fragmentation resulting in a reduction in hydrological connectivity therefore the hydrological connectivity in bydw was not as good as expected and more effective measures are needed for improvement 4 2 coexistence analysis of hydrological connectivity and water level 4 2 1 dependency analysis analysing the dependency of multiple factors was a prerequisite for exploring their joint distribution characteristics fig 6 shows the relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level variations at different time scales at both monthly and seasonal scales hydrological connectivity and water level indicated the consistency characteristics of firstly downwards and then upwards trends fig 6 a shows that the highest values of hydrological connectivity and water level both appeared in march while the lowest values appeared in september and june respectively the obvious abrupt change point occurred in september which was related to the phenological characteristics of phragmites australis and human activities in june the mature phragmites australis has large obstruction to hydrological connectivity and its strong evapotranspiration increases the water consumption resulting in the lowest of water level at this time subsequently local government would implement the ecological water replenishment projects in september and harvest phragmites australis in october to improve ecological environment of the wetland these efforts raised the hydrological connectivity and water level leading to the minimum of hydrological connectivity in september fig 6 b shows that the highest values of hydrological connectivity and water level both appeared in spring while the lowest values occurred in summer however fig 6 c shows that hydrological connectivity and water level had insignificant relevant characteristics at the yearly scale their statistical parameters at monthly seasonal and yearly scales were provided in tables s3 s5 of supplementary material respectively then kendall spearman and pearson correlation coefficients were used to further examine the relationships between these two variables table 1 shows that three correlation coefficients were larger than 0 with all passing the significance test at 5 therefore there was a certain positive correlation between hydrological connectivity and water level in bydw 4 2 2 marginal distributions of hydrological connectivity and water level various distribution functions e g beta gamma and normal distributions were applied to simulating the distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level with the help of mvcat the parameters bic and aic of marginal distributions were obtained as shown in table 2 for hydrological connectivity and water level the aic and bic values of beta distribution and generalized pareto distribution were the least respectively thus beta and generalized pareto distributions were chosen as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level respectively as expressed in table s6 of supplementary material their marginal distribution curves fig 7 also showed good fitting results 4 2 3 joint distribution of hydrological connectivity and water level twenty six copula functions e g frank t gaussian clayton and gumble were used to simulate the joint distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level by using the goodness test of fit the top five optimal joint distributions were the frank t gaussian clayton and gumbel copula functions as shown in table 3 and fig 8 among these copula functions the aic and bic values of the frank copula were the lowest which had a better fitting result therefore the frank copula function was determined as the optimal joint distribution function which were expressed in table s6 of supplementary material 4 2 4 modelling uncertainty the uncertainty generated in the parameter estimation process were quantified through mvcat which are shown in table 4 the local optimal parameters of tcam were expressed as fixed values which were prone to error however within the bayesian framework and mcmc simulation the posterior distributions of global optimal parameters could be estimated fig 9 as interval ranges thus realizing the characterization of modelling uncertainty and improving the estimation accuracy in addition the rmses of the estimated parameters of the top five copula functions with the best fitting by mvcat were lower than those by tcam and nses had the opposite results indicating the superiority of mvcat 5 discussion 5 1 determination of the optimal ecological water level 5 1 1 joint probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level ingeneral the coexistence relationships between hydrological connectivity and water level may create challenges for water replenishment decision therefore joint and conditional probabilities were examined to determine the optimal ecological water level for maintaining good hydrological connectivity and restoring ecological environment according to the statistical distribution characteristics of hydrological connectivity and water level they were divided into four levels by the quartile method and classification criteria are shown in table 5 according to the established frank copula function the joint probabilities of 16 schemes with different hydrological connectivities and water levels are shown in fig 10 the highest joint probability 0 10 appeared in the event of a superior water level and excellent hydrological connectivity and the lowest 0 03 occurred in the event of a low water level and excellent hydrological connectivity with the improvement of water level the joint probabilities causing the same medium good and excellent hydrological connectivity events continued to increase while the low hydrological connectivity event was the opposite however with the improvement of hydrological connectivity the changing laws of joint probability causing the same low medium high and superior water level events were different in addition the joint probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level synchronization combinations low low medium medium good high and excellent superior were 0 31 indicating the strong synchronization relationships between the two hydrological indicators therefore considering joint probability results managers could take measures to regulate water level and hydrological connectivity according to whether joint events are beneficial to the ecological environment thus realizing the water replenishment management of bydw 5 1 2 conditional probabilities of hydrological connectivity and water level to determine the optimal ecological water level conducive to hydrological connectivity conditional probabilities where gcf value belonged to any specific hydrological connectivity event under a specific water level were studied as shown in fig 11 with increasing water level the probability of a low hydrological connectivity event decreased while the probability of medium good and excellent hydrological connectivity events increased in addition when the water level was lower than 7 m the probability of a low hydrological connectivity event was the highest followed by medium and good hydrological connectivity events and a excellent hydrological connectivity event was the lowest however when the water level exceeded 8 m the results were completely opposite when the water level was 7 7 5 m the probability of a medium hydrological connectivity event exceeded that of a low hydrological connectivity event indicating the occurrence possibility of a medium hydrological connectivity event was the greatest at 7 7 5 m similarly the occurrence possibility of hydrological connectivity events at other levels showed that the transition range of water level was 7 5 8 m hence 7 8 m was the key water level range for the transition of the hydrological connectivity state when the water level exceeded 7 m the hydrological connectivity of bydw gradually improved which agreed with previous studies liu et al 2019a the planning outline for the xiong an new area in hebei province required that the water level of bydw should be adjusted to within 6 5 7 0 m yan et al 2020 our research results validated the rationality of government decision managment therefore combined with the baiyangdian ecological environment management and protection plan 2018 2035 managers should establish a multisource water replenishment mechanism amd make overall planning of ecological water resources that includes rivers within and across the basin reservoir water and reclaimed water through effective water replenishment management the annual ecological water replenishment of bydw should be ensured to be more than 300 million m3 and the water level should be retained above 7 m to maintain good hydrological connectivity and restore the ecological environment 5 2 advantages of icddaf the proposed icddaf incorporated hcd and hc wlca modules into an integrated framework with the aim to determine the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management accurate diagnostics of hydrological connectivity variations using hcd module can provide a solid foundation for the hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis using hc wlca module such an integrated framework has important practical guiding significance for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations the advantages of icddaf were as follows 1 through the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis hcd module could obtain accurate diagnostic results of hydrological connectivity in any specific direction within a certain distance range by coupling remote sensing and gcf methods for example a comprehensive index consisting of several landscape pattern indices was developed by li et al 2021c to assess the hydrological connectivity in bydw although the comprehensive index can effectively quantify the structural characteristics of hydrological connectivity the evaluation results were partial and approximate as it cannot represent the change laws of hydrological connectivity in different directions or within a certain distance range the proposed diagnostic method considered the directional difference and the validity of distance range enabling more accurate sketching of hydrological connectivity 2 hc wlca module not only extended the application of mvcat in the hydrological connectivity analysis field but also overcame the limitations of fewer distribution types and local optimization in tcam combined with the advantage that copula analysis method can effectively quantify multivariable relationships mvcat was innovatively included in the icddaf to conduct the coexistence analysis between hydrological connectivity and water level proving a new perspective for their dependency analysis moreover the global optimal parameters were quantified into interval ranges to characterize the modelling uncertainty within bayesian framework and mcmc simulation 3 icddaf could realize the regulation of water level and hydrological connectivity under different water replenishment schemes combining with the fine diagnosis of hydrological connectivity and the response analysis of connectivity to water level variations the optimal ecological water level was determined to achieve the expected ecological goals based on joint and conditional probability analyses such an icddaf can develop a new perspective for efficient adjustments of water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations and provide references for ecological restoration considering multiple ecological objectives 5 3 implications and future research in recent years a number of water replenishment projects have been launched for bydw enhancing the hydrodynamic conditions and improving the hydrological connectivity zeng et al 2021 however such improvement of hydrological connectivity remains two sided on the one hand the ameliorate of hydrological connectivity can improve the efficiency of material energy and biological exchanges further promoting the healthy state of ecosystem on the other hand the ameliorate of hydrological connectivity may accelerate the migration and diffusion of pollutants leading to a series of ecological problems such as the aggravation of eutrophication and the decline of aquatic biological resources wang et al 2022 dou et al 2022 pointed out that the hydrological connectivity project in wuhan urban lakes can reduce the potential risk of heavy metals in highly polluted lake sediments while it may bring secondary pollution to low pollution lakes although the hydrological connectivity project can bring positive effects on water resource utilization it may lead to secondary ecological environmental risks such as pollutant migration flood risk and environmental deterioration jiang et al 2018 for bydw a typical shallow lake its eutrophication problem has not been fundamentally solved due to the continuous accumulation of inorganic salts and organic matter in the water bodies for a long time han et al 2020 liang et al 2022 yang et al 2022 excessive hydrological connectivity and water level may change its hydrodynamic conditions intensify the diffusion of pollutants in the sediment and aggravate ecological degradation therefore it will be necessary to determine the appropriate thresholds of hydrological connectivity and water level to achieve the optimal management of shallow lakes in the future research identifying the influencing factors of hydrological connectivity will be a key issue many studies have shown that natural conditions and human activities are the main factors driving the evolution of hydrological connectivity zhang et al 2021 as for the aspect of natural conditions climate change e g precipitation and drought is the most crucial factor and some environmental factors e g soil characteristics vegetation and topography can also impact on hydrological connectivity nanda et al 2019 as for the aspect of human activities dredging cofferdams dismantlement dam construction groundwater extraction water flow regulation and diversion and land management have complex effects on hydrological connectivity robinson et al 2015 scordo et al 2023 it becomes very complicated to reveal the evolution mechanism of hydrological connectivity as so many influencing factors usually act together therefore more mechanism models e g mike efdc and swat models are desirable to be coupled into the framework to clarify the evolution process of hydrological connectivity elucidate the flow paths of matter and energy further revealing its response mechanism to hydrodynamics water quality and aquatic ecology under the background of climate change and human disturbances it is urgent to reveal the evolution law dynamic mechanism and influencing factors of hydrological connectivity with combining advanced monitoring means and model technologies thus providing references for wetland ecological restoration 6 conclusions an icddaf was proposed to determine the optimal ecological water level for supporting water replenishment management it consisted of two core modules of hcd and hc wlca playing hydrological connectivity diagnostics and hydrological connectivity water level coexistence analysis roles respectively it could diagnose hydrological connectivity variations considering the directional difference and validity of distance range through the combination of remote sensing and gcf methods providing more comprehensive evaluation of hydrological connectivity over traditional approaches moreover mvcat was adopted to reflect the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level and modelling uncertainty this not only extended the application of mvcat in the hydrological connectivity analysis field but also overcame the limitations of fewer distribution types and local optimization in tcam then the optimal ecological water level was determined for water replenishment practice based on the joint and conditional probability analyses of hydrological connectivity and water level in conclusion such an icddaf provided a new perspective to determine appropriate water levels based on hydrological connectivity pattern variations considering the coexistence relationships of hydrological connectivity and water level the icddaf was applied to determining the optimal water level in bydw and the results were as follows 1 for intra annual variations the hydrological connectivity was relatively good in march at the monthly scale spring at the seasonal scale and the w e direction while relatively weak in september and summer which were related to the periodic characteristics of vegetation growth overall terrain and flow direction for inter annual variations it was generally weak and showed a downwards and then upwards trend however it began to decline sharply after 2015 which may be related to human activities 2 beta and generalized pareto distributions were selected as the optimal marginal distributions for hydrological connectivity and water level indicators respectively and the frank copula was determined as the optimal joint distribution function the modelling uncertainty were characterized as interval ranges 3 a water level of 7 m was determined as the optimal ecological water level to maintain good hydrological connectivity and ecological restoration these results demonstrated the reliability of icddaf and can provide an effective support for water replenishment management of wetlands credit authorship contribution statement jianying cai conceptualization methodology formal

2068,climate change is a driver of soil erosion but the future projections of seasonal rainfall erosivity variability and spatial distribution over the lancang mekong river basin lmrb are still not well understood based on the bias corrected precipitation data from five general circulation models gcms in the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the impacts of future climate change on the seasonal rainfall erosivity over the lmrb were assessed using three widely applied empirical daily rainfall erosivity models under three combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the representative concentration pathways ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 the results show that rainfall erosivity would generally increase in the near term 2030 2060 and far term 2070 2100 and more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity especially under the high emission scenarios in the far term in the near term the ensemble mean of basin wide rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period 1980 2010 while in the far term the ensemble mean would increase by 12 2 31 0 seasonal variations in rainfall erosivity show that summer rainfall erosivity from june to august accounts for more than two thirds of the total annual rainfall erosivity although the projected basin wide average summer rainfall erosivity would increase the mid southern basin in thailand and southern lao pdr would experience a decrease for rainfall erosivity from march to may large areas except for the mountainous part of china would also experience a decrease in seasonal rainfall erosivity the projected changes in rainfall erosivity can contribute to a better understanding of soil erosion risk under climate change across the lmrb keywords climate change empirical model soil erosion ssp scenarios precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion by water as one of the most important global environmental problems has received growing attention in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb due to its high association with climate change and sustainable social development zhou et al 2014 suif et al 2016 pham et al 2018 chuenchum et al 2020a the lmrb is one of the most important transboundary river basins in southeast asia and faces major challenges from climate change and rapid population growth anthony et al 2015 yang et al 2019 yoshida et al 2020 yun et al 2020 human activities and land cover changes affect soil loss in the lmrb shifting cultivation or so called slash and burn agriculture in which vegetation is cleared burned in place and then replanted on the cleared land is the dominant farming practice in the mountainous region of the lmrb rasul and thapa 2003 this process can cause severe soil loss thus contributing to the increased sediment concentrations in the river ziegler et al 2011 borrelli et al 2017 proposed a noticeable increase in soil erosion in southeast asian countries from 2001 to 2012 and the soil erosion rates were projected to increase in the future borrelli et al 2020 thus quantification of future soil erosion by water in this region is urgently needed for sustainable management in the future rainfall is the most important climatic factor influencing soil erosion climate change is expected to affect soil erosion by changing the rainfall characteristics and rainfall erosive power li and fang 2016 in the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and the revised usle renard and foster 1997 the rainfall erosivity of a storm is calculated as the product of the kinetic energy and the maximum rainfall intensity in 30 consecutive minutes which requires high frequency precipitation data however such precipitation data are not readily available in most parts of the world thus different empirical models have been developed and calibrated to estimate rainfall erosivity based on annual or monthly precipitation data renard and freimund 1994 daily precipitation data angulo martínez and beguería 2009 ma and zheng 2022 richardson et al 1983 yu and rosewell 1996 zhang et al 2002 or sub daily precipitation data yin et al 2007 2015 xie et al 2016 matthews et al 2022 at different locations around the world global climate models gcms are useful tools for projecting future rainfall erosivity the spatial distribution and temporal change of future rainfall erosivity can be quantified using empirical models mondal et al 2016 panagos et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 azari et al 2021 since low resolution gcm data with biases do not correctly represent local rainfall erosivity various statistical downscaling and bias correction techniques have been utilized for future projections and impact assessments li et al 2021 most of the previous studies on rainfall erosivity projections for the lmrb were conducted based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 5 cmip3 5 established by the world climate research program wcrp the latest cmip6 models have been improved with higher horizontal resolution and better representation of synoptic processes which can provide more reasonable results on climate extreme indices di luca et al 2020 zarrin and dadashi roudbari 2021 supharatid et al 2022 the cmip6 models also use the combination of shared socio economic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps making them more appropriate for future scenarios borrelli et al 2020 in the lmrb previous studies have used data from multiple sources to assess past and future precipitation trends in the past decades a general increasing trend of annual precipitation was found over the lmrb while at the seasonal scale different trends were found in wet and dry seasons with significant spatial differences between the upper and lower lmrb chen et al 2018 irannezhad et al 2020 since precipitation in the lmrb is significantly influenced by the south asian summer monsoon the southern oscillation and the indian summer monsoon irannezhad et al 2020 wang et al 2022a future warming would lead to an increase in extreme precipitation over the lmrb precipitation extremes are expected to increase significantly in a warmer future due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions ge et al 2021 ngai et al 2022 and soil erosion may increase in a warmer wetter world if land use and management are not adapted burt et al 2016 the decreasing trends in precipitation in specific seasons have also been projected on a seasonal scale over the lmrb based on the earlier phase of cmip data kingston et al 2011 these shifts in projected seasonal precipitation can lead to variations in rainfall erosivity over the lmrb which can affect soil erosion risk to project the future distribution of soil erosion in the lmrb annual rainfall erosivity projections were made based on the monthly rainfall data from a single gcm chuenchum et al 2020b the results show that rainfall erosivity increases in 2030 and 2040 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios contributing to the increasing soil erosion rates consistent with the global study by borrelli et al 2020 there are still limitations in the understanding of rainfall erosivity projections in the lmrb first these previous studies relied on one single gcm and empirical model since the selection of climate model and empirical model for estimating rainfall erosivity can significantly affect the projections the uncertainties associated with these projection results can lead to possible biases which require multi model ensembles kingston et al 2011 panagos et al 2022 second to more accurately estimate the seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity for better erosion estimation higher temporal resolution data e g daily or sub daily and rainfall estimation models are needed third few studies have investigated the future changes in rainfall erosivity with the latest cmip6 dataset especially in the lmrb therefore the main objectives of this study are to investigate the projected seasonal changes and spatial distributions of rainfall erosivity in the near term 2030 2060 and the far term 2070 2100 under multiple cmip6 climate change scenarios using multiple gcms and widely applied empirical models 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river flows across six countries including china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam fig 1 from its source on the tibetan plateau it flows 2 200 km and drops nearly 4 500 m in elevation before entering the lower basin at the border of china thailand and myanmar then it flows for another 2600 km until it enters the south china sea via a complex delta system in vietnam mrc 2005 the lmrb covers an area of 795 000 km2 and most of it is under the influence of the southwest monsoon the average annual soil erosion rate of the lmrb is about 5000 t km 2 yr 1 and the rate tends to increase continuously due to climate change and land use change chuenchum et al 2020a 2020b cultivated land mainly paddy and broadleaf deciduous forests are the main vegetation cover in more than half of the basin mrc 2019 monitored the land cover changes from 2003 to 2010 in the lower mekong river basin and found that shrubland increased by 7 9 followed by a 7 6 increase in broadleaf deciduous forest while broadleaf evergreen forest decreased by 19 5 the land cover types in 2020 show distinct differences from upstream to downstream with the upper tibetan plateau being covered by large areas of grassland shrubland permanent snow and ice while the lower basin consists mostly of cultivated land in thailand and western cambodia and forest in lao pdr fig 1b the land cover data are used to assess the rainfall erosivity changes across different land cover types in this study 2 2 gcm data under cmip6 scenarios and bias correction five gcms from cmip6 selected by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 3b isimip3b lange 2019 lange and büchner 2021 were included in this study table 1 climate model selection was based on the data availability criteria and performance allocations in historical periods to be included in isimip3b a climate model had to provide daily data for variables such as precipitation near surface air temperature and wind speed for all years in the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods five cmip6 gcms were selected based on their performance in the historical period these gcms are structurally independent regarding the ocean and atmospheric model components and are good representatives of the whole cmip6 ensemble in terms of climate sensitivity then the model performance in the historical period was assessed using the portrait plot and the five best performing cmip6 models were derived the five primary models are structurally independent in terms of ocean and atmosphere model components in terms of climate sensitivity the five primary models are good representatives of the whole cmip6 ensemble lange and büchner 2021 the bias corrected daily precipitation data under three different combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the representative concentration pathways ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 produced by the isimip3b project were used to calculate the rainfall erosivity during the historical period from 1981 to 2014 and the future period from 2015 to 2100 the method used for bias correction and statistical downscaling in isimip3b is isimip3basd v2 5 lange 2021 the observational reference dataset used for bias adjustment and statistical downscaling in isimip3b is version 2 0 of wfde5 over land merged with era5 over the ocean w5e5 lange et al 2021 the w5e5 dataset covers 1979 2016 with daily temporal resolution at 0 5 spatial resolution and the precipitation data are from version 2 3 of the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the training period used for both bias adjustment and statistical downscaling was 1979 2014 which covers the baseline period of 1980 2010 in this study before bias adjustment and statistical downscaling the original cmip6 output was interpolated in time and space after bias adjustment and statistical downscaling values greater than the upper limit of 600 mm per day were set to the upper limit the spatial resolution of the downscaled and bias corrected data used is 0 5 2 3 daily rainfall erosivity empirical models finer temporal resolution of the rainfall data can improve the results of rainfall erosivity estimation ma and zheng 2022 therefore three representative daily empirical models were selected for the future rainfall erosivity projection which were also selected by liu et al 2020a to estimate the global rainfall erosivity changes in different climate zones with different coefficients these selected models have been widely applied in different locations and are suitable for estimating the rainfall erosivity in monsoon climates empirical model i is a power law function with different coefficient values in cold and warm seasons xie et al 2016 which was found to be a robust daily model that could be widely used in china chen et al 2020 wang et al 2022b this model was also adopted in the chinese soil loss equation and the first national water and soil conservation survey liu et al 2020b the formula is expressed as 1 r i α 1 j 1 k p d 1 β 1 where r i is the ith half month rainfall erosivity of a year in mj mm ha 1h 1 j 1 2 k represents the number of erosive rainfall days within this half month the first half months are the first to 15th days of each month and the remaining days are the second half months pd1 is the daily erosive rainfall daily rainfall greater than or equal to 9 7 mm in mm the parameter α1 was set to 0 3937 in the warm season may to september and to 0 3101 in the cold season october to april the parameter β 1 was calibrated and set to 1 7265 with this formula the annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity values are calculated as the accumulated half month rainfall erosivity empirical model ii is a power law function with a sinusoidal relationship reflecting monthly variations in the coefficient originally proposed by yu and rosewell 1996 and calibrated by xie et al 2016 using one minute resolution rainfall data from sixteen stations in the eastern china monsoon region this model represents the type of model with a monthly varying alpha that has been widely applied and proposed to be most effective in australia and southern china zhu et al 2021 ma and zheng 2022 the formula is expressed as 2 r d α 2 1 η c o s 2 π f θ ω p d 1 β 1 where r d is the rainfall erosivity for a rainy day in mj mm ha 1h 1 f 1 12 is the frequency of the cosine function θ is the month from 1 to 12 and ω 7π 6 the parameters α2 and η were calibrated and set to 0 2686 and 0 5412 respectively empirical model iii is also a power law function originally proposed by richardson et al 1983 and calibrated by zhang et al 2002 which has been used in rainfall erosivity projections in china li et al 2021 rainfall erosivity was calculated using the following formulas at the half month time step zhang et al 2002 3 r i α 3 j 1 k p d 2 β 2 where pd2 is the daily erosive rainfall amount in mm daily rainfall greater than or equal to 12 mm the coefficients α3 and β 2 are calculated according to the following formulas 4 α 3 21 58 β 2 7 1891 5 β 2 0 8363 18 177 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 where pd12 is the average daily erosive rainfall amount in mm daily rainfall greater than or equal to 12 mm and py12 is the mean value of the annual erosive rainfall amount in mm 2 4 multi model ensemble analysis a total of fifteen ensemble members were included in this study due to the combination of five gcms and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models ensemble means were calculated to derive the annual and seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity under different cmip6 scenarios in different future periods three periods were selected namely the baseline period 1980 2010 the near term 2030 2060 and the far term 2070 2100 the fraction of positive minus negative fpn was obtained to indicate the degree of agreement among ensemble members which was calculated as the number of ensemble members showing a positive change minus the number of ensemble members showing a negative change divided by the total number of the ensemble numbers tang and lettenmaier 2012 the fpn values varied from 100 to 100 and positive values indicate that more ensemble members agree with the positive change while negative values of fpn indicate the opposite 3 results 3 1 historical precipitation and rainfall erosivity distribution in the baseline period 1980 2010 the highest values of precipitation occurred in the mountainous regions along the border between lao pdr and vietnam fig 2 a another precipitation center is located in the mountainous region of vietnam located in the southwest of the basin from the upper mountainous regions to the lower part of the basin the mean precipitation shows a general increasing trend with the influence of the summer monsoon the ensemble mean annual rainfall erosivity shows a similar spatial distribution to the precipitation fig 2 basin wide mean values of rainfall erosivity ranged from 3779 to 5265 mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 with an ensemble mean value of 4462 mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 table s1 the estimation of rainfall erosivity values depends on model selection empirical model ii has the lowest value while empirical model iii has the highest value fig 3 compared to the average annual rainfall erosivity calculated by empirical model i the values of empirical models ii and iii changed by 9 2 and 6 3 respectively the estimation of rainfall erosivity values also depends on the choice of gcms the values estimated using mpi esm 1 2 hr and mri esm1 0 ll input were 7 2 and 3 4 smaller than the average values of five gcms but the values obtained from gfdl esm4 and ukesm1 0 ll were 5 3 and 4 5 larger than the average values of five gcms table s1 3 2 projected relative changes of rainfall erosivity in near and far terms in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble mean of basin wide rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period table s1 most ensemble members suggest that rainfall erosivity will increase by up to 10 notable exceptions occur in the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario of mri esm1 0 ll the ssp1 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 scenarios of gfdl esm4 and the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario of ukesm1 0 ll fig 4 the rainfall erosivity values calculated with the three different empirical models and the gcm mri esm1 0 ll are all projected to decrease under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenarios while in the far term of 2070 2100 the ensemble means would increase by 12 2 31 0 under different cmip6 climate change scenarios table s1 larger increasing trends in rainfall erosivity are found compared to those in the near term similar to the near term the rainfall erosivity values calculated with all three different empirical models and the gcm mri esm1 0 ll are also projected to decrease under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenarios the increasing rates under the high emission scenarios are generally higher than those under the low emission scenarios the far term changes in rainfall erosivity under the ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 scenarios of ipsl cm6ar lr are large and can reach an increase of 60 compared to the baseline period in the near term of 2030 2060 only a small part 7 12 of the lmrb shows decreased rainfall erosivity compared with the baseline period under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 fig 5 under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 rainfall erosivity shows an increasing trend over the entire basin fig 5a under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 rainfall erosivity would increase in 88 93 of the basin except for the mountainous area along the cambodia vietnam border and the southern edge area of the tibetan plateau fig 5b c under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity in 97 of the basin and 100 agreement has been reached in the border areas of china myanmar and lao pdr fig 5d under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 20 of the basin shows that more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity fig 5e under the scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 positive fpn values are found over more than 92 of the basin area the fpn values are higher than 80 at the southern end of the basin and in the border areas of thailand myanmar and lao pdr indicating high agreement among the ensemble members negative fpn values are identified in thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr indicating that more ensemble members agree with a negative change in rainfall erosivity over this region fig 5f in the far term of 2070 2100 only 1 of the lmrb shows decreased rainfall erosivity under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 while the relative changes in rainfall erosivity in other regions are all positive under all three scenarios fig 6 the far term changes in rainfall erosivity are generally higher compared to the near term changes the basin wide averaged relative changes under the scenarios of ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 are 17 9 29 5 and 41 5 respectively under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 positive fpn values are found over more than 99 of the entire basin fig 6d under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 positive fpn values are found over more than 93 of the basin while negative fpn values are identified over the mountainous area at the border of cambodia and vietnam fig 6e this can be attributed to the mri esm1 0 ll as all empirical models projected reduced rainfall erosivity in this gcm under the scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 positive fpn values are observed over the entire basin and more than 80 of the basin areas have an fpn value greater than 80 fig 6f showing that all members agree with a positive change in rainfall erosivity only with at most one ensemble member exception 3 3 seasonal variations of the basin wide averaged rainfall erosivity the monthly rainfall erosivity of the lmrb is relatively high from june to october which coincides with the rainy season in the lmrb in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity values and uncertainty ranges under the three climate change scenarios are similar fig 7 a while in the far term of 2070 2100 the rainfall erosivity values from june to january under the three scenarios are all greater than the baseline period following the sequence of ssp5 rcp8 5 ssp3 rcp7 0 ssp1 rcp2 6 fig 7b the uncertainties of the gcms and empirical models in the far term are larger than those in the near term especially for the higher emission scenarios from june to january the ensemble mean relative changes are all positive and the magnitudes of the changes in the far term are larger than those in the near term fig 7c d while from february to may the ensemble mean relative change under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario is negative these results indicate the increasing erosion risk from june to january while decreasing rainfall erosivity can be found from february to may especially under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario the uncertainties of relative changes in the far term are also larger compared to those in the near term especially under the higher emission scenarios 3 4 spatial distributions of relative change in rainfall erosivity in different seasons in summer june august jja the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity in thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr show a decreasing trend under scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 in the near term with the relative change rates ranging from 40 to 0 under the ssp1 rcp2 6 scenario the western part of the basin in thailand shows a decreasing trend other regions would experience increased rainfall erosivity under all three scenarios with increasing rates less than 60 fig 8 a c during the far term similar spatial patterns but larger magnitudes of relative change are observed with the increase in emission level regions with a positive change in rainfall erosivity show accelerated rates of increase which can exceed 100 in the border regions of china and lao pdr fig 8d f the overlap analysis shows that 20 to 38 of the cultivated land area would experience decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja although many regions would experience increasing rainfall erosivity in the jja the projected relative change in the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity of the son september november would generally increase in both the near and far term fig 9 in the near term the rainfall erosivity of son is projected to increase in more than 80 of the basin except for the regions at the upper end and the southwestern edge of the basin in the far term more than 98 of the basin would experience increasing rainfall erosivity under the highest emissions scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 in the far term the increasing rates of rainfall erosivity are greater than 100 in more than 70 of the basin in spring march may mam large areas outside of china would experience decreased rainfall erosivity in the near term under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 with relative change rates ranging from 60 to 0 the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity change in the far term is projected to be similar to that in the near term but larger rainfall erosivity decrease rates can be found in areas outside of china the decrease rate can reach 80 in the southwestern edge of the lmrb under the ssp5 rcp8 5 scenario fig 10 meanwhile in the mountainous area of the upper basin the rainfall erosivity of mam is generally projected to increase in the future under all three scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity and potential implications the results of this study indicate that the ensemble mean annual rainfall erosivity shows increasing trends in the lmrb which agree well with the increasing trends of the regional and global estimates chuenchum et al 2020b borrelli et al 2020 previous studies have shown that rising greenhouse gas emissions are expected to significantly increase precipitation extremes over the lmrb ge et al 2021 ngai et al 2022 since rainfall erosivity is strongly related to precipitation extremes it is not surprising that rainfall erosivity generally increases over the basin while in this study seasonal changes in future rainfall erosivity over the lmrb were also projected unlike the overall increasing trend of annual precipitation erosivity seasonal precipitation erosivity shows different spatial trends across the basin for example future rainfall erosivity in the jja is estimated to increase in the upper lmrb but decrease in the mid southern basin in thailand and southern lao pdr where highly erodible cultivated lands are distributed fig 8 this may be good news for soil erosion control as the risk of soil erosion in these regions may not increase even though annual rainfall erosivity is predicted to increase this detailed information cannot be obtained if seasonal rainfall erosivity predictions are not made similarly the projected negative change in rainfall erosivity of the mam also suggests an opportunity for soil conservation in the southern basin fig 10 because of the low pre rainy season soil cover in the mam agricultural soils are more susceptible to soil loss especially on steep slopes reduced rainfall erosivity in the mam means that less sediment enters the main stream during this period corresponding to the decrease in rainfall erosivity in the jja and the mam rainfall erosivity in the son would generally increase fig 9 but because it is at the end of the rainy season when the canopy is in good condition the increasing rainfall erosivity may not induce as much sediment as in previous seasons because the rainfall in the djf is a small proportion of the annual rainfall the rainfall erosivity of the djf may not affect soil erosion and sediment as much as other seasons through atmospheric teleconnections the el nino southern oscillation enso can drive global and regional hydroclimate variability mcgregor et al 2022 räsänen et al 2016 found that enso can affect the hydroclimate of the mam during the majority 95 of the study period over mainland southeast asia they also found that enso can cause a significant increase in climate variability during half 52 of the study period to show how global enso teleconnections will change under different projected emissions scenarios mcgregor et al 2022 compared the enso precipitation teleconnections between the historical and high emission future simulations in more than 31 models from cmip6 the results showed a clear and significant change in the enso teleconnection in the djf for the period 2081 2100 relative to 1950 2014 the results also suggest that changes in the enso precipitation teleconnection in many areas appear to scale with the modeled level of warming implying larger teleconnection changes at higher levels of warming therefore global warming would greatly influence the precipitation extremes and rainfall erosivity over the lmrb in the future sediment load in the main stream of the lancang mekong river is largely determined by the rainfall erosivity and soil erosion processes throughout the basin chuenchum et al 2020b soil erosion and sediment transport are linked to nutrient losses loss of farmland non point source pollution silting of dams and raising of riverbeds resulting in higher flood risk hecht et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yoshida et al 2020 but sediment may also have beneficial effects on the downstream delta and livelihoods anthony et al 2015 kondolf et al 2018 commercial sand mining and groundwater extraction induced subsidence can contribute to the sediment starving of the mekong delta kondolf et al 2014 moreover the sediment can bring nutrients to important downstream ecosystems like tonle sap lake and the mekong delta and maintain fisheries and agriculture which are crucial for local livelihoods yoshida et al 2020 thus how to balance soil erosion control and downstream sediment demand under a changing climate still needs further research and upstream downstream cooperation 4 2 land use land cover changes to mitigate increased future rainfall erosivity risk apart from rainfall erosivity changes in land use land cover are also highly associated with the soil erosion processes in the lmrb suif et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 chuenchum et al 2020a ly et al 2020 in the mountainous region of the upper lmrb located in china the forest area increased significantly in the two decades at the turn of the century zhang et al 2013 this can be attributed to the grain for green projects released by the central government of china since the end of the last century which has brought profound ecological and economic benefits to the local people and the eco environment this sustainable development method can effectively reduce the adverse effects of increased rainfall erosivity in the upstream of the lmrb wang et al 2021 in the lower lmrb the expansion of cultivated land may increase the erosion risks if the land use remains unchanged 20 38 of the cultivated land would experience decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja but this number will change which may affect the future distribution of soil erosion woody vegetation structure monitoring results in the lower lmrb showed that 9 4 of the forest area in 2000 was cleared and 16 6 was affected by disturbance by the year 2017 with cambodia having the highest deforestation rate of 22 5 at the national level potapov et al 2019 intensive forest utilization in this region combined with the increasing annual rainfall erosivity may increase future soil erosion risk a high rate of mangrove forest loss has been reported in the mekong delta region because of economic development and land policies veettil et al 2019 this requires a higher level of coastal ecological construction and sustainable development planning to mitigate the future increase in rainfall erosivity and other environmental risks 4 3 uncertainties and limitations large scale projections of future rainfall erosivity are challenging because of uncertainties and limitations in dataset availability downscaling processes and estimation methodology panagos et al 2022 uncertainties and limitations in this study are as follows first the selection of gcms ssp scenarios and empirical models affects the results of future rainfall erosivity projections an ensemble of five gcms three ssp scenarios and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models were included which may introduce uncertainties in future projections for example the empirical model itself can produce uncertainty the empirical model i separates the cold and warm seasons but the method of separating the cold and warm seasons may not fit the lmrb which will lead to uncertainty liu et al 2020a estimated changes in global rainfall erosivity based on different alpha and beta coefficients in different climate zones using daily precipitation data thus the variability of alpha and beta coefficients in empirical models can also affect projections future studies should develop the most appropriate coefficients for specific locations as for the choice of gcms it can also influence the projections the results obtained in this study confirm that different gcms have obviously different projection results for example mri esm2 0 consistently underestimates rainfall erosivity under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario fig 4 second the gcms and empirical models which agree well with the historical climate may not perform well in simulating future changes which can introduce uncertainty into the projection the w5e5 data used for bias correction processes can also introduce uncertainties third although the daily resolution data are good for predicting seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity xie et al 2016 there are still problems that may prevent the peak intensity of rainfall events from being precisely revealed yin et al 2015 thus the empirical models may underestimate the increase in future soil erosion risk in the lmrb which should be addressed in rainfall erosivity projections empirical models have generally been derived from site observed point data while gridded data with different probability density functions pdfs may introduce uncertainties in rainfall erosivity estimates since the spatial variability of rainfall erosivity can be high over short distances fiener et al 2019 gridded data may not capture the rainfall erosivity variability as well as point data within a grid cell potentially introducing uncertainty into projections last we did not consider the effects of climate change on the conversion of precipitation from snow to rain in the mountainous upper basin future studies should consider the changes in the phase of precipitation zhong et al 2018 5 conclusions future climate change impacts on the seasonal rainfall erosivity variations over the lmrb were assessed in this study by using bias corrected outputs of five cmip6 gcms and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models under three ssp climate change scenarios the results show that in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble means of basin wide annual rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period of 1980 2010 while in the far term of 2070 2100 the ensemble means would increase by 12 2 31 0 under different cmip6 climate change scenarios the basin wide averaged results reveal a higher risk of soil erosion by rainfall due to future climate change in terms of spatial distribution 88 99 of the area would show a positive change in rainfall erosivity and most of the ensemble members agree with the basin wide increase of rainfall erosivity seasonal rainfall erosivity variations show that the summer rainfall erosivity of the jja accounts for more than two thirds of the total annual rainfall erosivity in the historical period the projected rainfall erosivity of the jja would decrease in the mid southern basin of thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr while other regions would experience an increase in fact 20 to 38 of the cultivated land area would experience the decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja during the mam before the rainy season rainfall erosivity would decrease in large areas except for the mountainous part of china this implies that the negative impact of climate change on soil erosion during mam may be small although the annual rainfall erosivity is projected to increase the study provides information on potential changes in future rainfall erosivity which can contribute to a better understanding of soil erosion risk under climate change

2068,climate change is a driver of soil erosion but the future projections of seasonal rainfall erosivity variability and spatial distribution over the lancang mekong river basin lmrb are still not well understood based on the bias corrected precipitation data from five general circulation models gcms in the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the impacts of future climate change on the seasonal rainfall erosivity over the lmrb were assessed using three widely applied empirical daily rainfall erosivity models under three combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the representative concentration pathways ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 the results show that rainfall erosivity would generally increase in the near term 2030 2060 and far term 2070 2100 and more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity especially under the high emission scenarios in the far term in the near term the ensemble mean of basin wide rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period 1980 2010 while in the far term the ensemble mean would increase by 12 2 31 0 seasonal variations in rainfall erosivity show that summer rainfall erosivity from june to august accounts for more than two thirds of the total annual rainfall erosivity although the projected basin wide average summer rainfall erosivity would increase the mid southern basin in thailand and southern lao pdr would experience a decrease for rainfall erosivity from march to may large areas except for the mountainous part of china would also experience a decrease in seasonal rainfall erosivity the projected changes in rainfall erosivity can contribute to a better understanding of soil erosion risk under climate change across the lmrb keywords climate change empirical model soil erosion ssp scenarios precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion by water as one of the most important global environmental problems has received growing attention in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb due to its high association with climate change and sustainable social development zhou et al 2014 suif et al 2016 pham et al 2018 chuenchum et al 2020a the lmrb is one of the most important transboundary river basins in southeast asia and faces major challenges from climate change and rapid population growth anthony et al 2015 yang et al 2019 yoshida et al 2020 yun et al 2020 human activities and land cover changes affect soil loss in the lmrb shifting cultivation or so called slash and burn agriculture in which vegetation is cleared burned in place and then replanted on the cleared land is the dominant farming practice in the mountainous region of the lmrb rasul and thapa 2003 this process can cause severe soil loss thus contributing to the increased sediment concentrations in the river ziegler et al 2011 borrelli et al 2017 proposed a noticeable increase in soil erosion in southeast asian countries from 2001 to 2012 and the soil erosion rates were projected to increase in the future borrelli et al 2020 thus quantification of future soil erosion by water in this region is urgently needed for sustainable management in the future rainfall is the most important climatic factor influencing soil erosion climate change is expected to affect soil erosion by changing the rainfall characteristics and rainfall erosive power li and fang 2016 in the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and the revised usle renard and foster 1997 the rainfall erosivity of a storm is calculated as the product of the kinetic energy and the maximum rainfall intensity in 30 consecutive minutes which requires high frequency precipitation data however such precipitation data are not readily available in most parts of the world thus different empirical models have been developed and calibrated to estimate rainfall erosivity based on annual or monthly precipitation data renard and freimund 1994 daily precipitation data angulo martínez and beguería 2009 ma and zheng 2022 richardson et al 1983 yu and rosewell 1996 zhang et al 2002 or sub daily precipitation data yin et al 2007 2015 xie et al 2016 matthews et al 2022 at different locations around the world global climate models gcms are useful tools for projecting future rainfall erosivity the spatial distribution and temporal change of future rainfall erosivity can be quantified using empirical models mondal et al 2016 panagos et al 2017 borrelli et al 2020 azari et al 2021 since low resolution gcm data with biases do not correctly represent local rainfall erosivity various statistical downscaling and bias correction techniques have been utilized for future projections and impact assessments li et al 2021 most of the previous studies on rainfall erosivity projections for the lmrb were conducted based on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 5 cmip3 5 established by the world climate research program wcrp the latest cmip6 models have been improved with higher horizontal resolution and better representation of synoptic processes which can provide more reasonable results on climate extreme indices di luca et al 2020 zarrin and dadashi roudbari 2021 supharatid et al 2022 the cmip6 models also use the combination of shared socio economic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps making them more appropriate for future scenarios borrelli et al 2020 in the lmrb previous studies have used data from multiple sources to assess past and future precipitation trends in the past decades a general increasing trend of annual precipitation was found over the lmrb while at the seasonal scale different trends were found in wet and dry seasons with significant spatial differences between the upper and lower lmrb chen et al 2018 irannezhad et al 2020 since precipitation in the lmrb is significantly influenced by the south asian summer monsoon the southern oscillation and the indian summer monsoon irannezhad et al 2020 wang et al 2022a future warming would lead to an increase in extreme precipitation over the lmrb precipitation extremes are expected to increase significantly in a warmer future due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions ge et al 2021 ngai et al 2022 and soil erosion may increase in a warmer wetter world if land use and management are not adapted burt et al 2016 the decreasing trends in precipitation in specific seasons have also been projected on a seasonal scale over the lmrb based on the earlier phase of cmip data kingston et al 2011 these shifts in projected seasonal precipitation can lead to variations in rainfall erosivity over the lmrb which can affect soil erosion risk to project the future distribution of soil erosion in the lmrb annual rainfall erosivity projections were made based on the monthly rainfall data from a single gcm chuenchum et al 2020b the results show that rainfall erosivity increases in 2030 and 2040 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios contributing to the increasing soil erosion rates consistent with the global study by borrelli et al 2020 there are still limitations in the understanding of rainfall erosivity projections in the lmrb first these previous studies relied on one single gcm and empirical model since the selection of climate model and empirical model for estimating rainfall erosivity can significantly affect the projections the uncertainties associated with these projection results can lead to possible biases which require multi model ensembles kingston et al 2011 panagos et al 2022 second to more accurately estimate the seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity for better erosion estimation higher temporal resolution data e g daily or sub daily and rainfall estimation models are needed third few studies have investigated the future changes in rainfall erosivity with the latest cmip6 dataset especially in the lmrb therefore the main objectives of this study are to investigate the projected seasonal changes and spatial distributions of rainfall erosivity in the near term 2030 2060 and the far term 2070 2100 under multiple cmip6 climate change scenarios using multiple gcms and widely applied empirical models 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the lancang mekong river flows across six countries including china myanmar lao pdr thailand cambodia and vietnam fig 1 from its source on the tibetan plateau it flows 2 200 km and drops nearly 4 500 m in elevation before entering the lower basin at the border of china thailand and myanmar then it flows for another 2600 km until it enters the south china sea via a complex delta system in vietnam mrc 2005 the lmrb covers an area of 795 000 km2 and most of it is under the influence of the southwest monsoon the average annual soil erosion rate of the lmrb is about 5000 t km 2 yr 1 and the rate tends to increase continuously due to climate change and land use change chuenchum et al 2020a 2020b cultivated land mainly paddy and broadleaf deciduous forests are the main vegetation cover in more than half of the basin mrc 2019 monitored the land cover changes from 2003 to 2010 in the lower mekong river basin and found that shrubland increased by 7 9 followed by a 7 6 increase in broadleaf deciduous forest while broadleaf evergreen forest decreased by 19 5 the land cover types in 2020 show distinct differences from upstream to downstream with the upper tibetan plateau being covered by large areas of grassland shrubland permanent snow and ice while the lower basin consists mostly of cultivated land in thailand and western cambodia and forest in lao pdr fig 1b the land cover data are used to assess the rainfall erosivity changes across different land cover types in this study 2 2 gcm data under cmip6 scenarios and bias correction five gcms from cmip6 selected by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 3b isimip3b lange 2019 lange and büchner 2021 were included in this study table 1 climate model selection was based on the data availability criteria and performance allocations in historical periods to be included in isimip3b a climate model had to provide daily data for variables such as precipitation near surface air temperature and wind speed for all years in the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 periods five cmip6 gcms were selected based on their performance in the historical period these gcms are structurally independent regarding the ocean and atmospheric model components and are good representatives of the whole cmip6 ensemble in terms of climate sensitivity then the model performance in the historical period was assessed using the portrait plot and the five best performing cmip6 models were derived the five primary models are structurally independent in terms of ocean and atmosphere model components in terms of climate sensitivity the five primary models are good representatives of the whole cmip6 ensemble lange and büchner 2021 the bias corrected daily precipitation data under three different combined scenarios of the shared socioeconomic pathways and the representative concentration pathways ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 produced by the isimip3b project were used to calculate the rainfall erosivity during the historical period from 1981 to 2014 and the future period from 2015 to 2100 the method used for bias correction and statistical downscaling in isimip3b is isimip3basd v2 5 lange 2021 the observational reference dataset used for bias adjustment and statistical downscaling in isimip3b is version 2 0 of wfde5 over land merged with era5 over the ocean w5e5 lange et al 2021 the w5e5 dataset covers 1979 2016 with daily temporal resolution at 0 5 spatial resolution and the precipitation data are from version 2 3 of the global precipitation climatology project gpcp the training period used for both bias adjustment and statistical downscaling was 1979 2014 which covers the baseline period of 1980 2010 in this study before bias adjustment and statistical downscaling the original cmip6 output was interpolated in time and space after bias adjustment and statistical downscaling values greater than the upper limit of 600 mm per day were set to the upper limit the spatial resolution of the downscaled and bias corrected data used is 0 5 2 3 daily rainfall erosivity empirical models finer temporal resolution of the rainfall data can improve the results of rainfall erosivity estimation ma and zheng 2022 therefore three representative daily empirical models were selected for the future rainfall erosivity projection which were also selected by liu et al 2020a to estimate the global rainfall erosivity changes in different climate zones with different coefficients these selected models have been widely applied in different locations and are suitable for estimating the rainfall erosivity in monsoon climates empirical model i is a power law function with different coefficient values in cold and warm seasons xie et al 2016 which was found to be a robust daily model that could be widely used in china chen et al 2020 wang et al 2022b this model was also adopted in the chinese soil loss equation and the first national water and soil conservation survey liu et al 2020b the formula is expressed as 1 r i α 1 j 1 k p d 1 β 1 where r i is the ith half month rainfall erosivity of a year in mj mm ha 1h 1 j 1 2 k represents the number of erosive rainfall days within this half month the first half months are the first to 15th days of each month and the remaining days are the second half months pd1 is the daily erosive rainfall daily rainfall greater than or equal to 9 7 mm in mm the parameter α1 was set to 0 3937 in the warm season may to september and to 0 3101 in the cold season october to april the parameter β 1 was calibrated and set to 1 7265 with this formula the annual and seasonal rainfall erosivity values are calculated as the accumulated half month rainfall erosivity empirical model ii is a power law function with a sinusoidal relationship reflecting monthly variations in the coefficient originally proposed by yu and rosewell 1996 and calibrated by xie et al 2016 using one minute resolution rainfall data from sixteen stations in the eastern china monsoon region this model represents the type of model with a monthly varying alpha that has been widely applied and proposed to be most effective in australia and southern china zhu et al 2021 ma and zheng 2022 the formula is expressed as 2 r d α 2 1 η c o s 2 π f θ ω p d 1 β 1 where r d is the rainfall erosivity for a rainy day in mj mm ha 1h 1 f 1 12 is the frequency of the cosine function θ is the month from 1 to 12 and ω 7π 6 the parameters α2 and η were calibrated and set to 0 2686 and 0 5412 respectively empirical model iii is also a power law function originally proposed by richardson et al 1983 and calibrated by zhang et al 2002 which has been used in rainfall erosivity projections in china li et al 2021 rainfall erosivity was calculated using the following formulas at the half month time step zhang et al 2002 3 r i α 3 j 1 k p d 2 β 2 where pd2 is the daily erosive rainfall amount in mm daily rainfall greater than or equal to 12 mm the coefficients α3 and β 2 are calculated according to the following formulas 4 α 3 21 58 β 2 7 1891 5 β 2 0 8363 18 177 p d 12 24 455 p y 12 where pd12 is the average daily erosive rainfall amount in mm daily rainfall greater than or equal to 12 mm and py12 is the mean value of the annual erosive rainfall amount in mm 2 4 multi model ensemble analysis a total of fifteen ensemble members were included in this study due to the combination of five gcms and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models ensemble means were calculated to derive the annual and seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity under different cmip6 scenarios in different future periods three periods were selected namely the baseline period 1980 2010 the near term 2030 2060 and the far term 2070 2100 the fraction of positive minus negative fpn was obtained to indicate the degree of agreement among ensemble members which was calculated as the number of ensemble members showing a positive change minus the number of ensemble members showing a negative change divided by the total number of the ensemble numbers tang and lettenmaier 2012 the fpn values varied from 100 to 100 and positive values indicate that more ensemble members agree with the positive change while negative values of fpn indicate the opposite 3 results 3 1 historical precipitation and rainfall erosivity distribution in the baseline period 1980 2010 the highest values of precipitation occurred in the mountainous regions along the border between lao pdr and vietnam fig 2 a another precipitation center is located in the mountainous region of vietnam located in the southwest of the basin from the upper mountainous regions to the lower part of the basin the mean precipitation shows a general increasing trend with the influence of the summer monsoon the ensemble mean annual rainfall erosivity shows a similar spatial distribution to the precipitation fig 2 basin wide mean values of rainfall erosivity ranged from 3779 to 5265 mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 with an ensemble mean value of 4462 mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 table s1 the estimation of rainfall erosivity values depends on model selection empirical model ii has the lowest value while empirical model iii has the highest value fig 3 compared to the average annual rainfall erosivity calculated by empirical model i the values of empirical models ii and iii changed by 9 2 and 6 3 respectively the estimation of rainfall erosivity values also depends on the choice of gcms the values estimated using mpi esm 1 2 hr and mri esm1 0 ll input were 7 2 and 3 4 smaller than the average values of five gcms but the values obtained from gfdl esm4 and ukesm1 0 ll were 5 3 and 4 5 larger than the average values of five gcms table s1 3 2 projected relative changes of rainfall erosivity in near and far terms in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble mean of basin wide rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period table s1 most ensemble members suggest that rainfall erosivity will increase by up to 10 notable exceptions occur in the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario of mri esm1 0 ll the ssp1 rcp2 6 and ssp5 rcp8 5 scenarios of gfdl esm4 and the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario of ukesm1 0 ll fig 4 the rainfall erosivity values calculated with the three different empirical models and the gcm mri esm1 0 ll are all projected to decrease under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenarios while in the far term of 2070 2100 the ensemble means would increase by 12 2 31 0 under different cmip6 climate change scenarios table s1 larger increasing trends in rainfall erosivity are found compared to those in the near term similar to the near term the rainfall erosivity values calculated with all three different empirical models and the gcm mri esm1 0 ll are also projected to decrease under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenarios the increasing rates under the high emission scenarios are generally higher than those under the low emission scenarios the far term changes in rainfall erosivity under the ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 scenarios of ipsl cm6ar lr are large and can reach an increase of 60 compared to the baseline period in the near term of 2030 2060 only a small part 7 12 of the lmrb shows decreased rainfall erosivity compared with the baseline period under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 fig 5 under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 rainfall erosivity shows an increasing trend over the entire basin fig 5a under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 rainfall erosivity would increase in 88 93 of the basin except for the mountainous area along the cambodia vietnam border and the southern edge area of the tibetan plateau fig 5b c under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity in 97 of the basin and 100 agreement has been reached in the border areas of china myanmar and lao pdr fig 5d under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 20 of the basin shows that more ensemble members agree with the increase in rainfall erosivity fig 5e under the scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 positive fpn values are found over more than 92 of the basin area the fpn values are higher than 80 at the southern end of the basin and in the border areas of thailand myanmar and lao pdr indicating high agreement among the ensemble members negative fpn values are identified in thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr indicating that more ensemble members agree with a negative change in rainfall erosivity over this region fig 5f in the far term of 2070 2100 only 1 of the lmrb shows decreased rainfall erosivity under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 while the relative changes in rainfall erosivity in other regions are all positive under all three scenarios fig 6 the far term changes in rainfall erosivity are generally higher compared to the near term changes the basin wide averaged relative changes under the scenarios of ssp1 rcp2 6 ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 are 17 9 29 5 and 41 5 respectively under the scenario of ssp1 rcp2 6 positive fpn values are found over more than 99 of the entire basin fig 6d under the scenario of ssp3 rcp7 0 positive fpn values are found over more than 93 of the basin while negative fpn values are identified over the mountainous area at the border of cambodia and vietnam fig 6e this can be attributed to the mri esm1 0 ll as all empirical models projected reduced rainfall erosivity in this gcm under the scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 positive fpn values are observed over the entire basin and more than 80 of the basin areas have an fpn value greater than 80 fig 6f showing that all members agree with a positive change in rainfall erosivity only with at most one ensemble member exception 3 3 seasonal variations of the basin wide averaged rainfall erosivity the monthly rainfall erosivity of the lmrb is relatively high from june to october which coincides with the rainy season in the lmrb in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity values and uncertainty ranges under the three climate change scenarios are similar fig 7 a while in the far term of 2070 2100 the rainfall erosivity values from june to january under the three scenarios are all greater than the baseline period following the sequence of ssp5 rcp8 5 ssp3 rcp7 0 ssp1 rcp2 6 fig 7b the uncertainties of the gcms and empirical models in the far term are larger than those in the near term especially for the higher emission scenarios from june to january the ensemble mean relative changes are all positive and the magnitudes of the changes in the far term are larger than those in the near term fig 7c d while from february to may the ensemble mean relative change under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario is negative these results indicate the increasing erosion risk from june to january while decreasing rainfall erosivity can be found from february to may especially under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario the uncertainties of relative changes in the far term are also larger compared to those in the near term especially under the higher emission scenarios 3 4 spatial distributions of relative change in rainfall erosivity in different seasons in summer june august jja the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity in thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr show a decreasing trend under scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 in the near term with the relative change rates ranging from 40 to 0 under the ssp1 rcp2 6 scenario the western part of the basin in thailand shows a decreasing trend other regions would experience increased rainfall erosivity under all three scenarios with increasing rates less than 60 fig 8 a c during the far term similar spatial patterns but larger magnitudes of relative change are observed with the increase in emission level regions with a positive change in rainfall erosivity show accelerated rates of increase which can exceed 100 in the border regions of china and lao pdr fig 8d f the overlap analysis shows that 20 to 38 of the cultivated land area would experience decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja although many regions would experience increasing rainfall erosivity in the jja the projected relative change in the ensemble mean rainfall erosivity of the son september november would generally increase in both the near and far term fig 9 in the near term the rainfall erosivity of son is projected to increase in more than 80 of the basin except for the regions at the upper end and the southwestern edge of the basin in the far term more than 98 of the basin would experience increasing rainfall erosivity under the highest emissions scenario of ssp5 rcp8 5 in the far term the increasing rates of rainfall erosivity are greater than 100 in more than 70 of the basin in spring march may mam large areas outside of china would experience decreased rainfall erosivity in the near term under the scenarios of ssp3 rcp7 0 and ssp5 rcp8 5 with relative change rates ranging from 60 to 0 the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity change in the far term is projected to be similar to that in the near term but larger rainfall erosivity decrease rates can be found in areas outside of china the decrease rate can reach 80 in the southwestern edge of the lmrb under the ssp5 rcp8 5 scenario fig 10 meanwhile in the mountainous area of the upper basin the rainfall erosivity of mam is generally projected to increase in the future under all three scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity and potential implications the results of this study indicate that the ensemble mean annual rainfall erosivity shows increasing trends in the lmrb which agree well with the increasing trends of the regional and global estimates chuenchum et al 2020b borrelli et al 2020 previous studies have shown that rising greenhouse gas emissions are expected to significantly increase precipitation extremes over the lmrb ge et al 2021 ngai et al 2022 since rainfall erosivity is strongly related to precipitation extremes it is not surprising that rainfall erosivity generally increases over the basin while in this study seasonal changes in future rainfall erosivity over the lmrb were also projected unlike the overall increasing trend of annual precipitation erosivity seasonal precipitation erosivity shows different spatial trends across the basin for example future rainfall erosivity in the jja is estimated to increase in the upper lmrb but decrease in the mid southern basin in thailand and southern lao pdr where highly erodible cultivated lands are distributed fig 8 this may be good news for soil erosion control as the risk of soil erosion in these regions may not increase even though annual rainfall erosivity is predicted to increase this detailed information cannot be obtained if seasonal rainfall erosivity predictions are not made similarly the projected negative change in rainfall erosivity of the mam also suggests an opportunity for soil conservation in the southern basin fig 10 because of the low pre rainy season soil cover in the mam agricultural soils are more susceptible to soil loss especially on steep slopes reduced rainfall erosivity in the mam means that less sediment enters the main stream during this period corresponding to the decrease in rainfall erosivity in the jja and the mam rainfall erosivity in the son would generally increase fig 9 but because it is at the end of the rainy season when the canopy is in good condition the increasing rainfall erosivity may not induce as much sediment as in previous seasons because the rainfall in the djf is a small proportion of the annual rainfall the rainfall erosivity of the djf may not affect soil erosion and sediment as much as other seasons through atmospheric teleconnections the el nino southern oscillation enso can drive global and regional hydroclimate variability mcgregor et al 2022 räsänen et al 2016 found that enso can affect the hydroclimate of the mam during the majority 95 of the study period over mainland southeast asia they also found that enso can cause a significant increase in climate variability during half 52 of the study period to show how global enso teleconnections will change under different projected emissions scenarios mcgregor et al 2022 compared the enso precipitation teleconnections between the historical and high emission future simulations in more than 31 models from cmip6 the results showed a clear and significant change in the enso teleconnection in the djf for the period 2081 2100 relative to 1950 2014 the results also suggest that changes in the enso precipitation teleconnection in many areas appear to scale with the modeled level of warming implying larger teleconnection changes at higher levels of warming therefore global warming would greatly influence the precipitation extremes and rainfall erosivity over the lmrb in the future sediment load in the main stream of the lancang mekong river is largely determined by the rainfall erosivity and soil erosion processes throughout the basin chuenchum et al 2020b soil erosion and sediment transport are linked to nutrient losses loss of farmland non point source pollution silting of dams and raising of riverbeds resulting in higher flood risk hecht et al 2019 yang et al 2019 yoshida et al 2020 but sediment may also have beneficial effects on the downstream delta and livelihoods anthony et al 2015 kondolf et al 2018 commercial sand mining and groundwater extraction induced subsidence can contribute to the sediment starving of the mekong delta kondolf et al 2014 moreover the sediment can bring nutrients to important downstream ecosystems like tonle sap lake and the mekong delta and maintain fisheries and agriculture which are crucial for local livelihoods yoshida et al 2020 thus how to balance soil erosion control and downstream sediment demand under a changing climate still needs further research and upstream downstream cooperation 4 2 land use land cover changes to mitigate increased future rainfall erosivity risk apart from rainfall erosivity changes in land use land cover are also highly associated with the soil erosion processes in the lmrb suif et al 2016 zhou et al 2014 chuenchum et al 2020a ly et al 2020 in the mountainous region of the upper lmrb located in china the forest area increased significantly in the two decades at the turn of the century zhang et al 2013 this can be attributed to the grain for green projects released by the central government of china since the end of the last century which has brought profound ecological and economic benefits to the local people and the eco environment this sustainable development method can effectively reduce the adverse effects of increased rainfall erosivity in the upstream of the lmrb wang et al 2021 in the lower lmrb the expansion of cultivated land may increase the erosion risks if the land use remains unchanged 20 38 of the cultivated land would experience decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja but this number will change which may affect the future distribution of soil erosion woody vegetation structure monitoring results in the lower lmrb showed that 9 4 of the forest area in 2000 was cleared and 16 6 was affected by disturbance by the year 2017 with cambodia having the highest deforestation rate of 22 5 at the national level potapov et al 2019 intensive forest utilization in this region combined with the increasing annual rainfall erosivity may increase future soil erosion risk a high rate of mangrove forest loss has been reported in the mekong delta region because of economic development and land policies veettil et al 2019 this requires a higher level of coastal ecological construction and sustainable development planning to mitigate the future increase in rainfall erosivity and other environmental risks 4 3 uncertainties and limitations large scale projections of future rainfall erosivity are challenging because of uncertainties and limitations in dataset availability downscaling processes and estimation methodology panagos et al 2022 uncertainties and limitations in this study are as follows first the selection of gcms ssp scenarios and empirical models affects the results of future rainfall erosivity projections an ensemble of five gcms three ssp scenarios and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models were included which may introduce uncertainties in future projections for example the empirical model itself can produce uncertainty the empirical model i separates the cold and warm seasons but the method of separating the cold and warm seasons may not fit the lmrb which will lead to uncertainty liu et al 2020a estimated changes in global rainfall erosivity based on different alpha and beta coefficients in different climate zones using daily precipitation data thus the variability of alpha and beta coefficients in empirical models can also affect projections future studies should develop the most appropriate coefficients for specific locations as for the choice of gcms it can also influence the projections the results obtained in this study confirm that different gcms have obviously different projection results for example mri esm2 0 consistently underestimates rainfall erosivity under the ssp3 rcp7 0 scenario fig 4 second the gcms and empirical models which agree well with the historical climate may not perform well in simulating future changes which can introduce uncertainty into the projection the w5e5 data used for bias correction processes can also introduce uncertainties third although the daily resolution data are good for predicting seasonal changes in rainfall erosivity xie et al 2016 there are still problems that may prevent the peak intensity of rainfall events from being precisely revealed yin et al 2015 thus the empirical models may underestimate the increase in future soil erosion risk in the lmrb which should be addressed in rainfall erosivity projections empirical models have generally been derived from site observed point data while gridded data with different probability density functions pdfs may introduce uncertainties in rainfall erosivity estimates since the spatial variability of rainfall erosivity can be high over short distances fiener et al 2019 gridded data may not capture the rainfall erosivity variability as well as point data within a grid cell potentially introducing uncertainty into projections last we did not consider the effects of climate change on the conversion of precipitation from snow to rain in the mountainous upper basin future studies should consider the changes in the phase of precipitation zhong et al 2018 5 conclusions future climate change impacts on the seasonal rainfall erosivity variations over the lmrb were assessed in this study by using bias corrected outputs of five cmip6 gcms and three empirical daily rainfall erosivity models under three ssp climate change scenarios the results show that in the near term of 2030 2060 the ensemble means of basin wide annual rainfall erosivity would increase by 2 5 8 7 compared to the baseline period of 1980 2010 while in the far term of 2070 2100 the ensemble means would increase by 12 2 31 0 under different cmip6 climate change scenarios the basin wide averaged results reveal a higher risk of soil erosion by rainfall due to future climate change in terms of spatial distribution 88 99 of the area would show a positive change in rainfall erosivity and most of the ensemble members agree with the basin wide increase of rainfall erosivity seasonal rainfall erosivity variations show that the summer rainfall erosivity of the jja accounts for more than two thirds of the total annual rainfall erosivity in the historical period the projected rainfall erosivity of the jja would decrease in the mid southern basin of thailand and the southern part of the lao pdr while other regions would experience an increase in fact 20 to 38 of the cultivated land area would experience the decreasing rainfall erosivity in the jja during the mam before the rainy season rainfall erosivity would decrease in large areas except for the mountainous part of china this implies that the negative impact of climate change on soil erosion during mam may be small although the annual rainfall erosivity is projected to increase the study provides information on potential changes in future rainfall erosivity which can contribute to a better understanding of soil erosion risk under climate change

2069,studies around the world have shown that increases in extreme precipitation are not directly resulting in reported instances of flooding despite the evidence that antecedent soil moisture conditions play a significant role in regulating the runoff response during extreme storm events fewer works have tried to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such coupled interactions in the present work we aim to improve our understanding of the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture sm precipitation p dependence over europe using an event based non parametric event coincidence analysis eca approach we first quantified the probability of sm preceding p by the precursor coincidence rate we also examined the statistical precursor relationship between sm p joint episodes and reported annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence rate the results show that seasonality is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p coupling over europe the conditional precursor coincidence rates are in line with previous flood hazard studies over europe and show the importance of considering such diverse interdependencies in flood risk mitigation our work has implications for understanding the occurrence of preconditioned compound events worldwide and provides a vital starting point for characterising the major processes that need to be accounted for in comprehensive state of the art flood risk assessment studies keywords soil moisture floods eca sm p coupling europe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally floods are considered one of the most devastating and prevalent natural hazards impacting regions across continents and various diverse climatic regimes coumou and rahmstorf 2012 merz et al 2021 seneviratne et al 2021 the marked shifts in the global water cycle due to climatic variability and anthropogenic forcings are nowadays becoming more common and widespread ipcc 2021 furthermore anthropogenic climate change coupled with socioeconomic shifts in population exposure is expected to play a major role in shaping future flood hazard risk gu et al 2020 kam et al 2021 even though the risk of catastrophic flooding has impacted europe throughout history barredo 2007 brázdil et al 2006 human induced alterations in the global earth system have led to significant changes in the patterns and intensity of flooding events in europe bertola et al 2021 blöschl et al 2017 madsen et al 2014 this is further expected to result in a substantial increase in future flood damages alfieri et al 2015 dottori et al 2023 jongman et al 2014 these facts call for a better understanding of the predominant flood risk patterns over europe extreme precipitation events have increased over the past few decades papalexiou and montanari 2019 westra et al 2013 precipitation extremes are controlled by both thermodynamic local exchanges in heat moisture and other related quantities and dynamic processes those related to atmospheric and oceanic motions teleconnections at the regional scale recent studies seneviratne et al 2021 have reported that the observed rate of increased precipitation extremes at the global scale are in line with the famous clausius clapeyron relation pall et al 2007 the role of predecessor rain events in generating peak discharge has already been established globally bischiniotis et al 2018 froidevaux et al 2015 however the global increase in precipitation extremes has not directly translated into a rise in reported flood events do et al 2017 flood initiation and magnitude are invariably impacted by the intensity of precipitation landform land use land cover change soil properties and antecedent catchment conditions including soil moisture and snowpack previous studies have found that the decrease in antecedent soil moisture has led to a decline in observed flood discharge even with increased extreme precipitation sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019 soil moisture also plays a vital role in water and energy budget equations through its impact on evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 it also partitions the rainfall into various other hydrological cycle components evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff and hence directly impacts flood characteristics hlavcova et al 2005 komma et al 2008 massari et al 2018 zehe and blöschl 2004 zhai et al 2018 the interaction between antecedent catchment wetness and precipitation can be critical in shaping the runoff response however traditional risk assessment approaches usually only focused on univariate precipitation peak flood discharge modelling techniques to study the flood characteristics several studies around the world have now shown that univariate approaches underestimate the risk of an extreme event leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 and that most natural hazards are caused by a combination of multiple statistically dependent physical processes arising across multiple spatial and temporal scales kemter et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2020 the ipcc special report on climate extremes srex 2012 seneviratne et al 2012 first defined this broad class of events as compound events specifically preconditioned compound events are events in which an underlying weather driven or climate driven precondition leads to an alteration generally an increase in the impacts of a hazard bevacqua et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2020 it is also worthwhile to note here that the existing precondition could also have an attenuating stabilising effect and reduce the impact of the subsequent hazard like in the case of dryer antecedent conditions before floods blöschl et al 2017 the importance of such initial hydrologic conditions on catchment response cannot be overemphasised garg and mishra 2019 khatun et al 2022 berghuijs et al 2019b illustrated the importance of such conditions over european catchments and they showed that most annual peak floods in europe are caused not by large precipitation events but by the mutual co occurrence or coincidence of rainfall with either snowmelt or soil saturated conditions ghajarnia et al 2020 demonstrated the close statistical covariation relationship between soil moisture and runoff anomalies for the different european climatic regimes using a data driven multi catchment comparative approach with different datasets they unravelled a dominant first order covariation between soil moisture and runoff on the monthly scale blöschl et al 2017 analysed the timing of river floods in europe from 1960 to 2010 and found a clear shift in the timings of winter floods over western europe due to earlier soil moisture maxima wasko et al 2021 examined the trends in streamflow using a global dataset and attributed the decreasing trend of frequent flood magnitudes to the dominance of drying antecedent soil moisture conditions in contrast to the intensification of short duration precipitation grillakis et al 2016 compared the importance of initial soil moisture conditions for flash flood generation over different catchments and found that the peak discharge was dependent on soil moisture states and the magnitude of the impact relies on the magnitude of the event however within the available literature studies attempting to contextualize the soil moisture sm precipitation p preconditioning at a european scale is particularly sparse and very few works have attempted to understand the changing regional patterns between such sm p relationships at a seasonal scale hence there is a growing need to account for the role played by antecedent catchment wetness before a precipitation event in shaping the catchment response and their seasonal changes specifically it becomes necessary to characterise the spatiotemporal patterns of coincidence between soil moisture sm and precipitation p events the benefits of establishing such spatial information maps in the context of flood hydrology merz and blöschl 2008 and in characterising hydroclimatic covariability sun et al 2018 are already well established in the literature the seasonal changes in such patterns could further aid in understanding how the different climatic regions of europe behave in the context of sm p covariability traditional measures like correlation and covariance are indeed helpful in understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p dependence however the interdependencies are evaluated considering the entire distribution of data they describe dependence at the centre of the distribution and may under overestimate dependence in the joint tails of the distribution jiang et al 2020 siegmund et al 2016b some more commonly used linear methods may fail when the underlying distributions exhibit significant deviations from the gaussian assumption analyses involving identifying and subsequently extracting discrete events of interest from a continuous time series are common in hydrological sciences from an observed streamflow record at a gauging site only a few specified high discharge events are usually considered for flood frequency analysis adamowski et al 1998 bezak et al 2014 taesombut and yevjevich 1978 event coincidence analysis eca donges et al 2016 is a non parametric statistical tool that has received considerable attention in the past few years previous work across many diverse scientific disciplines has shown that eca can characterise the statistical interdependencies between different variables processes in many varied settings christopoulos et al 2020 fdez arroyabe et al 2020 templ et al 2021 wiedermann et al 2021 furthermore a statistical significance test checks the robustness of the obtained coincidence rates donges et al 2016 siegmund et al 2017 however only a few studies have employed eca to characterise the spatial and temporal dynamics of sm p coupling sun et al 2018 was the first to illustrate the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coupling using the eca approach they characterised the spatial patterns for texas in the us and further linked the results with the dominant seasonal climatology of the study region manoj et al 2022 evaluated the spatiotemporal dependence between sm and p across india using eca and additionally investigated their temporal evolution over time and compared it with the changing behaviour of precipitation during the same duration the previous works considered two variables sm p to quantify the sm p coincidence rates and infer the dynamics of their changing spatiotemporal patterns the basic two variable eca can also be advanced to account for the role of a third observable process siegmund et al 2016a such a conditional event coincidence analysis ceca siegmund et al 2016a could help in additionally considering the conditioning of events on instances governed by a third variable to the best of our knowledge no previous work has attempted to incorporate discharge as a third variable in the eca framework to statistically quantify the role of sm p coincidences as a possible precursor to the annual flood events such an analysis would offer additional information on the lagged dependence of annual floods on soil moisture precipitation preconditioning advancing our understanding of soil moisture sm precipitation p interactions would help in robustly characterising the regions over which a dominant statistical dependence exists between sm and p identifying areas catchments which experience a co occurrence coincidence between sm and p anomalies can be considered critical for better understanding the occurrence and propagation of large scale flood events like the one of july 2021 in western europe dietze et al 2022 ibebuchi 2022 the timing of annual peak floods could also be used to investigate such sm p coincidences prior to the annual flood events over different european climatic regions with this motivation in the present work we a describe the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coincidence over europe and then try to visualise the changing seasonal nature of such sm p dependence over the different climatic regions b identify and contextualise the annual floods occurring after such sm p coincidences have already taken place the article is organised as follows section 2 briefly introduces the study area and datasets used for the analysis the steps used in data preparation and a summary of event coincidence analysis are presented in section 3 section 4 details the results of the present study and section 5 the discussions final concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 study area data 2 1 study area understanding the possible role of antecedent conditions for floods is vital for setting up reliable flood estimation and forecast mechanisms at the european scale previous studies have shown that the mean annual timing of floods over europe is spatially well defined with distinct regional differences for their seasonality and generation mechanism the dominant flood generation mechanisms include precipitation excess soil moisture excess and snowmelt driven floods berghuijs et al 2019b blöschl et al 2019 2017 hall and blöschl 2018 below 60 latitude annual floods are typically seen in parts of western europe in winter and transition to spring floods in the east above 60 latitude except for coastal areas spring floods are more widespread the interplay between catchment conditions e g soil saturation due to persistent rainfall events and precipitation events often leads to a catchment response quite different from the ones expected due to the precipitation events acting alone this is particularly important to characterise from an extreme event perspective merz et al 2021 indeed in the near past intense flooding episodes have been caused by extreme precipitation and moderate catchment wetness blöschl et al 2007 and by moderate precipitation and extreme catchment wetness conditions schröter et al 2015 the köppen geiger climate classification zones for europe include cold semi arid climate bsk hot summer mediterranean climate csa warm summer mediterranean climate csb humid subtropical climate cfa cold desert climate bwk hot desert climate bwh hot semi arid climate bsh warm dry summer continental climate dsb temperate maritime climate cfb and warm summer humid continental climate dfb peel et al 2007 the ipcc srex 2012 classified the climatic zones into three distinct classes northern europe neu central europe ceu and southern europe seu the climatic homogeneity was characterised by mean states of precipitation and temperature considering köppen geiger climatic regions and the annual precipitation cycle in the latest ar6 assessment of the ipcc the classification system was further refined to better represent consistent regional climate features however the spatial boundaries of the three major european regions from srex 2012 neu ceu and seu have been maintained unaltered since they encompass the main regional climates in europe iturbide et al 2020 within europe the transition of climate types from west to east due to continentality and its subsequent impacts are already well documented in literature grabowska 2008 mikolaskova 2009 moghim et al 2022 thompson 1995 the mean annual timings of floods over europe also exhibit a west to east transition hall and blöschl 2018 to account for the impact of such a west to east gradient on the seasonal evolution of sm p coincidence rates within the three ipcc srex regions we subdivided each region into two based on the 15 e longitude they are conveniently classified as west neu east neu west ceu east ceu west seu and east seu in the present work the analysis is being carried out at a grid scale and we then compare and interpret our results based on the homogenous regions classification fig 1 details the six major regions covered 2 2 data e obs v24 0 cornes et al 2018 grid based daily precipitation product was used in the current study the final time series is obtained from the station network of the european climate assessment dataset eca d project e obs is a pan european continental scale observational dataset of several surface climate variables including daily precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperatures the dataset is based on observations from meteorological stations spanning across europe provided by the national meteorological and hydrological services nmhss and other relevant data holding institutes klein tank et al 2002 it is an ensemble dataset constructed through a conditional simulation approach cornes et al 2018 klein tank et al 2002 klok and klein tank 2009 previous works have assessed the ability of e obs to replicate the observed precipitation characteristics over europe and have reported encouraging results bandhauer et al 2022 hu and franzke 2020 kostopoulou et al 2012 the e obs product has also been extensively used over europe in flood hazard assessment studies berghuijs et al 2019b 2019a blöschl et al 2019 2017 the spatial resolution of the precipitation product used here is 0 25 x 0 25 the monthly climatology of mean daily precipitation for the six regions is depicted in fig 2 the modelled soil moisture product used in the present work comes from the gleam v3 5 martens et al 2017 model gleam stands for global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 it is worthwhile to point out that the best possible way to characterise the sm p spatiotemporal patterns would be by using observational datasets for both soil moisture and precipitation however no continental scale observational dataset exists for soil moisture with consistent and homogenous spatial and temporal coverage hence there is a need to use alternate datasets for this purpose the gleam model product used here has been previously used to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water cycle and for characterising extreme events alsafadi et al 2022 ghajarnia et al 2020 good et al 2017 guillod et al 2015 miralles et al 2014 pyarali et al 2022 schumacher et al 2019 the soil moisture product was also available at a daily temporal scale with a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 fig 3 shows the monthly changes in soil moisture across the different hydroclimatic regions considered in the present work the discharge peaks were taken from the european flood database fig 1 blöschl et al 2017 hall et al 2015 hall and blöschl 2018 consisting of the day of occurrence of annual maximum discharge values or water levels daily or instantaneous values the dataset is available for 4062 catchments over europe similar to berghuijs et al 2019b we do not consider the catchments over iceland in the present work the outlet elevations range from around sea level to almost 2000 m with the catchment area ranging from 10 to 100000 km2 hall et al 2015 hall and blöschl 2018 to compare the dates of annual flows with sm p coincidences we compare the flood events with the sm and p events for the grid cell where the streamflow gauging station is located flood generation is usually produced over the entire catchment area nevertheless with this simplification we are able to obtain a first estimate of the catchments where significant dependence exists between sm p coincidences and the peak discharge events this limitation is discussed in more detail in section 5 4 3 methodology in the present section we first explain briefly the steps involved in data preparation 3 1 we then detail the event coincidence analysis eca in 3 2 used in 4 1 for unravelling the seasonal sm p coincidences over the major european climatic regions followed by conditional event coincidence analysis in 3 3 used in 4 2 for comparing the dates of annual peak floods over european catchments with the sm p coincidences 3 1 data pre processing the e obs precipitation product was retrieved from the copernicus climate change service website the gleam product was accessed via the gleam project s official website the discharge data was downloaded from the ingenieurhydrologie und wassermengenwirtschaft tu wien website links to data are provided in the data availability statement precipitation and soil moisture products had a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 however the spatial overlaps were different and hence bilinear spatial remapping technique schulzweida 2019 was used to interpolate the gleam product to the e obs grid similar to sun et al 2018 and manoj et al 2022 we use the daily time step to characterise the sm p dependence patterns to disentangle the sm p coincidences at a seasonal scale the daily time series corresponding to every grid point is split into four seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son we identify the top 5 events for precipitation and soil moisture for each season at each grid point using the respective seasonal 95th percentile limit which on average leads to about 185 189 events in total per season for both p and sm this is widely adopted in a number of studies for defining extreme events leckebusch and ulbrich 2004 manoj et al 2022 mondal et al 2020 pendergrass 2018 sheridan and lee 2018 the event series is finally represented as a binary series 0 and 1 in which 1 denotes the presence of an event and 0 denotes the absence of an event during a timestep figs c1 and c2 in appendix c supplementary information shows the spatial map of the percentile cutoffs used for precipitation and soil moisture respectively for the discharge dataset the peak flood events are compared with the precipitation and soil moisture events for the grid cell where the streamflow gauging station is located to maintain temporal overlap between the products the sm p dependence patterns are evaluated at a seasonal scale from 1980 to 2020 due to the temporal coverage of the flood discharge data flood peaks are compared for the period from 1980 up to 2010 only to ensure a sufficient sample size for each season the flood analysis is always restricted to catchments having more than five events in conjunction with the statistical significance test this ensures that our results are significant and not subject to random effects table d1 in supplementary information details the number of flood events considered per season for each catchment 3 2 event coincidence analysis eca event coincidence analysis eca donges et al 2016 2011 siegmund et al 2017 is a statistical non parametric method used to quantify and characterise the coincidence rates between two sequences of events of different types in the present case we consider precipitation p and soil moisture sm events it is a particularly useful tool in climatic studies he and sheffield 2020 manoj et al 2022 sun et al 2018 2017 and helps to consider the timings of certain well defined events it has found varied applications in earth sciences and allied fields some of the more recent works include exploring the global transition between droughts and pluvial events drought pluvial seesaw he and sheffield 2020 constructing a functional network from gridded precipitation data to study the changes in spatiotemporal patterns of monsoons over east asia wolf et al 2021 deriving statistical relationships between el nino southern oscillation enso episodes and drought occurrence over china xing et al 2022 and evaluating the occurrence of flooding preceded by heat stress over central united states zhang and villarini 2020 however none of the previous studies have included simultaneously soil moisture precipitation and flood discharge data to contextualise the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a peak flood discharge mechanism the first step in the analysis involves setting the hypothesis that events in sm precede events in p in our case of quantifying sm p coincidence this ensures that sm events occur before p events hence the trivial case of sm arising well after p has already occurred is not counted as a coincidence eca affords two parameters the temporal tolerance window δ t and lag parameter τ and counts the mutual occurrences of events p and sm within the temporal tolerance interval δ t to characterise the probability of sm preceding p eca provides the precursor coincidence rate r p the main purpose of the precursor coincidence rate is to identify out of the total p events those events preceded by at least one sm event in the preselected temporal window the resulting number of sm p coincidences is reported as a fraction of the total number of p events consider event series of type p and sm in which the events occur at times t i p and t j sm with i 1 n p and j 1 n sm where n p and n sm are the total numbers of events in series p and sm respectively the precursor coincidence rate r p is defined as donges et al 2016 2011 1 r p 1 n p i 1 n p h j 1 n sm i 0 δ t t i p τ t j sm where τ is the lag parameter δ t is the temporal tolerance i 0 δ t is the indicator function defined as 2 i 0 δ t x 1 x 0 δ t 0 e l s e the heaviside function is further expressed as 3 h x 1 x 0 0 e l s e r p measures the fraction of p type events preceded by at least one sm type event it can range from 0 to 1 zero indicates the complete absence of any coincidence and one denotes that all events in series p happen coincident with events in sm attention is invited to the fact that multiple coincidences with the temporal window δ t is only counted once the 95th percentile limit defined the p and sm events at each grid point detailed information provided in data preparation section 3 1 temporal tolerance δ t was selected as three days the lag parameter τ which can allow for the shifting of events is not considered in our analysis and is set as 0 hereafter a sensitivity analysis previously conducted by changing the temporal tolerance δt windows to five days and seven days showed that the spatial patterns remain relatively consistent for the different windows and hence considering the resolution of the grid the data and the spatial extension of the study area we only discuss the results for three days throughout the remainder of the paper the obtained coincidence rates at each grid point are tested with the poisson distribution for statistical significance to assess the robustness donges et al 2016 xing et al 2022 the null hypothesis is set as the observed coincidence values being explained by two randomly generated event series following the poisson distribution the p value of the significance test gives the probability that the actual observed number of coincidences is equalled or exceeded in the randomly generated samples if the p value is less than the selected confidence level α 0 05 the null hypothesis is summarily rejected and the coincidence rate obtained is considered significant enough manoj et al 2022 detailed information regarding the significance test is given in supplementary information statistically insignificant values are not considered and masked using na in the main plots eca was implemented in r statistical computing language v4 0 2 r core team 2021 using the coincalc package siegmund et al 2017 3 3 conditional event coincidence analysis ceca conditional event coincidence analysis is an extension of the basic bivariate eca method first introduced by siegmund et al 2016a ceca advances the two variable eca approach to account for the conditioning of events on another third variable more specifically in addition to counting the coincidence between event series sm and p we explore the instances in which a q event defined here as an annual peak discharge event also appears coincident with the already evaluated sm p coincidences to characterise the probability of both sm and p preceding q ceca provide the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c is defined as siegmund et al 2016a 4 r p c 1 n q i 1 n q h j 1 n p h k 1 n sm i 0 δ t cond t j p τ cond t k sm i 0 δ t t i q τ t j p t i q t j p t k sm denote the timings and n p n sm and n q are the total numbers of events in series q p and sm respectively τ cond a n d δ t cond are defined as the temporal lag and time window for checking the conditioning of events we aim to identify out of the total type q events those q events preceded by at least one joint sm p episode in the preselected temporal window the temporal tolerance windows δ t δ t cond are set as two and one day respectively a preliminary review of some of the previous flood events in which antecedent conditions were reported to have played a significant role on flood initiation showed that such a setting could account for most of such events blöschl et al 2007 dietze et al 2022 schröter et al 2015 r p c measures the fraction of q type events preceded by at least one sm conditioned p event intrinsically only those events in p are checked for coincidence with q which are already conditioned by sm events the possible range again varies from 0 to 1 with one denoting that all the discharge q events occurred after sm p episodes and 0 indicating the absence of any statistical coincidence relationship between q and sm p a detailed methodology diagram outlining the major steps involved in the analysis is shown in fig 4 furthermore an explanation on the procedure for calculating the precursor and conditional precursor coincidence rates r p r p c is provided in appendix a in supplementary information using a prototypical example 4 results in the present section we first 4 1 explore the seasonal patterns of sm p dependence over the major european climatic regions using the precursor coincidence rate we then characterise the conditional precursor coincidence rate for discharge events appearing coincident with joint sm p episodes 4 2 4 1 spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coincidence in winter djf grid points with higher sm p coincidence rates r p 0 50 are seen in southern europe seu and towards the western parts of northern and central europe neu ceu only sparse coincidence is reported in other regions of neu and ceu except for the gradual reduction in magnitude and extent similar patterns are seen for the three major climatic regions in spring mam a seasonal shift in the location of high valued clusters of precursor coincidence rate r p 0 50 is seen in summer jja higher coincidence now emerges in east ceu and neu a reduction in coincidence is seen for seu for fall son the coincidence rates reduce in neu and ceu and a gradual formation is seen again in seu from fig 5 it is clear that there is a strong seasonal nature to the coincidence rates over the major european climatic regions the spatial map plots help us understand and visualise the seasonal changes in precursor coincidence r p between sm and p for europe in general the regions exhibit distinct seasonal behaviour apart from understanding the mean behaviour of the areas it also becomes essential to account for the distributions of r p exhibited by them this apparent seasonality in the distribution of coincidence rates for grid points within the six regions is explored further using a violin plot in fig 6 violin plots are an extension to the boxplots showing the entire distribution of data at different values it helps to check for multiple peaks in the probability density function and their relative position in the dataset in the present case the plots show the distribution of precursor coincidence rates among the grid points for the different regions refer to fig 1 for the location of grid points and the explanation of the colour scheme used tails point to the presence of grid points with markedly different values of r p compared to the median mean behaviour of the region fig 6 shows the violin plot for the six regions west neu east neu west ceu east ceu west seu east seu both the west and east seu exhibit consistent behaviour in winter this contrasts with neu and ceu where higher median mean coincidence is seen towards the west compared to the eastern regions for spring a slight increase in median mean coincidence is seen for both east ceu and seu from fig 6 c it is also clear that the sm p coincidence increases towards the east in summer the eastern regions exhibit higher median mean coincidence in the three regions compared to the western regions the seasonal patterns in the distribution of coincidence rates can be interpreted using the climatology of the three regions figs 2 and 3 depict the monthly changes in mean daily values for precipitation and soil moisture for the six regions the boxplots show how the average state of precipitation and soil moisture differs for the regions around may the soil moisture starts declining considerably throughout the six climatic regions in summer jja the reduction in soil moisture is experienced throughout europe however precipitation trends differ for seu compared to neu and ceu iturbide et al 2020 contrastingly the precipitation reduces for both west and east seu while it shows an increasing trend for the regions in neu and seu radiation and soil moisture availability have been consistently put forth as the two main drivers of evapotranspiration et over europe ghajarnia et al 2020 harris et al 2017 teuling et al 2009 seu s evapotranspiration et regime is expected to be water limited in nature ghajarnia et al 2020 thus we expect less sm p coupling via et in seu in the summer this is seen in figs 5 and 6 regions in seu exhibit only moderate coincidence in summer and have the lowest median mean value the precipitation in seu starts to increase around mid fall which increases soil moisture this leads to an increase in et which may be one of the reasons for the rise in coincidence seen for seu in winter djf for both neu and ceu the et regime is expected to be primarily energy limited ghajarnia et al 2020 and hence we see stronger coincidence and higher median mean values in summer when the temperature energy supply for et is also high and provides a conducive environment for enhanced sm p coupling the dependence of et trends on radiation trends in central europe was also suggested by teuling et al 2009 however it should be noted that further analysis incorporating et and radiation input should be carried out to verify the proposed role of et in impacting the sm p coincidence rates previous studies have assessed the impact of land cover and temperature changes for the seasonal evolution of evapotranspiration and related water cycle changes over europe hänsel et al 2019 nistor et al 2018 this presents a very interesting avenue worth exploring in future studies the difference in patterns seen for the east neu and east ceu can partly be explained by the extensive snow cover usually found in those regions during winter and spring berghuijs et al 2019b kemter et al 2020 in summer we see a corresponding rise due to snow melt and a shift of snowfall to rainfall when air temperatures start rising above zero di sante et al 2021 hundecha et al 2020 in sm p coincidence values the near identical behaviour manifested in west and east seu throughout the different seasons can be attributed to the typical mediterranean climate of the regions mediero et al 2015 schär et al 1999 in addition to exposing the seasonal sm p covariation patterns it is also essential to know the role played by the sm p dependence as a possible flood generation mechanism this is attempted by contextualising the statistical precursor relationship between sm p coincidences and the dates of occurrence of annual peak floods over european catchments using the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c 4 2 seasonal sm p coincidence prior to annual peak floods to understand the possible role of sm p coincidences unravelled in 4 1 as a candidate mechanism for flood generation over europe we used the european flood database hall et al 2015 consisting of dates of occurrences of annual peak floods more specifically we consider the coincidence of the discharge events q with precipitation events p that occurred on soil moisture anomalous states sm the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c of a catchment in a particular season is the fraction of annual floods out of the total number of reported floods in that season happening after the joint occurrence of both sm p events the setting helps to account for the fraction of annual flood events in a particular season that occurred after precipitation extremes happened in saturated soil conditions in this work we focus our analysis on the statistically significant results additionally as complementary information the analysis considering all coincidence rates both significant and non significant is included in figs c3 c5 in appendix c supplementary information fig 7 depicts the seasonal patterns for the conditional precursor coincidence of q with sm p coincidence over european catchments the physical interpretation of the conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c is the fraction of annual floods in a particular catchment after sm p preconditioning we hypothesise that soil moisture excess runoff is one of the driving mechanisms for flood generation in catchments with higher conditional precursor coincidence rates these are the catchments where a higher fraction of annual floods happened in wet conditions based on the exceedance above the 95th percentile limit the role played by the catchment wetness in shaping the runoff response in these catchment areas can be considered more critical than the catchments with lower conditional precursor coincidence rates higher coincidence rates r p c 0 70 are reported for seu and in the western european countries germany belgium france and uk in winter this contrasts with the sparse coincidence rates in scandinavian and eastern european catchments for spring a clear east to west continental divide is seen in the spatial distribution of the conditional precursor coincidence rates higher coincidences are seen towards the west of 15 longitude and lower coincidence to the east we also note the gradual emergence of significant coincidence rates in catchments towards scandinavia and eastern europe which were absent in winter however the rates are still lower r p c 0 50 compared to western catchments for summer clusters are seen in ceu particularly in the alps and the carpathian mountain ranges only nominal coincidence rates are seen in seu for fall we see strong coincidence rates r p c 0 70 for the uk parts of norway and alpine regions next we focus our attention on the mean seasonal behaviour of the conditional coincidence rate among all the catchments in our study area to investigate the changes in conditional precursor coincidence rates seasonally throughout europe we plotted seasonal violin distribution plots considering all the catchments with a significant coincidence rate fig 8 shows an average increase in the median mean coincidence from winter to fall for these catchments a comparison between winter and spring shows that even though the median mean and the number of samples are very similar for both seasons the coincidence rates among the catchments are slightly more spread out in spring the median coincidence is highest in fall 0 67 which indicates that at least half of the catchments in fall have two thirds or more of the annual floods occurring shortly after the joint occurrence of high antecedent soil moisture conditions and precipitation events similar to the regional distribution plot of the sm p precursor coincidence rate we also plotted violin box plots of the seasonal conditional coincidence rate distributions among the catchments for the six sub regions fig 9 we see noticeable changes in the distribution of the coincidence rates for catchments in the six regions in line with the expected flood seasonality and evolution of sm p coincidence described earlier for winter the emergence of high valued conditional coincidence rates r p c in catchments over seu corresponds to the increased sm p coincidence rates reported for the region r p in fig 3 in summer similar to the reduction of mean sm p coincidence we see very sparse conditional coincidence rates for the catchments the conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c again gradually emerge in fall over seu which coincides with the increase in median mean sm p coincidences r p this is interesting as even though higher rates of precursor coincidence mean more sm p joint episodes a higher rp value might not always directly translate into a higher rp c value as the conditional precursor coincidence is characterised by the total number of q events whereas the precursor coincidence is reported as a fraction of the total number of p events the higher conditional coincidence rates towards the countries of western europe indicate the importance of soil moisture excess in driving floods in winter and spring previous studies found that persistent precipitation events due to westerly winds from the atlantic is a major factor in the generation of floods over the region ibebuchi 2022 lun et al 2021 mediero et al 2015 zanardo et al 2019 such persistent precipitation episodes can lead to increased catchment wetness and subsequently higher conditional coincidence the absence of significant coincidence rates for catchments towards eastern europe and scandinavia in winter can be ascribed to the low winter temperatures preventing snowmelt and leading to snow accumulation significant coincidence rates gradually emerge in spring however the lower values indicate the relative less importance of sm p coincidence as a peak flood generation mechanism in the region for the alpine region the higher conditional coincidence rates in summer may be due to the role played by summer rainfall and snowmelt snowmelt usually starts in spring and saturates the soil for the summer rainfall events in the presence of melting snow soils will get saturated leading to higher conditional coincidence rates for the flood events with p and sm events however it should also be noted that snow accumulation and melting processes depend on the mean elevation of the catchment above sea level which could impact the coincidence rates 5 discussions the current study made use of event based eca approach to describe the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p dependence over europe and then visualised the changing seasonal nature of such sm p covariation patterns over the different climatic regions the sm p coincidence was characterised by the precursor coincidence rates we then investigated the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a possible precursor to the annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence rate 5 1 understanding the seasonal sm p coincidence patterns the fact that the joint manifestation of p events and sm anomalous conditions within a short interval can lead to highly nonlinear catchment response and hazard cascades is already well noted in the literature berghuijs et al 2019b brocca et al 2012 ray and jacobs 2007 wasko et al 2020 it is worth mentioning here that sm anomalies are not only caused by extreme precipitation but even sustained sub extreme precipitation can manifest into soil moisture anomalies these antecedent conditions contribute to flood generation only during any subsequent rainfall events and the sm p coincidence analysis helps to understand and account for them univariate modelling approaches which only focus on the precipitation characteristics severely underrepresent such nonlinear catchment feedback mechanisms previous studies were also constrained by the direct trivial relationship arising between precipitation and soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 due to its directional formulation eca allows quantifying such dynamic feedback between sm and p the sm p coincidence analysis gives potential insights into the covariation relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at a particular grid point essentially it denotes the fraction of p events which occurred after sm also exceeded its threshold it can also be related to the conditional joint probability that both variables attained their exceedance conditions together the temporal tolerance window helps to also account for dynamical interdependencies that cannot be easily captured by linear correlation covariation measures floods usually occur due to a complex interplay between atmospheric processes and factors contributing to runoff generation in the catchment merz et al 2021 the coincidence rates are also defined by both geomorphological and climatic factors one possible explanation for higher conditional rates is that extreme precipitation events in the region are usually preceded by a period of sustained duration precipitation the higher coincidence values could be an indicator of the persistence of soil moisture memory in a particular region the soils in these regions can store information on previous precipitation events for a more extended period this could be related to soil properties including soil type texture the land use and land cover of the region another factor could be the triggering relationship between soil moisture and precipitation brimelow et al 2011 manoj et al 2022 schwingshackl et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2010 via direct evapotranspiration and indirect interactions non linear impacts on boundary layer stability convective precipitation formation the sm p coincidence analysis suggests that seasonality is a major process in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p covariability over europe previous works have tried to unravel such dynamic spatial patterns at a continental scale for europe mainly from a perspective of dry conditions i e droughts bonaccorso et al 2013 hannaford et al 2011 tallaksen and stahl 2014 we argue that our analysis provides valuable information on spatial patterns of hydroclimatic covariability with a focus on wet conditions our results also show the need for considering spatial heterogeneity within the three ipcc homogeneous regions studies which use such homogeneous regions as references for the regional synthesis of future climate projections iturbide et al 2020 should take care of the varying nature of seasonal sm p coupling behaviour within the reference regions attributing the cause of such coupled sm p relationship would require process based models for the regions in which different scenarios should be investigated to test different hypothesis such an analysis is worth investigating but goes beyond the capabilities of the methodology applied in this work which is based solely on the statistical properties of the considered datasets 5 2 sm p dependence characteristics of the different climatic regions spatially well defined clusters are seen in southern europe seu west neu and west ceu in winter which shifts towards eastern europe in summer our results are generally in agreement with previous sm p studies over europe the reduction in soil moisture precipitation and evapotranspiration for seu in summer was shown by ghajarnia et al 2020 using a data driven multi catchment approach they observed higher monthly correlation values between soil moisture and evapotranspiration in the summer for seu their work stressed the critical role played by soil moisture in regulating large scale runoff variations across diverse european climatic regions the violin plots further helped understand the distribution of sm p coincidence rates within major ipcc regions over europe and their seasonality the reduction in median mean coincidence rates among grid points in seu is well captured in the seasonal violin plots such a reduction in coincidences is likely due to drier soil moisture states and less sm p coupling via et during summer in seu the resulting plots further pointed to the spatial variation of sm p coincidence rates within neu and ceu the near identical distribution of precursor coincidence rates for both west and east seu is an indicator of the homogenous behaviour of the whole region seu w r t hydroclimatic coupling identifying such homogenous regions and their corresponding seasonal behaviour is crucial for numerous hydro meteorological applications agarwal et al 2018 guntu et al 2020 pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 they can aid in disentangling the complexity of hydrological systems mcdonnell and woods 2004 the spatial coherence of such changing regional patterns can hold vital information about the propagation of large scale hydro meteorological extremes like droughts and floods the role of soil moisture atmosphere coupling for temperature and precipitation extremes and their associated trends have also been previously studied over europe jaeger and seneviratne 2011 used simulations from a regional climate model to investigate the role of sm p coupling for temperature and precipitation extremes over the european summer climate significant impacts of temporal sm variability were found for the wet day frequency and other associated extreme indices seneviratne et al 2006 investigated the role of atmospheric coupling on future changes in the interannual variability of summer precipitation over europe and found that in most cases the deviations can be partly explained by land atmosphere coupling in regions where precipitation increases of considerable magnitude were simulated the land atmosphere coupling could account for about two thirds of the total variance 5 3 sm p dependence as a possible flood generation mechanism accounting for the impact of joint sm p covariation patterns in the context of annual flood generation over european catchments is vital for the proper characterisation of different possible runoff generation mechanisms identifying catchments with a higher fraction of reported historical annual floods immediately after the joint occurrence of sm p coincidences and their dependence on seasonality is also helpful from flood forecast and disaster preparedness aspects we used an extension of the bivariate event coincidence analysis to account for the conditional probability of event occurrences in more than two variables specifically we focused on discharge events q annual floods happening after both sm and p events have taken place our findings showed that the seasonal evolution of such conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c over european catchments are generally in line with previous studies berghuijs et al 2019b blöschl et al 2019 hundecha et al 2020 lun et al 2021 we saw an increase in the median mean coincidence for r p c from winter to fall albeit with fewer catchments contributing to the distribution of the coincidence rates in fall furthermore we saw that the seasonal evolution of conditional precursor r p c over seu is in line with the corresponding temporal changes seen in sm p coincidence r p patterns to understand the possible connection between catchment wetness and the conditional precursor coincidence rates we plotted the seasonal variation of the 95th percentile limit fig c1 and c2 in appendix c supplementary information in general we can observe higher values for soil moisture and precipitation limits in regions with higher coincidence rates our observations align with the results of berghuijs et al 2019b for europe who used seasonal statistics to estimate the relative importance of different mechanisms as potential flood drivers they found that during 1960 2010 relatively few annual floods were caused by precipitation extremes acting alone and in about 43 of the studied catchments the flood events were caused by the concurrence of heavy precipitation with high antecedent soil moisture the timing of soil moisture excess was seen to coincide with the seasonality of annual flood events across large parts of western europe including germany france spain and britain these regions also have a higher coincidence in our case the peak floods were also seen to not coincide in the case of eastern europe this behaviour is also seen in our analysis with lower coincidence rates reported for the eastern european and scandinavian catchments however caution should be given to the fact that the conditional coincidence rates are calculated out of the total number of events in a season blöschl et al 2019 demonstrated regional patterns in observed flood discharges over europe and reported an increase in flood discharge values for north western europe including parts of germany france and the northern uk due to the increase in rainfall and soil moisture statistically significant positive correlation values were obtained for temporal variability of discharge and soil moisture maxima which again points to the possible role played by soil moisture excess along with the increasing precipitation as an important flood driver for these regions for southern europe a decrease in precipitation and soil moisture was reported resulting in a decrease in flood discharge values from 1960 to 2010 the decline has been attributed to the northward shift of the subtropical jet and increased evapotranspiration due to warming temperatures archer and caldeira 2008 mediero et al 2014 we argue here that since the percentile thresholds and the subsequent events are calculated based on the long term seasonal climatology of the region such a reduction would lead to a fewer number of coincidences and finally to a reduced coincidence rate this could be a possible reason for lower rates seen in those regions however the characterisation of the strength of absolute values on the calculated rates is indeed complex and worth investigating in detail in future studies hundecha et al 2020 identified four major flood generating processes across europe long rain short rain snowmelt and rain on dry soil flood events and investigated the seasonal and regional distribution of the different flood event types they saw a clear predominance of short rain events in which the catchment is saturated at the onset with very little soil moisture deficit both seasonally and regionally throughout europe the only exception is the regions in northern europe where snowmelt events dominated this is again similar to our observation of fewer significant conditional precursor coincidence rates in those regions while at the same time it should be noted that the coincidence rates is not generalised for all the other areas lun et al 2021 did a pan european assessment of characteristics and process controls of statistical flood moments they used the mean annual flood maf and coefficients of variation cv and skewness cs of flood discharges over five predetermined hydroclimatic regions similar to our results of higher conditional coincidence rates they observed higher mean specific annual floods over regions of the alps the apennines italy the carpathian flysch belt and great britain the spatial patterns of cv showed that the consistency of the occurrence of such peak flows is also in line with our obtained results catchments with wetter states in our case higher conditional coincidence rates showed less cv and hence more regularity in the occurrence of large floods 5 4 assumptions and limitations the need for exercising caution while employing gridded products for the analysis of extremes at a daily scale is already well reported in the literature gervais et al 2014 timmermans et al 2019 since it is an observational dataset the e obs product severely underperforms in regions with low station density which can be considered one of the product s major limitations however we note here that since the initial release of e obs haylock et al 2008 many more station has been continuously added and also the newer versions of e obs uses a refined interpolation method and take into account the possible uncertainties by delivering an ensemble of possible realisations 100 members cornes et al 2018 moreover in our case of quantifying the sm p coincidence we only consider the relative timings of events for different grid points the eca framework discards the magnitudes of the variable and only considers the days which exceed the prefixed percentile thresholds hence we explored the time variability rather than absolute values of soil moisture this has the advantage that the choice of modelled product is expected to have a limited impact on the final calculated coincidence rates koster et al 2009 our method is designed to quantify the sm p dependence based on the mutual occurrence of events in both series within the prefixed temporal tolerance we do not include the magnitude of such events into account therefore a quantitative understanding of the possible impact of changes in the magnitude of precipitation on the sm p dependence is lacking the 95th percentile is a reasonable cut off to include all extreme precipitation events which would finally lead to annual peak floods over the catchment however some floods could have been caused by rainfall rates not belonging to the top 5 and our present analysis does not take into account such events the spatial resolution of the gridded data 0 25 x 0 25 provides an average representation of the precipitation characteristics occurring in a region the grid based soil moisture product is also averaged over considerable spatial heterogeneity in order to compare the results for a larger number of catchments and to avoid the significant computational pre processing work involved in carrying out a catchment area weighted approach we used the grid points of the catchment outlet these approximations will invariably lead to a lack of representation of any small scale site specific conditions however our results must be seen as a first estimate of the catchments where significant dependence exists between sm p coincidences and the peak discharge events in our case higher conditional coincidence rates further works could focus on the identified locations and investigate the events following a process based modelling approach the methodology could be easily expanded to account for the catchment averaged soil moisture and precipitation values the temporal tolerance window could also be adapted and for a more detailed analysis an approach involving the coincidence rates calculation for different temporal tolerance could be utilised we stress here that the hydrological processes leading to flood generation are nonlinear and difficult to characterise using only simple event based approaches our main aim is to understand how the timing of the annual peak flood events could be used in conjunction with the seasonal patterns of sm p dependence to get a first estimate of the locations experiencing annual floods shortly after sm p coincidence the relative ratio of such flood events in each season to the total number of flood events reported in the specific season is calculated and helps identify catchments that are more prone to such soil moisture excess driven floods since only the dates of peak floods are available it is again not possible to identify the changes in patterns for different magnitude events we caution that the absolute number of annual flood events reported in a season can vary for each catchment the conditional precursor coincidence rates are reported as a fraction of the total number of events in a season minimum five for a catchment a drawback of such an approach is that it leads to some catchments being present in specific seasons only and to a different number of catchments in different seasons however in the present study our objective is to understand the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a possible precursor to the annual flood events throughout all the catchments and hence we investigated the relative proportions of the events as the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c floods usually manifest due to several complex interconnected factors merz et al 2021 mishra et al 2022 we focused on soil moisture and precipitation but we believe the analysis of other important factors could contribute to better understanding the flood triggers these additional variables include topography soil type and properties land cover change and even the impact of sea surface temperature anomalies another point to be noted is the impact of anthropogenic constructions and the effect of reservoir management operations on streamflow alterations and variability pérez ciria et al 2019 6 conclusions and perspectives the present work provides a continental scale overview of the statistical coincidence relationship between soil moisture and precipitation events over europe we used the precursor coincidence rate to characterise the sm p preconditioning and then investigated the influence of seasonality on the dependence strength the changing patterns of sm p dependence are studied in depth for the various climatic regions of europe the possible impact of such sm p coincidences on annual flood events is also unravelled focusing on the role of such antecedent conditions as a possible flood generating mechanism the salient findings of the current study are a the seasonal sm p coincidence analysis reveals that seasonality is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p coupling over europe b higher coincidence rates are seen in southern europe seu and towards the western parts of northern and central europe west neu west ceu in winter which shifts towards east neu and east ceu in summer the patterns are in line with the expected seasonal climatology of the different regions c the conditional precursor coincidence which quantifies the relative fraction of annual flood events in a particular season that occurred after joint sm p coincidence is also evaluated for the different catchments and the observed values agree with previous flood hazard studies over europe the present work can be advanced by conducting smaller catchment scale studies incorporating streamflow data the relative impact of sm p coincidence over a range of discharge values can also be investigated further exploiting the approach used in the present study to the problem of characterising the dependence of absolute values on the coincidence rates and the temporal evolution of the spatiotemporal patterns over the past few years provide an exciting avenue for future research but is beyond the scope of present study it is worthwhile to note that changing the temporal tolerance window parameters and studying their associated impacts could aid in understanding the lagged associations between the various hydrometeorological variables in our case soil moisture precipitation and discharge future works could investigate such lagged covariation relationships in detail by incorporating additional variables for example evapotranspiration and solar radiation evaluating the changes for different tolerance windows and considering the lag parameters our results indicate the importance of considering antecedent conditions for understanding flood generation mechanisms over europe event based methods like eca can help incorporate the conditioning of variables on other processes eca can be a vital tool in studies aiming to characterise multivariate dependencies approaches considering such dynamic relationships can vastly help describe multi hazard risk scenarios and mitigate the adverse impacts of preconditioned compound events data availability statement we

2069,studies around the world have shown that increases in extreme precipitation are not directly resulting in reported instances of flooding despite the evidence that antecedent soil moisture conditions play a significant role in regulating the runoff response during extreme storm events fewer works have tried to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of such coupled interactions in the present work we aim to improve our understanding of the dominant spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture sm precipitation p dependence over europe using an event based non parametric event coincidence analysis eca approach we first quantified the probability of sm preceding p by the precursor coincidence rate we also examined the statistical precursor relationship between sm p joint episodes and reported annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence rate the results show that seasonality is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p coupling over europe the conditional precursor coincidence rates are in line with previous flood hazard studies over europe and show the importance of considering such diverse interdependencies in flood risk mitigation our work has implications for understanding the occurrence of preconditioned compound events worldwide and provides a vital starting point for characterising the major processes that need to be accounted for in comprehensive state of the art flood risk assessment studies keywords soil moisture floods eca sm p coupling europe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally floods are considered one of the most devastating and prevalent natural hazards impacting regions across continents and various diverse climatic regimes coumou and rahmstorf 2012 merz et al 2021 seneviratne et al 2021 the marked shifts in the global water cycle due to climatic variability and anthropogenic forcings are nowadays becoming more common and widespread ipcc 2021 furthermore anthropogenic climate change coupled with socioeconomic shifts in population exposure is expected to play a major role in shaping future flood hazard risk gu et al 2020 kam et al 2021 even though the risk of catastrophic flooding has impacted europe throughout history barredo 2007 brázdil et al 2006 human induced alterations in the global earth system have led to significant changes in the patterns and intensity of flooding events in europe bertola et al 2021 blöschl et al 2017 madsen et al 2014 this is further expected to result in a substantial increase in future flood damages alfieri et al 2015 dottori et al 2023 jongman et al 2014 these facts call for a better understanding of the predominant flood risk patterns over europe extreme precipitation events have increased over the past few decades papalexiou and montanari 2019 westra et al 2013 precipitation extremes are controlled by both thermodynamic local exchanges in heat moisture and other related quantities and dynamic processes those related to atmospheric and oceanic motions teleconnections at the regional scale recent studies seneviratne et al 2021 have reported that the observed rate of increased precipitation extremes at the global scale are in line with the famous clausius clapeyron relation pall et al 2007 the role of predecessor rain events in generating peak discharge has already been established globally bischiniotis et al 2018 froidevaux et al 2015 however the global increase in precipitation extremes has not directly translated into a rise in reported flood events do et al 2017 flood initiation and magnitude are invariably impacted by the intensity of precipitation landform land use land cover change soil properties and antecedent catchment conditions including soil moisture and snowpack previous studies have found that the decrease in antecedent soil moisture has led to a decline in observed flood discharge even with increased extreme precipitation sharma et al 2018 wasko et al 2020 wasko and nathan 2019 soil moisture also plays a vital role in water and energy budget equations through its impact on evapotranspiration seneviratne et al 2010 it also partitions the rainfall into various other hydrological cycle components evapotranspiration infiltration and runoff and hence directly impacts flood characteristics hlavcova et al 2005 komma et al 2008 massari et al 2018 zehe and blöschl 2004 zhai et al 2018 the interaction between antecedent catchment wetness and precipitation can be critical in shaping the runoff response however traditional risk assessment approaches usually only focused on univariate precipitation peak flood discharge modelling techniques to study the flood characteristics several studies around the world have now shown that univariate approaches underestimate the risk of an extreme event leonard et al 2014 zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 and that most natural hazards are caused by a combination of multiple statistically dependent physical processes arising across multiple spatial and temporal scales kemter et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2020 the ipcc special report on climate extremes srex 2012 seneviratne et al 2012 first defined this broad class of events as compound events specifically preconditioned compound events are events in which an underlying weather driven or climate driven precondition leads to an alteration generally an increase in the impacts of a hazard bevacqua et al 2021 zscheischler et al 2020 it is also worthwhile to note here that the existing precondition could also have an attenuating stabilising effect and reduce the impact of the subsequent hazard like in the case of dryer antecedent conditions before floods blöschl et al 2017 the importance of such initial hydrologic conditions on catchment response cannot be overemphasised garg and mishra 2019 khatun et al 2022 berghuijs et al 2019b illustrated the importance of such conditions over european catchments and they showed that most annual peak floods in europe are caused not by large precipitation events but by the mutual co occurrence or coincidence of rainfall with either snowmelt or soil saturated conditions ghajarnia et al 2020 demonstrated the close statistical covariation relationship between soil moisture and runoff anomalies for the different european climatic regimes using a data driven multi catchment comparative approach with different datasets they unravelled a dominant first order covariation between soil moisture and runoff on the monthly scale blöschl et al 2017 analysed the timing of river floods in europe from 1960 to 2010 and found a clear shift in the timings of winter floods over western europe due to earlier soil moisture maxima wasko et al 2021 examined the trends in streamflow using a global dataset and attributed the decreasing trend of frequent flood magnitudes to the dominance of drying antecedent soil moisture conditions in contrast to the intensification of short duration precipitation grillakis et al 2016 compared the importance of initial soil moisture conditions for flash flood generation over different catchments and found that the peak discharge was dependent on soil moisture states and the magnitude of the impact relies on the magnitude of the event however within the available literature studies attempting to contextualize the soil moisture sm precipitation p preconditioning at a european scale is particularly sparse and very few works have attempted to understand the changing regional patterns between such sm p relationships at a seasonal scale hence there is a growing need to account for the role played by antecedent catchment wetness before a precipitation event in shaping the catchment response and their seasonal changes specifically it becomes necessary to characterise the spatiotemporal patterns of coincidence between soil moisture sm and precipitation p events the benefits of establishing such spatial information maps in the context of flood hydrology merz and blöschl 2008 and in characterising hydroclimatic covariability sun et al 2018 are already well established in the literature the seasonal changes in such patterns could further aid in understanding how the different climatic regions of europe behave in the context of sm p covariability traditional measures like correlation and covariance are indeed helpful in understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p dependence however the interdependencies are evaluated considering the entire distribution of data they describe dependence at the centre of the distribution and may under overestimate dependence in the joint tails of the distribution jiang et al 2020 siegmund et al 2016b some more commonly used linear methods may fail when the underlying distributions exhibit significant deviations from the gaussian assumption analyses involving identifying and subsequently extracting discrete events of interest from a continuous time series are common in hydrological sciences from an observed streamflow record at a gauging site only a few specified high discharge events are usually considered for flood frequency analysis adamowski et al 1998 bezak et al 2014 taesombut and yevjevich 1978 event coincidence analysis eca donges et al 2016 is a non parametric statistical tool that has received considerable attention in the past few years previous work across many diverse scientific disciplines has shown that eca can characterise the statistical interdependencies between different variables processes in many varied settings christopoulos et al 2020 fdez arroyabe et al 2020 templ et al 2021 wiedermann et al 2021 furthermore a statistical significance test checks the robustness of the obtained coincidence rates donges et al 2016 siegmund et al 2017 however only a few studies have employed eca to characterise the spatial and temporal dynamics of sm p coupling sun et al 2018 was the first to illustrate the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coupling using the eca approach they characterised the spatial patterns for texas in the us and further linked the results with the dominant seasonal climatology of the study region manoj et al 2022 evaluated the spatiotemporal dependence between sm and p across india using eca and additionally investigated their temporal evolution over time and compared it with the changing behaviour of precipitation during the same duration the previous works considered two variables sm p to quantify the sm p coincidence rates and infer the dynamics of their changing spatiotemporal patterns the basic two variable eca can also be advanced to account for the role of a third observable process siegmund et al 2016a such a conditional event coincidence analysis ceca siegmund et al 2016a could help in additionally considering the conditioning of events on instances governed by a third variable to the best of our knowledge no previous work has attempted to incorporate discharge as a third variable in the eca framework to statistically quantify the role of sm p coincidences as a possible precursor to the annual flood events such an analysis would offer additional information on the lagged dependence of annual floods on soil moisture precipitation preconditioning advancing our understanding of soil moisture sm precipitation p interactions would help in robustly characterising the regions over which a dominant statistical dependence exists between sm and p identifying areas catchments which experience a co occurrence coincidence between sm and p anomalies can be considered critical for better understanding the occurrence and propagation of large scale flood events like the one of july 2021 in western europe dietze et al 2022 ibebuchi 2022 the timing of annual peak floods could also be used to investigate such sm p coincidences prior to the annual flood events over different european climatic regions with this motivation in the present work we a describe the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coincidence over europe and then try to visualise the changing seasonal nature of such sm p dependence over the different climatic regions b identify and contextualise the annual floods occurring after such sm p coincidences have already taken place the article is organised as follows section 2 briefly introduces the study area and datasets used for the analysis the steps used in data preparation and a summary of event coincidence analysis are presented in section 3 section 4 details the results of the present study and section 5 the discussions final concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 study area data 2 1 study area understanding the possible role of antecedent conditions for floods is vital for setting up reliable flood estimation and forecast mechanisms at the european scale previous studies have shown that the mean annual timing of floods over europe is spatially well defined with distinct regional differences for their seasonality and generation mechanism the dominant flood generation mechanisms include precipitation excess soil moisture excess and snowmelt driven floods berghuijs et al 2019b blöschl et al 2019 2017 hall and blöschl 2018 below 60 latitude annual floods are typically seen in parts of western europe in winter and transition to spring floods in the east above 60 latitude except for coastal areas spring floods are more widespread the interplay between catchment conditions e g soil saturation due to persistent rainfall events and precipitation events often leads to a catchment response quite different from the ones expected due to the precipitation events acting alone this is particularly important to characterise from an extreme event perspective merz et al 2021 indeed in the near past intense flooding episodes have been caused by extreme precipitation and moderate catchment wetness blöschl et al 2007 and by moderate precipitation and extreme catchment wetness conditions schröter et al 2015 the köppen geiger climate classification zones for europe include cold semi arid climate bsk hot summer mediterranean climate csa warm summer mediterranean climate csb humid subtropical climate cfa cold desert climate bwk hot desert climate bwh hot semi arid climate bsh warm dry summer continental climate dsb temperate maritime climate cfb and warm summer humid continental climate dfb peel et al 2007 the ipcc srex 2012 classified the climatic zones into three distinct classes northern europe neu central europe ceu and southern europe seu the climatic homogeneity was characterised by mean states of precipitation and temperature considering köppen geiger climatic regions and the annual precipitation cycle in the latest ar6 assessment of the ipcc the classification system was further refined to better represent consistent regional climate features however the spatial boundaries of the three major european regions from srex 2012 neu ceu and seu have been maintained unaltered since they encompass the main regional climates in europe iturbide et al 2020 within europe the transition of climate types from west to east due to continentality and its subsequent impacts are already well documented in literature grabowska 2008 mikolaskova 2009 moghim et al 2022 thompson 1995 the mean annual timings of floods over europe also exhibit a west to east transition hall and blöschl 2018 to account for the impact of such a west to east gradient on the seasonal evolution of sm p coincidence rates within the three ipcc srex regions we subdivided each region into two based on the 15 e longitude they are conveniently classified as west neu east neu west ceu east ceu west seu and east seu in the present work the analysis is being carried out at a grid scale and we then compare and interpret our results based on the homogenous regions classification fig 1 details the six major regions covered 2 2 data e obs v24 0 cornes et al 2018 grid based daily precipitation product was used in the current study the final time series is obtained from the station network of the european climate assessment dataset eca d project e obs is a pan european continental scale observational dataset of several surface climate variables including daily precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperatures the dataset is based on observations from meteorological stations spanning across europe provided by the national meteorological and hydrological services nmhss and other relevant data holding institutes klein tank et al 2002 it is an ensemble dataset constructed through a conditional simulation approach cornes et al 2018 klein tank et al 2002 klok and klein tank 2009 previous works have assessed the ability of e obs to replicate the observed precipitation characteristics over europe and have reported encouraging results bandhauer et al 2022 hu and franzke 2020 kostopoulou et al 2012 the e obs product has also been extensively used over europe in flood hazard assessment studies berghuijs et al 2019b 2019a blöschl et al 2019 2017 the spatial resolution of the precipitation product used here is 0 25 x 0 25 the monthly climatology of mean daily precipitation for the six regions is depicted in fig 2 the modelled soil moisture product used in the present work comes from the gleam v3 5 martens et al 2017 model gleam stands for global land evaporation amsterdam model martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 it is worthwhile to point out that the best possible way to characterise the sm p spatiotemporal patterns would be by using observational datasets for both soil moisture and precipitation however no continental scale observational dataset exists for soil moisture with consistent and homogenous spatial and temporal coverage hence there is a need to use alternate datasets for this purpose the gleam model product used here has been previously used to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water cycle and for characterising extreme events alsafadi et al 2022 ghajarnia et al 2020 good et al 2017 guillod et al 2015 miralles et al 2014 pyarali et al 2022 schumacher et al 2019 the soil moisture product was also available at a daily temporal scale with a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 fig 3 shows the monthly changes in soil moisture across the different hydroclimatic regions considered in the present work the discharge peaks were taken from the european flood database fig 1 blöschl et al 2017 hall et al 2015 hall and blöschl 2018 consisting of the day of occurrence of annual maximum discharge values or water levels daily or instantaneous values the dataset is available for 4062 catchments over europe similar to berghuijs et al 2019b we do not consider the catchments over iceland in the present work the outlet elevations range from around sea level to almost 2000 m with the catchment area ranging from 10 to 100000 km2 hall et al 2015 hall and blöschl 2018 to compare the dates of annual flows with sm p coincidences we compare the flood events with the sm and p events for the grid cell where the streamflow gauging station is located flood generation is usually produced over the entire catchment area nevertheless with this simplification we are able to obtain a first estimate of the catchments where significant dependence exists between sm p coincidences and the peak discharge events this limitation is discussed in more detail in section 5 4 3 methodology in the present section we first explain briefly the steps involved in data preparation 3 1 we then detail the event coincidence analysis eca in 3 2 used in 4 1 for unravelling the seasonal sm p coincidences over the major european climatic regions followed by conditional event coincidence analysis in 3 3 used in 4 2 for comparing the dates of annual peak floods over european catchments with the sm p coincidences 3 1 data pre processing the e obs precipitation product was retrieved from the copernicus climate change service website the gleam product was accessed via the gleam project s official website the discharge data was downloaded from the ingenieurhydrologie und wassermengenwirtschaft tu wien website links to data are provided in the data availability statement precipitation and soil moisture products had a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 however the spatial overlaps were different and hence bilinear spatial remapping technique schulzweida 2019 was used to interpolate the gleam product to the e obs grid similar to sun et al 2018 and manoj et al 2022 we use the daily time step to characterise the sm p dependence patterns to disentangle the sm p coincidences at a seasonal scale the daily time series corresponding to every grid point is split into four seasons winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son we identify the top 5 events for precipitation and soil moisture for each season at each grid point using the respective seasonal 95th percentile limit which on average leads to about 185 189 events in total per season for both p and sm this is widely adopted in a number of studies for defining extreme events leckebusch and ulbrich 2004 manoj et al 2022 mondal et al 2020 pendergrass 2018 sheridan and lee 2018 the event series is finally represented as a binary series 0 and 1 in which 1 denotes the presence of an event and 0 denotes the absence of an event during a timestep figs c1 and c2 in appendix c supplementary information shows the spatial map of the percentile cutoffs used for precipitation and soil moisture respectively for the discharge dataset the peak flood events are compared with the precipitation and soil moisture events for the grid cell where the streamflow gauging station is located to maintain temporal overlap between the products the sm p dependence patterns are evaluated at a seasonal scale from 1980 to 2020 due to the temporal coverage of the flood discharge data flood peaks are compared for the period from 1980 up to 2010 only to ensure a sufficient sample size for each season the flood analysis is always restricted to catchments having more than five events in conjunction with the statistical significance test this ensures that our results are significant and not subject to random effects table d1 in supplementary information details the number of flood events considered per season for each catchment 3 2 event coincidence analysis eca event coincidence analysis eca donges et al 2016 2011 siegmund et al 2017 is a statistical non parametric method used to quantify and characterise the coincidence rates between two sequences of events of different types in the present case we consider precipitation p and soil moisture sm events it is a particularly useful tool in climatic studies he and sheffield 2020 manoj et al 2022 sun et al 2018 2017 and helps to consider the timings of certain well defined events it has found varied applications in earth sciences and allied fields some of the more recent works include exploring the global transition between droughts and pluvial events drought pluvial seesaw he and sheffield 2020 constructing a functional network from gridded precipitation data to study the changes in spatiotemporal patterns of monsoons over east asia wolf et al 2021 deriving statistical relationships between el nino southern oscillation enso episodes and drought occurrence over china xing et al 2022 and evaluating the occurrence of flooding preceded by heat stress over central united states zhang and villarini 2020 however none of the previous studies have included simultaneously soil moisture precipitation and flood discharge data to contextualise the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a peak flood discharge mechanism the first step in the analysis involves setting the hypothesis that events in sm precede events in p in our case of quantifying sm p coincidence this ensures that sm events occur before p events hence the trivial case of sm arising well after p has already occurred is not counted as a coincidence eca affords two parameters the temporal tolerance window δ t and lag parameter τ and counts the mutual occurrences of events p and sm within the temporal tolerance interval δ t to characterise the probability of sm preceding p eca provides the precursor coincidence rate r p the main purpose of the precursor coincidence rate is to identify out of the total p events those events preceded by at least one sm event in the preselected temporal window the resulting number of sm p coincidences is reported as a fraction of the total number of p events consider event series of type p and sm in which the events occur at times t i p and t j sm with i 1 n p and j 1 n sm where n p and n sm are the total numbers of events in series p and sm respectively the precursor coincidence rate r p is defined as donges et al 2016 2011 1 r p 1 n p i 1 n p h j 1 n sm i 0 δ t t i p τ t j sm where τ is the lag parameter δ t is the temporal tolerance i 0 δ t is the indicator function defined as 2 i 0 δ t x 1 x 0 δ t 0 e l s e the heaviside function is further expressed as 3 h x 1 x 0 0 e l s e r p measures the fraction of p type events preceded by at least one sm type event it can range from 0 to 1 zero indicates the complete absence of any coincidence and one denotes that all events in series p happen coincident with events in sm attention is invited to the fact that multiple coincidences with the temporal window δ t is only counted once the 95th percentile limit defined the p and sm events at each grid point detailed information provided in data preparation section 3 1 temporal tolerance δ t was selected as three days the lag parameter τ which can allow for the shifting of events is not considered in our analysis and is set as 0 hereafter a sensitivity analysis previously conducted by changing the temporal tolerance δt windows to five days and seven days showed that the spatial patterns remain relatively consistent for the different windows and hence considering the resolution of the grid the data and the spatial extension of the study area we only discuss the results for three days throughout the remainder of the paper the obtained coincidence rates at each grid point are tested with the poisson distribution for statistical significance to assess the robustness donges et al 2016 xing et al 2022 the null hypothesis is set as the observed coincidence values being explained by two randomly generated event series following the poisson distribution the p value of the significance test gives the probability that the actual observed number of coincidences is equalled or exceeded in the randomly generated samples if the p value is less than the selected confidence level α 0 05 the null hypothesis is summarily rejected and the coincidence rate obtained is considered significant enough manoj et al 2022 detailed information regarding the significance test is given

using the coincalc package siegmund et al 2017 3 3 conditional event coincidence analysis ceca conditional event coincidence analysis is an extension of the basic bivariate eca method first introduced by siegmund et al 2016a ceca advances the two variable eca approach to account for the conditioning of events on another third variable more specifically in addition to counting the coincidence between event series sm and p we explore the instances in which a q event defined here as an annual peak discharge event also appears coincident with the already evaluated sm p coincidences to characterise the probability of both sm and p preceding q ceca provide the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c is defined as siegmund et al 2016a 4 r p c 1 n q i 1 n q h j 1 n p h k 1 n sm i 0 δ t cond t j p τ cond t k sm i 0 δ t t i q τ t j p t i q t j p t k sm denote the timings and n p n sm and n q are the total numbers of events in series q p and sm respectively τ cond a n d δ t cond are defined as the temporal lag and time window for checking the conditioning of events we aim to identify out of the total type q events those q events preceded by at least one joint sm p episode in the preselected temporal window the temporal tolerance windows δ t δ t cond are set as two and one day respectively a preliminary review of some of the previous flood events in which antecedent conditions were reported to have played a significant role on flood initiation showed that such a setting could account for most of such events blöschl et al 2007 dietze et al 2022 schröter et al 2015 r p c measures the fraction of q type events preceded by at least one sm conditioned p event intrinsically only those events in p are checked for coincidence with q which are already conditioned by sm events the possible range again varies from 0 to 1 with one denoting that all the discharge q events occurred after sm p episodes and 0 indicating the absence of any statistical coincidence relationship between q and sm p a detailed methodology diagram outlining the major steps involved in the analysis is shown in fig 4 furthermore an explanation on the procedure for calculating the precursor and conditional precursor coincidence rates r p r p c is provided in appendix a in supplementary information using a prototypical example 4 results in the present section we first 4 1 explore the seasonal patterns of sm p dependence over the major european climatic regions using the precursor coincidence rate we then characterise the conditional precursor coincidence rate for discharge events appearing coincident with joint sm p episodes 4 2 4 1 spatiotemporal patterns of sm p coincidence in winter djf grid points with higher sm p coincidence rates r p 0 50 are seen in southern europe seu and towards the western parts of northern and central europe neu ceu only sparse coincidence is reported in other regions of neu and ceu except for the gradual reduction in magnitude and extent similar patterns are seen for the three major climatic regions in spring mam a seasonal shift in the location of high valued clusters of precursor coincidence rate r p 0 50 is seen in summer jja higher coincidence now emerges in east ceu and neu a reduction in coincidence is seen for seu for fall son the coincidence rates reduce in neu and ceu and a gradual formation is seen again in seu from fig 5 it is clear that there is a strong seasonal nature to the coincidence rates over the major european climatic regions the spatial map plots help us understand and visualise the seasonal changes in precursor coincidence r p between sm and p for europe in general the regions exhibit distinct seasonal behaviour apart from understanding the mean behaviour of the areas it also becomes essential to account for the distributions of r p exhibited by them this apparent seasonality in the distribution of coincidence rates for grid points within the six regions is explored further using a violin plot in fig 6 violin plots are an extension to the boxplots showing the entire distribution of data at different values it helps to check for multiple peaks in the probability density function and their relative position in the dataset in the present case the plots show the distribution of precursor coincidence rates among the grid points for the different regions refer to fig 1 for the location of grid points and the explanation of the colour scheme used tails point to the presence of grid points with markedly different values of r p compared to the median mean behaviour of the region fig 6 shows the violin plot for the six regions west neu east neu west ceu east ceu west seu east seu both the west and east seu exhibit consistent behaviour in winter this contrasts with neu and ceu where higher median mean coincidence is seen towards the west compared to the eastern regions for spring a slight increase in median mean coincidence is seen for both east ceu and seu from fig 6 c it is also clear that the sm p coincidence increases towards the east in summer the eastern regions exhibit higher median mean coincidence in the three regions compared to the western regions the seasonal patterns in the distribution of coincidence rates can be interpreted using the climatology of the three regions figs 2 and 3 depict the monthly changes in mean daily values for precipitation and soil moisture for the six regions the boxplots show how the average state of precipitation and soil moisture differs for the regions around may the soil moisture starts declining considerably throughout the six climatic regions in summer jja the reduction in soil moisture is experienced throughout europe however precipitation trends differ for seu compared to neu and ceu iturbide et al 2020 contrastingly the precipitation reduces for both west and east seu while it shows an increasing trend for the regions in neu and seu radiation and soil moisture availability have been consistently put forth as the two main drivers of evapotranspiration et over europe ghajarnia et al 2020 harris et al 2017 teuling et al 2009 seu s evapotranspiration et regime is expected to be water limited in nature ghajarnia et al 2020 thus we expect less sm p coupling via et in seu in the summer this is seen in figs 5 and 6 regions in seu exhibit only moderate coincidence in summer and have the lowest median mean value the precipitation in seu starts to increase around mid fall which increases soil moisture this leads to an increase in et which may be one of the reasons for the rise in coincidence seen for seu in winter djf for both neu and ceu the et regime is expected to be primarily energy limited ghajarnia et al 2020 and hence we see stronger coincidence and higher median mean values in summer when the temperature energy supply for et is also high and provides a conducive environment for enhanced sm p coupling the dependence of et trends on radiation trends in central europe was also suggested by teuling et al 2009 however it should be noted that further analysis incorporating et and radiation input should be carried out to verify the proposed role of et in impacting the sm p coincidence rates previous studies have assessed the impact of land cover and temperature changes for the seasonal evolution of evapotranspiration and related water cycle changes over europe hänsel et al 2019 nistor et al 2018 this presents a very interesting avenue worth exploring in future studies the difference in patterns seen for the east neu and east ceu can partly be explained by the extensive snow cover usually found in those regions during winter and spring berghuijs et al 2019b kemter et al 2020 in summer we see a corresponding rise due to snow melt and a shift of snowfall to rainfall when air temperatures start rising above zero di sante et al 2021 hundecha et al 2020 in sm p coincidence values the near identical behaviour manifested in west and east seu throughout the different seasons can be attributed to the typical mediterranean climate of the regions mediero et al 2015 schär et al 1999 in addition to exposing the seasonal sm p covariation patterns it is also essential to know the role played by the sm p dependence as a possible flood generation mechanism this is attempted by contextualising the statistical precursor relationship between sm p coincidences and the dates of occurrence of annual peak floods over european catchments using the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c 4 2 seasonal sm p coincidence prior to annual peak floods to understand the possible role of sm p coincidences unravelled in 4 1 as a candidate mechanism for flood generation over europe we used the european flood database hall et al 2015 consisting of dates of occurrences of annual peak floods more specifically we consider the coincidence of the discharge events q with precipitation events p that occurred on soil moisture anomalous states sm the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c of a catchment in a particular season is the fraction of annual floods out of the total number of reported floods in that season happening after the joint occurrence of both sm p events the setting helps to account for the fraction of annual flood events in a particular season that occurred after precipitation extremes happened in saturated soil conditions in this work we focus our analysis on the statistically significant results additionally as complementary information the analysis considering all coincidence rates both significant and non significant is included in figs c3 c5 in appendix c supplementary information fig 7 depicts the seasonal patterns for the conditional precursor coincidence of q with sm p coincidence over european catchments the physical interpretation of the conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c is the fraction of annual floods in a particular catchment after sm p preconditioning we hypothesise that soil moisture excess runoff is one of the driving mechanisms for flood generation in catchments with higher conditional precursor coincidence rates these are the catchments where a higher fraction of annual floods happened in wet conditions based on the exceedance above the 95th percentile limit the role played by the catchment wetness in shaping the runoff response in these catchment areas can be considered more critical than the catchments with lower conditional precursor coincidence rates higher coincidence rates r p c 0 70 are reported for seu and in the western european countries germany belgium france and uk in winter this contrasts with the sparse coincidence rates in scandinavian and eastern european catchments for spring a clear east to west continental divide is seen in the spatial distribution of the conditional precursor coincidence rates higher coincidences are seen towards the west of 15 longitude and lower coincidence to the east we also note the gradual emergence of significant coincidence rates in catchments towards scandinavia and eastern europe which were absent in winter however the rates are still lower r p c 0 50 compared to western catchments for summer clusters are seen in ceu particularly in the alps and the carpathian mountain ranges only nominal coincidence rates are seen in seu for fall we see strong coincidence rates r p c 0 70 for the uk parts of norway and alpine regions next we focus our attention on the mean seasonal behaviour of the conditional coincidence rate among all the catchments in our study area to investigate the changes in conditional precursor coincidence rates seasonally throughout europe we plotted seasonal violin distribution plots considering all the catchments with a significant coincidence rate fig 8 shows an average increase in the median mean coincidence from winter to fall for these catchments a comparison between winter and spring shows that even though the median mean and the number of samples are very similar for both seasons the coincidence rates among the catchments are slightly more spread out in spring the median coincidence is highest in fall 0 67 which indicates that at least half of the catchments in fall have two thirds or more of the annual floods occurring shortly after the joint occurrence of high antecedent soil moisture conditions and precipitation events similar to the regional distribution plot of the sm p precursor coincidence rate we also plotted violin box plots of the seasonal conditional coincidence rate distributions among the catchments for the six sub regions fig 9 we see noticeable changes in the distribution of the coincidence rates for catchments in the six regions in line with the expected flood seasonality and evolution of sm p coincidence described earlier for winter the emergence of high valued conditional coincidence rates r p c in catchments over seu corresponds to the increased sm p coincidence rates reported for the region r p in fig 3 in summer similar to the reduction of mean sm p coincidence we see very sparse conditional coincidence rates for the catchments the conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c again gradually emerge in fall over seu which coincides with the increase in median mean sm p coincidences r p this is interesting as even though higher rates of precursor coincidence mean more sm p joint episodes a higher rp value might not always directly translate into a higher rp c value as the conditional precursor coincidence is characterised by the total number of q events whereas the precursor coincidence is reported as a fraction of the total number of p events the higher conditional coincidence rates towards the countries of western europe indicate the importance of soil moisture excess in driving floods in winter and spring previous studies found that persistent precipitation events due to westerly winds from the atlantic is a major factor in the generation of floods over the region ibebuchi 2022 lun et al 2021 mediero et al 2015 zanardo et al 2019 such persistent precipitation episodes can lead to increased catchment wetness and subsequently higher conditional coincidence the absence of significant coincidence rates for catchments towards eastern europe and scandinavia in winter can be ascribed to the low winter temperatures preventing snowmelt and leading to snow accumulation significant coincidence rates gradually emerge in spring however the lower values indicate the relative less importance of sm p coincidence as a peak flood generation mechanism in the region for the alpine region the higher conditional coincidence rates in summer may be due to the role played by summer rainfall and snowmelt snowmelt usually starts in spring and saturates the soil for the summer rainfall events in the presence of melting snow soils will get saturated leading to higher conditional coincidence rates for the flood events with p and sm events however it should also be noted that snow accumulation and melting processes depend on the mean elevation of the catchment above sea level which could impact the coincidence rates 5 discussions the current study made use of event based eca approach to describe the spatiotemporal patterns of sm p dependence over europe and then visualised the changing seasonal nature of such sm p covariation patterns over the different climatic regions the sm p coincidence was characterised by the precursor coincidence rates we then investigated the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a possible precursor to the annual flood events using the conditional precursor coincidence rate 5 1 understanding the seasonal sm p coincidence patterns the fact that the joint manifestation of p events and sm anomalous conditions within a short interval can lead to highly nonlinear catchment response and hazard cascades is already well noted in the literature berghuijs et al 2019b brocca et al 2012 ray and jacobs 2007 wasko et al 2020 it is worth mentioning here that sm anomalies are not only caused by extreme precipitation but even sustained sub extreme precipitation can manifest into soil moisture anomalies these antecedent conditions contribute to flood generation only during any subsequent rainfall events and the sm p coincidence analysis helps to understand and account for them univariate modelling approaches which only focus on the precipitation characteristics severely underrepresent such nonlinear catchment feedback mechanisms previous studies were also constrained by the direct trivial relationship arising between precipitation and soil moisture seneviratne et al 2010 due to its directional formulation eca allows quantifying such dynamic feedback between sm and p the sm p coincidence analysis gives potential insights into the covariation relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at a particular grid point essentially it denotes the fraction of p events which occurred after sm also exceeded its threshold it can also be related to the conditional joint probability that both variables attained their exceedance conditions together the temporal tolerance window helps to also account for dynamical interdependencies that cannot be easily captured by linear correlation covariation measures floods usually occur due to a complex interplay between atmospheric processes and factors contributing to runoff generation in the catchment merz et al 2021 the coincidence rates are also defined by both geomorphological and climatic factors one possible explanation for higher conditional rates is that extreme precipitation events in the region are usually preceded by a period of sustained duration precipitation the higher coincidence values could be an indicator of the persistence of soil moisture memory in a particular region the soils in these regions can store information on previous precipitation events for a more extended period this could be related to soil properties including soil type texture the land use and land cover of the region another factor could be the triggering relationship between soil moisture and precipitation brimelow et al 2011 manoj et al 2022 schwingshackl et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2010 via direct evapotranspiration and indirect interactions non linear impacts on boundary layer stability convective precipitation formation the sm p coincidence analysis suggests that seasonality is a major process in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p covariability over europe previous works have tried to unravel such dynamic spatial patterns at a continental scale for europe mainly from a perspective of dry conditions i e droughts bonaccorso et al 2013 hannaford et al 2011 tallaksen and stahl 2014 we argue that our analysis provides valuable information on spatial patterns of hydroclimatic covariability with a focus on wet conditions our results also show the need for considering spatial heterogeneity within the three ipcc homogeneous regions studies which use such homogeneous regions as references for the regional synthesis of future climate projections iturbide et al 2020 should take care of the varying nature of seasonal sm p coupling behaviour within the reference regions attributing the cause of such coupled sm p relationship would require process based models for the regions in which different scenarios should be investigated to test different hypothesis such an analysis is worth investigating but goes beyond the capabilities of the methodology applied in this work which is based solely on the statistical properties of the considered datasets 5 2 sm p dependence characteristics of the different climatic regions spatially well defined clusters are seen in southern europe seu west neu and west ceu in winter which shifts towards eastern europe in summer our results are generally in agreement with previous sm p studies over europe the reduction in soil moisture precipitation and evapotranspiration for seu in summer was shown by ghajarnia et al 2020 using a data driven multi catchment approach they observed higher monthly correlation values between soil moisture and evapotranspiration in the summer for seu their work stressed the critical role played by soil moisture in regulating large scale runoff variations across diverse european climatic regions the violin plots further helped understand the distribution of sm p coincidence rates within major ipcc regions over europe and their seasonality the reduction in median mean coincidence rates among grid points in seu is well captured in the seasonal violin plots such a reduction in coincidences is likely due to drier soil moisture states and less sm p coupling via et during summer in seu the resulting plots further pointed to the spatial variation of sm p coincidence rates within neu and ceu the near identical distribution of precursor coincidence rates for both west and east seu is an indicator of the homogenous behaviour of the whole region seu w r t hydroclimatic coupling identifying such homogenous regions and their corresponding seasonal behaviour is crucial for numerous hydro meteorological applications agarwal et al 2018 guntu et al 2020 pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 they can aid in disentangling the complexity of hydrological systems mcdonnell and woods 2004 the spatial coherence of such changing regional patterns can hold vital information about the propagation of large scale hydro meteorological extremes like droughts and floods the role of soil moisture atmosphere coupling for temperature and precipitation extremes and their associated trends have also been previously studied over europe jaeger and seneviratne 2011 used simulations from a regional climate model to investigate the role of sm p coupling for temperature and precipitation extremes over the european summer climate significant impacts of temporal sm variability were found for the wet day frequency and other associated extreme indices seneviratne et al 2006 investigated the role of atmospheric coupling on future changes in the interannual variability of summer precipitation over europe and found that in most cases the deviations can be partly explained by land atmosphere coupling in regions where precipitation increases of considerable magnitude were simulated the land atmosphere coupling could account for about two thirds of the total variance 5 3 sm p dependence as a possible flood generation mechanism accounting for the impact of joint sm p covariation patterns in the context of annual flood generation over european catchments is vital for the proper characterisation of different possible runoff generation mechanisms identifying catchments with a higher fraction of reported historical annual floods immediately after the joint occurrence of sm p coincidences and their dependence on seasonality is also helpful from flood forecast and disaster preparedness aspects we used an extension of the bivariate event coincidence analysis to account for the conditional probability of event occurrences in more than two variables specifically we focused on discharge events q annual floods happening after both sm and p events have taken place our findings showed that the seasonal evolution of such conditional precursor coincidence rates r p c over european catchments are generally in line with previous studies berghuijs et al 2019b blöschl et al 2019 hundecha et al 2020 lun et al 2021 we saw an increase in the median mean coincidence for r p c from winter to fall albeit with fewer catchments contributing to the distribution of the coincidence rates in fall furthermore we saw that the seasonal evolution of conditional precursor r p c over seu is in line with the corresponding temporal changes seen in sm p coincidence r p patterns to understand the possible connection between catchment wetness and the conditional precursor coincidence rates we plotted the seasonal variation of the 95th percentile limit fig c1 and c2 in appendix c supplementary information in general we can observe higher values for soil moisture and precipitation limits in regions with higher coincidence rates our observations align with the results of berghuijs et al 2019b for europe who used seasonal statistics to estimate the relative importance of different mechanisms as potential flood drivers they found that during 1960 2010 relatively few annual floods were caused by precipitation extremes acting alone and in about 43 of the studied catchments the flood events were caused by the concurrence of heavy precipitation with high antecedent soil moisture the timing of soil moisture excess was seen to coincide with the seasonality of annual flood events across large parts of western europe including germany france spain and britain these regions also have a higher coincidence in our case the peak floods were also seen to not coincide in the case of eastern europe this behaviour is also seen in our analysis with lower coincidence rates reported for the eastern european and scandinavian catchments however caution should be given to the fact that the conditional coincidence rates are calculated out of the total number of events in a season blöschl et al 2019 demonstrated regional patterns in observed flood discharges over europe and reported an increase in flood discharge values for north western europe including parts of germany france and the northern uk due to the increase in rainfall and soil moisture statistically significant positive correlation values were obtained for temporal variability of discharge and soil moisture maxima which again points to the possible role played by soil moisture excess along with the increasing precipitation as an important flood driver for these regions for southern europe a decrease in precipitation and soil moisture was reported resulting in a decrease in flood discharge values from 1960 to 2010 the decline has been attributed to the northward shift of the subtropical jet and increased evapotranspiration due to warming temperatures archer and caldeira 2008 mediero et al 2014 we argue here that since the percentile thresholds and the subsequent events are calculated based on the long term seasonal climatology of the region such a reduction would lead to a fewer number of coincidences and finally to a reduced coincidence rate this could be a possible reason for lower rates seen in those regions however the characterisation of the strength of absolute values on the calculated rates is indeed complex and worth investigating in detail in future studies hundecha et al 2020 identified four major flood generating processes across europe long rain short rain snowmelt and rain on dry soil flood events and investigated the seasonal and regional distribution of the different flood event types they saw a clear predominance of short rain events in which the catchment is saturated at the onset with very little soil moisture deficit both seasonally and regionally throughout europe the only exception is the regions in northern europe where snowmelt events dominated this is again similar to our observation of fewer significant conditional precursor coincidence rates in those regions while at the same time it should be noted that the coincidence rates is not generalised for all the other areas lun et al 2021 did a pan european assessment of characteristics and process controls of statistical flood moments they used the mean annual flood maf and coefficients of variation cv and skewness cs of flood discharges over five predetermined hydroclimatic regions similar to our results of higher conditional coincidence rates they observed higher mean specific annual floods over regions of the alps the apennines italy the carpathian flysch belt and great britain the spatial patterns of cv showed that the consistency of the occurrence of such peak flows is also in line with our obtained results catchments with wetter states in our case higher conditional coincidence rates showed less cv and hence more regularity in the occurrence of large floods 5 4 assumptions and limitations the need for exercising caution while employing gridded products for the analysis of extremes at a daily scale is already well reported in the literature gervais et al 2014 timmermans et al 2019 since it is an observational dataset the e obs product severely underperforms in regions with low station density which can be considered one of the product s major limitations however we note here that since the initial release of e obs haylock et al 2008 many more station has been continuously added and also the newer versions of e obs uses a refined interpolation method and take into account the possible uncertainties by delivering an ensemble of possible realisations 100 members cornes et al 2018 moreover in our case of quantifying the sm p coincidence we only consider the relative timings of events for different grid points the eca framework discards the magnitudes of the variable and only considers the days which exceed the prefixed percentile thresholds hence we explored the time variability rather than absolute values of soil moisture this has the advantage that the choice of modelled product is expected to have a limited impact on the final calculated coincidence rates koster et al 2009 our method is designed to quantify the sm p dependence based on the mutual occurrence of events in both series within the prefixed temporal tolerance we do not include the magnitude of such events into account therefore a quantitative understanding of the possible impact of changes in the magnitude of precipitation on the sm p dependence is lacking the 95th percentile is a reasonable cut off to include all extreme precipitation events which would finally lead to annual peak floods over the catchment however some floods could have been caused by rainfall rates not belonging to the top 5 and our present analysis does not take into account such events the spatial resolution of the gridded data 0 25 x 0 25 provides an average representation of the precipitation characteristics occurring in a region the grid based soil moisture product is also averaged over considerable spatial heterogeneity in order to compare the results for a larger number of catchments and to avoid the significant computational pre processing work involved in carrying out a catchment area weighted approach we used the grid points of the catchment outlet these approximations will invariably lead to a lack of representation of any small scale site specific conditions however our results must be seen as a first estimate of the catchments where significant dependence exists between sm p coincidences and the peak discharge events in our case higher conditional coincidence rates further works could focus on the identified locations and investigate the events following a process based modelling approach the methodology could be easily expanded to account for the catchment averaged soil moisture and precipitation values the temporal tolerance window could also be adapted and for a more detailed analysis an approach involving the coincidence rates calculation for different temporal tolerance could be utilised we stress here that the hydrological processes leading to flood generation are nonlinear and difficult to characterise using only simple event based approaches our main aim is to understand how the timing of the annual peak flood events could be used in conjunction with the seasonal patterns of sm p dependence to get a first estimate of the locations experiencing annual floods shortly after sm p coincidence the relative ratio of such flood events in each season to the total number of flood events reported in the specific season is calculated and helps identify catchments that are more prone to such soil moisture excess driven floods since only the dates of peak floods are available it is again not possible to identify the changes in patterns for different magnitude events we caution that the absolute number of annual flood events reported in a season can vary for each catchment the conditional precursor coincidence rates are reported as a fraction of the total number of events in a season minimum five for a catchment a drawback of such an approach is that it leads to some catchments being present in specific seasons only and to a different number of catchments in different seasons however in the present study our objective is to understand the relative importance of sm p coincidence as a possible precursor to the annual flood events throughout all the catchments and hence we investigated the relative proportions of the events as the conditional precursor coincidence rate r p c floods usually manifest due to several complex interconnected factors merz et al 2021 mishra et al 2022 we focused on soil moisture and precipitation but we believe the analysis of other important factors could contribute to better understanding the flood triggers these additional variables include topography soil type and properties land cover change and even the impact of sea surface temperature anomalies another point to be noted is the impact of anthropogenic constructions and the effect of reservoir management operations on streamflow alterations and variability pérez ciria et al 2019 6 conclusions and perspectives the present work provides a continental scale overview of the statistical coincidence relationship between soil moisture and precipitation events over europe we used the precursor coincidence rate to characterise the sm p preconditioning and then investigated the influence of seasonality on the dependence strength the changing patterns of sm p dependence are studied in depth for the various climatic regions of europe the possible impact of such sm p coincidences on annual flood events is also unravelled focusing on the role of such antecedent conditions as a possible flood generating mechanism the salient findings of the current study are a the seasonal sm p coincidence analysis reveals that seasonality is a major driving force in the spatiotemporal dynamics of sm p coupling over europe b higher coincidence rates are seen in southern europe seu and towards the western parts of northern and central europe west neu west ceu in winter which shifts towards east neu and east ceu in summer the patterns are in line with the expected seasonal climatology of the different regions c the conditional precursor coincidence which quantifies the relative fraction of annual flood events in a particular season that occurred after joint sm p coincidence is also evaluated for the different catchments and the observed values agree with previous flood hazard studies over europe the present work can be advanced by conducting smaller catchment scale studies incorporating streamflow data the relative impact of sm p coincidence over a range of discharge values can also be investigated further exploiting the approach used in the present study to the problem of characterising the dependence of absolute values on the coincidence rates and the temporal evolution of the spatiotemporal patterns over the past few years provide an exciting avenue for future research but is beyond the scope of present study it is worthwhile to note that changing the temporal tolerance window parameters and studying their associated impacts could aid in understanding the lagged associations between the various hydrometeorological variables in our case soil moisture precipitation and discharge future works could investigate such lagged covariation relationships in detail by incorporating additional variables for example evapotranspiration and solar radiation evaluating the changes for different tolerance windows and considering the lag parameters our results indicate the importance of considering antecedent conditions for understanding flood generation mechanisms over europe event based methods like eca can help incorporate the conditioning of variables on other processes eca can be a vital tool in studies aiming to characterise multivariate dependencies approaches considering such dynamic relationships can vastly help describe multi hazard risk scenarios and mitigate the adverse impacts of preconditioned compound events data availability statement we
