8660,drought is one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production in many areas in the world pressurized irrigation systems enable more efficient use of water compared to surface irrigation systems but are rarely used by small farmers due to higher initial investment and energy costs the main question investigated in the study is if remittances affect investment in pressurized irrigation drip or sprinkler irrigation systems a quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted among 234 small scale farmers in the republic of moldova in 2016 the main result of the binary probit regression model revealed that remittances increased the likelihood of utilization of pressurized irrigation facilities in the study region this study further contributes to a better understanding of factors that affect farmers adoption of pressurized irrigation systems this knowledge helps policy makers and development organizations shape proper measures to increase the diffusion of this technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks keywords migration agricultural investment eastern europe drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction increased water scarcity represents one of the main challenges to sustainable agricultural production this challenge is becoming more apparent as the world s population continues to grow and extreme weather events pose an immediate threat to food security and the nutrition of the people who directly depend on agriculture for their livelihood 1 pressurized irrigation systems enabling more efficient use of water compared to surface irrigation systems in crop production can be used as a strategy for small scale farmers to adapt to climate risk and to improve economic outcomes 2 3 drip irrigation reduces demand for water and minimizes water evaporation losses by providing the necessary water resources direct to the root zone of high value vegetable crops 4 sprinkler irrigation systems apply water to the soil surface by mechanical and hydraulic devices simulating natural rainfall enabling distribution of the right amount of water that plants need 5 in the republic of moldova the study area of this research drought is one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production 6 7 as the frequency of dry periods is expected to increase in the future lack of climate coping strategies will adversely impact livelihoods and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas and further undermine progress made in poverty reduction 8 small scale farmers as well as farmers situated in the central hot semi humid and south hot arid zones are the most affected by climate risks 9 10 due to the constraints mentioned above we hypothesize that remittances money sent by family members working abroad allow an increase in investment in pressurized irrigation including drip and sprinkler facilities to our knowledge there are no studies that have investigated the effect of migration and remittances on investment in and use of pressurized irrigation so far 1 1 several previous studies focused on other types of irrigation 11 13 to fill this gap the study investigates the effect of remittances and of farmer and household as well as farm characteristics on the adoption of pressurized irrigation facilities among small scale farmers living in rural areas in three districts of the republic of moldova 2 literature review 2 1 conceptual framework two different approaches were introduced to explain adoption of innovations by farmers firstly the intensity of adoption was studied in cross sectional studies using individual level discrete choice models 14 several studies on drip and sprinkler irrigation technology where the dependent variable was the adoption of the irrigation system itself were conducted the most commonly used method to explain this binary variable has been via the use of logit or probit models 15 16 secondly adoption of innovations over time and possible distinctions between early and late adopters was studied using duration analysis 17 18 in our first approach the study contributes to a better understanding of factors that affect farmers adoption of pressurized irrigation systems using a binary probit model extended binary probit regression model and fixed effects fe estimation at the regional agro ecological zone level this knowledge can help policy makers and development organizations shape proper measures to increase the diffusion of the technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks several studies worldwide investigated factors influencing the adoption of sprinkler and drip irrigation among the factors researched household head characteristics household characteristics farm characteristics environmental and regional characteristics economic characteristics technological features and institutional factors were found to play an important role see annex 2 farmers with higher levels of educational attainment are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation systems compared to less educated farmers as they have better access to information and better awareness of the available technology which ultimately helps them in adoption 17 19 a number of studies analysed the role of the age of farmers in investment in pressurized irrigation however the findings were inconsistent on the one hand as demonstrated in a study from spain and chile younger farmers are more progressive and flexible in the adoption of new technologies and are more likely to adopt drip irrigation compared their older counterparts who tend to be more comfortable with traditional practices 17 19 that said a majority of previous studies did not find any effect of age on the adoption of pressurized irrigation technology 15 20 greater availability of household labour force decreases the need for hiring additional farm labour and enables household members to use saved financial resources for investment in pressurized irrigation technologies 15 however several previous studies demonstrated that household characteristics did not play an important role in adoption 17 21 the size of the farm reflects the wealth of the farmers which facilitates pressurized irrigation adoption 22 23 on the one hand farmers with larger farms have better access to credit for on farm investment 18 22 and again they face less financial pressure in the search for alternative ways to improve the effectiveness of their water use 18 despite this several previous studies demonstrated that farm size did not play an important role in the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems 17 19 or even had a negative effect on adoption 24 cropping patterns are crucial in the adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies as water requirements are crop specific 20 25 farmers who manage fruit tree plantations and other high value crops are more likely to adopt drip irrigation 17 21 as was mentioned by alcon et al 17 in spain citrus plantations require long term investment it takes 4 5 years to reach a production life of around 35 years which encourages the farmers to adopt drip irrigation sooner compared to others respondents whose principal occupation is farming are less likely to adopt pressurized irrigation 26 showing the importance of cash resources in the initial adoption decisions of farmers 20 environmental risks which farmers have to face such as drought play an important role in adoption behaviour 22 27 a larger share of months with severe drought during the previous year increases the adoption of pressurized irrigation 22 28 pressurized irrigation technologies can maintain crop yield with lower water application rates which reduces production risk during water shortage and drought periods 26 moreover gains from increased irrigation efficiency offset water losses from increasing evaporation 26 contrary to the findings of olen et al 26 it was demonstrated by knapp and huang 22 that higher drought occurrence observed over a longer time horizon had a negative effect on adoption as small scale farmers have to face permanent decline in water availability sprinkler irrigation could be less favoured due to evaporation losses and different types of irrigation e g tailwater pits being preferred instead also a study by khor and feike 29 pointed out that with increased water scarcity the adoption of drip irrigation is likely to become less profitable and less viable for farmers sprinkler adoption is higher in the areas with a higher index of sheet and rill erosion capturing the effect of a lower soil quality and steeper slopes 19 30 the availability of information and the sources of information used have been found to be important factors influencing farmers behaviour 17 31 contact with extension service providers increases awareness of the benefits of new technology enhances farmers technical capability and increases the likelihood of the adoption of land management practices including the adoption of irrigation 32 33 farmers who learnt about pressurized irrigation from specialized people in agriculture have a higher probability of adoption than those farmers who learnt about the technology from other farmers 17 access to credit alleviates the constraints that affect farmers especially during the planting period and positively influence the adoption of pressurized irrigation 17 32 in this regard the study of nejadrezaei et al 34 pointed out that farmers benefiting from loans and banking facilities are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation 3 methodology 3 1 data collection and description of the target area a quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted between july and september 2016 in three regions of the republic of moldova prior to the survey the questionnaire was tested with a pilot group of five respondents in orhei district and adjusted the survey was conducted by one of the authors of the article and supported by local extension consultants from the national agency for rural development and by staff from the state agrarian university of moldova the republic of moldova is divided into three agro ecological zones the north region the central region and the south region see table 1 the north region s agricultural production benefits from favourable climatic conditions and fertile soils this region along the dniester river a forest steppe is characterized by high productivity in pasture and livestock production but is also suitable for the growing of crops such as maize wheat sunflower soybeans barley sugar beet potatoes and apples the central region a hilly and forested area is suitable for growing perennial crops vineyards and orchards the dry climate in the south region a mix of hills and plains makes the south region less suitable for agricultural production compared to other regions 35 36 one district in each agro ecological zone with the highest gross harvest of agricultural crops cereals leguminous and sunflower on farms in 2015 37 was selected namely cantemir orhei and soroca districts in each district two or three communes were selected as target areas fig 1 and table 1 cantemir district has the lowest population therefore only two communes were included instead of three soroca which is located in the north region is the most suitable region for field vegetable and fruit production out of the three surveyed districts in orhei located in the central region small scale farmers are mostly involved in cereal leguminous and sunflower production 39 they profit from the presence of large markets located in the district and in the capital city chisinau 35 36 cantemir district is located in the south agro ecological zone and thus is the least suitable for crop production compared to the other regions systematic random sampling was used to select respondents the sample size was calculated as following 35 respondents village 2 2 in peresecina and cosauti 36 farmers were interviewed since one questionnaire was not included when we checked for the correctness and completeness of the answers with confidence interval 90 margin of error 15 the sampling interval was calculated by dividing the number of citizens living in a village by average household size 3 members 3 3 source nbs 40 and divided by 100 desired number of respondents as we expected that at least half of potential respondents would be absent due to involvement in an off farm job in another part of the country or due to labour migration abroad or due to vacations in each household only one member was included in the survey in the majority of cases the household head was interviewed whenever he she was absent a household member responsible for farming activities was included the response rate was 36 in total 282 questionnaires were collected since agriculture activity dominated by small fragmented family farms often correlates withs limited access to financial resources and credit constraints remittances may crucially affect investment behaviour 41 42 at the same time small scale farmers importance in food production is large 43 therefore the sample was restricted only to small scale farmers with land less than 10 ha following the official definition of small scale farming in the republic of moldova by the national bureau of statistics of moldova 44 3 2 irrigation in the republic of moldova irrigated land in the republic of moldova has reduced dramatically compared to the soviet period mainly due to a deterioration in irrigation infrastructure recently only about nine percent of agricultural land is irrigated 45 it is estimated that in total 6640 ha are irrigated including 4035 ha under centralised systems and 2605 ha under small scale private systems 46 the most widespread small scale private irrigation systems are furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation 45 drip irrigation is the most efficient system and usually generates high revenues for farmers if used in orchards vineyards and in vegetable growing the benefits of drip irrigation however may vary according to the agro ecological zone of the country on average in the north irrigation may contribute to a 30 40 increase in yields in the centre to 40 80 and in the south to 80 150 47 moreover drip irrigation may save up to 40 of the cost of water compared to the cost when the crops are irrigated manually lowering the cost of water to an acceptable 3 5 lei m3 from 8 7 lei m3 47 the most suitable irrigation systems for small scale farmers with less than 10 ha in the republic of moldova are hose reel with boom sprinklers drip irrigation stand sprinklers and garden plot drip 48 the average price is about 2032 per hectare for a hose reel with boom sprinklers and between 1900 2500 per hectare for drip irrigation stand sprinklers and garden plot drip are suitable for small farms 2 3 ha the average price is 1456 for stand sprinklers and 3047 for garden plot drip systems the operating period of small scale irrigation systems is 12 17 years depending on how well it is maintained 49 considering the average household income per month in the republic of moldova is approximately 303 6000 lei 39 and due to unfavourable credit conditions 4 4 due to absence of collateral and high interest rates amounting to 15 20 annually small scale farmers often rely on credits provided by saving and credit associations i e associations created by a local group of citizens who decided to collectively save financial resources and provide credit to its members another credit opportunity is micro credit organizations where farmers may apply for small credits up to 25 000 lei 1389 usd at the beginning of the season and return them after the harvest period 50 irrigation is inaccessible for the majority of small scale farmers the price of irrigation equipment in moldova is up to 25 higher than price of equipment in neighbour countries 48 due to the financial constraints mentioned above we hypothesize that remittances money sent by family members working abroad allow an increase in investment in pressurized including drip and sprinkler irrigation facilities 3 3 empirical model when the adoption variable is binary logit and probit regression models are most commonly used to analyse technology adoption processes 51 52 the binary probit model used was in the following form pr y 1 x φ xβ 1 where y is a dependent binary variable denoting adoption of a sprinkler or drip irrigation 5 5 the adoption of drip or sprinkler irrigation was used as a single dependent variable since the adoption rate of both systems is relatively low in the study area about 7 of farmers used sprinkler systems and 8 used drip systems both systems require hight initial investment when implemented both systems may reduce irrigation water demand and both systems are subsidized by government so as to shift to higher value cultivation 46 in 2015 taking a value of 1 if the household adopted pressurized irrigation and value 0 if not x represents a set of all explanatory variables presented in table 2 and φ xβ is the cumulative distribution function to control for dependence of observations within the same community and to achieve a correct estimation of the standard errors observations are specified as being independent between communities but not within communities clustered robust standard errors at the commune level were used 53 54 our regression model was tested for multicollinearity using a variance inflation factor since the empirical model included several independent explanatory variables multicollinearity is a potential issue despite the fact that collinearity does not bias parameter estimates it can influence standard errors moreover the model becomes sensitive to changes in the sample size and to changes in the model structure 55 various recommendations regarding the value of the variance inflation factor and the level of tolerance have been proposed most commonly a value of ten as the maximum level of variance inflation factor and a value of 0 10 as the minimum level of tolerance has been recommended 55 all tested explanatory variables had variance inflation factor values within the range of 1 07 1 24 and the mean variance inflation factor was 1 14 which is below the threshold value of ten suggested by kleinbaum et al 56 indicating absence of multicollinearity an extended binary probit regression model was used to address potential endogeneity as our probit and iv probit model estimates would be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity we addressed this problem by use of estimations of regional fixed effects fe at the agro ecological zone level an χ2 test 57 fisher exact test 58 one way analysis of variance anova 59 kruskal wallis test 60 followed by a dunn test 61 were applied to determine if there is any difference in the use of pressurized irrigation between surveyed regions a fisher exact test was used whenever the expected frequency of cells was lower than five a kruskal wallis test 60 was used instead of the one way analysis of variance whenever the assumption of normality was not fulfilled 6 6 the assumption of normality was tested via a shapiro wilk 74 test and the assumption of homogeneity of variance was verified via a bartlett s test for equal variances 75 despite the fact that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was fulfilled the assumption of normality was not achieved therefore the kruskal wallis test 60 was used instead of one way analysis of variance 3 3 1 endogeneity empirical model specifications may suffer from endogeneity due to the presence of omitted variables sample selection bias measurement error and reverse causation 62 63 households receiving remittances may be basically different from households that do not receive them which we refer to as a selection bias for example households with remittances may likely be a previously poor household where a member migrated abroad to solve this situation reverse causality occurs when the poor wealth status together with a lack of farm machinery and infrastructure influences the migrant to remit more to improve the status of the household and increase farm production moreover households receiving remittances may be characterized by unobservable characteristics that could influence both remittance receipts and farm investment which we refer to as omitted variables the result would then either be overestimated or underestimated if remittances are sent to wealthy households which are not facing the challenge of a lack of farm assets then the result might be overestimated but if remittances are sent to compensate for the lack of farm machinery and assets the result may be underestimated an instrumental variables method was therefore applied to adequately address endogeneity previous studies focusing on the impact of labour migration and remittances on land use farm production farm labour and rural environment addressed the potential endogeneity issue by using an instrumental variable approach such as two stage least squares 64 65 three stage least squares 66 67 a probit model with continuous endogenous regressors 68 69 a tobit model with continuous endogenous regressors 70 71 or the instrumental variables fixed effect 72 in our research an extended probit regression model and instrumental variables regional fixed effect regression model were adopted the extended probit regression model fits all models including any combination of endogenous covariates and allowed us to use continuous as well as binary explanatory variables in the model 73 statistical analysis was carried out using the stata 16 statistical package 3 3 1 1 instrumental variables the historical migration rate 76 77 as well as socio economic conditions in destination areas 78 79 has commonly been used to predict receipt of remittances the historical migration rate serves as an indicator of the presence of migration networks established in destination countries enabling migrants to send a larger volume of remittances following böhme et al 12 and stöhr 80 we calculated the number of moldovan migrants going to each destination country relative to the total population at the district level from the 2004 census 39 to reflect the exclusion restriction of our instrument following the same authors we cross compared historical migration networks with the average gross domestic product per capita growth in the host countries between 2004 and 2014 which we adopted from the world bank 81 following böhme et al 12 our network growth interaction instrument was used in following form network growth interactioni i v j j m i g r a n t s 2004 i j p o p u l a t i o n 2004 i 2 t t t g d p j t 1 g d p j t g d p j t where iv is the instrumental variable t 2004 2014 are years j 1 j are all destination countries and i 1 i all sampled localities in the republic of moldova it is expected that higher average monthly income in migrant destination countries raises migrants disposable earnings and increases the likelihood and amount of remittances sent home 79 82 a five year 2009 2014 average of gross average monthly wage estimates at the state level used as a second instrument were obtained from the united nations economic commission for europe 83 first we examined whether instrumental variables were significantly correlated with remittance receipts the endogenous regressor to be calculated we found a strong correlation between the instruments and remittance receipts both instrumental variables were significant at 1 level of significance second we assessed the exogeneity of our instruments further as an informal check we estimated the accuracy of our model including all its regressors along with remittance receipts and the two instruments migration network and gross average monthly wage being used neither instrument appears to have had a significant direct impact on expenditures once we controlled for household remittance receipts results upon request as the adoption of an instrumental variable approach leads to a reduction in the sample it was not possible to consistently analyse territorial differences therefore territorial differences were captured using descriptive statistics because finding appropriate instruments is challenging we now report diagnostic tests of the validity and relevance of the chosen instruments instrument relevancy i e correlated with endogenous variables was tested using the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk lm test 84 under the null hypothesis that the instruments were not correlated with the endogenous variables the hansen j test 85 was used to test if instruments were not correlated with the error term and therefore were not overidentified the strength of the instrumental variables was examined in the first stage regression by testing the significance of the excluded variable s using an f test we report the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk wald f test instead of cragg donald based f statistic 87 because a clustered robust standard error was used under the null hypothesis that the instruments were only weakly correlated with the endogenous variables we ran an extended instrumental variables regression as diagnostic tests were calculated after ivreg2 in stata 86 3 3 2 sample description the characteristics of the surveyed small scale farmers are reported in table 2 a wilcoxon rank sum mann whitney 88 two sample t test 89 and pearson χ2 57 tests for categorical variables were applied to analyse differences between households receiving remittances and non receiving households the average age of the surveyed small scale farmers was 36 15 15 years mean sd with the youngest farmer being 18 years old and the oldest 75 years old this is in line with the population census from 2014 90 where the average age was 37 9 years 7 7 based on the agricultural census from 2011 94 average age of the household head was 53 1 despite that in the majority of cases the household head was interviewed in our survey whenever he she was absent the household member responsible for farming activities was included usually son or daughter of respondent as for educational attainment more than 41 of farmers were tertiary educated based on a household budget survey of 2016 91 17 6 reached higher educational level therefore more than more than twice as many farmers in the sample 41 than in the population 17 6 indicated having had higher education agriculture represented the main source of income for 30 of respondents which is consistent with a study of nbs of 2015 92 based on data from 2015 about 32 citizens were employed in agriculture hunting and forestry or fishing 93 on average 2 4 family members worked on the farm the land plots were often small and fragmented with an average area of 2 ha per farm 2 03 1 29 ha typically divided into two plots 2 07 1 84 which is consistent with previous studies from the republic of moldova 42 based on the agricultural census of 2011 94 the average area of land was 2 15 ha 8 8 including all types of agricultural holdings about 7 of farmers in our sample used sprinkler systems and 8 used drip systems based on our results farmers receiving remittances felt less likely to be constrained by a lack of access to credit and capital and less likely to be constrained by low soil fertility or productivity a higher proportion of households receiving remittances used pressurized irrigation households receiving remittances appeared to own larger farms and tended to be less fragmented however in our wilcoxon rank sum mann whitney results there were no significant differences in farm size holdings 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive analysis 4 1 1 migration and remittance patterns about half of the households in the study sample had experiences with international migration where one or more household members were working abroad see table 3 the most favoured destinations of migrants were russia 39 italy 27 romania 22 and ukraine 12 less than six percent of household members were fully involved in agricultural tasks before they migrated abroad migrant workers were involved mainly in the planting of crops 14 harvesting 14 preparation of land 12 weeding 11 animal feeding and care 10 and marketing of produce 9 before their departure abroad women were mostly responsible for planting weeding and harvesting and men were mostly responsible for preparation of land harvesting planting and animal feeding remittances were spent mostly on the payment of health and education expenses buying clothes food and electronics and on household construction and maintenance practices and vehicles see annex 2 investing remittances in material goods such as a house or car is a visible sign that a household member has migrated successfully and found a well paid job abroad despite the repeated occurrence of drought the level of irrigation was low based on discussions with local extension consultants from the national agency for rural development involved in data collection irrigation infrastructure requires high investment and maintenance costs which are unaffordable for the majority of farmers only 15 of farmers used drip or sprinkler pressurized irrigation based on the observations of the authors the majority of the surveyed farmers irrigated crops by hand and the rest of respondents did not irrigate the land at all drip or sprinkler irrigation was used mostly in vegetable production based on the results shown in table 3 the region with the lowest percentage of households with current migrants was the cantemir district where 31 of households had one or more members working abroad whereas the percentage of households with current migrants was higher in the orhei and soroca districts about 52 remittances were most often sent by migrants originating in the orhei district followed by the cantemir and soroca districts looking at the destination countries of the migrants in both the cantemir and soroca districts there was a higher prevalence of migrants working in the commonwealth of independent states whereas in orhei migrants were working almost equally in the european union and in the commonwealth of independent states a kruskal wallis test showed a difference between the regions in average land size p value 0 001 and number of land parcels owned p value 0 079 a multiple comparisons test dunn test showed differences in land size between the soroca and orhei districts 3 317 p 0 001 and between the orhei and cantemir districts 2 836 p value 0 007 but there were no differences between the soroca and cantemir districts 0 245 p value 1 000 focusing on the number of parcels a multiple comparisons test showed differences only between the soroca and orhei districts 2 380 p value 0 026 but there were no differences between the soroca and cantemir districts 1 175 p value 0 360 or between the orhei and cantemir districts 1 031 p value 0 454 4 2 determinants on the use of pressurized irrigation we conducted a robustness check of our analysis first a binary probit model was used to determine factors influencing the adoption of pressurized irrigation the results are shown in table 4 column 1 shows the results of a probit model that includes only household head characteristics columns 2 3 4 5 includes the results of estimating the model controlling for household economic characteristics farm level and institutional characteristics respectively finally in column 6 we present the results for estimating a model with the full set of controls to control for dependence of observations within the same community and to achieve a correct estimation of the standard errors a clustered robust standard errors calculation at the commune level was used in all models second we ran an additional binary probit model where we separated out the dependent variable drip and sprinkler irrigation adoption the coefficients and marginal effects of this binary probit estimation are reported in table 5 column 7 shows the estimated coefficients and standard errors for the adoption of drip irrigation and column 8 shows the results for sprinkler irrigation adoption third we used an extended binary probit regression model to address potential endogeneity of the treatment variable because finding appropriate instruments is challenging we also report diagnostic tests of the validity and relevance of the chosen instruments instrument relevancy i e correlated with the endogenous variables is tested using a kleibergen and paap 2006 rk lm test under the null supposition that the instruments are not correlated with the endogenous variables the cragg donald kleibergen paap f statistic indicates that the instruments are significantly correlated with the endogenous regressors 6 796 p value 0 033 and thus not weak the probability value for a hansen j test shows that the instruments are not correlated with the error term and therefore are not over identified 1 281 p value 0 258 the strength of the instrumental variables is examined in a first stage regression by testing the significance of the excluded variable s using an f test we report using the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk wald f test instead of a cragg donald based f statistic because a clustered robust standard error was used under the null hypothesis that the instruments are only weakly correlated with the endogenous variables the kleibergen paap walk rk f statistic mostly exceeds at 70 809 the critical value of 10 for weak instruments proposed by stock and yogo 2002 95 overall our results suggest that the instruments used in the model are valid and reliable the results of our extended binary probit regression model are included in table 6 column 9 the error correlation corr e remittance e dependent variable is an estimate of the correlation between the errors from the main and auxilary equations the null hypothesis states that there is no endogeneity the estimates were not significant at a 1 level so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and remittances can be treated as exogenous both instrumental variables were correlated with the endogenous covariates but they were not directly related to the outcome variable fourth since our probit and iv probit model estimates would be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity various biotic and abiotic factors we addressed this problem by controlling for regional fixed effect using fixed effects fe estimations at the regional agro ecological zone level column 10 show the estimated coefficients and standard errors of regional fixed effect regression while column 11 show a results model combining regional fixed effects with an iv strategy the results showed reasonable explanatory power with the percentage of overall correct predictions ranging from 85 04 column 1 to 93 16 in the case of the adoption of sprinkler irrigation column 8 moreover the coefficient estimates of a majority of the control variables have consistent signs with acceptable differences in magnitudes between the models indicating the robustness of these estimates the results show that remittances facilitate the adoption of pressurized irrigation the signs of the coefficients were consistent and remain significant at the 1 level in all models except for the results of the model combining a regional fixed effects with the iv strategy where the coefficient of the remittance variable was significant at the 5 level farmers with tertiary education are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation compared to less educated farmers the signs of the coefficients were consistent and remain significant at the 1 level in all models except for the results model combining a regional fixed effects with the iv strategy where the coefficient of the education variable was significant at the 5 level and in the model where the adoption of a sprinkler irrigation system was separated from the adoption of drip irrigation where the coefficient was significant at the 10 level the age of household head did not have an effect on the adoption of farm assets the coefficient of age of hh head remained insignificant in all models 4 2 1 household characteristics our results revealed that availability of household labour is a statistically significant factor affecting the adoption only in models where we accounted for endogeneity e g models shown in column 9 and column 11 ownership of larger landholdings reflecting the wealth of the farmers has a positive effect on the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems however the coefficient of land size was significant only in models not accounting for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity when we accounted for unobserved biotic and abiotic factors the coefficient was no longer significant unexpectedly the number of plots or land parcels significantly increases the likelihood of the utilization of irrigation facilities however a higher number of plots may reflect the wealth of the farmer indicating that larger richer farmers conducting more intensive agricultural production can afford to invest in pressurized irrigation infrastructure an individual farm in the study sample cultivates on average an area of about 2 ha typically distributed between two or three plots see table 2 irrigation can always be applied only on one specific plot devoted to vegetable production while the rest of the plots are irrigated manually the coefficient of the number of land parcels was no longer significant when we accounted for unobserved heterogeneity using a regional fixed effect regression model biotic and abiotic factors being specific to the agro ecological zone moreover the number of plots significantly increases the likelihood of the utilization of sprinkler irrigation but not drip irrigation cropping patterns are crucial in the adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies as water requirements are highly crop specific farmers managing vegetable production were more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation in our study vegetables such as tomatoes potatoes peppers watermelons cabbages and cucumbers were mostly irrigated see table 3 however the coefficient of cultivation was no longer significant when we ran the model for sprinkler irrigation 4 2 2 institutional characteristics the results of our models revealed that neither access to extension services nor perception of credit constraints affecting agricultural production by local farmers influenced the utilization of pressurized irrigation statistically significantly the coefficients remain unsignificant in all models our questionnaire provides only limited information regarding the use of extension services as the quality of the information provided to the farmer skills of the extension provider as well as the frequency of contact with the extension agency is not included in our survey therefore the quality of the service probably matters more than simple access to an extension provider 4 2 3 environmental characteristics when farmers in our study perceived that their production was affected by severe drought during the previous year they were more likely to use pressurized irrigation the signs of the coefficients were consistent in all models 5 conclusion and discussion drought increasing water scarcity and inefficient use of irrigation water are one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production in many parts of the world therefore effective management of water resources and the adoption of efficient irrigation systems provide important buffers against increasing climate variability and are becoming a priority for local policy makers despite all the positive effects of pressurized irrigation technology its wide use in the field among small farmers is still limited also in the republic of moldova our study area particularly due to the high initial investment and maintenance costs of these irrigation systems our results showed that only 15 of small farmers cultivating up to 10 ha land used drip or sprinkler irrigation in the republic of moldova drip or sprinkler irrigation was used mostly in vegetable production where high economic returns were expected this result showed that the potential for pressurized irrigation in climate risk mitigation and in increasing production among small farmers is not exhausted this study s particular contribution is that it deals with the question why this is the case it provides insights into factors and drivers of the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems and serves as the basis for policy interventions in the surveyed area where sustainable water management is required the results show that remittances facilitate the adoption of irrigation infrastructure in our study area this finding is consistent with the findings of piras et al 96 who conducted their study among 126 smallholders from 37 villages in moldova in 2015 and also with several other studies from mozambique mexico and laos which found that remittances facilitate investment in water pumps and irrigation infrastructure in general 11 13 a sufficient amount of remittances allows poor small scale farmers to make small investments without accessing farm credit piras et al 96 at the same time remittances allow a relaxation of credit constraints 97 98 which enables smallholders to overcome the high investment costs of irrigation facilities and the rising cost of energy supply for the pumps small scale farmers in moldova are very risk averse when dealing with credit and they are unwilling to expand their farm activities if they are required to use their land as collateral and therefore they prefer to use remittances to intensify farm production without relying on corporate farm structures for input supply instead 96 therefore remittances could provide an effective starting point for policy makers co funding of remittance financed projects could be one way to stimulate investments in modern technology and improve the efficiency of the provided grants 99 as the lack of finance access in the area hinders the adoption and use of pressurized systems complementary policy measures are needed to expand areas under drip and sprinkler systems and to shift to higher value production policy makers should come up with plans to reduce any adaptation costs both financially as well as in terms of time and effort and should deploy effort to reduce entry barriers facilitate and broaden the access to pressurized irrigation technology as well as eliminate credit constraints making the initial investment affordable for the majority of small scale farmers this requires a targeted and well managed expansion of subsidy schemes for small scale private irrigation systems farmers should be supported at the national as well as at local levels through investments to facilitate access to finance and scale up subsidies for on farm investments moreover as mentioned by piras et al 99 a supportive business environment should be created to support local investment policy makers should pay attention especially to removing obstacles posed by systematic corruption and the absence of a system of farm insurance which may be preventing small scale farmers from investing in agriculture our results suggest that more educated small scale farmers have a greater ability to understand and adapt to climate change by using pressurized irrigation facilities they have a higher awareness of the benefits and negatives of applying technology and at the same time they have a greater ability to seek important information and obtain support from the government and non governmental organizations 100 101 this finding is in line with adoption literature which states that a positive relationship exists between human capital and decisions to adopt new technology 102 103 confirms the fact that pressurized irrigation technologies require special technical and managerial skills for their proper utilization 20 to encourage adoption and use of pressurized systems and reduce uncertainty about the advantages of pressurized irrigation special training programmes and trials providing the small scale farmers an opportunity to gain the information and skills needed to maintain irrigation system should be put in place as suggested in a study by yang et al 104 indoor courses where farmers can learn about the risks and uncertainties of applied technology as well as about their economic viability e g costs and benefits and thus allowing small scale farmers to increase their familiarity with recommended new technology should be organized in combination with field trials field instruction can enable farmers to understand in depth the correct operation and economic benefits of the technology both training and trials can provide an opportunity for farmers to learn from each other sharing their experiences and may speed up direct communication between them however knowledge of pressurized irrigation technology does not guarantee actual adoption unless these technologies are made accessible to the small scale farmers through devising an institutional support system results show that age of a household head has no influence on the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation suggesting that there is no generation gap in the adoption of irrigation facilities this is consistent with a majority of studies which found no significant effect of age on the use of irrigation facilities 15 105 we found that farm characteristics such as farm size fragmentation and cropping patterns play a significant role in the adoption of irrigation infrastructure until we accounted for unobserved heterogeneity by using a regional fixed effect regression model biotic and abiotic factors specific to the agro ecological zone therefore policy makers and development organizations should consider the different characteristics of the agro ecological zones when implementing measures to increase the diffusion of this technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks further results show that the use of extension services has no effect on irrigation adoption thus the possible role of extension services does not seem to be fully exploited as yet further research would be needed to understand where the user of irrigation technology gets information about pressurized irrigation systems and which information channels increase the adoption of irrigation among small farmers in moldova when farmers in our study perceived that their production was affected by severe drought during the previous year they were more likely to use pressurized irrigation as was found by udmale et al 28 based on the perception of drought impact severity farmers used various adaptation measures to mitigate drought impacts one of these measures included using improved irrigation practices since pressurized irrigation technologies can maintain crop yield with lower water application rates reducing production risks during water shortage and drought periods they may use these irrigation systems to deal with perceived drought to increase their production similarly a study by anik et al 106 pointed out that farmers located in areas severely affected by climate change are more proactive in undertaking adaptation strategies than their counterparts located in less affected areas and a study by li et al 107 found significant differences between farmers with and without disaster experience in their perceptions of climate change and technical adaptive strategies therefore educational institutions should raise farmers awareness of the probability of repeated drought occurrences and highlight their negative effects on farm productivity and offer possible responses to these as mentioned by zobeidi et al 108 visits of small scale farmers to other farmers in drought affected areas are critical to increasing their risk perception when interpreting the results we need to have in mind several limitations of this study especially that the questionnaire used in our study did not include information about the amount of transfers which members of households working abroad sent to their relatives as information about the amount of received remittances is perceived as a sensitive question by the majority of farmers and therefore including it could have reduced farmers willingness to answer moreover the questionnaire used in our study did not include information about water prices paid by farmers funding this work was supported by the internal grant agency of the faculty of tropical agrisciences

8660,drought is one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production in many areas in the world pressurized irrigation systems enable more efficient use of water compared to surface irrigation systems but are rarely used by small farmers due to higher initial investment and energy costs the main question investigated in the study is if remittances affect investment in pressurized irrigation drip or sprinkler irrigation systems a quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted among 234 small scale farmers in the republic of moldova in 2016 the main result of the binary probit regression model revealed that remittances increased the likelihood of utilization of pressurized irrigation facilities in the study region this study further contributes to a better understanding of factors that affect farmers adoption of pressurized irrigation systems this knowledge helps policy makers and development organizations shape proper measures to increase the diffusion of this technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks keywords migration agricultural investment eastern europe drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction increased water scarcity represents one of the main challenges to sustainable agricultural production this challenge is becoming more apparent as the world s population continues to grow and extreme weather events pose an immediate threat to food security and the nutrition of the people who directly depend on agriculture for their livelihood 1 pressurized irrigation systems enabling more efficient use of water compared to surface irrigation systems in crop production can be used as a strategy for small scale farmers to adapt to climate risk and to improve economic outcomes 2 3 drip irrigation reduces demand for water and minimizes water evaporation losses by providing the necessary water resources direct to the root zone of high value vegetable crops 4 sprinkler irrigation systems apply water to the soil surface by mechanical and hydraulic devices simulating natural rainfall enabling distribution of the right amount of water that plants need 5 in the republic of moldova the study area of this research drought is one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production 6 7 as the frequency of dry periods is expected to increase in the future lack of climate coping strategies will adversely impact livelihoods and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas and further undermine progress made in poverty reduction 8 small scale farmers as well as farmers situated in the central hot semi humid and south hot arid zones are the most affected by climate risks 9 10 due to the constraints mentioned above we hypothesize that remittances money sent by family members working abroad allow an increase in investment in pressurized irrigation including drip and sprinkler facilities to our knowledge there are no studies that have investigated the effect of migration and remittances on investment in and use of pressurized irrigation so far 1 1 several previous studies focused on other types of irrigation 11 13 to fill this gap the study investigates the effect of remittances and of farmer and household as well as farm characteristics on the adoption of pressurized irrigation facilities among small scale farmers living in rural areas in three districts of the republic of moldova 2 literature review 2 1 conceptual framework two different approaches were introduced to explain adoption of innovations by farmers firstly the intensity of adoption was studied in cross sectional studies using individual level discrete choice models 14 several studies on drip and sprinkler irrigation technology where the dependent variable was the adoption of the irrigation system itself were conducted the most commonly used method to explain this binary variable has been via the use of logit or probit models 15 16 secondly adoption of innovations over time and possible distinctions between early and late adopters was studied using duration analysis 17 18 in our first approach the study contributes to a better understanding of factors that affect farmers adoption of pressurized irrigation systems using a binary probit model extended binary probit regression model and fixed effects fe estimation at the regional agro ecological zone level this knowledge can help policy makers and development organizations shape proper measures to increase the diffusion of the technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks several studies worldwide investigated factors influencing the adoption of sprinkler and drip irrigation among the factors researched household head characteristics household characteristics farm characteristics environmental and regional characteristics economic characteristics technological features and institutional factors were found to play an important role see annex 2 farmers with higher levels of educational attainment are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation systems compared to less educated farmers as they have better access to information and better awareness of the available technology which ultimately helps them in adoption 17 19 a number of studies analysed the role of the age of farmers in investment in pressurized irrigation however the findings were inconsistent on the one hand as demonstrated in a study from spain and chile younger farmers are more progressive and flexible in the adoption of new technologies and are more likely to adopt drip irrigation compared their older counterparts who tend to be more comfortable with traditional practices 17 19 that said a majority of previous studies did not find any effect of age on the adoption of pressurized irrigation technology 15 20 greater availability of household labour force decreases the need for hiring additional farm labour and enables household members to use saved financial resources for investment in pressurized irrigation technologies 15 however several previous studies demonstrated that household characteristics did not play an important role in adoption 17 21 the size of the farm reflects the wealth of the farmers which facilitates pressurized irrigation adoption 22 23 on the one hand farmers with larger farms have better access to credit for on farm investment 18 22 and again they face less financial pressure in the search for alternative ways to improve the effectiveness of their water use 18 despite this several previous studies demonstrated that farm size did not play an important role in the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems 17 19 or even had a negative effect on adoption 24 cropping patterns are crucial in the adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies as water requirements are crop specific 20 25 farmers who manage fruit tree plantations and other high value crops are more likely to adopt drip irrigation 17 21 as was mentioned by alcon et al 17 in spain citrus plantations require long term investment it takes 4 5 years to reach a production life of around 35 years which encourages the farmers to adopt drip irrigation sooner compared to others respondents whose principal occupation is farming are less likely to adopt pressurized irrigation 26 showing the importance of cash resources in the initial adoption decisions of farmers 20 environmental risks which farmers have to face such as drought play an important role in adoption behaviour 22 27 a larger share of months with severe drought during the previous year increases the adoption of pressurized irrigation 22 28 pressurized irrigation technologies can maintain crop yield with lower water application rates which reduces production risk during water shortage and drought periods 26 moreover gains from increased irrigation efficiency offset water losses from increasing evaporation 26 contrary to the findings of olen et al 26 it was demonstrated by knapp and huang 22 that higher drought occurrence observed over a longer time horizon had a negative effect on adoption as small scale farmers have to face permanent decline in water availability sprinkler irrigation could be less favoured due to evaporation losses and different types of irrigation e g tailwater pits being preferred instead also a study by khor and feike 29 pointed out that with increased water scarcity the adoption of drip irrigation is likely to become less profitable and less viable for farmers sprinkler adoption is higher in the areas with a higher index of sheet and rill erosion capturing the effect of a lower soil quality and steeper slopes 19 30 the availability of information and the sources of information used have been found to be important factors influencing farmers behaviour 17 31 contact with extension service providers increases awareness of the benefits of new technology enhances farmers technical capability and increases the likelihood of the adoption of land management practices including the adoption of irrigation 32 33 farmers who learnt about pressurized irrigation from specialized people in agriculture have a higher probability of adoption than those farmers who learnt about the technology from other farmers 17 access to credit alleviates the constraints that affect farmers especially during the planting period and positively influence the adoption of pressurized irrigation 17 32 in this regard the study of nejadrezaei et al 34 pointed out that farmers benefiting from loans and banking facilities are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation 3 methodology 3 1 data collection and description of the target area a quantitative questionnaire survey was conducted between july and september 2016 in three regions of the republic of moldova prior to the survey the questionnaire was tested with a pilot group of five respondents in orhei district and adjusted the survey was conducted by one of the authors of the article and supported by local extension consultants from the national agency for rural development and by staff from the state agrarian university of moldova the republic of moldova is divided into three agro ecological zones the north region the central region and the south region see table 1 the north region s agricultural production benefits from favourable climatic conditions and fertile soils this region along the dniester river a forest steppe is characterized by high productivity in pasture and livestock production but is also suitable for the growing of crops such as maize wheat sunflower soybeans barley sugar beet potatoes and apples the central region a hilly and forested area is suitable for growing perennial crops vineyards and orchards the dry climate in the south region a mix of hills and plains makes the south region less suitable for agricultural production compared to other regions 35 36 one district in each agro ecological zone with the highest gross harvest of agricultural crops cereals leguminous and sunflower on farms in 2015 37 was selected namely cantemir orhei and soroca districts in each district two or three communes were selected as target areas fig 1 and table 1 cantemir district has the lowest population therefore only two communes were included instead of three soroca which is located in the north region is the most suitable region for field vegetable and fruit production out of the three surveyed districts in orhei located in the central region small scale farmers are mostly involved in cereal leguminous and sunflower production 39 they profit from the presence of large markets located in the district and in the capital city chisinau 35 36 cantemir district is located in the south agro ecological zone and thus is the least suitable for crop production compared to the other regions systematic random sampling was used to select respondents the sample size was calculated as following 35 respondents village 2 2 in peresecina and cosauti 36 farmers were interviewed since one questionnaire was not included when we checked for the correctness and completeness of the answers with confidence interval 90 margin of error 15 the sampling interval was calculated by dividing the number of citizens living in a village by average household size 3 members 3 3 source nbs 40 and divided by 100 desired number of respondents as we expected that at least half of potential respondents would be absent due to involvement in an off farm job in another part of the country or due to labour migration abroad or due to vacations in each household only one member was included in the survey in the majority of cases the household head was interviewed whenever he she was absent a household member responsible for farming activities was included the response rate was 36 in total 282 questionnaires were collected since agriculture activity dominated by small fragmented family farms often correlates withs limited access to financial resources and credit constraints remittances may crucially affect investment behaviour 41 42 at the same time small scale farmers importance in food production is large 43 therefore the sample was restricted only to small scale farmers with land less than 10 ha following the official definition of small scale farming in the republic of moldova by the national bureau of statistics of moldova 44 3 2 irrigation in the republic of moldova irrigated land in the republic of moldova has reduced dramatically compared to the soviet period mainly due to a deterioration in irrigation infrastructure recently only about nine percent of agricultural land is irrigated 45 it is estimated that in total 6640 ha are irrigated including 4035 ha under centralised systems and 2605 ha under small scale private systems 46 the most widespread small scale private irrigation systems are furrow sprinkler and drip irrigation 45 drip irrigation is the most efficient system and usually generates high revenues for farmers if used in orchards vineyards and in vegetable growing the benefits of drip irrigation however may vary according to the agro ecological zone of the country on average in the north irrigation may contribute to a 30 40 increase in yields in the centre to 40 80 and in the south to 80 150 47 moreover drip irrigation may save up to 40 of the cost of water compared to the cost when the crops are irrigated manually lowering the cost of water to an acceptable 3 5 lei m3 from 8 7 lei m3 47 the most suitable irrigation systems for small scale farmers with less than 10 ha in the republic of moldova are hose reel with boom sprinklers drip irrigation stand sprinklers and garden plot drip 48 the average price is about 2032 per hectare for a hose reel with boom sprinklers and between 1900 2500 per hectare for drip irrigation stand sprinklers and garden plot drip are suitable for small farms 2 3 ha the average price is 1456 for stand sprinklers and 3047 for garden plot drip systems the operating period of small scale irrigation systems is 12 17 years depending on how well it is maintained 49 considering the average household income per month in the republic of moldova is approximately 303 6000 lei 39 and due to unfavourable credit conditions 4 4 due to absence of collateral and high interest rates amounting to 15 20 annually small scale farmers often rely on credits provided by saving and credit associations i e associations created by a local group of citizens who decided to collectively save financial resources and provide credit to its members another credit opportunity is micro credit organizations where farmers may apply for small credits up to 25 000 lei 1389 usd at the beginning of the season and return them after the harvest period 50 irrigation is inaccessible for the majority of small scale farmers the price of irrigation equipment in moldova is up to 25 higher than price of equipment in neighbour countries 48 due to the financial constraints mentioned above we hypothesize that remittances money sent by family members working abroad allow an increase in investment in pressurized including drip and sprinkler irrigation facilities 3 3 empirical model when the adoption variable is binary logit and probit regression models are most commonly used to analyse technology adoption processes 51 52 the binary probit model used was in the following form pr y 1 x φ xβ 1 where y is a dependent binary variable denoting adoption of a sprinkler or drip irrigation 5 5 the adoption of drip or sprinkler irrigation was used as a single dependent variable since the adoption rate of both systems is relatively low in the study area about 7 of farmers used sprinkler systems and 8 used drip systems both systems require hight initial investment when implemented both systems may reduce irrigation water demand and both systems are subsidized by government so as to shift to higher value cultivation 46 in 2015 taking a value of 1 if the household adopted pressurized irrigation and value 0 if not x represents a set of all explanatory variables presented in table 2 and φ xβ is the cumulative distribution function to control for dependence of observations within the same community and to achieve a correct estimation of the standard errors observations are specified as being independent between communities but not within communities clustered robust standard errors at the commune level were used 53 54 our regression model was tested for multicollinearity using a variance inflation factor since the empirical model included several independent explanatory variables multicollinearity is a potential issue despite the fact that collinearity does not bias parameter estimates it can influence standard errors moreover the model becomes sensitive to changes in the sample size and to changes in the model structure 55 various recommendations regarding the value of the variance inflation factor and the level of tolerance have been proposed most commonly a value of ten as the maximum level of variance inflation factor and a value of 0 10 as the minimum level of tolerance has been recommended 55 all tested explanatory variables had variance inflation factor values within the range of 1 07 1 24 and the mean variance inflation factor was 1 14 which is below the threshold value of ten suggested by kleinbaum et al 56 indicating absence of multicollinearity an extended binary probit regression model was used to address potential endogeneity as our probit and iv probit model estimates would be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity we addressed this problem by use of estimations of regional fixed effects fe at the agro ecological zone level an χ2 test 57 fisher exact test 58 one way analysis of variance anova 59 kruskal wallis test 60 followed by a dunn test 61 were applied to determine if there is any difference in the use of pressurized irrigation between surveyed regions a fisher exact test was used whenever the expected frequency of cells was lower than five a kruskal wallis test 60 was used instead of the one way analysis of variance whenever the assumption of normality was not fulfilled 6 6 the assumption of normality was tested via a shapiro wilk 74 test and the assumption of homogeneity of variance was verified via a bartlett s test for equal variances 75 despite the fact that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was fulfilled the assumption of normality was not achieved therefore the kruskal wallis test 60 was used instead of one way analysis of variance 3 3 1 endogeneity empirical model specifications may suffer from endogeneity due to the presence of omitted variables sample selection bias measurement error and reverse causation 62 63 households receiving remittances may be basically different from households that do not receive them which we refer to as a selection bias for example households with remittances may likely be a previously poor household where a member migrated abroad to solve this situation reverse causality occurs when the poor wealth status together with a lack of farm machinery and infrastructure influences the migrant to remit more to improve the status of the household and increase farm production moreover households receiving remittances may be characterized by unobservable characteristics that could influence both remittance receipts and farm investment which we refer to as omitted variables the result would then either be overestimated or underestimated if remittances are sent to wealthy households which are not facing the challenge of a lack of farm assets then the result might be overestimated but if remittances are sent to compensate for the lack of farm machinery and assets the result may be underestimated an instrumental variables method was therefore applied to adequately address endogeneity previous studies focusing on the impact of labour migration and remittances on land use farm production farm labour and rural environment addressed the potential endogeneity issue by using an instrumental variable approach such as two stage least squares 64 65 three stage least squares 66 67 a probit model with continuous endogenous regressors 68 69 a tobit model with continuous endogenous regressors 70 71 or the instrumental variables fixed effect 72 in our research an extended probit regression model and instrumental variables regional fixed effect regression model were adopted the extended probit regression model fits all models including any combination of endogenous covariates and allowed us to use continuous as well as binary explanatory variables in the model 73 statistical analysis was carried out using the stata 16 statistical package 3 3 1 1 instrumental variables the historical migration rate 76 77 as well as socio economic conditions in destination areas 78 79 has commonly been used to predict receipt of remittances the historical migration rate serves as an indicator of the presence of migration networks established in destination countries enabling migrants to send a larger volume of remittances following böhme et al 12 and stöhr 80 we calculated the number of moldovan migrants going to each destination country relative to the total population at the district level from the 2004 census 39 to reflect the exclusion restriction of our instrument following the same authors we cross compared historical migration networks with the average gross domestic product per capita growth in the host countries between 2004 and 2014 which we adopted from the world bank 81 following böhme et al 12 our network growth interaction instrument was used in following form network growth interactioni i v j j m i g r a n t s 2004 i j p o p u l a t i o n 2004 i 2 t t t g d p j t 1 g d p j t g d p j t where iv is the instrumental variable t 2004 2014 are years j 1 j are all destination countries and i 1 i all sampled localities in the republic of moldova it is expected that higher average monthly income in migrant destination countries raises migrants disposable earnings and increases the likelihood and amount of remittances sent home 79 82 a five year 2009 2014 average of gross average monthly wage estimates at the state level used as a second instrument were obtained from the united nations economic commission for europe 83 first we examined whether instrumental variables were significantly correlated with remittance receipts the endogenous regressor to be calculated we found a strong correlation between the instruments and remittance receipts both instrumental variables were significant at 1 level of significance second we assessed the exogeneity of our instruments further as an informal check we estimated the accuracy of our model including all its regressors along with remittance receipts and the two instruments migration network and gross average monthly wage being used neither instrument appears to have had a significant direct impact on expenditures once we controlled for household remittance receipts results upon request as the adoption of an instrumental variable approach leads to a reduction in the sample it was not possible to consistently analyse territorial differences therefore territorial differences were captured using descriptive statistics because finding appropriate instruments is challenging we now report diagnostic tests of the validity and relevance of the chosen instruments instrument relevancy i e correlated with endogenous variables was tested using the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk lm test 84 under the null hypothesis that the instruments were not correlated with the endogenous variables the hansen j test 85 was used to test if instruments were not correlated with the error term and therefore were not overidentified the strength of the instrumental variables was examined in the first stage regression by testing the significance of the excluded variable s using an f test we report the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk wald f test instead of cragg donald based f statistic 87 because a clustered robust standard error was used under the null hypothesis that the instruments were only weakly correlated with the endogenous variables we ran an extended instrumental variables regression as diagnostic tests were calculated after ivreg2 in stata 86 3 3 2 sample description the characteristics of the surveyed small scale farmers are reported in table 2 a wilcoxon rank sum mann whitney 88 two sample t test 89 and pearson χ2 57 tests for categorical variables were applied to analyse differences between households receiving remittances and non receiving households the average age of the surveyed small scale farmers was 36 15 15 years mean sd with the youngest farmer being 18 years old and the oldest 75 years old this is in line with the population census from 2014 90 where the average age was 37 9 years 7 7 based on the agricultural census from 2011 94 average age of the household head was 53 1 despite that in the majority of cases the household head was interviewed in our survey whenever he she was absent the household member responsible for farming activities was included usually son or daughter of respondent as for educational attainment more than 41 of farmers were tertiary educated based on a household budget survey of 2016 91 17 6 reached higher educational level therefore more than more than twice as many farmers in the sample 41 than in the population 17 6 indicated having had higher education agriculture represented the main source of income for 30 of respondents which is consistent with a study of nbs of 2015 92 based on data from 2015 about 32 citizens were employed in agriculture hunting and forestry or fishing 93 on average 2 4 family members worked on the farm the land plots were often small and fragmented with an average area of 2 ha per farm 2 03 1 29 ha typically divided into two plots 2 07 1 84 which is consistent with previous studies from the republic of moldova 42 based on the agricultural census of 2011 94 the average area of land was 2 15 ha 8 8 including all types of agricultural holdings about 7 of farmers in our sample used sprinkler systems and 8 used drip systems based on our results farmers receiving remittances felt less likely to be constrained by a lack of access to credit and capital and less likely to be constrained by low soil fertility or productivity a higher proportion of households receiving remittances used pressurized irrigation households receiving remittances appeared to own larger farms and tended to be less fragmented however in our wilcoxon rank sum mann whitney results there were no significant differences in farm size holdings 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive analysis 4 1 1 migration and remittance patterns about half of the households in the study sample had experiences with international migration where one or more household members were working abroad see table 3 the most favoured destinations of migrants were russia 39 italy 27 romania 22 and ukraine 12 less than six percent of household members were fully involved in agricultural tasks before they migrated abroad migrant workers were involved mainly in the planting of crops 14 harvesting 14 preparation of land 12 weeding 11 animal feeding and care 10 and marketing of produce 9 before their departure abroad women were mostly responsible for planting weeding and harvesting and men were mostly responsible for preparation of land harvesting planting and animal feeding remittances were spent mostly on the payment of health and education expenses buying clothes food and electronics and on household construction and maintenance practices and vehicles see annex 2 investing remittances in material goods such as a house or car is a visible sign that a household member has migrated successfully and found a well paid job abroad despite the repeated occurrence of drought the level of irrigation was low based on discussions with local extension consultants from the national agency for rural development involved in data collection irrigation infrastructure requires high investment and maintenance costs which are unaffordable for the majority of farmers only 15 of farmers used drip or sprinkler pressurized irrigation based on the observations of the authors the majority of the surveyed farmers irrigated crops by hand and the rest of respondents did not irrigate the land at all drip or sprinkler irrigation was used mostly in vegetable production based on the results shown in table 3 the region with the lowest percentage of households with current migrants was the cantemir district where 31 of households had one or more members working abroad whereas the percentage of households with current migrants was higher in the orhei and soroca districts about 52 remittances were most often sent by migrants originating in the orhei district followed by the cantemir and soroca districts looking at the destination countries of the migrants in both the cantemir and soroca districts there was a higher prevalence of migrants working in the commonwealth of independent states whereas in orhei migrants were working almost equally in the european union and in the commonwealth of independent states a kruskal wallis test showed a difference between the regions in average land size p value 0 001 and number of land parcels owned p value 0 079 a multiple comparisons test dunn test showed differences in land size between the soroca and orhei districts 3 317 p 0 001 and between the orhei and cantemir districts 2 836 p value 0 007 but there were no differences between the soroca and cantemir districts 0 245 p value 1 000 focusing on the number of parcels a multiple comparisons test showed differences only between the soroca and orhei districts 2 380 p value 0 026 but there were no differences between the soroca and cantemir districts 1 175 p value 0 360 or between the orhei and cantemir districts 1 031 p value 0 454 4 2 determinants on the use of pressurized irrigation we conducted a robustness check of our analysis first a binary probit model was used to determine factors influencing the adoption of pressurized irrigation the results are shown in table 4 column 1 shows the results of a probit model that includes only household head characteristics columns 2 3 4 5 includes the results of estimating the model controlling for household economic characteristics farm level and institutional characteristics respectively finally in column 6 we present the results for estimating a model with the full set of controls to control for dependence of observations within the same community and to achieve a correct estimation of the standard errors a clustered robust standard errors calculation at the commune level was used in all models second we ran an additional binary probit model where we separated out the dependent variable drip and sprinkler irrigation adoption the coefficients and marginal effects of this binary probit estimation are reported in table 5 column 7 shows the estimated coefficients and standard errors for the adoption of drip irrigation and column 8 shows the results for sprinkler irrigation adoption third we used an extended binary probit regression model to address potential endogeneity of the treatment variable because finding appropriate instruments is challenging we also report diagnostic tests of the validity and relevance of the chosen instruments instrument relevancy i e correlated with the endogenous variables is tested using a kleibergen and paap 2006 rk lm test under the null supposition that the instruments are not correlated with the endogenous variables the cragg donald kleibergen paap f statistic indicates that the instruments are significantly correlated with the endogenous regressors 6 796 p value 0 033 and thus not weak the probability value for a hansen j test shows that the instruments are not correlated with the error term and therefore are not over identified 1 281 p value 0 258 the strength of the instrumental variables is examined in a first stage regression by testing the significance of the excluded variable s using an f test we report using the kleibergen and paap 2006 rk wald f test instead of a cragg donald based f statistic because a clustered robust standard error was used under the null hypothesis that the instruments are only weakly correlated with the endogenous variables the kleibergen paap walk rk f statistic mostly exceeds at 70 809 the critical value of 10 for weak instruments proposed by stock and yogo 2002 95 overall our results suggest that the instruments used in the model are valid and reliable the results of our extended binary probit regression model are included in table 6 column 9 the error correlation corr e remittance e dependent variable is an estimate of the correlation between the errors from the main and auxilary equations the null hypothesis states that there is no endogeneity the estimates were not significant at a 1 level so we cannot reject the null hypothesis and remittances can be treated as exogenous both instrumental variables were correlated with the endogenous covariates but they were not directly related to the outcome variable fourth since our probit and iv probit model estimates would be biased and inconsistent in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity various biotic and abiotic factors we addressed this problem by controlling for regional fixed effect using fixed effects fe estimations at the regional agro ecological zone level column 10 show the estimated coefficients and standard errors of regional fixed effect regression while column 11 show a results model combining regional fixed effects with an iv strategy the results showed reasonable explanatory power with the percentage of overall correct predictions ranging from 85 04 column 1 to 93 16 in the case of the adoption of sprinkler irrigation column 8 moreover the coefficient estimates of a majority of the control variables have consistent signs with acceptable differences in magnitudes between the models indicating the robustness of these estimates the results show that remittances facilitate the adoption of pressurized irrigation the signs of the coefficients were consistent and remain significant at the 1 level in all models except for the results of the model combining a regional fixed effects with the iv strategy where the coefficient of the remittance variable was significant at the 5 level farmers with tertiary education are more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation compared to less educated farmers the signs of the coefficients were consistent and remain significant at the 1 level in all models except for the results model combining a regional fixed effects with the iv strategy where the coefficient of the education variable was significant at the 5 level and in the model where the adoption of a sprinkler irrigation system was separated from the adoption of drip irrigation where the coefficient was significant at the 10 level the age of household head did not have an effect on the adoption of farm assets the coefficient of age of hh head remained insignificant in all models 4 2 1 household characteristics our results revealed that availability of household labour is a statistically significant factor affecting the adoption only in models where we accounted for endogeneity e g models shown in column 9 and column 11 ownership of larger landholdings reflecting the wealth of the farmers has a positive effect on the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems however the coefficient of land size was significant only in models not accounting for endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity when we accounted for unobserved biotic and abiotic factors the coefficient was no longer significant unexpectedly the number of plots or land parcels significantly increases the likelihood of the utilization of irrigation facilities however a higher number of plots may reflect the wealth of the farmer indicating that larger richer farmers conducting more intensive agricultural production can afford to invest in pressurized irrigation infrastructure an individual farm in the study sample cultivates on average an area of about 2 ha typically distributed between two or three plots see table 2 irrigation can always be applied only on one specific plot devoted to vegetable production while the rest of the plots are irrigated manually the coefficient of the number of land parcels was no longer significant when we accounted for unobserved heterogeneity using a regional fixed effect regression model biotic and abiotic factors being specific to the agro ecological zone moreover the number of plots significantly increases the likelihood of the utilization of sprinkler irrigation but not drip irrigation cropping patterns are crucial in the adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies as water requirements are highly crop specific farmers managing vegetable production were more likely to adopt pressurized irrigation in our study vegetables such as tomatoes potatoes peppers watermelons cabbages and cucumbers were mostly irrigated see table 3 however the coefficient of cultivation was no longer significant when we ran the model for sprinkler irrigation 4 2 2 institutional characteristics the results of our models revealed that neither access to extension services nor perception of credit constraints affecting agricultural production by local farmers influenced the utilization of pressurized irrigation statistically significantly the coefficients remain unsignificant in all models our questionnaire provides only limited information regarding the use of extension services as the quality of the information provided to the farmer skills of the extension provider as well as the frequency of contact with the extension agency is not included in our survey therefore the quality of the service probably matters more than simple access to an extension provider 4 2 3 environmental characteristics when farmers in our study perceived that their production was affected by severe drought during the previous year they were more likely to use pressurized irrigation the signs of the coefficients were consistent in all models 5 conclusion and discussion drought increasing water scarcity and inefficient use of irrigation water are one of the main limiting factors affecting crop production in many parts of the world therefore effective management of water resources and the adoption of efficient irrigation systems provide important buffers against increasing climate variability and are becoming a priority for local policy makers despite all the positive effects of pressurized irrigation technology its wide use in the field among small farmers is still limited also in the republic of moldova our study area particularly due to the high initial investment and maintenance costs of these irrigation systems our results showed that only 15 of small farmers cultivating up to 10 ha land used drip or sprinkler irrigation in the republic of moldova drip or sprinkler irrigation was used mostly in vegetable production where high economic returns were expected this result showed that the potential for pressurized irrigation in climate risk mitigation and in increasing production among small farmers is not exhausted this study s particular contribution is that it deals with the question why this is the case it provides insights into factors and drivers of the adoption of pressurized irrigation systems and serves as the basis for policy interventions in the surveyed area where sustainable water management is required the results show that remittances facilitate the adoption of irrigation infrastructure in our study area this finding is consistent with the findings of piras et al 96 who conducted their study among 126 smallholders from 37 villages in moldova in 2015 and also with several other studies from mozambique mexico and laos which found that remittances facilitate investment in water pumps and irrigation infrastructure in general 11 13 a sufficient amount of remittances allows poor small scale farmers to make small investments without accessing farm credit piras et al 96 at the same time remittances allow a relaxation of credit constraints 97 98 which enables smallholders to overcome the high investment costs of irrigation facilities and the rising cost of energy supply for the pumps small scale farmers in moldova are very risk averse when dealing with credit and they are unwilling to expand their farm activities if they are required to use their land as collateral and therefore they prefer to use remittances to intensify farm production without relying on corporate farm structures for input supply instead 96 therefore remittances could provide an effective starting point for policy makers co funding of remittance financed projects could be one way to stimulate investments in modern technology and improve the efficiency of the provided grants 99 as the lack of finance access in the area hinders the adoption and use of pressurized systems complementary policy measures are needed to expand areas under drip and sprinkler systems and to shift to higher value production policy makers should come up with plans to reduce any adaptation costs both financially as well as in terms of time and effort and should deploy effort to reduce entry barriers facilitate and broaden the access to pressurized irrigation technology as well as eliminate credit constraints making the initial investment affordable for the majority of small scale farmers this requires a targeted and well managed expansion of subsidy schemes for small scale private irrigation systems farmers should be supported at the national as well as at local levels through investments to facilitate access to finance and scale up subsidies for on farm investments moreover as mentioned by piras et al 99 a supportive business environment should be created to support local investment policy makers should pay attention especially to removing obstacles posed by systematic corruption and the absence of a system of farm insurance which may be preventing small scale farmers from investing in agriculture our results suggest that more educated small scale farmers have a greater ability to understand and adapt to climate change by using pressurized irrigation facilities they have a higher awareness of the benefits and negatives of applying technology and at the same time they have a greater ability to seek important information and obtain support from the government and non governmental organizations 100 101 this finding is in line with adoption literature which states that a positive relationship exists between human capital and decisions to adopt new technology 102 103 confirms the fact that pressurized irrigation technologies require special technical and managerial skills for their proper utilization 20 to encourage adoption and use of pressurized systems and reduce uncertainty about the advantages of pressurized irrigation special training programmes and trials providing the small scale farmers an opportunity to gain the information and skills needed to maintain irrigation system should be put in place as suggested in a study by yang et al 104 indoor courses where farmers can learn about the risks and uncertainties of applied technology as well as about their economic viability e g costs and benefits and thus allowing small scale farmers to increase their familiarity with recommended new technology should be organized in combination with field trials field instruction can enable farmers to understand in depth the correct operation and economic benefits of the technology both training and trials can provide an opportunity for farmers to learn from each other sharing their experiences and may speed up direct communication between them however knowledge of pressurized irrigation technology does not guarantee actual adoption unless these technologies are made accessible to the small scale farmers through devising an institutional support system results show that age of a household head has no influence on the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation suggesting that there is no generation gap in the adoption of irrigation facilities this is consistent with a majority of studies which found no significant effect of age on the use of irrigation facilities 15 105 we found that farm characteristics such as farm size fragmentation and cropping patterns play a significant role in the adoption of irrigation infrastructure until we accounted for unobserved heterogeneity by using a regional fixed effect regression model biotic and abiotic factors specific to the agro ecological zone therefore policy makers and development organizations should consider the different characteristics of the agro ecological zones when implementing measures to increase the diffusion of this technology and thus the adaptation of smallholder farmers to climate risks further results show that the use of extension services has no effect on irrigation adoption thus the possible role of extension services does not seem to be fully exploited as yet further research would be needed to understand where the user of irrigation technology gets information about pressurized irrigation systems and which information channels increase the adoption of irrigation among small farmers in moldova when farmers in our study perceived that their production was affected by severe drought during the previous year they were more likely to use pressurized irrigation as was found by udmale et al 28 based on the perception of drought impact severity farmers used various adaptation measures to mitigate drought impacts one of these measures included using improved irrigation practices since pressurized irrigation technologies can maintain crop yield with lower water application rates reducing production risks during water shortage and drought periods they may use these irrigation systems to deal with perceived drought to increase their production similarly a study by anik et al 106 pointed out that farmers located in areas severely affected by climate change are more proactive in undertaking adaptation strategies than their counterparts located in less affected areas and a study by li et al 107 found significant differences between farmers with and without disaster experience in their perceptions of climate change and technical adaptive strategies therefore educational institutions should raise farmers awareness of the probability of repeated drought occurrences and highlight their negative effects on farm productivity and offer possible responses to these as mentioned by zobeidi et al 108 visits of small scale farmers to other farmers in drought affected areas are critical to increasing their risk perception when interpreting the results we need to have in mind several limitations of this study especially that the questionnaire used in our study did not include information about the amount of transfers which members of households working abroad sent to their relatives as information about the amount of received remittances is perceived as a sensitive question by the majority of farmers and therefore including it could have reduced farmers willingness to answer moreover the questionnaire used in our study did not include information about water prices paid by farmers funding this work was supported by the internal grant agency of the faculty of tropical agrisciences

8661,we study urban water tariff setting and its welfare implications with a unique panel of chinese cities in the 2000s first we find that peer cities water tariff levels have a significant influence on a city s choice of tariffs using the peer cities average tariffs as instrumental variables in estimating water demand functions we obtain price elasticities around 0 41 for both residential and industrial sectors our estimation of cost functions reveals the supply of urban water services to be characterized by strong economies of scale and economies of scope more than half of the sample have residential water tariffs higher than the corresponding marginal costs while the share increases to 71 for industrial sector the deadweight loss calculated under first best pricing suggests moderate welfare loss due to prices deviating from marginal costs keywords deadweight loss multiproduct cost function water demand water tariff jel classification l95 q21 q25 q28 1 introduction rapid urbanization is a feature as well as driver of economic development in many developing countries managing urbanization well requires not only enormous investment in urban infrastructure such as roads water supply network and wastewater treatment facilities but also sound management of natural resources and the environment water is one of such key resources especially in countries like china and india where available water per capita is low and agricultural production still accounts for a large share of water consumption 1 given water as essential to life and the market structure of urban water supply water tariffs are rarely set by pure market forces instead urban water tariff is closely regulated as an important policy instrument to balance demand and supply and achieve water conservation to support its fast growth in urban population increasing from 17 9 of total population in 1978 to 58 5 in 2017 china has invested enormously in building urban infrastructure for instance china reached a stock of 382 000 km of roads and 757 000 km of water supply pipes in urban areas by 2016 up from 160 000 km to 255 000 km in 2000 respectively 2 and 2001 these statistics reveal that a city usually has much longer water supply pipes underneath the roads than the roads themselves thus rehabilitating or expanding an urban water supply system requires a substantial amount of capital investment besides domestic sources of funding which include regular fiscal budget and revenues from government bonds or land sale developing countries have increasingly relied on external funding sources such as bilateral and multilateral donors 1 1 for example urban water supply accounts for about 20 of world bank s portfolio http www worldbank org en topic watersupply 2 and private investors to finance rehabilitation or expansion of their urban water systems galiani gertler and schargrodsky 2005 3 when these external investors participate in developing the water supply market they pay considerable attention to water tariffs to ensure that the projects they support are financially sustainable and improves water use efficiency donors often ask local governments to raise water tariffs private investors also prefer higher water tariffs which largely determine the rate of return on their investment however as in many other developing countries proposals to increase water tariffs often meet resistance from the government and public in china according to china s price law water tariffs should be set by the government and public hearings must be convened in the process of setting new tariffs 2 2 article 18 of the price law of the people s republic of china 1997 states that the government shall issue government set or guided prices for merchandise and services if they are i of great importance to economic development and people s livelihood ii resources in short supply iii monopolized in supply in nature iv important public utilities and or v important services of public welfare in nature article 23 states that public hearings should be organized by the price bureau of the government to solicit views from consumers business operators and other quarters to explore the necessity and feasibility of price adjustment it seems understandable that the public do not favor water tariff increase in general given that water is essential to life and the operation of many water utilities lacks transparency in the presence of pervasive negative feedback from the public the local government tends to reject or postpone increases in water tariffs or even turn down a proposal before a public hearing if negative feedback is expected there could be several reasons for the tendency of local governments to weigh the public s views more than the interest of the water utilities and their investors first water tariffs influence almost everyone relying on public water supply an increase in water tariff against the public may backfire and cause difficulties for decision makers second when the external investors are on board and a new city administration is in charge keeping low tariffs to maintain political stability will often weigh more in the decision making of the new government officials third the revenue deficit due to sluggish water tariffs is unlikely to account for a large portion of a local government s budget the government could subsidize the utility to cover the gap without engaging the public in an intense discussion however utilities also have incentive to propose faster tariff increases in presence of information asymmetry one may not conclude that it is economically inefficient by observing that local governments tend to reject or slow the pace of water tariff increase to assess whether the prevailing water tariffs are set properly it is necessary to understand the key driving factors in the setting of water tariffs and measure the welfare consequence based on the supply and demand of water services in this study we empirically analyze these issues with a comprehensive panel dataset containing information on the quantity of water supply consumption and tariffs for over 200 chinese cities in the 2000s we begin with an examination of the evolution of urban water tariffs over time for both residential and industrial sectors next we investigate how city level factors including population climate economic characteristics and peer cities tariffs affect a city s residential and industrial water tariff levels third we estimate water demand functions for residential and industrial users tackling the endogeneity of water tariffs with instrumental variables we also estimate a translog cost function of water supply whereby marginal cost functions are derived for residential and industrial sectors respectively combining estimated water demand and marginal cost functions we measure the potential welfare loss due to deviations of water tariffs from marginal costs below we highlight the main findings that we consider relevant and novel in the literature first in panel model specifications controlling for city fixed effects and year fixed effects or provincial time trends a city s water tariff level is highly correlated with its peer cities average water tariff where peer cities are those neighboring cities from the same province an alternative spatial autoregressive estimation lends further support to this finding which holds true for both residential and industrial water tariffs in the public economics literature there is a strand of studies regarding strategic interactions in fiscal policies and environmental and labor regulations among national or sub national governments for instance recent empirical studies document strong spatial correlations in tax rates for local property tax and income tax within countries 4 6 in stringency of environmental policies among states of the us 7 and in labor standards setting and enforcement across countries 8 in the context of china there is evidence that city level governments are engaged in strategic interactions with respect to undertaking investment to boost local economy 9 and enforcing safety regulations on coal mining 10 our finding extends this literature to the interactions among local governments in regulating water supply industry second building on this result we use peer cities average tariff as an instrumental variable iv hereafter to estimate water demand functions a naïve ols estimation shows that price elasticity of water demand is economically and statistically insignificant and even positive in some cases this may be because water tariffs are set endogenously for example the government of a growing city may adopt a higher tariff to rein in increasing demand for water with a constant elasticity specification the iv estimation implies that the price elasticity of water demand is around 0 41 for both residential and industrial use which is statistically significant for the former these estimates fall in the range of estimated elasticities found in the literature see surveys in refs 11 13 and confirm the endogeneity of water tariff setting third we consider water utilities servicing users from different sectors as multiproduct firms by estimating a translog multiproduct cost function we show that urban water supply is clearly characterized by both economies of scale and scope with majority of sample city years on the downward sloping part of the marginal cost curves last but not least overlaying the demand and supply functions we find that more than half of the sample city years have residential water tariffs higher than the corresponding marginal costs while the share increases to 71 for industrial sector this result counters the conventional wisdom that water tariffs are generally set too low in china 3 3 see articles at https www economist com asia 2010 01 07 bottling it and https piie com blogs china economic watch economics h2o water price reforms china for example our estimation of deadweight loss under the first best pricing rule suggests that the social welfare loss due to water tariffs deviating from the marginal price is moderate 4 4 first best pricing in this study refers to charging a volumetric price at marginal cost as well as a fix cost to achieve full cost recovery to the best of our knowledge closest to our paper is a recent study by davis and muehlegger 14 which examines whether prices exceed marginal costs in the natural gas distribution market and associated welfare loss at state level in the u s extra efforts are taken to address the endogeneity of water tariff in estimating the water demand elasticity the key message from our study is that both demand and supply information needs to be taken into account in the dynamic process of setting proper tariff levels the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides background information on water tariff setting in china section 3 describes the data used in the study empirical analysis regarding urban water tariff setting is presented in section 4 sections 5 and 6 estimate water demand and supply functions respectively section 7 estimates welfare loss under first best pricing and section 8 concludes 2 background urban water tariff here refers to the volumetric price often in the unit of cny per cubic meter charged by the water utility on consumers who obtain water from the urban water supply network operated by the utility charging water tariffs can be traced back to 1985 in china when the government started to require that water supply acquired through any hydraulic works should be paid 5 5 state council s no 94 policy paper administrative decree on accounting collecting and managing the raw water charges of hydraulic works in 1994 the government issued prc ordinance on urban water supply detailing the water supply pricing scheme such as the consumer categories the tariff structure and formula and the administrative procedure of setting tariffs the objective was to have water supply costs fully covered by tariff revenues further the prc water law enacted in 1998 proposed to charge a water resource fee to protect water resources and improve water use efficiency 15 usually the water utility pays the hydraulic work charge and water resource fee when it obtains water from the sources and counts them as part of its water supply cost until late 2000s most chinese cities applied a flat tariff rate without connection or fixed fee 16 the urban water tariff is primarily set by the prefecture government and is supposed to cover the cost of supplying water taxes and a reasonable amount of profit for the water utility the water supply cost covers the costs for water acquisition production transmission and distribution and other related costs the water utility is responsible for collecting water tariffs which constitutes the major revenue for the utility in a separate process the prefecture government also sets the level of wastewater treatment fee the water utility collects the wastewater treatment fees together with water tariffs and transfers the former to the sewage company the prc price law passed in 1998 provides the provision that public hearing system must be established in setting prices for public utilities services in public interest and goods with natural monopoly nature by the government following this legislation the central government issued a few decrees to introduce public hearings on price setting by governments including setting of urban water tariffs 6 6 there are implementation of public hearing for government to set prices 2002 and rule of conduct of government to set prices 2006 among others public hearings on water tariffs which have been largely focused on residential water tariffs have received considerable media and public attention since the policy implementation the proposal for a new higher water tariff is generally initiated by the water utility in order to cover its investment and or increased costs in response relevant government agencies such as the planning agency water affairs department and or price bureau will conduct consultation and assessment regarding the reasonability and impacts of the tariff increase the government will proceed to call a public hearing unless it decides to reject the proposal outright resident delegates are selected to participate in the public hearing and vote on the proposal at the end of the hearing from the above description we can see that the decision process on water tariff setting primarily involves the water utility government and water users each party has relatively clear roles to play in the process however people argue that the process is largely controlled by the local government for several reasons first the majority of water utilities are owned by the government despite a movement in early 1990s toward private sector participation in urban water services in china 3 second the prefectural government could reject the tariff adjustment proposal directly without convening a public hearing third it is shown that governments have definitive control on the size and composition of the delegation as well as ways the delegates are selected to participate in the hearings in a few cases studied by zhong and mol 18 the majority of delegates were government employees or from institutions affiliated with the government independent citizens only accounted for a small minority in the delegation thus it is not surprising to see that most proposals for water tariff increase submitted for public hearings were approved however it is noteworthy that the public hearing is not always a token activity there are quite a few cases wherein the public rejected the price increase proposals or got the proposals revised 18 3 data the data used for this study is a combination of several city level datasets covering more than 200 prefecture level cities from 2000 to 2012 7 7 the number of cities varies slightly across analyses due to missing data issue while different variables are used in different regressions first we digitized the annual statistics of urban water supply of years 2000 2007 in which the reporting utilities provide detailed information on their water supply services including total water supplied water sold disaggregated by user sectors total and groundwater supply capacity cost per ton of water supplied number of employees total wage bill length of water intake and supply pipes number of meters as well as water tariffs for different sectors the post 2006 tariff data are collected from the china water net which publicizes monthly city water tariffs 8 8 see price h2o china com we validated the data by checking available government documents regarding water tariff adjustments the annual tariffs are average of the monthly tariffs in case tariffs changed within the year we obtained city level characteristics such as population area gdp and its sectoral composition and fiscal performance from the chinese city statistical yearbooks as the second subnational administrative level immediately below province a prefecture is often referred to as city in china it actually comprises an urban center and suburban or rural areas surrounding the center the yearbooks contain separate statistics for the urban center as well as for the whole prefecture because water tariffs set by the prefecture government primarily relate to urban utilities supplying water to the urban centers we used data of the urban center in the yearbooks in our analysis 9 9 there are county or town level utilities supplying water to sub urban or rural areas they are generally smaller and not included in our sample we obtained yearly weather data from the data center of the chinese meteorological bureau 10 10 accessed through data cma cn the dataset contains weather measurements collected by about 840 weather stations distributed across the country we mapped them to the cities where the stations are located and took the average of rainfall and maximum minimum of the maximum minimum temperature across stations if multiple stations are found in the same city finally to obtain a precise measure of water tariffs in real terms we meticulously collected city level cpi from provincial statistical yearbooks real tariffs are computed in cny with the base year 2000 table 1 presents the summary statistics of the above variables except water tariffs data reported by water utilities are available for 2000 to 2007 some variables are missing for 2000 while other city level data are available for 2000 to 2011 12 averaged across cities and years total annual water supply is 83 8 million cubic meters and water sold is 66 4 million the ratio of the two amounting to 79 2 could be considered as the approximate rate of revenue water residential users account for nearly half of the total water sold while industrial users account for about 28 other sectors including commercial administrative and special users consume less than one quarter of water therefore this study focuses on residential and industrial sectors 11 11 this is also because many cities did not report water sold to other sectors on average the supply capacity from ground water accounts for 28 of the total capacity while this share varies from 0 to 100 across cities the unit cost of water supply ranges from cny 0 22 to 6 10 per ton with an average of cny 1 35 12 12 the exchange rate between us dollar to chinese yuan decreased from about cny 8 3 to cny 6 3 per dollar between 2000 and 2012 applying a rate of 7 0 the dollar equivalent average unit cost is about 20 cents the cost levels will be compared to the water tariffs we collected next for the rest of the water utility and urban variables we note the dramatic gaps across city years for instance binzhou a small eastern city had only 760 m in 2002 while tianjin one of the four directly governed municipalities had over 2 2 million meters in 2007 in terms of income level the real gdp per capita in constant 2000 price was only cny 1236 in the urban chaoyang a northeastern city in 2002 in contrast zhenjiang located in the affluent yangtze river delta area had a per capita gdp of cny 221 000 equivalent to usd 26 600 by 2012 table 2 reports nominal and real water tariffs for residential and industrial users respectively we divide the sample into two time periods i e 2000 2006 and 2007 2012 as the data come from two different sources and there is a slight discrepancy between them discussed below the average nominal residential water tariffs are cny 1 27 per ton for 2000 2006 and cny 1 60 for 2007 2012 industrial water tariffs are higher at cny 1 66 and 2 21 respectively the real tariffs in 2000 price are slightly lower than the nominal tariffs this is not surprising given that inflation rates have been moderate during the period fig 1 shows the time trends of national average tariffs for residential and industrial users in nominal and real terms the trajectories of average tariffs within each subperiod appear smooth and generally increase despite a downward break between 2006 and 2007 we use year fixed effects in the following regression analyses to control for this data discrepancy arising from different data sources a few patterns are noteworthy regarding the dynamics of tariff setting first the growth rates of nominal tariffs are relatively high registering around 8 for both sectors before 2007 and drop to 3 5 for residential and 5 1 for industrial sectors after 2007 one plausible explanation is that local governments concerned with adverse effects of the global financial crisis slowed down the tariff increase to help cope with possible economic hardship second the growing patterns of real tariffs followed those of nominal tariffs closely before 2007 removing inflation factors the tariffs have increased at 6 6 and 7 3 per annum on average for residential and industrial sectors respectively however real tariffs largely stayed unchanged between 2007 and 2012 finally while industrial tariffs are higher than residential tariffs trends of both appear to be parallel table 3 compares the nominal tariffs and utility reported average water supply costs by year the tariffs are averaged across residential and industrial sectors with the amount of water provided to each sector as weights it shows that by 2003 utilities that had sufficient revenues to cover costs outnumbered cities running deficits the situation was slightly reversed in 2004 and 2006 and largely in 2007 note however that the numbers of deficit cases are possibly over estimated since due to lack of quantity data the average weighted tariffs do not yet incorporate tariffs for commercial administrative and special sectors which are commonly higher than the residential tariffs in sum the comparison suggests that cases where water tariffs are below water supply costs are far from ubiquitous across the country 4 urban water tariff setting we estimate a set of regression models to understand the factors that may influence water tariff setting at the city level to the extent that the local government plays a dominant role in the whole process our results primarily reveal the factors that government officials have considered in setting new water tariffs the baseline equation is 1 ln p i t α 0 α 1 ln j i σ j i p j t x i t β γ i δ p t ε i t where p i t p j t is the real water tariff of city i j in year t σ j i 1 n i if city j is one of the ni cities from the same province and neighboring city i and 0 otherwise x i t is a vector of time varying city characteristics that are probably exogenous and could affect the level of water tariff γ i is the city fixed effect and δ p t represents the province specific trend in setting water tariffs the city characteristics we are interested in include total population log population density log agricultural and industrial shares of gdp real gdp per capita fiscal deficit as a share of revenue five year moving averages of precipitation log and maximum temperature and minimum temperature total population proxies for demand for water and would be positively correlated with water price ceteris paribus on the other hand larger population suggests scale of economy and thus lowers the cost of water supply higher population density means lower unit cost of serving individual water users agriculture remains a water intensive sector in china to ensure sufficient water is allocated to agricultural production the prefectural government may have to increase water tariffs to depress residential and industrial use gdp per capita is expected to be positively correlated with water tariff as higher income level implies more willingness to pay for water services as well as greater water demand leading to government adopting higher tariffs it is likely for a local government to cut the subsidy to water utilities and raise water tariffs when it runs into a serious deficit continuous significant rainfall and low temperature tend to keep the demand for water at a relatively low level while high temperature does the opposite thus these weather related factors may have been considered in tariffs setting in order to balance the water supply and demand besides these conventional factors we introduce a new explanatory variable namely the average real tariffs of peer cities within china s administrative hierarchy system there is considerable horizontal competition at each level e g ref 19 city officials will compete and be evaluated by the provincial government against officials of other cities in the same province therefore strong incentives exist for a city to learn from or mimic its competitors moreover some provinces are large and spatially diverse hence we define peer cities as those from the same province and neighboring the primary city conceptually a city government could be affected by its peers in choosing water tariff levels for different reasons while government officials and the public are involved in the price setting process they do not observe the true costs of supplying water by the utility to reduce this information asymmetry decision makers may take into account the fact that water service costs should be similar across neighboring cities that share common natural and economic conditions hence a new tariff significantly higher than those peer cities tariffs is likely to be viewed as an indication of inefficiency in the local utility s operation and get rejected this is referred to as yardstick competition in the tax setting literature e g ref 20 the influence of peer cities may also arise from a different type of competition whereby cities lower their water tariffs to attract water intensive industries we consider this second explanation less likely since producers using large amount of water as their inputs often extract water independently and are subject to separate pricing policies neither does the argument seem to apply to residential water tariffs as a tiebout model would suggest since water expenditure accounts for a fairly small portion of living costs in china people are very unlikely to move between cities because of water tariffs 13 13 the tax setting literature offers a third explanation for the inter jurisdiction peer effects expenditure spillovers this however does not seem to be relevant to water tariff setting eq 1 can be seen as a panel version of the endogenous social effects model according to manski 21 identification problem also referred to as reflection problem would arise if mean of city characteristics x across peer cities and determinants of peer cities are linearly dependent however this is unlikely the case given that our peer cities are defined by geographic proximity and administrative jurisdiction instead of any city characteristics in eq 1 in addition lee 22 demonstrates that the endogenous effects are identifiable in a spatial autoregressive setting wherein the peer group sizes are small and not constant in our case the number of peer cities each city has varies between 1 and 7 with mean equal to 3 8 lee and yu 23 further develop estimator for spatial autoregressive panel models which stata adopts to estimate such models in view of the above we estimate three different specifications in addition to the baseline model of eq 1 first we add one year lag real water tariff in log to account for the likely practice that the decision to adjust water tariffs are partly associated with existing tariff levels second we also substitute year fixed effects for the province specific time trend to control for common time effects as well as the fact that the tariff data come from two sources covering different periods lastly we estimate a spatial autoregressive panel model ln p i t α 1 w i n ln p t x i t β γ i ε i t where ln p t ln p i t i 1 n is the n 1 vector of observation of year t and w i n is a specified 1 n weighting vector with component equal to 1 for a city that is neighboring and in the same province with city i and zero otherwise columns 1 to 4 of table 4 presents estimation results for residential water tariffs first of all the tariffs of peer cities exhibit a strong positive impact on the primary city s tariff with a statistical significance at the 1 level the baseline estimate suggests that a 10 increase in the average tariff of neighboring cities from the same province leads to a 5 2 increase in a city s tariff level the elasticity drops to around 0 28 but remains statistically significant when we control for the lagged tariff of the primary city column 3 shows that replacing the interaction of province dummy and time trend with year fixed effects has no effect on the estimate of α 1 it is reassuring to see that the spatial autoregressive estimation yields same coefficient estimate for peer cities in column 4 this suggests that the linear endogenous social effects model described in eq 1 is not subject to serious identification issue most coefficients of city characteristics have the expected signs and are generally stable across different specifications though only a few of them are statistically significant contrary to expectation gdp per capita has a negative coefficient estimate and statistically significant in the two way fixed effects specification and spatial autoregressive model although the magnitude is small i e 10 increase in per capita gdp resulting in about 0 3 decrease in residential water tariffs one possible explanation is that holding other factors constant more economically advanced cities can supply water more efficiently e g less non revenue water and thus entail lower service cost the current tariff level is closely related to the one year lag of tariff the elasticity is estimated between 0 47 and 0 58 with statistical significance indicating a convergence trend of tariff levels across cities coefficients of other explanatory variables are not precisely estimated population and population density are negatively correlated with water tariffs suggesting that tariff setting takes into account the lower costs of serving water to a larger population and to a population located more closely a higher share of output in agriculture is associated with higher water tariffs and the estimates are much greater than those for industrial output share this implies that agriculture plays a significant role in local water allocation and water tariff may have been used to allocate more water to agricultural sector from urban use cities with high fiscal deficit tend to have high water tariffs since the governments are less capable of subsidizing water services correlations between weather variables i e temperature and rainfall and tariff levels are not strong this may be because many cities have water infrastructure like reservoirs to stabilize water supply so that local precipitation or temperature has little effects on the cost of water supply 14 14 thanks to one referee for offering this plausible explanation again these interpretations are rather tentative since the estimates lack statistical significance columns 5 to 8 present the regression estimates for real industrial water tariffs the estimated elasticities of city s own tariff with respect to the average industrial tariff of peer cities range from 0 18 to 0 33 in the first three linear specifications which are all statistically significant at the 1 level and slightly smaller than the corresponding estimates of residential tariffs the spatial autoregressive model is estimated with α 1 equal to 0 28 which is close to the estimate from linear specification with city and year fixed effects hence similar to the case of residential tariffs the peer cities industrial water tariffs play a prominent role in a city s decision on setting its own tariff for industrial water use the coefficient estimates for other city characteristics bear similar patterns as those for residential water tariffs for instance the lagged industrial tariff also has a notable influence in setting current industrial tariff with elasticity almost the same as that for residential tariff however the coefficients of urban gdp per capita become smaller and statistically insignificant in setting industrial tariffs 15 15 we estimate similar models with nominal water tariffs as dependent variables and the relevant regressors peer tariff lagged own tariff and urban gdp per capita in nominal term inflation rate is included as a possible factor in setting nominal tariff levels the results presented in appendix table 1 are broadly consistent with the real tariff models 5 water demand estimation in this section we estimate water demand functions with city level data on water consumption and tariffs while it is more common in the literature to estimate residential water demand functions with household data the two approaches answer different questions and complement each other for local government planning and managing water resources it is not sufficient to have an average estimate of household price elasticity of water demand in the presence of considerable heterogeneity across households moreover it is rare to have firm level water use data to estimate water demand by industrial users city level estimation is better positioned to answer the question of how aggregate water demand would respond to a price change as well as changes in other factors such as average income and economic structure what we do here is closer to the few studies that use city community level data to estimate residential water demand elasticities such as bell and griffin 24 25 diakite semenov and thomas 26 renzetti 27 and timmins 28 however it is worth highlighting a few distinctive features of our work first we use a large sample of cities from a developing country while the existing studies except diakite semenov and thomas 26 focus on developed countries mainly usa and canada residential water consumption patterns in china could be distinct from these countries second we also estimate industrial water demand elasticities across cities which is not common in the literature third we address the endogeneity of water tariffs in the demand models by instrumenting a city s own water tariff with its peer cities average tariff 5 1 empirical strategy we estimate a log log demand function for both residential and industrial sectors the baseline specification is 2 ln y i t α 0 β 1 ln p i t x i t φ γ i δ p t ω i t where y i t is total water consumption by residential or industrial sector of city i in year t p i t is the real water tariff for residential or industrial sector 16 16 in china the price of water paid by consumers should be the sum of water tariff and the rate of sewage charge as sewage fee is collected in the same bill of water tariff unfortunately we do not have data on sewage rates before 2007 the post 2007 data suggest that sewage rates are relatively low as compared to the water tariffs and have been adjusted infrequently to the extent that the sewage rates are considered as a small constant added to the water tariffs before 2007 a change in tariff could represent the marginal change in the total water price thus our estimates with tariff only should not be considerably biased alternatively we impute the sewage rates before 2007 based on linear projections for each city and add them to the water tariffs the resulting estimation confirms the general patterns of the estimates with tariffs only i e larger negative elasticity by iv estimation but the estimates for the industrial sector are subject to weak iv problem these estimates are available from authors upon request x i t is a vector of time varying urban factors that may affect water consumption exogenously including population population density agricultural and industrial shares of gdp real gdp per capita contemporary rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature of the year γ i is the city fixed effect and δ p t represents the province specific trends in water consumption the primary parameter of interest is β 1 which presumably negative measures the price elasticity of water demand however the ols estimation of eq 2 is likely to yield a biased estimate of the elasticity even with the set of controls in the model one primary source of endogeneity arises when decision makers incorporate expected water demand in setting water tariffs specifically the water tariffs may be increased in the expectation of high water demand which is positively correlated with the realized water demand in such a case the ols estimate of β 1 is biased upward toward zero or even positive while the true value should be negative however the endogeneity problem plaguing models estimated with household data and quantity based pricing wherein the consumed quantity and marginal price of water are simultaneously determined e g refs 29 30 seems less of a concern in our case first most cities applied a flat tariff rate in 2000s in china zhang fang and baerenklau 16 documents that there were only 28 out of a total 138 cities in china adopting increasing block tariffs by 2009 since the approach was introduced in 2002 second urban household size is generally small in china so the maximum quantity eligible for a base tariff is less likely binding for the majority of households in cities adopting increasing block tariffs thus the base tariff rate should play a dominant role in determining water demand of individual households as well as a city s aggregate demand third a few recent studies show that consumers are more sensitive to the average price rather than the marginal price in utility consumption 31 32 17 17 whether consumers respond to marginal or average price is an ongoing debate in the literature 2 for instance finds that residential water consumption is more likely driven by marginal prices than by average prices to tackle the above endogeneity problem we employ the average water price of peer cities denoted as ln j i σ j i p j t to instrument for the city s own water price ln p i t the results in section 4 suggest that there exists a strong tariff mimicking practice among cities that are from the same province and share boundaries hence despite slight differences between regressors of eqs 1 and 2 the average peer price should still be positively correlated with the own water price meanwhile there is no compelling reason to think that other cities tariff levels would affect a city s own water consumption through channels other than own tariff there is a concern that the peer cities tariffs are also function of own city s tariff however we argue in section 4 that eq 1 is identifiable given the nature of definition of our peer cities moreover the endogenous social effects model and spatial autoregressive model produce essentially the same coefficient estimates for peer cities tariffs while the latter is considered identified in our case in view of these we believe the proposed instrument variable also satisfies the exclusion restriction condition eq 2 imposes constant elasticity to the demand function to relax this we also estimate a quadratic price specification 3 ln y i t α 0 β 1 ln p i t β 2 ln 2 p i t x i t φ γ i δ p t ω i t which allows the price elasticity to vary by water price the two endogenous price variables are instrumented by ln j i σ j i p j t and ln 2 j i σ j i p j t to assess the extent to which common provincial shocks affect both water tariff setting and water demand we also estimate models that substitute the year fixed effect for the province specific time trends and compare the results 5 2 price elasticity of water demand table 5 reports ols estimation results of the demand functions for residential users columns 1 4 and industrial users columns 5 8 the odd numbered columns show estimates for linear quantity price model eq 2 while even numbered columns for models with quadratic price terms eq 3 conditional on city and year fixed effects both residential and industrial water demands are strongly correlated with city population columns 1 2 5 and 6 however this correlation is largely weakened and turns statistically insignificant when we include provincial time trends to replace the year fixed effect columns 3 4 7 and 9 cities with higher share of gdp derived from agriculture or industry tend to have less water consumed by the households even when water tariff is controlled one possible explanation is that households in those cities are more likely to have access to water sources and facilities such as groundwater and wells other than that supplied by water utilities to a lesser extent share of gdp from agriculture is also inversely correlated with industrial water use but industrial gdp share has a positive though statistically insignificant effect in line with the literature we find that the residential water consumption decreases with rainfall volume with an elasticity around 6 8 minimum temperature tends to decrease domestic demand and the maximum temperature increases industrial water demand but the coefficient estimates are significant at 10 level only in the models with year fixed effect household income proxied by gdp per capita and urban density have little effect on either domestic or industrial water demands 18 18 we use the average wage of urban employees as an alternative measure of city income level and obtain similar results the estimated common time trends suggest that the industrial water consumption has declined by an average of 9 per annum across the country between 2000 and 2007 given that industrial outputs increase steadily in the same period and the industrial share of gdp is controlled in the regressions the decreasing trend is likely be attributed to the improved water use efficiency i e decrease in water consumption per unit of industrial output as well as structural shift toward less water intensive production in the industrial sector none of the coefficients for tariff variables are precisely estimated leaving this issue aside the estimation of the year effect models yields positive coefficient estimates for the linear term of water tariff and negative for the quadratic term for both domestic and industrial demands they imply positive price elasticity at the sample mean or median as shown in the bottom of table 5 which are counter intuitive when the provincial time trends are controlled instead the coefficient estimates turn negative for the linear tariff variable the price elasticities derived with these estimates although lacking statistical precision are around 7 8 which falls at the lower end of the range found in the literature however these ols point estimates could still be biased even with control for provincial time trends one possible source of bias is that the water tariffs are deemed as an effective policy tool to manage water demand and thus set in anticipation of potential water demand the reverse causality could lead to underestimation of the price elasticity table 6 presents the results from iv estimation intended to address such endogeneity concerns 19 19 the coefficients for other city characteristics in the iv models are largely the same as ols estimates so we focus on tariff related estimates in table 6 full model estimation is available upon request the upper panel of table 6 shows that the ivs generally have strong explanatory power for the endogenous water tariff variables echoing the findings from previous section for residential demand functions with linear tariff term columns 1 and 3 a 10 increase in the average tariff of the peer cities leads to 4 5 or more increase in the city s own tariff the elasticity decreases to about 0 25 for industrial sector but remains statistically significant columns 5 and 7 the squares of own tariffs are also strongly correlated with the corresponding squares of peer cities tariffs columns 2 4 6 and 8 meanwhile we note that the weak iv tests suggest that there may be weak iv problem for the industrial demand regressions f stat 10 except for the specification with quadratic tariffs and year fixed effects the lower panel provides the two stage least squares 2sls estimates for the water tariff variables for residential water demand the estimated coefficients are negative for the linear term and positive for the quadratic term which are opposite to the ols estimates obtained with year fixed effects the iv estimates with provincial time trend controlled are substantially larger in magnitude than the iv estimates with year fixed effects as well as the ols estimates with provincial time trends and they are statistically significant the constant elasticity specification suggests a price elasticity of water demand at city level equal to 0 41 with variable elasticity specification the iv estimated price elasticity is 0 68 for sample mean and 0 73 for sample median these estimates are statistically significant at the 1 level and fall in the higher spectrum of estimates in the literature we see similar patterns in the results for industrial water demand for models with year fixed effects we observe negative price elasticities when constant elasticity constraint is dropped the models with provincial time trends produce negative elasticity estimates for both constant elasticity and variable elasticity specifications the point estimate is 0 41 in the case of constant elasticity and 1 26 at the mean and 1 57 at the median in the case of variable elasticity however none of them are estimated with statistical precision 20 20 the variable elasticity models yield positive elasticity estimates for certain observations with very large prices improving the model specification to deal with this situation is to be further studied overall the results from iv estimation seem to support the earlier conjecture that decision makers incorporate the anticipated future water demand in setting water tariffs and use the tariffs as a tool to manage water demand not addressing this issue ols estimation tends to underestimate the price elasticity of water demand 6 water supply estimation in this section we first estimate the cost function of water supply with utility level production and real cost data the water supply or marginal cost function is then derived based on the estimates following kim 33 and kim 34 we adopt a translog multiproduct joint cost function to estimate urban water supply the translog function features a flexible approximation to the production function using second order taylor series adding up level terms quadratic terms and cross products of outputs input prices and other variables that enter the production function given data limitation we consider two outputs the annual amount of water supplied to the residential and industrial users the total cost equals the sum of the two outputs multiplied by the utility s unit cost of water supply average wage computed from the total wage bill and number of employees is used to measure labor price we do not observe prices for other inputs such as capital and electricity directly however there was little variation across cities and year in the capital and electricity prices since both financial market and electricity market are heavily regulated in china at least in the early 2000s in this case the time fixed effects may pick up the effects of these inputs on the total costs in our regression models specifically we estimate the following model city and year subscripts are suppressed for simplicity 4 ln c a 0 s a s ln q s b w ln w k c k ln z k 1 2 r s a r s ln q r ln q s b w w ln w 2 1 2 j k c j k ln z j ln z k s d s w ln q s ln w k e k w ln z k ln w s k f s k ln q s ln z k u where c denotes the total cost q s q r corresponds to the amount of water supplied to sector s r 21 21 we observe total water supply total water sold and water sold to residential and industrial sectors respectively we calculate the leakage rate with total supply and total water sold and then apply it to the water sold to each sector to estimate water supplied to that sector w denotes wage and z k z j represents a set of control variables including the share of groundwater in total supply capacity total length of pipes log total number of meters log and whether the utility has shareholders from the private sector which may affect the technology or efficiency of water supply consistent with previous water tariff models and water demand models two specifications for the error term u are considered first u is decomposed into a city fixed effect a year fixed effect and a random error second the provincial time trends replace the year fixed effect among all the parameters a r s a s r and c j k c k j by the symmetry conditions of the model we can derive the cost elasticity of each output by differentiating the fitted eq 4 with respect to that output 5 e c q s a ˆ s r a ˆ s r ln q r d ˆ s w ln w k f ˆ s k ln z k where e c q s is the cost elasticity of water supply to sector s the marginal cost of water supply to sector s holding the other sector constant can be obtained as 6 m c s c ˆ q s e c q s where m c s is the marginal cost of water supply to sector s and c ˆ is the fitted total cost note the cost elasticity and marginal cost are both functions of water supply with city year specific parameters table 7 shows the estimation results of eq 4 with the utility level panel data from 2001 to 2007 the two specifications one with year fixed effects and the other with provincial time trends yield qualitatively similar coefficient estimates first the quantity of water supplied to both residential and industrial users are positively correlated with total cost in both linear and quadratic terms with the quadratic terms statistically significant meanwhile the coefficient of the interaction of residential and industrial quantities is significantly negative suggesting strong economies of scope utilities gain from servicing both residential and industrial sectors this is plausible as water supply services to the two types of customers could share many inputs such as main network raw water and treatment facilities and utility management in common despite the differences in customer size and location wage level has a sizable impact on the water supply cost across specifications this to some extent justifies the public s concern that the high salaries paid to the utility employees often set without sufficient transparency drive up the water price water supply cost increases with the share of capacity to process water from underground sources significant at the 10 level in the provincial time trend model however this relation is dampened when the amount of supply especially supply to residential sector is large finally the total length of pipes especially when the industrial water supply is high has a large impact on the supply cost the bottom panel of table 7 presents the cost elasticities with respect to residential and industrial water supply computed by eq 5 for the city year with sample median of the total water supply the estimates statistically significant at 1 level indicate that a 10 increase in residential industrial water supply leads to a 5 8 2 4 increase in the total cost urban water supply is a textbook case of natural monopoly it features significant economies of scale as the production relies on large scale networks which require extremely high initial investment whereas the daily operation of the system is much less expensive the estimated elasticities clearly demonstrate such scale economies in the urban water systems in china s context we further derive the sectoral marginal cost functions i e eq 6 for each city year with estimates from column 2 of table 7 and the estimated residuals fig 2 illustrates the marginal cost curves as well as realized quality marginal costs for three cities whose total water supply equal to 10 50 and 90 of the sample respectively despite variations in shape and placement of these curves the marginal cost curves generally exhibit a short increasing portion with small amounts of quantity and a long decreasing portion on the right 22 22 log of quantity which is present in the total cost and elasticity components of the marginal cost function increases fast when quality is small this seems to give rise to the increasing portion of the marginal cost curves at small quantities a large part of the downward sloping portion of the curves goes flat we compute the derivative of the marginal cost with respect to the quantity at the actual quantity supplied the results show that the majority of our sample city years 78 for residential supply and 94 for industrial supply are on the right of the turning points and many especially the larger cities lie on the flat portion of the curves evidence on downward sloping marginal cost curves for a regulated industry or water industry is well documented in the literature as brown caves and christensen 35 show diminishing marginal costs for both passenger and freight services in us railways and zekri and dinar 36 find a downward sloping supply curve for rural water services in tunisia 23 23 35 adopt a multiproduct cost function similar to the one used in this study while 36 estimate a log log supply function our results contribute to this literature by showing declining marginal costs for urban water supply in china 7 welfare analysis the estimation of demand and marginal cost functions allows us to determine the optimal water tariffs and the extent of deviation from the social welfare maximizing level under first best pricing in particular we examine the difference between actual water tariffs and the marginal costs estimated at the amount of water consumed for simplicity we use the constant elasticity estimates of the demand functions columns 3 and 7 in table 6 all the price related variables are in real terms panel a of table 8 reports summary statistics of the tariff marginal cost gap as a percentage of the tariff for the whole sample as well as the subsamples whose tariffs are higher or lower than the marginal costs in the case of residential water use the average margin between tariff and marginal cost is slightly positive at 2 1 and the median is 5 3 the distribution of positive and negative margins seems quite symmetric 385 city years have tariffs exceeding the estimated marginal costs while 301 have the reverse the average gaps are 29 2 for the former and 32 5 for the latter the absolute values of the medians as well as 10 percentiles and 90 percentiles are also comparable between the two subsamples for industrial water use the tariff marginal cost gaps are more skewed toward positive values with greater variation the average gap for the whole sample is 17 7 with median equal to 26 3 24 24 we drop 24 city years with negative marginal costs at the quantities consumed both considerably larger than those of residential water among 662 city year observations 470 or 71 have tariffs higher than the marginal costs with an average of 48 6 although observations with higher marginal costs account for less than 30 of the total the mean is as large as 57 9 and the marginal costs more than double the tariff in several instances the gap to tariff ratio is lower than 100 25 25 for comparison 34 studies u s water utilities in the early 1970s and finds the margins between average water price and marginal cost as a share of marginal cost which are 158 for residential sector and 40 for industrial sector next we turn to calculating the deadweight loss due to the gap between water tariff and marginal cost first the demand functions p d q f q u i t are derived from eq 2 with estimated coefficients from column 3 for residential sector and column 6 for industrial sector in table 6 marginal cost function m c q g q v i t are derived based on the estimates for eq 4 from column 2 of table 7 note that u i t and v i t in the two functions denote covariates as well as estimated residuals specific for each city year second we obtain the equilibrium quantity q i t e such that f q i t e u i t g q i t e v i t finally the deadweight loss is given by d w l i t q i t e q i t 0 f q u i t g q v i t d q where q i t 0 is the actual water consumption panel b of table 8 presents the deadweight loss as a share of the water revenue by sector on average the deadweight loss resulting from the gap between residential water tariff and marginal cost for residential water consumption equals 3 7 of revenue from water sold to residential users and 6 0 for industrial water the total deadweight loss as a percentage of total revenue is estimated at 4 4 examining the distributions suggests that 90 of city years have total deadweight loss equal or lower than 11 of total revenue with corresponding shares equal to 10 for residential sector and 15 for industrial sector moreover more than a quarter of the sample has deadweight loss below 1 for the residential sector the average deadweight loss caused by water priced higher than the marginal cost is slightly larger than that caused by downward pricing 3 9 vs 3 6 while it is the opposite case for the industrial sector 5 8 vs 6 6 the latter is partly driven by a few extreme cases with large negative gaps between tariffs and marginal costs overall the results point to moderate deadweight loss under the first best pricing and in terms of the share of revenue industrial sector incurs greater deadweight loss than residential sector does for urban water supply first best pricing may not lead to maximization of social welfare first water consumption bears a significant negative externality where groundwater constitutes an important source of urban water supply 37 accounting for the social costs of water consumption the optimal prices will exceed those obtained under first best pricing second in the absence of fixed or connection fee as the case of china water utilities will incur considerable financial loss under the first best pricing due to the natural monopoly characteristics of the industry to keep the utilities in operation the government needs to raise taxes to subsidize the utilities which has its own social cost third when the amount of non revenue water caused by system leakage is associated with the water consumed and represents a net loss to the society it is sensible to set a higher water tariff to lower water consumption so as to reduce system leakage 26 26 quantifying the welfare loss or optimal prices in the first two cases requires additional information that is beyond the scope of the paper 17 simulates scenarios with flat non revenue rate at 0 11 and linear cost function of non revenue water using estimates obtained in sections 4 and 5 the results suggest the deadweight loss could be minimized with a price higher than the first best price 8 conclusion this study attempts to answer whether water tariffs are regulated optimally in the context of china in 2000s we start with an effort to understand how urban water tariffs have been set in the context of chinese cities in the 2000s we find that water tariffs have steadily increased in both nominal and real terms in the early 2000s although the pace of adjustment slowed down after 2007 among the city level factors we examined that may affect water tariffs the single most important one is the average tariff levels of peer cities this suggests that industrial regulators may use neighboring cities information to overcome information asymmetry between the government and water utilities regarding true water supply costs although alternative estimates from a spatial autoregressive model corroborate the finding it is desirable to further pin down the peer effects in urban water tariff setting with an instrumental variable or natural experiment approach in future research when we use average tariff of peer cities as the instrumental variable for the own tariff we get iv estimates distinctive from the ols estimates which are nearly zero and statistically insignificant the iv estimation yields a price elasticity of water demand around 0 41 for both residential and industrial sectors in our favorite specifications on the supply side we estimate a translog multiproduct joint cost function and obtain evidence that the urban water services possess strong scope economies and scale economies the majority of our sample city years falls on the downward sloping segment of the marginal cost curves based on our estimation the cases of actual tariffs higher and lower than marginal costs are equally divided for residential sector whereas the incidence of higher actual tariffs accounts for 71 for the industrial sector adopting first best pricing rule the deadweight loss is estimated to be moderate for the majority of the sample this may be explained by the inelasticity of water demand relatively small gaps between the actual tariffs and marginal costs and downward slope of the marginal cost curves these results remind us that whether water tariffs are set properly should be assessed on a case by case basis with a careful account of both water demand and supply it is not socially optimal for the government to maintain static water tariffs out of political concern or for the utilities with information advantages to demand extraordinarily high tariffs due to data limitation our welfare assessment is restricted up to the year 2007 available data suggests that the local governments in china have slowed down the pace of adjusting water tariffs after 2007 our analysis implies that social welfare loss would have increased as a result of changing demand and or supply conditions while the tariffs were kept low statement all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript being submitted they

8661,we study urban water tariff setting and its welfare implications with a unique panel of chinese cities in the 2000s first we find that peer cities water tariff levels have a significant influence on a city s choice of tariffs using the peer cities average tariffs as instrumental variables in estimating water demand functions we obtain price elasticities around 0 41 for both residential and industrial sectors our estimation of cost functions reveals the supply of urban water services to be characterized by strong economies of scale and economies of scope more than half of the sample have residential water tariffs higher than the corresponding marginal costs while the share increases to 71 for industrial sector the deadweight loss calculated under first best pricing suggests moderate welfare loss due to prices deviating from marginal costs keywords deadweight loss multiproduct cost function water demand water tariff jel classification l95 q21 q25 q28 1 introduction rapid urbanization is a feature as well as driver of economic development in many developing countries managing urbanization well requires not only enormous investment in urban infrastructure such as roads water supply network and wastewater treatment facilities but also sound management of natural resources and the environment water is one of such key resources especially in countries like china and india where available water per capita is low and agricultural production still accounts for a large share of water consumption 1 given water as essential to life and the market structure of urban water supply water tariffs are rarely set by pure market forces instead urban water tariff is closely regulated as an important policy instrument to balance demand and supply and achieve water conservation to support its fast growth in urban population increasing from 17 9 of total population in 1978 to 58 5 in 2017 china has invested enormously in building urban infrastructure for instance china reached a stock of 382 000 km of roads and 757 000 km of water supply pipes in urban areas by 2016 up from 160 000 km to 255 000 km in 2000 respectively 2 and 2001 these statistics reveal that a city usually has much longer water supply pipes underneath the roads than the roads themselves thus rehabilitating or expanding an urban water supply system requires a substantial amount of capital investment besides domestic sources of funding which include regular fiscal budget and revenues from government bonds or land sale developing countries have increasingly relied on external funding sources such as bilateral and multilateral donors 1 1 for example urban water supply accounts for about 20 of world bank s portfolio http www worldbank org en topic watersupply 2 and private investors to finance rehabilitation or expansion of their urban water systems galiani gertler and schargrodsky 2005 3 when these external investors participate in developing the water supply market they pay considerable attention to water tariffs to ensure that the projects they support are financially sustainable and improves water use efficiency donors often ask local governments to raise water tariffs private investors also prefer higher water tariffs which largely determine the rate of return on their investment however as in many other developing countries proposals to increase water tariffs often meet resistance from the government and public in china according to china s price law water tariffs should be set by the government and public hearings must be convened in the process of setting new tariffs 2 2 article 18 of the price law of the people s republic of china 1997 states that the government shall issue government set or guided prices for merchandise and services if they are i of great importance to economic development and people s livelihood ii resources in short supply iii monopolized in supply in nature iv important public utilities and or v important services of public welfare in nature article 23 states that public hearings should be organized by the price bureau of the government to solicit views from consumers business operators and other quarters to explore the necessity and feasibility of price adjustment it seems understandable that the public do not favor water tariff increase in general given that water is essential to life and the operation of many water utilities lacks transparency in the presence of pervasive negative feedback from the public the local government tends to reject or postpone increases in water tariffs or even turn down a proposal before a public hearing if negative feedback is expected there could be several reasons for the tendency of local governments to weigh the public s views more than the interest of the water utilities and their investors first water tariffs influence almost everyone relying on public water supply an increase in water tariff against the public may backfire and cause difficulties for decision makers second when the external investors are on board and a new city administration is in charge keeping low tariffs to maintain political stability will often weigh more in the decision making of the new government officials third the revenue deficit due to sluggish water tariffs is unlikely to account for a large portion of a local government s budget the government could subsidize the utility to cover the gap without engaging the public in an intense discussion however utilities also have incentive to propose faster tariff increases in presence of information asymmetry one may not conclude that it is economically inefficient by observing that local governments tend to reject or slow the pace of water tariff increase to assess whether the prevailing water tariffs are set properly it is necessary to understand the key driving factors in the setting of water tariffs and measure the welfare consequence based on the supply and demand of water services in this study we empirically analyze these issues with a comprehensive panel dataset containing information on the quantity of water supply consumption and tariffs for over 200 chinese cities in the 2000s we begin with an examination of the evolution of urban water tariffs over time for both residential and industrial sectors next we investigate how city level factors including population climate economic characteristics and peer cities tariffs affect a city s residential and industrial water tariff levels third we estimate water demand functions for residential and industrial users tackling the endogeneity of water tariffs with instrumental variables we also estimate a translog cost function of water supply whereby marginal cost functions are derived for residential and industrial sectors respectively combining estimated water demand and marginal cost functions we measure the potential welfare loss due to deviations of water tariffs from marginal costs below we highlight the main findings that we consider relevant and novel in the literature first in panel model specifications controlling for city fixed effects and year fixed effects or provincial time trends a city s water tariff level is highly correlated with its peer cities average water tariff where peer cities are those neighboring cities from the same province an alternative spatial autoregressive estimation lends further support to this finding which holds true for both residential and industrial water tariffs in the public economics literature there is a strand of studies regarding strategic interactions in fiscal policies and environmental and labor regulations among national or sub national governments for instance recent empirical studies document strong spatial correlations in tax rates for local property tax and income tax within countries 4 6 in stringency of environmental policies among states of the us 7 and in labor standards setting and enforcement across countries 8 in the context of china there is evidence that city level governments are engaged in strategic interactions with respect to undertaking investment to boost local economy 9 and enforcing safety regulations on coal mining 10 our finding extends this literature to the interactions among local governments in regulating water supply industry second building on this result we use peer cities average tariff as an instrumental variable iv hereafter to estimate water demand functions a naïve ols estimation shows that price elasticity of water demand is economically and statistically insignificant and even positive in some cases this may be because water tariffs are set endogenously for example the government of a growing city may adopt a higher tariff to rein in increasing demand for water with a constant elasticity specification the iv estimation implies that the price elasticity of water demand is around 0 41 for both residential and industrial use which is statistically significant for the former these estimates fall in the range of estimated elasticities found in the literature see surveys in refs 11 13 and confirm the endogeneity of water tariff setting third we consider water utilities servicing users from different sectors as multiproduct firms by estimating a translog multiproduct cost function we show that urban water supply is clearly characterized by both economies of scale and scope with majority of sample city years on the downward sloping part of the marginal cost curves last but not least overlaying the demand and supply functions we find that more than half of the sample city years have residential water tariffs higher than the corresponding marginal costs while the share increases to 71 for industrial sector this result counters the conventional wisdom that water tariffs are generally set too low in china 3 3 see articles at https www economist com asia 2010 01 07 bottling it and https piie com blogs china economic watch economics h2o water price reforms china for example our estimation of deadweight loss under the first best pricing rule suggests that the social welfare loss due to water tariffs deviating from the marginal price is moderate 4 4 first best pricing in this study refers to charging a volumetric price at marginal cost as well as a fix cost to achieve full cost recovery to the best of our knowledge closest to our paper is a recent study by davis and muehlegger 14 which examines whether prices exceed marginal costs in the natural gas distribution market and associated welfare loss at state level in the u s extra efforts are taken to address the endogeneity of water tariff in estimating the water demand elasticity the key message from our study is that both demand and supply information needs to be taken into account in the dynamic process of setting proper tariff levels the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides background information on water tariff setting in china section 3 describes the data used in the study empirical analysis regarding urban water tariff setting is presented in section 4 sections 5 and 6 estimate water demand and supply functions respectively section 7 estimates welfare loss under first best pricing and section 8 concludes 2 background urban water tariff here refers to the volumetric price often in the unit of cny per cubic meter charged by the water utility on consumers who obtain water from the urban water supply network operated by the utility charging water tariffs can be traced back to 1985 in china when the government started to require that water supply acquired through any hydraulic works should be paid 5 5 state council s no 94 policy paper administrative decree on accounting collecting and managing the raw water charges of hydraulic works in 1994 the government issued prc ordinance on urban water supply detailing the water supply pricing scheme such as the consumer categories the tariff structure and formula and the administrative procedure of setting tariffs the objective was to have water supply costs fully covered by tariff revenues further the prc water law enacted in 1998 proposed to charge a water resource fee to protect water resources and improve water use efficiency 15 usually the water utility pays the hydraulic work charge and water resource fee when it obtains water from the sources and counts them as part of its water supply cost until late 2000s most chinese cities applied a flat tariff rate without connection or fixed fee 16 the urban water tariff is primarily set by the prefecture government and is supposed to cover the cost of supplying water taxes and a reasonable amount of profit for the water utility the water supply cost covers the costs for water acquisition production transmission and distribution and other related costs the water utility is responsible for collecting water tariffs which constitutes the major revenue for the utility in a separate process the prefecture government also sets the level of wastewater treatment fee the water utility collects the wastewater treatment fees together with water tariffs and transfers the former to the sewage company the prc price law passed in 1998 provides the provision that public hearing system must be established in setting prices for public utilities services in public interest and goods with natural monopoly nature by the government following this legislation the central government issued a few decrees to introduce public hearings on price setting by governments including setting of urban water tariffs 6 6 there are implementation of public hearing for government to set prices 2002 and rule of conduct of government to set prices 2006 among others public hearings on water tariffs which have been largely focused on residential water tariffs have received considerable media and public attention since the policy implementation the proposal for a new higher water tariff is generally initiated by the water utility in order to cover its investment and or increased costs in response relevant government agencies such as the planning agency water affairs department and or price bureau will conduct consultation and assessment regarding the reasonability and impacts of the tariff increase the government will proceed to call a public hearing unless it decides to reject the proposal outright resident delegates are selected to participate in the public hearing and vote on the proposal at the end of the hearing from the above description we can see that the decision process on water tariff setting primarily involves the water utility government and water users each party has relatively clear roles to play in the process however people argue that the process is largely controlled by the local government for several reasons first the majority of water utilities are owned by the government despite a movement in early 1990s toward private sector participation in urban water services in china 3 second the prefectural government could reject the tariff adjustment proposal directly without convening a public hearing third it is shown that governments have definitive control on the size and composition of the delegation as well as ways the delegates are selected to participate in the hearings in a few cases studied by zhong and mol 18 the majority of delegates were government employees or from institutions affiliated with the government independent citizens only accounted for a small minority in the delegation thus it is not surprising to see that most proposals for water tariff increase submitted for public hearings were approved however it is noteworthy that the public hearing is not always a token activity there are quite a few cases wherein the public rejected the price increase proposals or got the proposals revised 18 3 data the data used for this study is a combination of several city level datasets covering more than 200 prefecture level cities from 2000 to 2012 7 7 the number of cities varies slightly across analyses due to missing data issue while different variables are used in different regressions first we digitized the annual statistics of urban water supply of years 2000 2007 in which the reporting utilities provide detailed information on their water supply services including total water supplied water sold disaggregated by user sectors total and groundwater supply capacity cost per ton of water supplied number of employees total wage bill length of water intake and supply pipes number of meters as well as water tariffs for different sectors the post 2006 tariff data are collected from the china water net which publicizes monthly city water tariffs 8 8 see price h2o china com we validated the data by checking available government documents regarding water tariff adjustments the annual tariffs are average of the monthly tariffs in case tariffs changed within the year we obtained city level characteristics such as population area gdp and its sectoral composition and fiscal performance from the chinese city statistical yearbooks as the second subnational administrative level immediately below province a prefecture is often referred to as city in china it actually comprises an urban center and suburban or rural areas surrounding the center the yearbooks contain separate statistics for the urban center as well as for the whole prefecture because water tariffs set by the prefecture government primarily relate to urban utilities supplying water to the urban centers we used data of the urban center in the yearbooks in our analysis 9 9 there are county or town level utilities supplying water to sub urban or rural areas they are generally smaller and not included in our sample we obtained yearly weather data from the data center of the chinese meteorological bureau 10 10 accessed through data cma cn the dataset contains weather measurements collected by about 840 weather stations distributed across the country we mapped them to the cities where the stations are located and took the average of rainfall and maximum minimum of the maximum minimum temperature across stations if multiple stations are found in the same city finally to obtain a precise measure of water tariffs in real terms we meticulously collected city level cpi from provincial statistical yearbooks real tariffs are computed in cny with the base year 2000 table 1 presents the summary statistics of the above variables except water tariffs data reported by water utilities are available for 2000 to 2007 some variables are missing for 2000 while other city level data are available for 2000 to 2011 12 averaged across cities and years total annual water supply is 83 8 million cubic meters and water sold is 66 4 million the ratio of the two amounting to 79 2 could be considered as the approximate rate of revenue water residential users account for nearly half of the total water sold while industrial users account for about 28 other sectors including commercial administrative and special users consume less than one quarter of water therefore this study focuses on residential and industrial sectors 11 11 this is also because many cities did not report water sold to other sectors on average the supply capacity from ground water accounts for 28 of the total capacity while this share varies from 0 to 100 across cities the unit cost of water supply ranges from cny 0 22 to 6 10 per ton with an average of cny 1 35 12 12 the exchange rate between us dollar to chinese yuan decreased from about cny 8 3 to cny 6 3 per dollar between 2000 and 2012 applying a rate of 7 0 the dollar equivalent average unit cost is about 20 cents the cost levels will be compared to the water tariffs we collected next for the rest of the water utility and urban variables we note the dramatic gaps across city years for instance binzhou a small eastern city had only 760 m in 2002 while tianjin one of the four directly governed municipalities had over 2 2 million meters in 2007 in terms of income level the real gdp per capita in constant 2000 price was only cny 1236 in the urban chaoyang a northeastern city in 2002 in contrast zhenjiang located in the affluent yangtze river delta area had a per capita gdp of cny 221 000 equivalent to usd 26 600 by 2012 table 2 reports nominal and real water tariffs for residential and industrial users respectively we divide the sample into two time periods i e 2000 2006 and 2007 2012 as the data come from two different sources and there is a slight discrepancy between them discussed below the average nominal residential water tariffs are cny 1 27 per ton for 2000 2006 and cny 1 60 for 2007 2012 industrial water tariffs are higher at cny 1 66 and 2 21 respectively the real tariffs in 2000 price are slightly lower than the nominal tariffs this is not surprising given that inflation rates have been moderate during the period fig 1 shows the time trends of national average tariffs for residential and industrial users in nominal and real terms the trajectories of average tariffs within each subperiod appear smooth and generally increase despite a downward break between 2006 and 2007 we use year fixed effects in the following regression analyses to control for this data discrepancy arising from different data sources a few patterns are noteworthy regarding the dynamics of tariff setting first the growth rates of nominal tariffs are relatively high registering around 8 for both sectors before 2007 and drop to 3 5 for residential and 5 1 for industrial sectors after 2007 one plausible explanation is that local governments concerned with adverse effects of the global financial crisis slowed down the tariff increase to help cope with possible economic hardship second the growing patterns of real tariffs followed those of nominal tariffs closely before 2007 removing inflation factors the tariffs have increased at 6 6 and 7 3 per annum on average for residential and industrial sectors respectively however real tariffs largely stayed unchanged between 2007 and 2012 finally while industrial tariffs are higher than residential tariffs trends of both appear to be parallel table 3 compares the nominal tariffs and utility reported average water supply costs by year the tariffs are averaged across residential and industrial sectors with the amount of water provided to each sector as weights it shows that by 2003 utilities that had sufficient revenues to cover costs outnumbered cities running deficits the situation was slightly reversed in 2004 and 2006 and largely in 2007 note however that the numbers of deficit cases are possibly over estimated since due to lack of quantity data the average weighted tariffs do not yet incorporate tariffs for commercial administrative and special sectors which are commonly higher than the residential tariffs in sum the comparison suggests that cases where water tariffs are below water supply costs are far from ubiquitous across the country 4 urban water tariff setting we estimate a set of regression models to understand the factors that may influence water tariff setting at the city level to the extent that the local government plays a dominant role in the whole process our results primarily reveal the factors that government officials have considered in setting new water tariffs the baseline equation is 1 ln p i t α 0 α 1 ln j i σ j i p j t x i t β γ i δ p t ε i t where p i t p j t is the real water tariff of city i j in year t σ j i 1 n i if city j is one of the ni cities from the same province and neighboring city i and 0 otherwise x i t is a vector of time varying city characteristics that are probably exogenous and could affect the level of water tariff γ i is the city fixed effect and δ p t represents the province specific trend in setting water tariffs the city characteristics we are interested in include total population log population density log agricultural and industrial shares of gdp real gdp per capita fiscal deficit as a share of revenue five year moving averages of precipitation log and maximum temperature and minimum temperature total population proxies for demand for water and would be positively correlated with water price ceteris paribus on the other hand larger population suggests scale of economy and thus lowers the cost of water supply higher population density means lower unit cost of serving individual water users agriculture remains a water intensive sector in china to ensure sufficient water is allocated to agricultural production the prefectural government may have to increase water tariffs to depress residential and industrial use gdp per capita is expected to be positively correlated with water tariff as higher income level implies more willingness to pay for water services as well as greater water demand leading to government adopting higher tariffs it is likely for a local government to cut the subsidy to water utilities and raise water tariffs when it runs into a serious deficit continuous significant rainfall and low temperature tend to keep the demand for water at a relatively low level while high temperature does the opposite thus these weather related factors may have been considered in tariffs setting in order to balance the water supply and demand besides these conventional factors we introduce a new explanatory variable namely the average real tariffs of peer cities within china s administrative hierarchy system there is considerable horizontal competition at each level e g ref 19 city officials will compete and be evaluated by the provincial government against officials of other cities in the same province therefore strong incentives exist for a city to learn from or mimic its competitors moreover some provinces are large and spatially diverse hence we define peer cities as those from the same province and neighboring the primary city conceptually a city government could be affected by its peers in choosing water tariff levels for different reasons while government officials and the public are involved in the price setting process they do not observe the true costs of supplying water by the utility to reduce this information asymmetry decision makers may take into account the fact that water service costs should be similar across neighboring cities that share common natural and economic conditions hence a new tariff significantly higher than those peer cities tariffs is likely to be viewed as an indication of inefficiency in the local utility s operation and get rejected this is referred to as yardstick competition in the tax setting literature e g ref 20 the influence of peer cities may also arise from a different type of competition whereby cities lower their water tariffs to attract water intensive industries we consider this second explanation less likely since producers using large amount of water as their inputs often extract water independently and are subject to separate pricing policies neither does the argument seem to apply to residential water tariffs as a tiebout model would suggest since water expenditure accounts for a fairly small portion of living costs in china people are very unlikely to move between cities because of water tariffs 13 13 the tax setting literature offers a third explanation for the inter jurisdiction peer effects expenditure spillovers this however does not seem to be relevant to water tariff setting eq 1 can be seen as a panel version of the endogenous social effects model according to manski 21 identification problem also referred to as reflection problem would arise if mean of city characteristics x across peer cities and determinants of peer cities are linearly dependent however this is unlikely the case given that our peer cities are defined by geographic proximity and administrative jurisdiction instead of any city characteristics in eq 1 in addition lee 22 demonstrates that the endogenous effects are identifiable in a spatial autoregressive setting wherein the peer group sizes are small and not constant in our case the number of peer cities each city has varies between 1 and 7 with mean equal to 3 8 lee and yu 23 further develop estimator for spatial autoregressive panel models which stata adopts to estimate such models in view of the above we estimate three different specifications in addition to the baseline model of eq 1 first we add one year lag real water tariff in log to account for the likely practice that the decision to adjust water tariffs are partly associated with existing tariff levels second we also substitute year fixed effects for the province specific time trend to control for common time effects as well as the fact that the tariff data come from two sources covering different periods lastly we estimate a spatial autoregressive panel model ln p i t α 1 w i n ln p t x i t β γ i ε i t where ln p t ln p i t i 1 n is the n 1 vector of observation of year t and w i n is a specified 1 n weighting vector with component equal to 1 for a city that is neighboring and in the same province with city i and zero otherwise columns 1 to 4 of table 4 presents estimation results for residential water tariffs first of all the tariffs of peer cities exhibit a strong positive impact on the primary city s tariff with a statistical significance at the 1 level the baseline estimate suggests that a 10 increase in the average tariff of neighboring cities from the same province leads to a 5 2 increase in a city s tariff level the elasticity drops to around 0 28 but remains statistically significant when we control for the lagged tariff of the primary city column 3 shows that replacing the interaction of province dummy and time trend with year fixed effects has no effect on the estimate of α 1 it is reassuring to see that the spatial autoregressive estimation yields same coefficient estimate for peer cities in column 4 this suggests that the linear endogenous social effects model described in eq 1 is not subject to serious identification issue most coefficients of city characteristics have the expected signs and are generally stable across different specifications though only a few of them are statistically significant contrary to expectation gdp per capita has a negative coefficient estimate and statistically significant in the two way fixed effects specification and spatial autoregressive model although the magnitude is small i e 10 increase in per capita gdp resulting in about 0 3 decrease in residential water tariffs one possible explanation is that holding other factors constant more economically advanced cities can supply water more efficiently e g less non revenue water and thus entail lower service cost the current tariff level is closely related to the one year lag of tariff the elasticity is estimated between 0 47 and 0 58 with statistical significance indicating a convergence trend of tariff levels across cities coefficients of other explanatory variables are not precisely estimated population and population density are negatively correlated with water tariffs suggesting that tariff setting takes into account the lower costs of serving water to a larger population and to a population located more closely a higher share of output in agriculture is associated with higher water tariffs and the estimates are much greater than those for industrial output share this implies that agriculture plays a significant role in local water allocation and water tariff may have been used to allocate more water to agricultural sector from urban use cities with high fiscal deficit tend to have high water tariffs since the governments are less capable of subsidizing water services correlations between weather variables i e temperature and rainfall and tariff levels are not strong this may be because many cities have water infrastructure like reservoirs to stabilize water supply so that local precipitation or temperature has little effects on the cost of water supply 14 14 thanks to one referee for offering this plausible explanation again these interpretations are rather tentative since the estimates lack statistical significance columns 5 to 8 present the regression estimates for real industrial water tariffs the estimated elasticities of city s own tariff with respect to the average industrial tariff of peer cities range from 0 18 to 0 33 in the first three linear specifications which are all statistically significant at the 1 level and slightly smaller than the corresponding estimates of residential tariffs the spatial autoregressive model is estimated with α 1 equal to 0 28 which is close to the estimate from linear specification with city and year fixed effects hence similar to the case of residential tariffs the peer cities industrial water tariffs play a prominent role in a city s decision on setting its own tariff for industrial water use the coefficient estimates for other city characteristics bear similar patterns as those for residential water tariffs for instance the lagged industrial tariff also has a notable influence in setting current industrial tariff with elasticity almost the same as that for residential tariff however the coefficients of urban gdp per capita become smaller and statistically insignificant in setting industrial tariffs 15 15 we estimate similar models with nominal water tariffs as dependent variables and the relevant regressors peer tariff lagged own tariff and urban gdp per capita in nominal term inflation rate is included as a possible factor in setting nominal tariff levels the results presented in appendix table 1 are broadly consistent with the real tariff models 5 water demand estimation in this section we estimate water demand functions with city level data on water consumption and tariffs while it is more common in the literature to estimate residential water demand functions with household data the two approaches answer different questions and complement each other for local government planning and managing water resources it is not sufficient to have an average estimate of household price elasticity of water demand in the presence of considerable heterogeneity across households moreover it is rare to have firm level water use data to estimate water demand by industrial users city level estimation is better positioned to answer the question of how aggregate water demand would respond to a price change as well as changes in other factors such as average income and economic structure what we do here is closer to the few studies that use city community level data to estimate residential water demand elasticities such as bell and griffin 24 25 diakite semenov and thomas 26 renzetti 27 and timmins 28 however it is worth highlighting a few distinctive features of our work first we use a large sample of cities from a developing country while the existing studies except diakite semenov and thomas 26 focus on developed countries mainly usa and canada residential water consumption patterns in china could be distinct from these countries second we also estimate industrial water demand elasticities across cities which is not common in the literature third we address the endogeneity of water tariffs in the demand models by instrumenting a city s own water tariff with its peer cities average tariff 5 1 empirical strategy we estimate a log log demand function for both residential and industrial sectors the baseline specification is 2 ln y i t α 0 β 1 ln p i t x i t φ γ i δ p t ω i t where y i t is total water consumption by residential or industrial sector of city i in year t p i t is the real water tariff for residential or industrial sector 16 16 in china the price of water paid by consumers should be the sum of water tariff and the rate of sewage charge as sewage fee is collected in the same bill of water tariff unfortunately we do not have data on sewage rates before 2007 the post 2007 data suggest that sewage rates are relatively low as compared to the water tariffs and have been adjusted infrequently to the extent that the sewage rates are considered as a small constant added to the water tariffs before 2007 a change in tariff could represent the marginal change in the total water price thus our estimates with tariff only should not be considerably biased alternatively we impute the sewage rates before 2007 based on linear projections for each city and add them to the water tariffs the resulting estimation confirms the general patterns of the estimates with tariffs only i e larger negative elasticity by iv estimation but the estimates for the industrial sector are subject to weak iv problem these estimates are available from authors upon request x i t is a vector of time varying urban factors that may affect water consumption exogenously including population population density agricultural and industrial shares of gdp real gdp per capita contemporary rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature of the year γ i is the city fixed effect and δ p t represents the province specific trends in water consumption the primary parameter of interest is β 1 which presumably negative measures the price elasticity of water demand however the ols estimation of eq 2 is likely to yield a biased estimate of the elasticity even with the set of controls in the model one primary source of endogeneity arises when decision makers incorporate expected water demand in setting water tariffs specifically the water tariffs may be increased in the expectation of high water demand which is positively correlated with the realized water demand in such a case the ols estimate of β 1 is biased upward toward zero or even positive while the true value should be negative however the endogeneity problem plaguing models estimated with household data and quantity based pricing wherein the consumed quantity and marginal price of water are simultaneously determined e g refs 29 30 seems less of a concern in our case first most cities applied a flat tariff rate in 2000s in china zhang fang and baerenklau 16 documents that there were only 28 out of a total 138 cities in china adopting increasing block tariffs by 2009 since the approach was introduced in 2002 second urban household size is generally small in china so the maximum quantity eligible for a base tariff is less likely binding for the majority of households in cities adopting increasing block tariffs thus the base tariff rate should play a dominant role in determining water demand of individual households as well as a city s aggregate demand third a few recent studies show that consumers are more sensitive to the average price rather than the marginal price in utility consumption 31 32 17 17 whether consumers respond to marginal or average price is an ongoing debate in the literature 2 for instance finds that residential water consumption is more likely driven by marginal prices than by average prices to tackle the above endogeneity problem we employ the average water price of peer cities denoted as ln j i σ j i p j t to instrument for the city s own water price ln p i t the results in section 4 suggest that there exists a strong tariff mimicking practice among cities that are from the same province and share boundaries hence despite slight differences between regressors of eqs 1 and 2 the average peer price should still be positively correlated with the own water price meanwhile there is no compelling reason to think that other cities tariff levels would affect a city s own water consumption through channels other than own tariff there is a concern that the peer cities tariffs are also function of own city s tariff however we argue in section 4 that eq 1 is identifiable given the nature of definition of our peer cities moreover the endogenous social effects model and spatial autoregressive model produce essentially the same coefficient estimates for peer cities tariffs while the latter is considered identified in our case in view of these we believe the proposed instrument variable also satisfies the exclusion restriction condition eq 2 imposes constant elasticity to the demand function to relax this we also estimate a quadratic price specification 3 ln y i t α 0 β 1 ln p i t β 2 ln 2 p i t x i t φ γ i δ p t ω i t which allows the price elasticity to vary by water price the two endogenous price variables are instrumented by ln j i σ j i p j t and ln 2 j i σ j i p j t to assess the extent to which common provincial shocks affect both water tariff setting and water demand we also estimate models that substitute the year fixed effect for the province specific time trends and compare the results 5 2 price elasticity of water demand table 5 reports ols estimation results of the demand functions for residential users columns 1 4 and industrial users columns 5 8 the odd numbered columns show estimates for linear quantity price model eq 2 while even numbered columns for models with quadratic price terms eq 3 conditional on city and year fixed effects both residential and industrial water demands are strongly correlated with city population columns 1 2 5 and 6 however this correlation is largely weakened and turns statistically insignificant when we include provincial time trends to replace the year fixed effect columns 3 4 7 and 9 cities with higher share of gdp derived from agriculture or industry tend to have less water consumed by the households even when water tariff is controlled one possible explanation is that households in those cities are more likely to have access to water sources and facilities such as groundwater and wells other than that supplied by water utilities to a lesser extent share of gdp from agriculture is also inversely correlated with industrial water use but industrial gdp share has a positive though statistically insignificant effect in line with the literature we find that the residential water consumption decreases with rainfall volume with an elasticity around 6 8 minimum temperature tends to decrease domestic demand and the maximum temperature increases industrial water demand but the coefficient estimates are significant at 10 level only in the models with year fixed effect household income proxied by gdp per capita and urban density have little effect on either domestic or industrial water demands 18 18 we use the average wage of urban employees as an alternative measure of city income level and obtain similar results the estimated common time trends suggest that the industrial water consumption has declined by an average of 9 per annum across the country between 2000 and 2007 given that industrial outputs increase steadily in the same period and the industrial share of gdp is controlled in the regressions the decreasing trend is likely be attributed to the improved water use efficiency i e decrease in water consumption per unit of industrial output as well as structural shift toward less water intensive production in the industrial sector none of the coefficients for tariff variables are precisely estimated leaving this issue aside the estimation of the year effect models yields positive coefficient estimates for the linear term of water tariff and negative for the quadratic term for both domestic and industrial demands they imply positive price elasticity at the sample mean or median as shown in the bottom of table 5 which are counter intuitive when the provincial time trends are controlled instead the coefficient estimates turn negative for the linear tariff variable the price elasticities derived with these estimates although lacking statistical precision are around 7 8 which falls at the lower end of the range found in the literature however these ols point estimates could still be biased even with control for provincial time trends one possible source of bias is that the water tariffs are deemed as an effective policy tool to manage water demand and thus set in anticipation of potential water demand the reverse causality could lead to underestimation of the price elasticity table 6 presents the results from iv estimation intended to address such endogeneity concerns 19 19 the coefficients for other city characteristics in the iv models are largely the same as ols estimates so we focus on tariff related estimates in table 6 full model estimation is available upon request the upper panel of table 6 shows that the ivs generally have strong explanatory power for the endogenous water tariff variables echoing the findings from previous section for residential demand functions with linear tariff term columns 1 and 3 a 10 increase in the average tariff of the peer cities leads to 4 5 or more increase in the city s own tariff the elasticity decreases to about 0 25 for industrial sector but remains statistically significant columns 5 and 7 the squares of own tariffs are also strongly correlated with the corresponding squares of peer cities tariffs columns 2 4 6 and 8 meanwhile we note that the weak iv tests suggest that there may be weak iv problem for the industrial demand regressions f stat 10 except for the specification with quadratic tariffs and year fixed effects the lower panel provides the two stage least squares 2sls estimates for the water tariff variables for residential water demand the estimated coefficients are negative for the linear term and positive for the quadratic term which are opposite to the ols estimates obtained with year fixed effects the iv estimates with provincial time trend controlled are substantially larger in magnitude than the iv estimates with year fixed effects as well as the ols estimates with provincial time trends and they are statistically significant the constant elasticity specification suggests a price elasticity of water demand at city level equal to 0 41 with variable elasticity specification the iv estimated price elasticity is 0 68 for sample mean and 0 73 for sample median these estimates are statistically significant at the 1 level and fall in the higher spectrum of estimates in the literature we see similar patterns in the results for industrial water demand for models with year fixed effects we observe negative price elasticities when constant elasticity constraint is dropped the models with provincial time trends produce negative elasticity estimates for both constant elasticity and variable elasticity specifications the point estimate is 0 41 in the case of constant elasticity and 1 26 at the mean and 1 57 at the median in the case of variable elasticity however none of them are estimated with statistical precision 20 20 the variable elasticity models yield positive elasticity estimates for certain observations with very large prices improving the model specification to deal with this situation is to be further studied overall the results from iv estimation seem to support the earlier conjecture that decision makers incorporate the anticipated future water demand in setting water tariffs and use the tariffs as a tool to manage water demand not addressing this issue ols estimation tends to underestimate the price elasticity of water demand 6 water supply estimation in this section we first estimate the cost function of water supply with utility level production and real cost data the water supply or marginal cost function is then derived based on the estimates following kim 33 and kim 34 we adopt a translog multiproduct joint cost function to estimate urban water supply the translog function features a flexible approximation to the production function using second order taylor series adding up level terms quadratic terms and cross products of outputs input prices and other variables that enter the production function given data limitation we consider two outputs the annual amount of water supplied to the residential and industrial users the total cost equals the sum of the two outputs multiplied by the utility s unit cost of water supply average wage computed from the total wage bill and number of employees is used to measure labor price we do not observe prices for other inputs such as capital and electricity directly however there was little variation across cities and year in the capital and electricity prices since both financial market and electricity market are heavily regulated in china at least in the early 2000s in this case the time fixed effects may pick up the effects of these inputs on the total costs in our regression models specifically we estimate the following model city and year subscripts are suppressed for simplicity 4 ln c a 0 s a s ln q s b w ln w k c k ln z k 1 2 r s a r s ln q r ln q s b w w ln w 2 1 2 j k c j k ln z j ln z k s d s w ln q s ln w k e k w ln z k ln w s k f s k ln q s ln z k u where c denotes the total cost q s q r corresponds to the amount of water supplied to sector s r 21 21 we observe total water supply total water sold and water sold to residential and industrial sectors respectively we calculate the leakage rate with total supply and total water sold and then apply it to the water sold to each sector to estimate water supplied to that sector w denotes wage and z k z j represents a set of control variables including the share of groundwater in total supply capacity total length of pipes log total number of meters log and whether the utility has shareholders from the private sector which may affect the technology or efficiency of water supply consistent with previous water tariff models and water demand models two specifications for the error term u are considered first u is decomposed into a city fixed effect a year fixed effect and a random error second the provincial time trends replace the year fixed effect among all the parameters a r s a s r and c j k c k j by the symmetry conditions of the model we can derive the cost elasticity of each output by differentiating the fitted eq 4 with respect to that output 5 e c q s a ˆ s r a ˆ s r ln q r d ˆ s w ln w k f ˆ s k ln z k where e c q s is the cost elasticity of water supply to sector s the marginal cost of water supply to sector s holding the other sector constant can be obtained as 6 m c s c ˆ q s e c q s where m c s is the marginal cost of water supply to sector s and c ˆ is the fitted total cost note the cost elasticity and marginal cost are both functions of water supply with city year specific parameters table 7 shows the estimation results of eq 4 with the utility level panel data from 2001 to 2007 the two specifications one with year fixed effects and the other with provincial time trends yield qualitatively similar coefficient estimates first the quantity of water supplied to both residential and industrial users are positively correlated with total cost in both linear and quadratic terms with the quadratic terms statistically significant meanwhile the coefficient of the interaction of residential and industrial quantities is significantly negative suggesting strong economies of scope utilities gain from servicing both residential and industrial sectors this is plausible as water supply services to the two types of customers could share many inputs such as main network raw water and treatment facilities and utility management in common despite the differences in customer size and location wage level has a sizable impact on the water supply cost across specifications this to some extent justifies the public s concern that the high salaries paid to the utility employees often set without sufficient transparency drive up the water price water supply cost increases with the share of capacity to process water from underground sources significant at the 10 level in the provincial time trend model however this relation is dampened when the amount of supply especially supply to residential sector is large finally the total length of pipes especially when the industrial water supply is high has a large impact on the supply cost the bottom panel of table 7 presents the cost elasticities with respect to residential and industrial water supply computed by eq 5 for the city year with sample median of the total water supply the estimates statistically significant at 1 level indicate that a 10 increase in residential industrial water supply leads to a 5 8 2 4 increase in the total cost urban water supply is a textbook case of natural monopoly it features significant economies of scale as the production relies on large scale networks which require extremely high initial investment whereas the daily operation of the system is much less expensive the estimated elasticities clearly demonstrate such scale economies in the urban water systems in china s context we further derive the sectoral marginal cost functions i e eq 6 for each city year with estimates from column 2 of table 7 and the estimated residuals fig 2 illustrates the marginal cost curves as well as realized quality marginal costs for three cities whose total water supply equal to 10 50 and 90 of the sample respectively despite variations in shape and placement of these curves the marginal cost curves generally exhibit a short increasing portion with small amounts of quantity and a long decreasing portion on the right 22 22 log of quantity which is present in the total cost and elasticity components of the marginal cost function increases fast when quality is small this seems to give rise to the increasing portion of the marginal cost curves at small quantities a large part of the downward sloping portion of the curves goes flat we compute the derivative of the marginal cost with respect to the quantity at the actual quantity supplied the results show that the majority of our sample city years 78 for residential supply and 94 for industrial supply are on the right of the turning points and many especially the larger cities lie on the flat portion of the curves evidence on downward sloping marginal cost curves for a regulated industry or water industry is well documented in the literature as brown caves and christensen 35 show diminishing marginal costs for both passenger and freight services in us railways and zekri and dinar 36 find a downward sloping supply curve for rural water services in tunisia 23 23 35 adopt a multiproduct cost function similar to the one used in this study while 36 estimate a log log supply function our results contribute to this literature by showing declining marginal costs for urban water supply in china 7 welfare analysis the estimation of demand and marginal cost functions allows us to determine the optimal water tariffs and the extent of deviation from the social welfare maximizing level under first best pricing in particular we examine the difference between actual water tariffs and the marginal costs estimated at the amount of water consumed for simplicity we use the constant elasticity estimates of the demand functions columns 3 and 7 in table 6 all the price related variables are in real terms panel a of table 8 reports summary statistics of the tariff marginal cost gap as a percentage of the tariff for the whole sample as well as the subsamples whose tariffs are higher or lower than the marginal costs in the case of residential water use the average margin between tariff and marginal cost is slightly positive at 2 1 and the median is 5 3 the distribution of positive and negative margins seems quite symmetric 385 city years have tariffs exceeding the estimated marginal costs while 301 have the reverse the average gaps are 29 2 for the former and 32 5 for the latter the absolute values of the medians as well as 10 percentiles and 90 percentiles are also comparable between the two subsamples for industrial water use the tariff marginal cost gaps are more skewed toward positive values with greater variation the average gap for the whole sample is 17 7 with median equal to 26 3 24 24 we drop 24 city years with negative marginal costs at the quantities consumed both considerably larger than those of residential water among 662 city year observations 470 or 71 have tariffs higher than the marginal costs with an average of 48 6 although observations with higher marginal costs account for less than 30 of the total the mean is as large as 57 9 and the marginal costs more than double the tariff in several instances the gap to tariff ratio is lower than 100 25 25 for comparison 34 studies u s water utilities in the early 1970s and finds the margins between average water price and marginal cost as a share of marginal cost which are 158 for residential sector and 40 for industrial sector next we turn to calculating the deadweight loss due to the gap between water tariff and marginal cost first the demand functions p d q f q u i t are derived from eq 2 with estimated coefficients from column 3 for residential sector and column 6 for industrial sector in table 6 marginal cost function m c q g q v i t are derived based on the estimates for eq 4 from column 2 of table 7 note that u i t and v i t in the two functions denote covariates as well as estimated residuals specific for each city year second we obtain the equilibrium quantity q i t e such that f q i t e u i t g q i t e v i t finally the deadweight loss is given by d w l i t q i t e q i t 0 f q u i t g q v i t d q where q i t 0 is the actual water consumption panel b of table 8 presents the deadweight loss as a share of the water revenue by sector on average the deadweight loss resulting from the gap between residential water tariff and marginal cost for residential water consumption equals 3 7 of revenue from water sold to residential users and 6 0 for industrial water the total deadweight loss as a percentage of total revenue is estimated at 4 4 examining the distributions suggests that 90 of city years have total deadweight loss equal or lower than 11 of total revenue with corresponding shares equal to 10 for residential sector and 15 for industrial sector moreover more than a quarter of the sample has deadweight loss below 1 for the residential sector the average deadweight loss caused by water priced higher than the marginal cost is slightly larger than that caused by downward pricing 3 9 vs 3 6 while it is the opposite case for the industrial sector 5 8 vs 6 6 the latter is partly driven by a few extreme cases with large negative gaps between tariffs and marginal costs overall the results point to moderate deadweight loss under the first best pricing and in terms of the share of revenue industrial sector incurs greater deadweight loss than residential sector does for urban water supply first best pricing may not lead to maximization of social welfare first water consumption bears a significant negative externality where groundwater constitutes an important source of urban water supply 37 accounting for the social costs of water consumption the optimal prices will exceed those obtained under first best pricing second in the absence of fixed or connection fee as the case of china water utilities will incur considerable financial loss under the first best pricing due to the natural monopoly characteristics of the industry to keep the utilities in operation the government needs to raise taxes to subsidize the utilities which has its own social cost third when the amount of non revenue water caused by system leakage is associated with the water consumed and represents a net loss to the society it is sensible to set a higher water tariff to lower water consumption so as to reduce system leakage 26 26 quantifying the welfare loss or optimal prices in the first two cases requires additional information that is beyond the scope of the paper 17 simulates scenarios with flat non revenue rate at 0 11 and linear cost function of non revenue water using estimates obtained in sections 4 and 5 the results suggest the deadweight loss could be minimized with a price higher than the first best price 8 conclusion this study attempts to answer whether water tariffs are regulated optimally in the context of china in 2000s we start with an effort to understand how urban water tariffs have been set in the context of chinese cities in the 2000s we find that water tariffs have steadily increased in both nominal and real terms in the early 2000s although the pace of adjustment slowed down after 2007 among the city level factors we examined that may affect water tariffs the single most important one is the average tariff levels of peer cities this suggests that industrial regulators may use neighboring cities information to overcome information asymmetry between the government and water utilities regarding true water supply costs although alternative estimates from a spatial autoregressive model corroborate the finding it is desirable to further pin down the peer effects in urban water tariff setting with an instrumental variable or natural experiment approach in future research when we use average tariff of peer cities as the instrumental variable for the own tariff we get iv estimates distinctive from the ols estimates which are nearly zero and statistically insignificant the iv estimation yields a price elasticity of water demand around 0 41 for both residential and industrial sectors in our favorite specifications on the supply side we estimate a translog multiproduct joint cost function and obtain evidence that the urban water services possess strong scope economies and scale economies the majority of our sample city years falls on the downward sloping segment of the marginal cost curves based on our estimation the cases of actual tariffs higher and lower than marginal costs are equally divided for residential sector whereas the incidence of higher actual tariffs accounts for 71 for the industrial sector adopting first best pricing rule the deadweight loss is estimated to be moderate for the majority of the sample this may be explained by the inelasticity of water demand relatively small gaps between the actual tariffs and marginal costs and downward slope of the marginal cost curves these results remind us that whether water tariffs are set properly should be assessed on a case by case basis with a careful account of both water demand and supply it is not socially optimal for the government to maintain static water tariffs out of political concern or for the utilities with information advantages to demand extraordinarily high tariffs due to data limitation our welfare assessment is restricted up to the year 2007 available data suggests that the local governments in china have slowed down the pace of adjusting water tariffs after 2007 our analysis implies that social welfare loss would have increased as a result of changing demand and or supply conditions while the tariffs were kept low statement all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript being submitted they

8662,during the 2011 2017 drought in california water providers used a variety of demand side management dsm policies to successfully reduce water consumption by over 20 unfortunately because utilities used numerous conservation policies simultaneously little is known about support for specific policies specifically an untested water budgeting policy wherein utilities gave households an allotment of water and charged higher prices for water used in excess of the budget california recently legislated mandatory long term reductions in water usage it is therefore critical to obtain a better understanding of which policies including water budgeting have strongest public support and to understand how the drought experience changed residents water use behaviors attitudes beliefs habits and personal capabilities surrounding conservation this work surveyed individuals residing in northern california the north state during a period of severe drought we used best worst scaling to determine households preferences for dsm policies asked households how their water use behaviors changed and evaluated psychological attitudes toward drought and water conservation results show the vast majority of households changed their water use behaviors during the drought over two thirds of respondents never exceeded their water budgets and said they would continue to conserve after the state lifted conservation requirements respondents preferred water budgets relative to more familiar dsm policies a result with implications for forecasting future water demand last our survey finds only minor differences in policy preferences for respondents with different demographics and attitudes toward water use even for variables e g income that previous literature has found to have disparate welfare effects across users keywords water conservation best worst scaling conservation attitudes water use psychology water economics 1 introduction from 2011 to 2017 california faced a severe drought that spurred unprecedented calls for water conservation conservation was mandated not only in southern california where water use planning has historically used demand side management policies but also in northern california where many such polices especially watering restrictions have been used less often the historical need for demand side management has been low given that this area referred to as the north state averages over 20 inches of rain in non drought years restriction based policies during the drought included limits on days of the week and times for outdoor watering bans on use of water for certain uses e g washing one s driveway and restrictions on technologies for hoses and for irrigation systems on new homes incentive based policies varied across municipal water providers many chose to increase water prices and implement water budgets where households were asked to conserve a given percentage relative to the household s individualized 2013 water usage overall these policies were extremely effective in reducing average statewide water consumption by 30 in the summer months of 2016 relative to 2013 water use according to the 1 though conservation policies were successful we know little about households support for specific water policies or how households changed specific water use behaviors during the drought despite this gap in existing knowledge california legislation passed in 2018 will require all regions of the state to make permanent reductions in per capita water use 2 to do so all water providers must create urban water use objectives goals for municipal water conservation based on a baseline of 55 gallon per capita per day for indoor usage plus an allotment for outdoor usage based on the topographic climactic conditions in the service area water providers must also show how they will decrease demand during droughts from this baseline of reduced water usage compared to current values and providers who do not comply with their objective will be subject to conservation orders imposed by the state in the year 2026 for the utility desiring to use these individual policies to achieve this goal all dsm options have pros and cons with respect to balancing utilities conservation goals with abilities to forecast future demand and stabilize long run revenues for instance policies that cause large decreases in usage also cause utility revenues to decline whereas price increases and watering restrictions may lead to less certain reductions in demand if for example households simply pay more and continue to use large volumes of water for irrigation 3 the alternative water budget approach attempts to balance these factors by setting a goal for conservation for each household generally 80 of pre drought usage and only increasing the per unit price of water if households exceed their allotted budget thus assuming households do not largely exceed their budgets the state can be reasonably assured of the quantity of water that will be conserved and forecast both demand and utility revenues however success of the program depends upon households acceptance of this idea of shared conservation i e will they comply with the water budget which is not the same for all households the objectives of this study are as follows first we determine how the drought experience changed residents water use behaviors and attitudes second we evaluate how support for a novel water budget approach used for the first time during the 2015 drought compared to support for more traditional demand side management policies last we wished to evaluate how demographics attitudes and psychological factors affect policy preferences to answer these questions we surveyed nearly 400 north state households we asked individuals how they changed their water use behaviors and used psychological attitudinal questions to evaluate how the drought changed beliefs about water use and conservation to evaluate preferences for demand side management policies respondents completed a best worst scaling survey 4 and policy preference rankings are estimated using a sequential best worst multinomial logit model 5 we then include demographic variables in the model and discuss what variables especially those most relevant to water managers impact policy preferences understanding how the drought changed behaviors and cultivated support for policies like water budgets which require collective buy in i e the consumer stays within his or her budget for water will inform how water providers may meet legislated water reduction requirements and respond to future droughts 1 1 the 2015 2017 drought the severe drought that peaked in 2015 in northern california actually began in fall of 2011 low levels of precipitation and record breaking average annual temperatures continued until january of 2014 when governor jerry brown declared a drought emergency the state implemented several key regulatory measures thereafter in april 2015 over three years into the drought the state water board mandated an overall 25 reduction in statewide water use relative to 2013 pre drought levels to achieve this goal municipal water providers serving over 3 000 customers were assigned to one of nine conservation tiers each with a unique required level of conservation e g a region with lower per capita water use would be required to conserve less than a region with higher water users heavy precipitation in the spring of 2016 allowed the state to relax conservation requirements for providers who could pass a stress test i e demonstrate the ability to provide water to citizens despite the ongoing drought after a record precipitation in the 2016 2017 water year october 2016 september 2017 emergency conservation regulations were lifted but the state issued an executive order requiring conservation to be made a way of life in california 6 to achieve regional state directed water reductions many water providers used water budgets for the first time as part of their overall dsm portfolio water utilities gave each household a budget for conservation equal to a percentage roughly of 80 of pre drought usage for most water providers in the north state for water usage any water used in excess of the budget would have a higher per ccf centrum cubic foot price budgets for allowed water use varied across service areas in alignment with state mandated conservation requirements that varied across regions providers generally used water budgets in addition to block rate pricing structures wherein the marginal price of water increases at higher consumption levels see ref 7 for a summary of alternative water pricing structures lastly non price conservation programs e g rebates for more efficient watering technology media information campaigns reminding residents of the social need to conserve water audits to detect water waste were used statewide overall use of these policies led the majority of water providers to meet state mandated monthly conservation goals and even to continue to conserve in excess of 20 relative to pre drought water usage in the summer of 2017 after mandatory conservation requirements ended as an example from our area of interest average water use declined in the chico area served by the california water company by approximately 32 during the period of mandatory conservation over the course of the drought 8 1 2 water conservation policies there is a rich water literature on use of demand side management policies and their implications both for the consumer i e welfare effects and for the utility policy effectiveness and revenue implications commonly studies policies include increases in the marginal price of water per unit increases in based charges fixed fees charged regardless of the volume of consumption and fixed fees base charges use of block rate pricing structures usually increasing block rates where the marginal price of water increases as consumption increases and watering restrictions limiting times or uses of water however what constitutes policy success is not always clear as reductions in water usage can have varying implications both for the consumer and for the water utility that must have sufficient revenues to cover supply costs we refer the reader to ref 9 for an overview of dsm policies and to refs 10 11 for an examination of the welfare effects of price versus non price based conservation programs we present a brief overview of this literature here 1 2 1 welfare effects of demand side management policies in terms of consumer welfare researchers have found that incentive based approaches like block rate pricing and increases in the marginal price of water maximize consumer welfare compared to regulatory type measures for example increasing block rates wherein the marginal price of water increases with consumption allow those who greatly value water usage i e are willing to pay higher prices for water to exceed the restriction constraint while households with lower willingness to pay will reduce consumption block rates also benefit lower income users in that they charge a lower marginal price for an amount of water deemed necessary for basic indoor uses 11 last instead of changing the marginal price of water utilities may increase fixed fees base charges that charge a fixed rate regardless of use such charges are generally more harmful for low income users and allow high volume users to use water without facing the cost of that consumption 12 in contrast to the above incentive based approaches watering restrictions may decrease consumer welfare by limiting the amount of water that can be used or restricting types of uses e g car washing even for those who would be willing to pay to use more water the water budget approach is a blend of these approaches allowing all individual users a given amount of water based on household needs and penalizing households via increased marginal prices for excess use to date little work has evaluated welfare implications of the water budget approach but a recent study by ref 13 suggests the water budget approach has similar welfare effects as increasing block rate price structures however 14 recently found that the water budgeting system led to greater welfare losses in areas of northern california because more water is used in this region for indoor purposes e g washing clothes showering compared to the southern regions of the state in contrast households with greater irrigation usage may decrease consumption with less lost welfare 1 2 2 impact of dsm on the utility from utilities perspectives policies must be evaluated both in terms of their success in decreasing water consumption and in terms of how they will impact utilities revenues for example watering restrictions typically limit households watering to specific days or times of the day however consumers who do not buy into the need for shared conservation or have acute awareness or social memory of drought 15 could simply choose to water more intensely during their allowed times days increasing prices can also have unintended consequences for the utility consumers could continue their patterns of water usage and pay a higher bill on the other hand they might decrease their consumption dramatically with negative implications for utility revenues 16 1 2 3 water budgets and the need to understand policy preferences water budgets are beneficial in that they allow utilities to reasonably predict demand and stabilize revenues so long as households comply with the budget this is a major advantage compared to other pricing policies that induce conservation but may decrease utility revenues forcing water managers to increase water prices even though consumers effectively conserved 16 nevertheless we do not yet know if customers see the budget system as unfair given that it allows those who previously used large volumes of water often for irrigation purposes others might see as wasteful larger budgets based on this need we also need to know the extent to which california households were aware of complied with the water budget system and how psychological factors attitudes may have influenced this support and compliance the context in which a utility calls for conservation can have large impact on how consumers respond to demand side management policies stone goemans and costanigro 2020 and consumer s acceptance and adherence to policies is fundamental to the utility s ability to forecast water demands 1 3 using psychology to predict water use behaviors previous research in the field of psychology help us understand water conservation behaviors in particular 17 argue that attitudes e g evaluations norms or values surrounding water conservation beliefs e g one s ecological worldview as it pertains to water scarcity habits e g regular behavioral patterns surrounding water use and sociodemographic variables e g age education or income are predictors of successful water conservation in general research has found favorable public support for water conservation policies at the local state and regional level 18 moreover attitudes continue to serve as robust predictors of actual water use 19 with higher levels of environmental and conservation concerns showing an association with lower water end use 20 attitudes are also contextualized by environmental conditions such as location e g urban vs rural 21 and other local e g place attachment and global e g climate change beliefs factors 22 within the western united states environmental beliefs predict water conservation behaviors e g taking shorter showers 23 and support for policies that restrict water use 24 homeowners who perceive environmental and social factors as being of greater importance use significantly less water than homeowners who emphasize cost and convenience as motivations for conservation 25 26 even show that households in environmentally concerned communities have higher price elasticities of demand during severe water shortages last habitual behaviors i e frequent automatic and cued responding have been shown to explain a significant proportion of variance in water use behavior after controlling for attitudinal and belief factors 19 conversely 27 found that habit strength operationalized as the degree to which respondents felt their water use behaviors were automatic or habitual did predict water conservation efforts however habit strength did significantly interact with intentions and household size a more recent study by ref 28 identified habitual behaviors as the strongest predictor of water use intentions and self reported water bills further underscoring the significance of consumer behavior as contrasted by attitudes or beliefs in water conservation efforts 1 4 sociodemographic predictors of water use we refer the reader to fielding et al 2012 for a thorough review of the sociodemographic variables that impact water use as one might expect income lot size home square footage and number of members in a household are associated with increased water usage in addition to other psychological factors sociodemographic variables such as age income and education are important predictors of conservation and use behaviors 17 for example older individuals use more water per household 19 income is also associated with greater water use despite the financial capability of installing water efficiency devices e g ref 29 moreover 30 reported that wealthier individuals self reported longer shower durations this is termed the rebound effect wherein making a home more water efficient actually makes one s current water less expensive which in turn increases water use as such households support for the idea of shared conservation and compliance with utility policies can have a large impact on water use irrespective of underlying demographics especially for households with higher incomes and initial water use higher education levels also predicted greater water use makki et al however 31 found no evidence linking educational level and water consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 best worst scaling we used sequential best worst scaling to assess preferences for actual policies used in the northern california during the drought in a best worst scaling choice task with five options respondents choose their most and least preferred options they then choose their second most and second least options these sequential choices best worst second best and second worst allow the researcher to obtain an overall ranking of the five alternatives without respondents having to actually rank options at once research has shown that the cognitive burden of this approach is lower than a traditional 1 5 ranking exercise 4 given that respondents are only required to choose their most and least preferred options from any given choice set best worst scaling assumes that the utility an individual i receives from consumption of a good j is a function of the characteristics of that good j here the good j in question is the mix of policies used by the water provider therefore utility is a function of the individual policies implemented at specific levels ζ i z i 1 z i m z i m included in each best worst scaling choice task such that u i z j θ ε i the best worst scaling choice task asks participants to rank their most and least preferred options in a choice set if a specific attribute k is chosen as most preferred and l is chosen as least preferred this means that the difference in utility provided by this attribute pair is larger than that for any other combination in the choice set see ref 32 under the assumption that errors are gumbel distributed the probability of an overall ranking of alternatives a b c d e based on a series of best worst choices may be estimated via a sequential best worst multinomial logit 5 this model has an advantage over a rank ordered logit in that it reflects the actual choice task faced by respondents where a best and then worst option is chosen in order to achieve an overall ranking of options if we indicate each impact as z i m and let θ m represent the associated marginal utility the probability of observing the sequence a b c d e based on individuals repeated best worst choices is 1 p a b c d e exp z i a θ z m a b c d e exp z i m θ m exp z i e θ z m b c d e exp z i m θ m exp z i b θ z m b c d exp z i m θ m exp z i d θ z m c d exp z i m θ m where utility is positive for best choices and negative for worst choices 2 2 survey administration and participants we chose to obtain a sample from the north state specifically counties in the sacramento hydrologic basin because most cities counties in this area faced similar water shortages and used similar conservation policies during the drought per capita water consumption in the north state has historically been higher than use in drier regions where demand side management policies e g restrictions on watering promotion of xeriscape landscaping are heavily used this is due to the fact that as an example the city of sacramento averages approximately 20 inches of rain in non drought years this relative historical abundance of water has allowed per capita water use in the north state to be double the average usage in drier regions 33 the survey was administered via qualtrics panels qualtrics inc provo ut to a sample of n 363 individuals currently residing in 18 counties comprising the sacramento hydrologic basin in northern california this area includes 18 counties many of which comprise less than 1 of the total basin population given the low population numbers in these more rural areas whose residents are also less likely to use municipal water and have used water budgets we chose to use sacramento county demographics to guide our stratified sampling technique 1 1 ideally we would have a sample wherein the demographic characteristics of our respondents and the share of those respondents from individual counties would be representative of the overall sacramento hydrologic basin region we sampled unfortunately it was extremely difficult for us to obtain enough observations from the very rural counties and even the larger counties like butte and this is why we asked qualtrics to stratify the demographics based on sacramento county only we were comfortable with this decision for two reasons first our goal is to represent the population served by the generally large municipal water providers who used water budgets during the drought at the same time we did not want to exclude residents from more rural counties who might have faced new municipal water policies during the drought i e rural residents who are not served by wells given these realities the only way to make a true representative sample and demographic comparison of our sample to the population would be to know the demographics of the non well water users within each county of the sacramento hydrologic basin as such comparing our sample to demographics for these rural counties as a whole might be misleading because only a small share of residents in many counties use municipal water sources we compare demographics only for sacramento county the most urban of our sampled counties comprising approximately 40 of the basin s population to our sample in table 2 sacramento county as a share of all urban water users not served by wells is a much higher percentage of the population of interest though it is impossible to know the exact share we claim only that our survey reflects the water use habits and preferences of a majority of municipal water users who faced the novel water budgets during california s 2015 2016 drought qualtrics inc used a stratified sampling technique to ensure that our sample represents the demographic characteristics of the water users in sacramento county for age gender and income table 2 shows survey demographics for our sample compared to those for sacramento county the most populous county in our sample comprising roughly 40 of the basin s population as of the last census 34 as seen in table 2 demographics for our survey sample largely align with those of sacramento county with the exception that our sample has a slightly larger percentage of higher income individuals earning 100 000 or more relative to lower income 25 000 49 999 all survey results were obtained from december 2015 january 2016 we also wished to evaluate preferences only for relatively informed participants to this end we screened respondents out of the survey if they were not aware of their water bills or if water budgets were not used by their water providers from the perspective of the water utility all water savings during drought must come from households cognizant of changes in utility policies meant to spur conservation in our service area these policy responsive residents had the burden of decreasing consumption by approximately 20 relative to pre drought levels because the subset of what we may call aware consumers are those most likely to change their water behaviors we chose to ask only these consumers about their water use behaviors and water policy preferences 2 2 in our survey 24 of initial pre screening respondents said they were either unaware of water budget policies used by their utility and or whether they paid drought surcharges or that their water provider did not use water budgets of those whose utilities did use water budgets and drought surcharges only 14 of respondents were unaware of whether their usage caused them to exceed their budget admittedly this may bias our results to reflect the preferences of consumers who are more likely to respond to utility policies however this is less of a concern given that approximately 75 of pre screening survey respondents were aware of the new water budget policies being used 2 3 survey instrument 2 3 1 sociodemographic variables sociodemographic variables included age gender annual income highest level of education completed type of household e g single family ownership status rent own number of occupants in household years of residence in current household years of residence in california and county of residence participants were eligible to join the study if they indicated current residence in one of the 18 counties in the sacramento hydrologic basin butte colusa el dorado glenn lake lassen napa nevada placer plumas sacramento shasta siskiyou solano sutter tehama yolo or yuba 2 3 2 water use characteristics we asked participants whether their water provider was an investor owned utility or a municipal water provider expenditures related to water use were assessed by asking how participants paid for their water flat fees versus volume based charges the cost of their average bills during summer months may to august and the cost of their average bills during winter months november to february we also asked respondents how frequently they paid drought surcharges for exceeding their monthly water budgets last we asked residents to report the cost of their drought surcharge price of over budget water use per ccf and to recall the total amount they paid in drought surcharges per month on average 2 3 3 water use habits we asked participants to identify all of the measures they had taken to decrease water use during the 2015 2016 drought measures included decreasing the frequency duration of outdoor irrigation decreasing water usage for daily activities showering dishes laundry and other indoor water uses installing new water efficient appliances installing new water efficient landscaping technologies more efficient sprinklers drip systems and changing one s landscaping replacing lawn and other vegetation with drought resistant landscaping i e xeriscaping participants were also asked about their current water use habits i e following the lifting of mandatory water restrictions by the state using the same response options 2 3 4 water use attitudes and beliefs we assess water use attitudes and beliefs using a five point bipolar scale strongly disagree to strongly agree specifically participants were asked to rate their agreement with 15 statements surrounding water use attitudes and beliefs 2 3 5 best worst scaling choice task over the course of the drought the state set regulations for individual water providers mandating they decrease consumption in their service area by roughly 20 30 policies each with two levels of implementation and expected to have similar impacts on demand as the water budget formed the upper and lower bounds for policy levels used in the best worst scaling choice task the set of all 5 polices at their two levels of implementation was used to create the experimental design for the choice task table 1 prior to completing the best worst scaling choice task participants saw the following information regarding the above mentioned policies in the following series of questions you will be asked to choose which conservation policies you most and least prefer many of these options may have been used in the past or are currently used by your water provider potential policy options include the following mandatory watering restrictions the number of days of allowed watering each week is restricted to 2 or 3 days voluntary watering reductions you are asked to voluntarily conserve water decreasing usage relative to 2013 pre drought levels by 15 or 30 increased based charges fixed service costs on your water bill the base cost of service on your water bill regardless of how much water you use is increased by 7 50 or 15 funds may be used for conservation programs rebate programs for water efficient appliances turf replacement water audits or to pay for increasing costs of water delivery use of water budgets you are given a budget that reduces your allowed water usage by 15 or 30 relative to pre drought levels if you exceed this budget you will pay a drought surcharge of 5 for additional ccf of water used over the budget increases in the marginal price of water the per unit price ccf of water is increased by 15 or 30 your choices here are critical if water providers are to determine the best means of coping with drought and balancing water supplies with future water demands in the north state choice sets were created using a sequential fractional factorial experimental design see ref 35 on optimal designs yielding eight potential choice sets to ease the cognitive burden on respondents and decrease survey length choice sets were blocked so that each respondent only faced four choices participants chose the most and least preferred followed by second most and second least preferred options in each choice set allowing for a full ranking of the included policy options a sample choice set appears in fig 1 thus each respondent made four choices per choice set yielding 16 total observations per respondent 2 4 econometric model the dependent variable for the sequential best worst multinomial logit is a variable that takes on a value of one if the attribute in question was chosen as most least preferred and zero otherwise this choice is a function of the level of the attribute that appeared in each choice set such that total utility can be defined as 2 z i θ r e s t r i c t l o w i r e s t r i c t h i g h i v o l u n t a r y l o w i v o l u n t a r y h i g h i b a s e l o w i b a s e h i g h i b u d g e t l o w i p r i c e l o w i p r i c e h i g h i where for an individual i only one level of each policy e g either water 3days or water 2days appeared in each choice set and the raw data was coded as 1 for presence and 0 for absence of a specific level of each attribute the water budget 30 attribute level is omitted from the specification thus estimated coefficients are as more less preferred than the water budget requiring 30 reductions in water usage this approximates the water budget policy implemented in our region in order to estimate associations between demographic variables and policy preferences we estimated models including policy demographic interaction terms for variables such as age income education and gender we also sought to include terms related to the psychological variables e g households who agreed that the 2015 2016 drought changed how they think about water use demographic and attitudinal variables are described in table 1 however the number of demographic and psychological variables would require an inordinately large number of interaction terms 3 3 we initially took two approaches to further exploring policy preferences first we used factor analysis to determine if we could identify unique factors i e latent types of water users associated with variation in the demographic psychological questions included in the survey surprisingly factor analysis did not identify unique factors though a few variables had high factor loadings i e the factors were not unique but a few variables of policy interest were relatively more likely to define one type of consumer than others we therefore used principal component analysis pca based on a polychoric correlation matrix 36 principal component analysis takes a correlation matrix and condenses the total variance covariance across variables into a reduced number of components which explain the total variance present in the original data unlike cluster or factor analysis components do not relate to a latent variable type but when included as interaction terms with our policy variables allow us to overcome multicollinearity problems and determine if there is heterogeneity in policy preferences in association with demographic psychological variables last we estimated policy ranking models for key variables of policy interest i e demographic groups for whom the welfare effects of demand side management policies vary first we estimated separate models for high and low income individuals defined as earning greater than 100 000 and less than 25 000 a year respectively income is of interest because we might expect high income users to strongly prefer voluntary restrictions or the water budget approach to policies that would force them to pay more for all units of water or curb water use drastically i e no allowed budget for use conversely low income users might not support the budget approach because it seems unfair to allow high users to keep using relatively more water it may also be more difficult for low income users to reduce water use as they tend to have less outdoor irrigation in addition to the models capturing income disparity three models focused on respondents who 1 believed the drought was not associated with climate change 2 never paid drought surcharges always stayed under their budget and 3 paid over 30 an average per month in drought surcharges we expect individuals who do not believe the drought is related to climate change might be less supportive of the collective water budget approach that makes conservation a shared goal though we have no clear a priori expectation for these individuals we would also expect those who stayed under their water budgets to have different policy preferences from those who frequently paid large amounts in drought surcharges 3 results 3 1 sociodemographic variables respondent demographics are

structure 77 69 never paid a drought surcharge 69 70 or paid less than 10 on average in drought surcharges per month 76 86 respondents were most likely to pay between 60 and 120 per month for water during the summer irrigation season and between 30 and 60 per month for water during the winter season 3 3 water use habits table 4 shows reported drought related changes in water use habits when asked to select all the ways in which they reduced water during the drought 79 61 of participants said they saved water by reducing frequency duration of outdoor watering and 68 60 also reduced water used for daily typically indoor activities showering dishes less than 20 of respondents said they installed new water efficient appliances or landscaping technologies or converted to drought resistant landscaping i e xeriscaping just slightly more than 5 of the sample did not change their water usage significantly as a result of the drought similar percentages of participants reported that they planned to continue conservation behaviors for both irrigation and indoor water usage even after the state lifted mandatory watering reductions table 5 only 4 68 of participants said that they would increase or plan to increase their water usage if the state signaled that the drought was over 3 4 water use attitudes and beliefs fig 2 shows participants attitudes and beliefs surrounding water use and conservation policies with respect to local governmental and provider measures the majority of participants 50 at least agreed that their local government was adequately concerned about conservation during the drought 58 56 and that their water provider should promote voluntary conservation even if the drought ends 66 2 participants were less likely to agree however that their water provider should penalize consumers who fail to conserve water or that the use of water budgets and drought surcharges is fair 34 53 and 26 52 at least somewhat disagreed with these statements respectively despite these minority attitudes against punitive approaches to promote water conservation most participants at least somewhat agreed that the measures taken by their local water management services had helped them to conserve more water than they would have otherwise 62 53 other statements emphasized an ecological perspective on water as a natural resource and environmental conditions surrounding the drought the majority of participants 50 at least somewhat agreed that water should be free 51 52 conversely 65 01 at least somewhat disagreed that water is an unlimited resource participants were less likely to agree or disagree that the drought was over 19 83 endorsed neither agree nor disagree the majority of participants at least somewhat agreed that the drought was symptomatic of global climate change caused by humans 56 36 and that it was part of the natural water cycle of scarcity and abundance 60 88 contextual factors were viewed either as neutral or influential in participants decisions about water conservation the statement that drought resistant landscaping xeriscaping is less attractive than traditional landscaping was neither agreed with nor disagreed with by nearly 25 of the sample 23 48 social factors were slightly more influential nearly two thirds of participants 66 11 at least somewhat agreed that the drought would have been less severe if everyone had conserved as much as they did however over 25 26 45 neither agreed nor disagreed that they felt compelled to say something if someone else was wasting water finally the drought appeared to significantly impact participants attitudes and habits surrounding water conservation the majority of the sample 50 at least somewhat agreed that the 2015 2016 drought had changed the way they think about the availability of water 81 55 with 89 78 of participants indicating that they would continue to conserve water even after mandatory watering restrictions are lifted 3 5 best worst scaling choice task table 6 shows results for the best worst scaling choice task results summarizing policy rankings are also shown in fig 3 in table 6 coefficient estimates which reveal the strength of preferences for each policy are estimated relative to the omitted policy variable water budgets requiring 30 reductions in usage positive coefficients indicate that a policy was preferred to the 30 water budget while negative coefficients indicate that a policy was less preferred to the 30 water budget coefficients are presented in order of their rankings from the most preferred to the least preferred policy the overall ordering of policies fig 3 from most to least preferred was charge 15 00 price 30 budget reduce30 budget reduce15 charge 7 50 price 15 water 3days water 2days volutaryhigh and reduce 15 however the only variables with statistically significant p values were price 15 reduce 15 reduce 30 water 3days and water 2days all of which were less preferred to the 15 water budget this means households ranked all other policies including the water budget policies as on par with more commonly used policies like increases in prices and base charges one very surprising result is that the policies seen as equivalent to the 30 water budget are those that would have increased costs for the average respondent as much as or even more than the water budget approach for instance in our sample approximately 76 of respondents said they never paid more than 10 in drought surcharges and the average summer water bill in our sample was reported as 60 90 per month this implies a minimum of 20 in increased costs if prices were increased 30 similarly base charges of 7 50 and 15 00 were equally preferred to use of water budgets these findings mean households support use of policies that are even more aggressive in terms of their costs than use of water budgets however they did not support use of either voluntary or mandatory watering restrictions or lower level price increases 3 6 exploratory principal component analyses five components those with eigenvalues greater than one were identified through pca full pca results are presented in appendix 1 table 7 summarizes the pca analysis component 1 finds a positive association between high positive factor loadings age income and education and high negative loading for surcharge amount i e there is a positive correlation between age income and education and not having to pay surcharges for overusing water component 2 shows positive correlations between believing the drought is over that it was caused by natural variations in climate and feeling compelled to pressure neighbors to conserve water component 3 shows a positive association between gender being female higher income and education stating the drought changed how one used water and believing the drought is not over component 4 has negative loadings for wateruse perception and voluntary reduce and a positive loading for feel compelled thus this component shows correlations between stating the drought did not change how one used water that one would not voluntary reduced after the drought but also feeling compelled to say something if others wasted water last component 5 showed a positive large coefficient for surcharge amount and gender i e positive association between being male and paying drought surcharges 3 7 results for sequential best worst multinomial logit with pca interaction terms table 8 shows results for the policy preference model including an interaction term for each component x policy significant p values less than 0 10 for a component x policy term mean that the component had a significant impact on preferences for that policy a priori we expected the components associated with staying within one s water budget component 1 and believing the drought changed how they used water components 3 and 4 might have preferences for the budgets or even for price increases i e the most aggressive policies in the sense that they force individuals to reduce use or pay conversely we expected component 5 with a positive association between being male and paying more in surcharges to prefer the policies with no enforcement mechanism e g watering restrictions in comparing the expanded interaction term model table 8 to our base model table 6 aic and bic values are actually higher for the expanded model similarly only 3 component policy interaction terms are statistically significant at with greater than ninety percent confidence significant terms are as follows the interaction term for component 3 x budget reduce15 is positive meaning this component higher income believing the drought is not over stating the drought changed how one uses water is associated with preference for a 15 water budget as opposed to the 30 reductions implemented the term component 4 x price 15 is positive meaning low level price increases are preferred to the water budget for this component stating the drought did not change how one used water and that they will not continue to conserve post drought last the term component 5x price 30 is positive indicating a preference for high level price increases for the component associated with males who paid more in drought surcharges the variable component interaction terms that were significant generally support an idea that those who believed the drought would continue and require permanent changes in water use or paid more in drought surcharges supported use of lower level water budgets or price increases as opposed to the water budget that would reduce consumption by 30 overall however results show extremely little heterogeneity in policy preferences in association with our demographic and attitudinal variables 3 8 results for sequential best worst multinomial logit estimated for variables of interest to water managers results for the models estimated for variables of policy interest are presented in table 9 high income users 20 43 of the sample had identical preferences to those estimated for the base model save for the coefficient for charge 7 50 was negative and statistically significant and budget reduce15 was positive and significant this means these users would have preferred lower level water budgets but not lower level base charges a priori we had expected high income users to strongly prefer voluntary restrictions or flat increases in base charges to policies that would force them to pay more for all units of water e g prices or curb water use drastically i e no allowed budget for use low income users had similar preferences to those for the group as a whole with two exceptions first mandatory watering restrictions at the low or high level were not less preferred to the pricing budget policies as was the case for the sample as a whole second the coefficient for budget reduce15 was negative and significant p value of 0 1 i e these users said lower level water budgets would be less preferred to higher level this is also surprising given that we expected lower income households to have the most difficulty complying with water budgets next policy rankings are estimated for individuals who believed the drought was symptomatic of natural cycles in precipitation not climate change we expected these individuals to be less supportive of the collective water budget approach that makes conservation a shared goal as seen in table 9 these individuals also have similar preferences to other groups save for the negative coefficient for budget reduce15 and strong highly significant coefficient for price 30 these results suggest these users would actually strongly support using more aggressive policies like high level price increases during shortages next table 9 shows results for individuals who paid an average of more than 30 a month in over budget charges compared to those for individuals who never exceeded their water budget those who paid over budget charges who we might call the unsuccessful conservers have positive and significant coefficient for charge 15 00 and negative and significant coefficient for price 15 thus these users would have preferred a flat high increase in base fees each month i e a policy in line with the fees they ended up paying anyhow because they exceeded their budgets last those that did not pay drought surcharges have positive and significant coefficients for charge 15 00 and price 30 surprisingly these are policies that would have actually been more expensive for these successful conservers than the water budget approach though there is no way to know the true reason for these results we hypothesize that these individuals who successfully stayed within their budgets may believe higher water users should have to pay more for all water used during drought and think higher prices wouldn t affect them greatly given their ability to conserve 4 discussion in this work we fielded a survey during the unprecedented drought in northern california to evaluate how the drought altered households stated water use behaviors and attitudes we used a best worst scaling choice task to determine how acceptance of water budgeting implemented by many utilities for the first time compared to preferences for more traditional demand side management policies our results overwhelmingly show that the vast majority of respondents changed their water use complied with their water budgets felt a shared need to conserve and stated the drought had changed how they felt about water use in northern california multinomial logit models estimated for the best worst scaling choice task showed that households supported the use of water budgets that force households to either reduce water use or pay higher costs even compared to free policies like voluntary watering restrictions in fact support for water budgets was not significantly different from that of more traditional dsm policies i e increases in marginal prices even though the budget system allows households baseline water consumption based on prior usage potentially giving those who previously used excess water a larger drought budget these findings were largely consistent regardless of demographics and attitudes perceptions on conservation and drought in general even though we might expect to have varying preferences based on the known welfare effects of policies in fact results were so consistent that nearly all our analysis aimed at identifying households with unique demographic psychological profiles and corresponding unique policy preferences were statistically insignificant in the model with interaction terms for all of our pca identified component variable interaction terms only three of these terms were statistically significant these results generally showed that those who believed the drought would continue had higher incomes and paid more in drought surcharges would have preferred either 15 water budgets or price increases while it is impossible to know the reason for this preference these users may have believed they would have paid less or had less pressure to reduce consumption under these alternative policies even when we estimated policy preference models for key groups whom we would expect to have distinct policy preferences e g low and high income users we find only minor differences compared to our base model while it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why psychological variables were not significant predictors in the present study one possibility is that the media s ability to focus the public s attention on the need to conserve as an emergency situation created a shared conservation ethos that outweighed individuals previously held water use beliefs this is consistent with a finding by ref 37 who found that water conservation in the san francisco bay area was strongly correlated to news coverage of drought leading to water conservation even before the state local water providers implemented conservation policies anecdotally based on conversations with representatives of the california water service company it was not unusual for higher income residents to over water landscaping on allowed watering days leading to increases in water usage after watering day restrictions were implemented if this is the case it makes sense that a pro conservation public would see such policies as less effective in promoting a shared responsibility for reducing water usage during a severe shortage overall our survey results imply use of water budget policies can be a successful part of northern california utilities strategies for meeting state conservation goals while support for water budgets does not necessarily mean households will comply with them versus simply paying more for over budget water use over two thirds of households reported that they never exceeded their water budgets given that aggregate water usage goals were met by nearly all water providers in our area of interest this compliance also means water utilities can make reasonable projections for future revenues further work should be aimed at quantifying the welfare impacts of water budgets relative to policies like price increases and watering restrictions limitations of our work are as follows first sociodemographic variables water use characteristics and water use habits were self reported and therefore difficult to verify ideally we would connect households survey results to their water bills to see if they actually achieved self reported decreases in water use next nearly 60 of participants reported currently residing in sacramento county while this is somewhat expected since sacramento is the most populous metropolitan area in the region greater representation from outlying rural areas with non well water sources would have been beneficial in identifying potential differences with consumers in urban and suburban areas finally the survey was administered to participants following an extended period of unexpected and significant rainfall volumes in the region after five years of drought although it is possible that participants responses were influenced by the proximate environmental conditions our data are suggestive of an enduring pattern of water conservation credit author statement janine stone

8662,during the 2011 2017 drought in california water providers used a variety of demand side management dsm policies to successfully reduce water consumption by over 20 unfortunately because utilities used numerous conservation policies simultaneously little is known about support for specific policies specifically an untested water budgeting policy wherein utilities gave households an allotment of water and charged higher prices for water used in excess of the budget california recently legislated mandatory long term reductions in water usage it is therefore critical to obtain a better understanding of which policies including water budgeting have strongest public support and to understand how the drought experience changed residents water use behaviors attitudes beliefs habits and personal capabilities surrounding conservation this work surveyed individuals residing in northern california the north state during a period of severe drought we used best worst scaling to determine households preferences for dsm policies asked households how their water use behaviors changed and evaluated psychological attitudes toward drought and water conservation results show the vast majority of households changed their water use behaviors during the drought over two thirds of respondents never exceeded their water budgets and said they would continue to conserve after the state lifted conservation requirements respondents preferred water budgets relative to more familiar dsm policies a result with implications for forecasting future water demand last our survey finds only minor differences in policy preferences for respondents with different demographics and attitudes toward water use even for variables e g income that previous literature has found to have disparate welfare effects across users keywords water conservation best worst scaling conservation attitudes water use psychology water economics 1 introduction from 2011 to 2017 california faced a severe drought that spurred unprecedented calls for water conservation conservation was mandated not only in southern california where water use planning has historically used demand side management policies but also in northern california where many such polices especially watering restrictions have been used less often the historical need for demand side management has been low given that this area referred to as the north state averages over 20 inches of rain in non drought years restriction based policies during the drought included limits on days of the week and times for outdoor watering bans on use of water for certain uses e g washing one s driveway and restrictions on technologies for hoses and for irrigation systems on new homes incentive based policies varied across municipal water providers many chose to increase water prices and implement water budgets where households were asked to conserve a given percentage relative to the household s individualized 2013 water usage overall these policies were extremely effective in reducing average statewide water consumption by 30 in the summer months of 2016 relative to 2013 water use according to the 1 though conservation policies were successful we know little about households support for specific water policies or how households changed specific water use behaviors during the drought despite this gap in existing knowledge california legislation passed in 2018 will require all regions of the state to make permanent reductions in per capita water use 2 to do so all water providers must create urban water use objectives goals for municipal water conservation based on a baseline of 55 gallon per capita per day for indoor usage plus an allotment for outdoor usage based on the topographic climactic conditions in the service area water providers must also show how they will decrease demand during droughts from this baseline of reduced water usage compared to current values and providers who do not comply with their objective will be subject to conservation orders imposed by the state in the year 2026 for the utility desiring to use these individual policies to achieve this goal all dsm options have pros and cons with respect to balancing utilities conservation goals with abilities to forecast future demand and stabilize long run revenues for instance policies that cause large decreases in usage also cause utility revenues to decline whereas price increases and watering restrictions may lead to less certain reductions in demand if for example households simply pay more and continue to use large volumes of water for irrigation 3 the alternative water budget approach attempts to balance these factors by setting a goal for conservation for each household generally 80 of pre drought usage and only increasing the per unit price of water if households exceed their allotted budget thus assuming households do not largely exceed their budgets the state can be reasonably assured of the quantity of water that will be conserved and forecast both demand and utility revenues however success of the program depends upon households acceptance of this idea of shared conservation i e will they comply with the water budget which is not the same for all households the objectives of this study are as follows first we determine how the drought experience changed residents water use behaviors and attitudes second we evaluate how support for a novel water budget approach used for the first time during the 2015 drought compared to support for more traditional demand side management policies last we wished to evaluate how demographics attitudes and psychological factors affect policy preferences to answer these questions we surveyed nearly 400 north state households we asked individuals how they changed their water use behaviors and used psychological attitudinal questions to evaluate how the drought changed beliefs about water use and conservation to evaluate preferences for demand side management policies respondents completed a best worst scaling survey 4 and policy preference rankings are estimated using a sequential best worst multinomial logit model 5 we then include demographic variables in the model and discuss what variables especially those most relevant to water managers impact policy preferences understanding how the drought changed behaviors and cultivated support for policies like water budgets which require collective buy in i e the consumer stays within his or her budget for water will inform how water providers may meet legislated water reduction requirements and respond to future droughts 1 1 the 2015 2017 drought the severe drought that peaked in 2015 in northern california actually began in fall of 2011 low levels of precipitation and record breaking average annual temperatures continued until january of 2014 when governor jerry brown declared a drought emergency the state implemented several key regulatory measures thereafter in april 2015 over three years into the drought the state water board mandated an overall 25 reduction in statewide water use relative to 2013 pre drought levels to achieve this goal municipal water providers serving over 3 000 customers were assigned to one of nine conservation tiers each with a unique required level of conservation e g a region with lower per capita water use would be required to conserve less than a region with higher water users heavy precipitation in the spring of 2016 allowed the state to relax conservation requirements for providers who could pass a stress test i e demonstrate the ability to provide water to citizens despite the ongoing drought after a record precipitation in the 2016 2017 water year october 2016 september 2017 emergency conservation regulations were lifted but the state issued an executive order requiring conservation to be made a way of life in california 6 to achieve regional state directed water reductions many water providers used water budgets for the first time as part of their overall dsm portfolio water utilities gave each household a budget for conservation equal to a percentage roughly of 80 of pre drought usage for most water providers in the north state for water usage any water used in excess of the budget would have a higher per ccf centrum cubic foot price budgets for allowed water use varied across service areas in alignment with state mandated conservation requirements that varied across regions providers generally used water budgets in addition to block rate pricing structures wherein the marginal price of water increases at higher consumption levels see ref 7 for a summary of alternative water pricing structures lastly non price conservation programs e g rebates for more efficient watering technology media information campaigns reminding residents of the social need to conserve water audits to detect water waste were used statewide overall use of these policies led the majority of water providers to meet state mandated monthly conservation goals and even to continue to conserve in excess of 20 relative to pre drought water usage in the summer of 2017 after mandatory conservation requirements ended as an example from our area of interest average water use declined in the chico area served by the california water company by approximately 32 during the period of mandatory conservation over the course of the drought 8 1 2 water conservation policies there is a rich water literature on use of demand side management policies and their implications both for the consumer i e welfare effects and for the utility policy effectiveness and revenue implications commonly studies policies include increases in the marginal price of water per unit increases in based charges fixed fees charged regardless of the volume of consumption and fixed fees base charges use of block rate pricing structures usually increasing block rates where the marginal price of water increases as consumption increases and watering restrictions limiting times or uses of water however what constitutes policy success is not always clear as reductions in water usage can have varying implications both for the consumer and for the water utility that must have sufficient revenues to cover supply costs we refer the reader to ref 9 for an overview of dsm policies and to refs 10 11 for an examination of the welfare effects of price versus non price based conservation programs we present a brief overview of this literature here 1 2 1 welfare effects of demand side management policies in terms of consumer welfare researchers have found that incentive based approaches like block rate pricing and increases in the marginal price of water maximize consumer welfare compared to regulatory type measures for example increasing block rates wherein the marginal price of water increases with consumption allow those who greatly value water usage i e are willing to pay higher prices for water to exceed the restriction constraint while households with lower willingness to pay will reduce consumption block rates also benefit lower income users in that they charge a lower marginal price for an amount of water deemed necessary for basic indoor uses 11 last instead of changing the marginal price of water utilities may increase fixed fees base charges that charge a fixed rate regardless of use such charges are generally more harmful for low income users and allow high volume users to use water without facing the cost of that consumption 12 in contrast to the above incentive based approaches watering restrictions may decrease consumer welfare by limiting the amount of water that can be used or restricting types of uses e g car washing even for those who would be willing to pay to use more water the water budget approach is a blend of these approaches allowing all individual users a given amount of water based on household needs and penalizing households via increased marginal prices for excess use to date little work has evaluated welfare implications of the water budget approach but a recent study by ref 13 suggests the water budget approach has similar welfare effects as increasing block rate price structures however 14 recently found that the water budgeting system led to greater welfare losses in areas of northern california because more water is used in this region for indoor purposes e g washing clothes showering compared to the southern regions of the state in contrast households with greater irrigation usage may decrease consumption with less lost welfare 1 2 2 impact of dsm on the utility from utilities perspectives policies must be evaluated both in terms of their success in decreasing water consumption and in terms of how they will impact utilities revenues for example watering restrictions typically limit households watering to specific days or times of the day however consumers who do not buy into the need for shared conservation or have acute awareness or social memory of drought 15 could simply choose to water more intensely during their allowed times days increasing prices can also have unintended consequences for the utility consumers could continue their patterns of water usage and pay a higher bill on the other hand they might decrease their consumption dramatically with negative implications for utility revenues 16 1 2 3 water budgets and the need to understand policy preferences water budgets are beneficial in that they allow utilities to reasonably predict demand and stabilize revenues so long as households comply with the budget this is a major advantage compared to other pricing policies that induce conservation but may decrease utility revenues forcing water managers to increase water prices even though consumers effectively conserved 16 nevertheless we do not yet know if customers see the budget system as unfair given that it allows those who previously used large volumes of water often for irrigation purposes others might see as wasteful larger budgets based on this need we also need to know the extent to which california households were aware of complied with the water budget system and how psychological factors attitudes may have influenced this support and compliance the context in which a utility calls for conservation can have large impact on how consumers respond to demand side management policies stone goemans and costanigro 2020 and consumer s acceptance and adherence to policies is fundamental to the utility s ability to forecast water demands 1 3 using psychology to predict water use behaviors previous research in the field of psychology help us understand water conservation behaviors in particular 17 argue that attitudes e g evaluations norms or values surrounding water conservation beliefs e g one s ecological worldview as it pertains to water scarcity habits e g regular behavioral patterns surrounding water use and sociodemographic variables e g age education or income are predictors of successful water conservation in general research has found favorable public support for water conservation policies at the local state and regional level 18 moreover attitudes continue to serve as robust predictors of actual water use 19 with higher levels of environmental and conservation concerns showing an association with lower water end use 20 attitudes are also contextualized by environmental conditions such as location e g urban vs rural 21 and other local e g place attachment and global e g climate change beliefs factors 22 within the western united states environmental beliefs predict water conservation behaviors e g taking shorter showers 23 and support for policies that restrict water use 24 homeowners who perceive environmental and social factors as being of greater importance use significantly less water than homeowners who emphasize cost and convenience as motivations for conservation 25 26 even show that households in environmentally concerned communities have higher price elasticities of demand during severe water shortages last habitual behaviors i e frequent automatic and cued responding have been shown to explain a significant proportion of variance in water use behavior after controlling for attitudinal and belief factors 19 conversely 27 found that habit strength operationalized as the degree to which respondents felt their water use behaviors were automatic or habitual did predict water conservation efforts however habit strength did significantly interact with intentions and household size a more recent study by ref 28 identified habitual behaviors as the strongest predictor of water use intentions and self reported water bills further underscoring the significance of consumer behavior as contrasted by attitudes or beliefs in water conservation efforts 1 4 sociodemographic predictors of water use we refer the reader to fielding et al 2012 for a thorough review of the sociodemographic variables that impact water use as one might expect income lot size home square footage and number of members in a household are associated with increased water usage in addition to other psychological factors sociodemographic variables such as age income and education are important predictors of conservation and use behaviors 17 for example older individuals use more water per household 19 income is also associated with greater water use despite the financial capability of installing water efficiency devices e g ref 29 moreover 30 reported that wealthier individuals self reported longer shower durations this is termed the rebound effect wherein making a home more water efficient actually makes one s current water less expensive which in turn increases water use as such households support for the idea of shared conservation and compliance with utility policies can have a large impact on water use irrespective of underlying demographics especially for households with higher incomes and initial water use higher education levels also predicted greater water use makki et al however 31 found no evidence linking educational level and water consumption 2 materials and methods 2 1 best worst scaling we used sequential best worst scaling to assess preferences for actual policies used in the northern california during the drought in a best worst scaling choice task with five options respondents choose their most and least preferred options they then choose their second most and second least options these sequential choices best worst second best and second worst allow the researcher to obtain an overall ranking of the five alternatives without respondents having to actually rank options at once research has shown that the cognitive burden of this approach is lower than a traditional 1 5 ranking exercise 4 given that respondents are only required to choose their most and least preferred options from any given choice set best worst scaling assumes that the utility an individual i receives from consumption of a good j is a function of the characteristics of that good j here the good j in question is the mix of policies used by the water provider therefore utility is a function of the individual policies implemented at specific levels ζ i z i 1 z i m z i m included in each best worst scaling choice task such that u i z j θ ε i the best worst scaling choice task asks participants to rank their most and least preferred options in a choice set if a specific attribute k is chosen as most preferred and l is chosen as least preferred this means that the difference in utility provided by this attribute pair is larger than that for any other combination in the choice set see ref 32 under the assumption that errors are gumbel distributed the probability of an overall ranking of alternatives a b c d e based on a series of best worst choices may be estimated via a sequential best worst multinomial logit 5 this model has an advantage over a rank ordered logit in that it reflects the actual choice task faced by respondents where a best and then worst option is chosen in order to achieve an overall ranking of options if we indicate each impact as z i m and let θ m represent the associated marginal utility the probability of observing the sequence a b c d e based on individuals repeated best worst choices is 1 p a b c d e exp z i a θ z m a b c d e exp z i m θ m exp z i e θ z m b c d e exp z i m θ m exp z i b θ z m b c d exp z i m θ m exp z i d θ z m c d exp z i m θ m where utility is positive for best choices and negative for worst choices 2 2 survey administration and participants we chose to obtain a sample from the north state specifically counties in the sacramento hydrologic basin because most cities counties in this area faced similar water shortages and used similar conservation policies during the drought per capita water consumption in the north state has historically been higher than use in drier regions where demand side management policies e g restrictions on watering promotion of xeriscape landscaping are heavily used this is due to the fact that as an example the city of sacramento averages approximately 20 inches of rain in non drought years this relative historical abundance of water has allowed per capita water use in the north state to be double the average usage in drier regions 33 the survey was administered via qualtrics panels qualtrics inc provo ut to a sample of n 363 individuals currently residing in 18 counties comprising the sacramento hydrologic basin in northern california this area includes 18 counties many of which comprise less than 1 of the total basin population given the low population numbers in these more rural areas whose residents are also less likely to use municipal water and have used water budgets we chose to use sacramento county demographics to guide our stratified sampling technique 1 1 ideally we would have a sample wherein the demographic characteristics of our respondents and the share of those respondents from individual counties would be representative of the overall sacramento hydrologic basin region we sampled unfortunately it was extremely difficult for us to obtain enough observations from the very rural counties and even the larger counties like butte and this is why we asked qualtrics to stratify the demographics based on sacramento county only we were comfortable with this decision for two reasons first our goal is to represent the population served by the generally large municipal water providers who used water budgets during the drought at the same time we did not want to exclude residents from more rural counties who might have faced new municipal water policies during the drought i e rural residents who are not served by wells given these realities the only way to make a true representative sample and demographic comparison of our sample to the population would be to know the demographics of the non well water users within each county of the sacramento hydrologic basin as such comparing our sample to demographics for these rural counties as a whole might be misleading because only a small share of residents in many counties use municipal water sources we compare demographics only for sacramento county the most urban of our sampled counties comprising approximately 40 of the basin s population to our sample in table 2 sacramento county as a share of all urban water users not served by wells is a much higher percentage of the population of interest though it is impossible to know the exact share we claim only that our survey reflects the water use habits and preferences of a majority of municipal water users who faced the novel water budgets during california s 2015 2016 drought qualtrics inc used a stratified sampling technique to ensure that our sample represents the demographic characteristics of the water users in sacramento county for age gender and income table 2 shows survey demographics for our sample compared to those for sacramento county the most populous county in our sample comprising roughly 40 of the basin s population as of the last census 34 as seen in table 2 demographics for our survey sample largely align with those of sacramento county with the exception that our sample has a slightly larger percentage of higher income individuals earning 100 000 or more relative to lower income 25 000 49 999 all survey results were obtained from december 2015 january 2016 we also wished to evaluate preferences only for relatively informed participants to this end we screened respondents out of the survey if they were not aware of their water bills or if water budgets were not used by their water providers from the perspective of the water utility all water savings during drought must come from households cognizant of changes in utility policies meant to spur conservation in our service area these policy responsive residents had the burden of decreasing consumption by approximately 20 relative to pre drought levels because the subset of what we may call aware consumers are those most likely to change their water behaviors we chose to ask only these consumers about their water use behaviors and water policy preferences 2 2 in our survey 24 of initial pre screening respondents said they were either unaware of water budget policies used by their utility and or whether they paid drought surcharges or that their water provider did not use water budgets of those whose utilities did use water budgets and drought surcharges only 14 of respondents were unaware of whether their usage caused them to exceed their budget admittedly this may bias our results to reflect the preferences of consumers who are more likely to respond to utility policies however this is less of a concern given that approximately 75 of pre screening survey respondents were aware of the new water budget policies being used 2 3 survey instrument 2 3 1 sociodemographic variables sociodemographic variables included age gender annual income highest level of education completed type of household e g single family ownership status rent own number of occupants in household years of residence in current household years of residence in california and county of residence participants were eligible to join the study if they indicated current residence in one of the 18 counties in the sacramento hydrologic basin butte colusa el dorado glenn lake lassen napa nevada placer plumas sacramento shasta siskiyou solano sutter tehama yolo or yuba 2 3 2 water use characteristics we asked participants whether their water provider was an investor owned utility or a municipal water provider expenditures related to water use were assessed by asking how participants paid for their water flat fees versus volume based charges the cost of their average bills during summer months may to august and the cost of their average bills during winter months november to february we also asked respondents how frequently they paid drought surcharges for exceeding their monthly water budgets last we asked residents to report the cost of their drought surcharge price of over budget water use per ccf and to recall the total amount they paid in drought surcharges per month on average 2 3 3 water use habits we asked participants to identify all of the measures they had taken to decrease water use during the 2015 2016 drought measures included decreasing the frequency duration of outdoor irrigation decreasing water usage for daily activities showering dishes laundry and other indoor water uses installing new water efficient appliances installing new water efficient landscaping technologies more efficient sprinklers drip systems and changing one s landscaping replacing lawn and other vegetation with drought resistant landscaping i e xeriscaping participants were also asked about their current water use habits i e following the lifting of mandatory water restrictions by the state using the same response options 2 3 4 water use attitudes and beliefs we assess water use attitudes and beliefs using a five point bipolar scale strongly disagree to strongly agree specifically participants were asked to rate their agreement with 15 statements surrounding water use attitudes and beliefs 2 3 5 best worst scaling choice task over the course of the drought the state set regulations for individual water providers mandating they decrease consumption in their service area by roughly 20 30 policies each with two levels of implementation and expected to have similar impacts on demand as the water budget formed the upper and lower bounds for policy levels used in the best worst scaling choice task the set of all 5 polices at their two levels of implementation was used to create the experimental design for the choice task table 1 prior to completing the best worst scaling choice task participants saw the following information regarding the above mentioned policies in the following series of questions you will be asked to choose which conservation policies you most and least prefer many of these options may have been used in the past or are currently used by your water provider potential policy options include the following mandatory watering restrictions the number of days of allowed watering each week is restricted to 2 or 3 days voluntary watering reductions you are asked to voluntarily conserve water decreasing usage relative to 2013 pre drought levels by 15 or 30 increased based charges fixed service costs on your water bill the base cost of service on your water bill regardless of how much water you use is increased by 7 50 or 15 funds may be used for conservation programs rebate programs for water efficient appliances turf replacement water audits or to pay for increasing costs of water delivery use of water budgets you are given a budget that reduces your allowed water usage by 15 or 30 relative to pre drought levels if you exceed this budget you will pay a drought surcharge of 5 for additional ccf of water used over the budget increases in the marginal price of water the per unit price ccf of water is increased by 15 or 30 your choices here are critical if water providers are to determine the best means of coping with drought and balancing water supplies with future water demands in the north state choice sets were created using a sequential fractional factorial experimental design see ref 35 on optimal designs yielding eight potential choice sets to ease the cognitive burden on respondents and decrease survey length choice sets were blocked so that each respondent only faced four choices participants chose the most and least preferred followed by second most and second least preferred options in each choice set allowing for a full ranking of the included policy options a sample choice set appears in fig 1 thus each respondent made four choices per choice set yielding 16 total observations per respondent 2 4 econometric model the dependent variable for the sequential best worst multinomial logit is a variable that takes on a value of one if the attribute in question was chosen as most least preferred and zero otherwise this choice is a function of the level of the attribute that appeared in each choice set such that total utility can be defined as 2 z i θ r e s t r i c t l o w i r e s t r i c t h i g h i v o l u n t a r y l o w i v o l u n t a r y h i g h i b a s e l o w i b a s e h i g h i b u d g e t l o w i p r i c e l o w i p r i c e h i g h i where for an individual i only one level of each policy e g either water 3days or water 2days appeared in each choice set and the raw data was coded as 1 for presence and 0 for absence of a specific level of each attribute the water budget 30 attribute level is omitted from the specification thus estimated coefficients are as more less preferred than the water budget requiring 30 reductions in water usage this approximates the water budget policy implemented in our region in order to estimate associations between demographic variables and policy preferences we estimated models including policy demographic interaction terms for variables such as age income education and gender we also sought to include terms related to the psychological variables e g households who agreed that the 2015 2016 drought changed how they think about water use demographic and attitudinal variables are described in table 1 however the number of demographic and psychological variables would require an inordinately large number of interaction terms 3 3 we initially took two approaches to further exploring policy preferences first we used factor analysis to determine if we could identify unique factors i e latent types of water users associated with variation in the demographic psychological questions included in the survey surprisingly factor analysis did not identify unique factors though a few variables had high factor loadings i e the factors were not unique but a few variables of policy interest were relatively more likely to define one type of consumer than others we therefore used principal component analysis pca based on a polychoric correlation matrix 36 principal component analysis takes a correlation matrix and condenses the total variance covariance across variables into a reduced number of components which explain the total variance present in the original data unlike cluster or factor analysis components do not relate to a latent variable type but when included as interaction terms with our policy variables allow us to overcome multicollinearity problems and determine if there is heterogeneity in policy preferences in association with demographic psychological variables last we estimated policy ranking models for key variables of policy interest i e demographic groups for whom the welfare effects of demand side management policies vary first we estimated separate models for high and low income individuals defined as earning greater than 100 000 and less than 25 000 a year respectively income is of interest because we might expect high income users to strongly prefer voluntary restrictions or the water budget approach to policies that would force them to pay more for all units of water or curb water use drastically i e no allowed budget for use conversely low income users might not support the budget approach because it seems unfair to allow high users to keep using relatively more water it may also be more difficult for low income users to reduce water use as they tend to have less outdoor irrigation in addition to the models capturing income disparity three models focused on respondents who 1 believed the drought was not associated with climate change 2 never paid drought surcharges always stayed under their budget and 3 paid over 30 an average per month in drought surcharges we expect individuals who do not believe the drought is related to climate change might be less supportive of the collective water budget approach that makes conservation a shared goal though we have no clear a priori expectation for these individuals we would also expect those who stayed under their water budgets to have different policy preferences from those who frequently paid large amounts in drought surcharges 3 results 3 1 sociodemographic variables respondent demographics are presented in table 2 table 2 also shows age gender and income estimates from the 2015 american community survey of sacramento county see footnote to show how our sample corresponds with regional demographics respondents were more likely to be 20 34 years old 35 26 female 52 07 earn between 25 000 and 49 999 annually 27 55 have received at least some college education 34 71 live in a single family home 94 49 own one s home 68 60 live with one other individual 26 72 have lived in their current residence for 0 5 years 41 60 and have lived in california for more than ten years at least one respondent resided in each of the 18 counties in the sacramento hydrologic basis with the majority of respondents residing in the largest county in the region sacramento county 59 78 3 2 water use characteristics table 3 shows households self reported water use characteristics the majority of respondents are served by a municipal water provider 81 54 pay according to a marginal per unit pricing structure 77 69 never paid a drought surcharge 69 70 or paid less than 10 on average in drought surcharges per month 76 86 respondents were most likely to pay between 60 and 120 per month for water during the summer irrigation season and between 30 and 60 per month for water during the winter season 3 3 water use habits table 4 shows reported drought related changes in water use habits when asked to select all the ways in which they reduced water during the drought 79 61 of participants said they saved water by reducing frequency duration of outdoor watering and 68 60 also reduced water used for daily typically indoor activities showering dishes less than 20 of respondents said they installed new water efficient appliances or landscaping technologies or converted to drought resistant landscaping i e xeriscaping just slightly more than 5 of the sample did not change their water usage significantly as a result of the drought similar percentages of participants reported that they planned to continue conservation behaviors for both irrigation and indoor water usage even after the state lifted mandatory watering reductions table 5 only 4 68 of participants said that they would increase or plan to increase their water usage if the state signaled that the drought was over 3 4 water use attitudes and beliefs fig 2 shows participants attitudes and beliefs surrounding water use and conservation policies with respect to local governmental and provider measures the majority of participants 50 at least agreed that their local government was adequately concerned about conservation during the drought 58 56 and that their water provider should promote voluntary conservation even if the drought ends 66 2 participants were less likely to agree however that their water provider should penalize consumers who fail to conserve water or that the use of water budgets and drought surcharges is fair 34 53 and 26 52 at least somewhat disagreed with these statements respectively despite these minority attitudes against punitive approaches to promote water conservation most participants at least somewhat agreed that the measures taken by their local water management services had helped them to conserve more water than they would have otherwise 62 53 other statements emphasized an ecological perspective on water as a natural resource and environmental conditions surrounding the drought the majority of participants 50 at least somewhat agreed that water should be free 51 52 conversely 65 01 at least somewhat disagreed that water is an unlimited resource participants were less likely to agree or disagree that the drought was over 19 83 endorsed neither agree nor disagree the majority of participants at least somewhat agreed that the drought was symptomatic of global climate change caused by humans 56 36 and that it was part of the natural water cycle of scarcity and abundance 60 88 contextual factors were viewed either as neutral or influential in participants decisions about water conservation the statement that drought resistant landscaping xeriscaping is less attractive than traditional landscaping was neither agreed with nor disagreed with by nearly 25 of the sample 23 48 social factors were slightly more influential nearly two thirds of participants 66 11 at least somewhat agreed that the drought would have been less severe if everyone had conserved as much as they did however over 25 26 45 neither agreed nor disagreed that they felt compelled to say something if someone else was wasting water finally the drought appeared to significantly impact participants attitudes and habits surrounding water conservation the majority of the sample 50 at least somewhat agreed that the 2015 2016 drought had changed the way they think about the availability of water 81 55 with 89 78 of participants indicating that they would continue to conserve water even after mandatory watering restrictions are lifted 3 5 best worst scaling choice task table 6 shows results for the best worst scaling choice task results summarizing policy rankings are also shown in fig 3 in table 6 coefficient estimates which reveal the strength of preferences for each policy are estimated relative to the omitted policy variable water budgets requiring 30 reductions in usage positive coefficients indicate that a policy was preferred to the 30 water budget while negative coefficients indicate that a policy was less preferred to the 30 water budget coefficients are presented in order of their rankings from the most preferred to the least preferred policy the overall ordering of policies fig 3 from most to least preferred was charge 15 00 price 30 budget reduce30 budget reduce15 charge 7 50 price 15 water 3days water 2days volutaryhigh and reduce 15 however the only variables with statistically significant p values were price 15 reduce 15 reduce 30 water 3days and water 2days all of which were less preferred to the 15 water budget this means households ranked all other policies including the water budget policies as on par with more commonly used policies like increases in prices and base charges one very surprising result is that the policies seen as equivalent to the 30 water budget are those that would have increased costs for the average respondent as much as or even more than the water budget approach for instance in our sample approximately 76 of respondents said they never paid more than 10 in drought surcharges and the average summer water bill in our sample was reported as 60 90 per month this implies a minimum of 20 in increased costs if prices were increased 30 similarly base charges of 7 50 and 15 00 were equally preferred to use of water budgets these findings mean households support use of policies that are even more aggressive in terms of their costs than use of water budgets however they did not support use of either voluntary or mandatory watering restrictions or lower level price increases 3 6 exploratory principal component analyses five components those with eigenvalues greater than one were identified through pca full pca results are presented in appendix 1 table 7 summarizes the pca analysis component 1 finds a positive association between high positive factor loadings age income and education and high negative loading for surcharge amount i e there is a positive correlation between age income and education and not having to pay surcharges for overusing water component 2 shows positive correlations between believing the drought is over that it was caused by natural variations in climate and feeling compelled to pressure neighbors to conserve water component 3 shows a positive association between gender being female higher income and education stating the drought changed how one used water and believing the drought is not over component 4 has negative loadings for wateruse perception and voluntary reduce and a positive loading for feel compelled thus this component shows correlations between stating the drought did not change how one used water that one would not voluntary reduced after the drought but also feeling compelled to say something if others wasted water last component 5 showed a positive large coefficient for surcharge amount and gender i e positive association between being male and paying drought surcharges 3 7 results for sequential best worst multinomial logit with pca interaction terms table 8 shows results for the policy preference model including an interaction term for each component x policy significant p values less than 0 10 for a component x policy term mean that the component had a significant impact on preferences for that policy a priori we expected the components associated with staying within one s water budget component 1 and believing the drought changed how they used water components 3 and 4 might have preferences for the budgets or even for price increases i e the most aggressive policies in the sense that they force individuals to reduce use or pay conversely we expected component 5 with a positive association between being male and paying more in surcharges to prefer the policies with no enforcement mechanism e g watering restrictions in comparing the expanded interaction term model table 8 to our base model table 6 aic and bic values are actually higher for the expanded model similarly only 3 component policy interaction terms are statistically significant at with greater than ninety percent confidence significant terms are as follows the interaction term for component 3 x budget reduce15 is positive meaning this component higher income believing the drought is not over stating the drought changed how one uses water is associated with preference for a 15 water budget as opposed to the 30 reductions implemented the term component 4 x price 15 is positive meaning low level price increases are preferred to the water budget for this component stating the drought did not change how one used water and that they will not continue to conserve post drought last the term component 5x price 30 is positive indicating a preference for high level price increases for the component associated with males who paid more in drought surcharges the variable component interaction terms that were significant generally support an idea that those who believed the drought would continue and require permanent changes in water use or paid more in drought surcharges supported use of lower level water budgets or price increases as opposed to the water budget that would reduce consumption by 30 overall however results show extremely little heterogeneity in policy preferences in association with our demographic and attitudinal variables 3 8 results for sequential best worst multinomial logit estimated for variables of interest to water managers results for the models estimated for variables of policy interest are presented in table 9 high income users 20 43 of the sample had identical preferences to those estimated for the base model save for the coefficient for charge 7 50 was negative and statistically significant and budget reduce15 was positive and significant this means these users would have preferred lower level water budgets but not lower level base charges a priori we had expected high income users to strongly prefer voluntary restrictions or flat increases in base charges to policies that would force them to pay more for all units of water e g prices or curb water use drastically i e no allowed budget for use low income users had similar preferences to those for the group as a whole with two exceptions first mandatory watering restrictions at the low or high level were not less preferred to the pricing budget policies as was the case for the sample as a whole second the coefficient for budget reduce15 was negative and significant p value of 0 1 i e these users said lower level water budgets would be less preferred to higher level this is also surprising given that we expected lower income households to have the most difficulty complying with water budgets next policy rankings are estimated for individuals who believed the drought was symptomatic of natural cycles in precipitation not climate change we expected these individuals to be less supportive of the collective water budget approach that makes conservation a shared goal as seen in table 9 these individuals also have similar preferences to other groups save for the negative coefficient for budget reduce15 and strong highly significant coefficient for price 30 these results suggest these users would actually strongly support using more aggressive policies like high level price increases during shortages next table 9 shows results for individuals who paid an average of more than 30 a month in over budget charges compared to those for individuals who never exceeded their water budget those who paid over budget charges who we might call the unsuccessful conservers have positive and significant coefficient for charge 15 00 and negative and significant coefficient for price 15 thus these users would have preferred a flat high increase in base fees each month i e a policy in line with the fees they ended up paying anyhow because they exceeded their budgets last those that did not pay drought surcharges have positive and significant coefficients for charge 15 00 and price 30 surprisingly these are policies that would have actually been more expensive for these successful conservers than the water budget approach though there is no way to know the true reason for these results we hypothesize that these individuals who successfully stayed within their budgets may believe higher water users should have to pay more for all water used during drought and think higher prices wouldn t affect them greatly given their ability to conserve 4 discussion in this work we fielded a survey during the unprecedented drought in northern california to evaluate how the drought altered households stated water use behaviors and attitudes we used a best worst scaling choice task to determine how acceptance of water budgeting implemented by many utilities for the first time compared to preferences for more traditional demand side management policies our results overwhelmingly show that the vast majority of respondents changed their water use complied with their water budgets felt a shared need to conserve and stated the drought had changed how they felt about water use in northern california multinomial logit models estimated for the best worst scaling choice task showed that households supported the use of water budgets that force households to either reduce water use or pay higher costs even compared to free policies like voluntary watering restrictions in fact support for water budgets was not significantly different from that of more traditional dsm policies i e increases in marginal prices even though the budget system allows households baseline water consumption based on prior usage potentially giving those who previously used excess water a larger drought budget these findings were largely consistent regardless of demographics and attitudes perceptions on conservation and drought in general even though we might expect to have varying preferences based on the known welfare effects of policies in fact results were so consistent that nearly all our analysis aimed at identifying households with unique demographic psychological profiles and corresponding unique policy preferences were statistically insignificant in the model with interaction terms for all of our pca identified component variable interaction terms only three of these terms were statistically significant these results generally showed that those who believed the drought would continue had higher incomes and paid more in drought surcharges would have preferred either 15 water budgets or price increases while it is impossible to know the reason for this preference these users may have believed they would have paid less or had less pressure to reduce consumption under these alternative policies even when we estimated policy preference models for key groups whom we would expect to have distinct policy preferences e g low and high income users we find only minor differences compared to our base model while it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why psychological variables were not significant predictors in the present study one possibility is that the media s ability to focus the public s attention on the need to conserve as an emergency situation created a shared conservation ethos that outweighed individuals previously held water use beliefs this is consistent with a finding by ref 37 who found that water conservation in the san francisco bay area was strongly correlated to news coverage of drought leading to water conservation even before the state local water providers implemented conservation policies anecdotally based on conversations with representatives of the california water service company it was not unusual for higher income residents to over water landscaping on allowed watering days leading to increases in water usage after watering day restrictions were implemented if this is the case it makes sense that a pro conservation public would see such policies as less effective in promoting a shared responsibility for reducing water usage during a severe shortage overall our survey results imply use of water budget policies can be a successful part of northern california utilities strategies for meeting state conservation goals while support for water budgets does not necessarily mean households will comply with them versus simply paying more for over budget water use over two thirds of households reported that they never exceeded their water budgets given that aggregate water usage goals were met by nearly all water providers in our area of interest this compliance also means water utilities can make reasonable projections for future revenues further work should be aimed at quantifying the welfare impacts of water budgets relative to policies like price increases and watering restrictions limitations of our work are as follows first sociodemographic variables water use characteristics and water use habits were self reported and therefore difficult to verify ideally we would connect households survey results to their water bills to see if they actually achieved self reported decreases in water use next nearly 60 of participants reported currently residing in sacramento county while this is somewhat expected since sacramento is the most populous metropolitan area in the region greater representation from outlying rural areas with non well water sources would have been beneficial in identifying potential differences with consumers in urban and suburban areas finally the survey was administered to participants following an extended period of unexpected and significant rainfall volumes in the region after five years of drought although it is possible that participants responses were influenced by the proximate environmental conditions our data are suggestive of an enduring pattern of water conservation credit author statement janine stone

8663,access to safe water sources remains scarce in sub saharan african countries we estimate the economic value of safe water from newly constructed boreholes in rural zambia our quasi experimental setting allows us to estimate the revealed preference measure of new safe water sources in a causal way empowered by precise information on water collection and distance to new facilities we show that the share of time value for water collection in total expenditures was about 10 at the baseline survey which was reduced to about 3 at the end line survey but the difference in differences analysis reveals that the project did not reduce the time burden for collecting water due to the greater demand for safe water the main net benefit of the project lies in improved productivity due to decreased diarrhea incidence among working age adults the estimated internal rate of return of the project is not large however the project is likely to have additional dynamic health benefits due to the

development zambia jel classification i38 j22 o18 1 introduction ensuring access to safe water is a basic need for all people and indispensable to improving their living standards as stated in the united nations 1 sustainable development goals sdgs goal 6 1 1 1 goal 6 1 calls for securing universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all in order to achieve goal 6 which is to ensure access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 united nations n d in 2017 however 579 million people globally did not have access to water from improved sources with access to safe water most limited in sub saharan african ssa countries 2 only 61 of people enjoyed basic drinking water or above in sub saharan africa which is far below the worldwide average of 90 and 135 million people used water sources that required more than 30 min to complete water collection limited access to safe water is attributed to the absolute shortage of a safe water supply moreover a lack of general market mechanisms exacerbates the efficient allocation of safe water thus a large volume of literature predominantly by environmental economists has been devoted to providing quantitative estimates of the economic valuation of safe water since it is a nonmarket resource whose economic value is rarely observed 3 one major strategy to assess the economic valuation of safe water is the revealed preference rp approach used to measure the demand for nonmarket environmental improvements rp works by examining the existing choices of households to make inferences about marginal benefits which is indispensable to developing a better understanding of the efficient working of market mechanisms 2 2 the revealed preference approach includes the travel cost method and averting expenditure method as well as the hedonic valuation method another popular strategy is the stated preference sp approach using survey responses on the willingness to pay for specific changes and includes contingent valuation 3 one popular variant of the rp approach is the coping cost approach averting expenditures that is frequently used to gauge the economic benefits of water supply improvements the typical procedure of the approach is to decompose the coping cost to obtain a monetary valuation of non health benefits such as the reduction of time spent on water collection and treatment market purchase of water as well as the health benefits accrued by avoiding any adverse effects on health and employment caused by waterborne diseases when we constrain our scope to limited water access in developing countries the estimated total coping costs relative to income vary widely between studies 1 of current income in kathmandu nepal 4 7 5 of income in parral mexico 5 0 8 in leon nicaragua 6 12 of reported monthly cash income in kianjai kenya 7 4 of monthly expenditure in zarqa and the eastern part of amman jordan 3 and 15 of income in low income households in chennai india 8 3 3 there are a number of studies on the coping cost of water in developed countries focusing on treatment behavior of tap water with a short collection time e g refs 9 10 most of these studies focus on measuring the values of water treatment costs and water storage investments for urban consumers who suffer from intermittent supply 7 in contrast to many studies using stated preference sp methods to measure willingness to pay for improved water supply directly there have been several empirical studies on coping strategies in rural areas in developing countries 11 use both revealed and stated preference methods to estimate the value of water source protection in rural kenya focusing on coping strategies in water treatment and water collection times without showing detailed estimates of coping cost 12 measured the time costs of water collection storage and treatment as well as poor sanitation and illness in a community demand driven water supply program in india and showed that half of the total coping cost stems from time cost 13 reported that improved water sources reduce household spending on water treatment which offsets 4 of the gains from water quality improvement in rural india 7 estimated the non health benefits from water by measuring the coping cost on water collection time as well as the capital cost for storage and rainwater collection money paid to obtain water treating diarrhea cases and water treatment the results showed that the median total coping cost is 20 usd per month or 12 of monthly cash income in rural kenya this paper provides new estimates of the economic value of safe water by calculating the coping cost of safe water using a revealed preference approach in rural zambia we attempt to add to the existing literature on estimates of the economic valuation of safe water in several new aspects first we estimate the revealed preference measure of new safe water sources in a causal way most of the previous literature has relied on cross sectional data in which it is difficult to disentangle the effects of new water facilities and other confounding factors from the unobservable characteristics of households 4 4 one exception is 14 who used differences in the timing across villages to identify the impacts of shared water infrastructure on household distance to water sources individual time use and agricultural production we utilize a unique dataset collected under a quasi experimental setting in the dry season at sites with new access to safe water sources and without we employ difference in differences did estimates to gauge the causal impact of new boreholes made exogenously available which captures the impact of safe water sources in a more precise way second we examine the impact of access to safe water without contamination at source the newly constructed boreholes have a depth of approximately 63 m a variety of tests were used to confirm that the boreholes were free from potential contamination at source including the amount of escherichia coli e coli before the boreholes were handed over to villagers third we employ a detailed time use survey on a variety of activities including water collection we utilize an exhaustive timetable for the whole day from 5 a m to 10 p m at both project and control sites the merit of a time use survey should be emphasized since there are only a small number of empirical estimates of time spent on traveling and waiting for water collection 4 7 15 5 5 several studies reported the time burden of fetching water 16 show that women spend 2 3 h per day on water collection on average in rural sub saharan africa and women and girls are mainly responsible for water collection 17 20 6 6 14 uses 24 h time use diaries of individuals 12 years and older but there is no category specific to water collection we also incorporate the distance to water sources using location information to capture the differences in the impact of improved access to safe water across locations this paper proceeds as follows the next section describes the theoretical framework section 3 illustrates the target project our research design and the data set section 4 presents the empirical model section 5 estimates each component of the coping costs and discusses our estimates of the economic valuation of safe water the conclusion in section 6 discusses the implications of our main findings and possibilities for future research 2 theoretical framework we consider the following unitary household utility maximization problem to examine the revealed preference for the value of

the costs and benefits of newly constructed boreholes installed by the groundwater development project table 1 sets out the costs and benefits of new boreholes by component based on our estimates and calculations the benefits of the project are defined as the coping costs avoided compared with the costs paid for construction and maintenance of the new facilities at the household level we calculate the benefits arising from 1 the reduction in water treatment cost 2 reduction in diarrhea incidence among working age adults 3 reduction in time spent on water collection which is a major component of coping costs in the existing literature and theory 4 reduction in diarrhea treatment costs oral rehydration therapy doctor s fees medicine etc and 5 reduction in purchases of water or storage costs we show how the benefits from 1 2 and 3 are calculated in the following sections while the benefit from 4 is set as 0 because residents seldom go to a hospital or clinic to treat diarrhea the benefit from 5 is also assumed to be 0 because it was negligible in our survey data beyond the costs and benefits of new boreholes obtained from the static theoretical model just discussed we also consider the decrease in age standardized disability adjusted life years dalys as a potential additional benefit in section 5 3 materials 3 1 zambia and luapula province zambia is a landlocked sub saharan african country with 17 million people in 2019 it suffers from limited access to safe water in 2015 only 67 7 of households had access to improved sources of drinking water 23 a slight improvement on 62 in 2010 with a wide regional variation between urban and rural areas 24 as a case study of rural zambia we focus on luapula province located in the northern territory with a population of one million living in an area of 30 thousand square kilometers the province had the highest poverty rate among the provinces in the country in 2010 which worsened to 81 1 in 2015 23 while the province is endowed with rich water sources with more than 40 taken up by lakes and wetland areas fig 1 it suffers from lower access to safe drinking water the proportion of people with access to safe water in the province was among the lowest at only 28 in 2010 but improved to 52 9 in 2015 23 a lack of access to safe water is detrimental to the daily lives of people since they cannot enjoy the health or non health benefits from water facilities for health benefits from safe water there is a growing concern that a lack of access to safe water is a major cause of waterborne diseases including diarrhea which is ranked among the top ten major causes of morbidity in zambia and in more recent years a higher incidence of diarrhea has been observed 26 the national average of diarrhea incidence per 1 000 population in zambia was 8 6 cases and the hospital case fatality rates for diarrhea were 65 deaths per 1 000 admissions in 2012 in the luapula province the incidence of diarrhea per 1 000 registered at 8 3 and the hospital case fatality rates were 69 deaths per 1 000 admissions in the same period 26 the non health benefits of access to safe water stem from a reduction in the time burden required for water collection treatment and storage and the decreased need to purchase water most studies of sub saharan african countries use cross sectional data showing that the estimated time saving by improving access to water sources has ranged widely from 30 to 300 min 27 29 recently 30 reported that 27 min were saved per day by switching from a public to a private connection in morocco s urban area and 31 found that 41 min were saved per day from water collection activities due to the provision of new public water points in rural benin we echo the method of these two papers by using longitudinal data to examine the time saving effect of new water sources rigorously 3 2 the groundwater development project the target project of this study is project for groundwater development in luapula province phase 2 conducted by the japan international cooperation agency jica this is a grant aid project to provide both hardware and software components with the aim of reducing water related diseases by assuring improved access to safe and stable water sources in the project new borehole water supply facilities were constructed with hand pumps at 216 sites between february 2012 and may 2013 each facility was designed to provide 30 l of water for 250 people per day 25 those boreholes have a designed average depth of 63 m below ground level which ensures that water is free from ground contaminants at the source the quality of water at each borehole was tested to satisfy the national standards of zambia before being handed over to the residents 7 7 the tests included electrical conductivity ph iron manganese fluorine content and escherichia coli e coli our survey asked the respondents to evaluate the taste and cleanliness of water from each source subjectively and they gave a higher rating to water from the newly built boreholes the target sites in the project were selected as follows 320 sites in four districts milenge mwense mansa and nchelenge were specified by the government of zambia in its request for grant aid then each specified site was screened using a preparatory survey of seven criteria to consider the feasibility and relevance of the project implementation these criteria were 1 demand for a safe and stable water supply i e population 2 accessibility to the site 3 hydrogeological conditions 4 availability of the existing water supply facilities 5 overlap with other related projects 6 possibility of forming a v washe committee and 7 residents willingness to pay for the operation and maintenance costs of the facilities 25 after examination 291 sites were identified as candidate sites 216 sites the maximum number of facilities the project had the resources to construct were selected as target sites while the remaining 75 sites served as alternatives when drilling was unsuccessful at target sites the number of sites for each district was determined by using the same proportion per district of the original 320 sites with the final target sites in each district selected based on population size since there was still a risk of failing to find underground water a maximum of two drillings were attempted at each site and if both were unsuccessful the site was abandoned and replaced with an alternative 25 in the end the project constructed 216 facilities at 214 sites but 31 target sites were replaced because it was impossible to obtain groundwater 8 8 in milenge district two additional facilities were constructed at two sites since the number of unsuccessful sites exceeded the number of alternative sites 25 the construction of new boreholes was accompanied with re organization of the village water sanitation and health education v washe committee which is responsible for general and daily operations and maintenance at the village level along with a variety of training programs provided to stakeholders 25 3 3 data description the data used in this study consists of the first round baseline survey conducted from june to july 2012 with no facilities available at that time and the second round end line survey from june to august 2013 following the completion of new boreholes both surveys were implemented in the dry season within the almost no rain period the survey was conducted in three districts milenge mwense and nchelenge 9 9 mansa was excluded from the survey since some facilities were handed over to the villagers before the baseline survey was undertaken at the baseline survey 94 sites were randomly selected in each district 50 sites from the list of the target sites and 44 from the control sites however the project was not able to obtain water from new boreholes at some target sites because it was difficult to predict the possibility of obtaining water successfully when blind boring those sites without water could be regarded as control sites in the end line survey and new sites converted from control sites into target sites where it was possible to get water from new boreholes since one of the most important criteria for selecting project sites is the population size in determining the demand for water project sites may have larger populations than the control sites however we do not find a significant difference in population between the project sites and control sites due to unpredictable failures in the target sites moreover there is no statistical difference in the time to collect water at the baseline by household members and females shown in table 3 after these conversions we ended up with 63 project sites with the new boreholes and 31 control sites without them in total fig 2 then 8 households were randomly selected from each of the 94 sites and thus 752 households in total were interviewed 117 households 15 6 of the total could not be revisited in the end line survey the total number of households surveyed at both baseline and end line was 634 429 in the treatment group and 205 in the control group 10 10 we dropped one household that reported extremely large agricultural landholdings 250 ha from our balanced panel sample 11 11 households with fewer family members were more likely to move away but this attrition pattern did not significantly differ between project and control sites 25 we make two remarks on the dataset first the interval between baseline and end line is short only one year which enables us to examine the short term impact of safe water access second villagers living around different sites started to use them at different times with the period for using the new facilities in the project sites averaging six months varying from two months to ten months both rounds of the survey employed household and community questionnaires and these contained a wide variety of socio economic variables related to individuals households and communities the same questionnaire was used in both surveys with minor revisions after another pre test for the end line survey in the survey access to existing water sources outside houses was confirmed by both community and household questionnaires and the practice of fetching water per day from each water source for the day before the interview moreover rich information on health status was collected including episodes of illness injury for each individual family member over the previous two weeks and any diarrhea related symptoms over the same period together furthermore the survey collected detailed time use information by asking respondents to fill in a timetable for a whole day according to 18 types of activities 12 12 the most knowledgeable person was made responsible for providing information on use of time the time use survey allowed us to comprehensively measure the time spent on a variety of activities including time spent on water collection and water related chores 4 empirical model this study employs a difference in differences did approach to estimate the impact of the project the methodology requires a parallel trend as the central assumption we assume that any change between baseline and end line surveys without the intervention caused by unobserved characteristics is common between the project and control sites we perform a balance test at the baseline before the intervention of the project and compare the variables used in the estimation between the project and control sites in the next section we examine the impact of the project on a variety of outcomes related to water collection the basic specification is as follows 1 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 s j β 3 s j t ε i j t where i refers to a household j points to a site or village and t is time t 0 for baseline and t 1 for end line y ijt is the dependent variable y ijt is a continuous variable of 1 time spent on water collection in hours 2 water volume carried yesterday 3 number of trips yesterday and previous one week and 4 working days lost due to diarrhea y ijt is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if a household used a water treatment method chlorination boiling and filtration and 0 otherwise and 1 if a household had any diarrhea incidence all members adults school age children and pre school age children and 0 otherwise turning to the right hand side variables s j is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the site has a successful borehole and 0 otherwise β 0 to β 3 are the parameters to be estimated and β 3 measures the impact of the project on the outcomes ε i j t is an iid error term we employ an ordinary least squared ols estimation to obtain the coefficients and our specification is a linear probability model lpm when the dependent variable is binary the parallel trend assumption may be violated if changes in covariates are not common between the project and control sites therefore we also employ an empirical model which includes some covariates x i j t is a vector to include a set of household characteristics which includes two dummy variables that capture seasonal differences in the survey months july or august with reference to june x j t is a vector containing a set of site village j s characteristics other than success of facility construction s j which includes dummy variables that capture district level fixed effects by adding those covariates we write another version of our empirical model 2 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 s j β 3 s j t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same as in 1 except that γ 1 and γ 2 are vectors of the parameters to be estimated these models estimate the intention to treat itt impact of the project β 3 at the village level since not all households in the project sites used the new boreholes thus the direct impact of new boreholes installed by the project is captured by examining the effect on borehole users we also employ the following specifications 3 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 u i β 3 u i t β 2 e n u i β 3 e n u i t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same except for replacing s j to u i s and nu i u i is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the household used a borehole at the project site and 0 otherwise nu i is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the household does not use a borehole at the project site and 0 otherwise β 3 in specification 3 captures the direct effect while β 3 e captures a spillover effect if any further we employ the following specification to consider difference in distance from each house to boreholes among borehole users 4 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 u i β 3 u i t β 4 u i t d i β 2 e n u i β 3 e n u i t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same as in 3 except for d i which stands for distance to the new borehole in the project sites in terms of physical distance in kilometers and time in minutes all the regression models control for the covariates at the household and village level and all standard errors are clustered at the village level after performing these regressions we use the point estimate of the impact to calculate the economic value of costs and benefits of the new boreholes by each component which we discuss in detail in the following section 5 results and discussion 5 1 use rate of water sources table 2 summarizes the use rate of water sources from which rural households collect water 13 13 appendix 3 provides a brief subjective evaluation of the cleanliness and taste of each water source it is clear that the jica boreholes provide the cleanest and the best tasting water among the listed water sources in the project sites at the baseline survey only about 15 of the households had access to boreholes which were shallower than the new boreholes constructed by the project the majority of households formerly used shallow wells including hand dug wells or surface sub surface sources such as springs streams rivers and lakes at the time of the baseline survey the use rate of shallow wells was higher and the use rate of surface sub surface sources was lower in the project sites however in a broader sense over 90 of the population 95 3 in the project sites and 91 3 in the control sites relied on either shallow wells and or surface sub surface sources which are highly responsive to surface water and rainfall after construction of the new water facilities the end line survey reveals that the average distance to the new boreholes was 255 m and 77 9 of the sampled households used the new boreholes fig 3 shows a histogram of the households in the project sites and examines the relationship between distance to and the use rate of the new boreholes by employing a kernel weighted local polynomial regression the use rate was over 80 near the new boreholes and declined as the distance became greater after constructing the new boreholes the use rate of the other water sources declined significantly in the control sites the use rate of the boreholes rose to 35 because some shallower boreholes were newly constructed nonetheless the use rate of the other water sources remained unchanged suggesting that new borehole construction had limited influence on the control sites 14 14 32 33 examine the household choice of water sources and find that both supply side and demand side characteristics affect household decisions on water source choice note that a site in this study refers to a village we confirm that residents in a village fetch water from water sources in their own village and those in the control group did not collect water from a new borehole installed in a village in the treatment group the average distance to the nearest water source was 454 m in the project sites and 547 m in the control sites at the baseline survey both of which were reduced to 163 m and 395 m respectively 5 2 outcome variables and control covariates table 3 provides a sneak preview of outcome variables used to estimate the coping costs of water and the benefits of the groundwater development project we conducted balance tests of the outcome variables at the baseline survey and can confirm that there is no statistically significant difference between the project sites and control sites including water collection time by household members moreover table 4 reports a balance test of covariates used in the estimation at the household and village levels we do not see any significant difference between the project and control sites at the baseline survey we confirm that there is no statistically significant difference in all variables used in the estimation between project and control sites 15 15 we further confirmed that residents in the project and control sites had similar access to natural resources such as water and firewood and that their communities had similar infrastructure conditions such as roads irrigation and electricity as well as similar access to shops markets schools and health facilities at the time of the baseline survey therefore the balance tests of the initial conditions of the sites confirm that both project and control sites had similar demographic and socio economic characteristics at the baseline survey these observations justify our empirical approach described in the previous section and we can therefore employ the difference in differences estimation to examine if these differences are attributable to the project effect because the common trend assumption is likely to be violated when changes in covariates confound the trend we include control covariates in the estimation the summary statistics of covariates controlled for in multivariate regression analysis are shown in appendix 1 5 3 coping costs for water collection first of all we calculate the coping costs for water collection which is a key component of coping costs in the existing literature to cope with the scarcity of water resources local people spend a lot of time collecting water from various water sources our time use survey reveals that households on average were spending 3 53 h per day collecting water in the project sites and 3 61 h per day in the control sites at the baseline survey table 3 columns a and b 16 16 at the baseline survey l g 0 and the numbers represent l k at the end line survey the numbers represent l g l k in the project sites an increase in l g was accompanied by a decrease in l k this study examines the net effect of the project on the total time for water collection l g g m a x l k g m a x the average household size was 5 22 2 70 females and 2 52 males in the project sites and 5 17 2 58 females and 2 59 males in the control sites 17 17 the figures on household size are not shown in table 3 in the project sites 2 70 females 2 52 males consist of 0 62 0 57 pre school age children aged 0 to 6 0 91 0 87 school age children aged 7 to 18 1 07 0 98 working age adults aged 19 to 59 and 0 11 0 09 elderly aged 60 and above in the control sites 2 58 females 2 59 males consist of 0 65 0 67 pre school age children 0 78 0 82 school age children 1 05 1 03 working age adults and 0 10 0 08 elderly working age females aged 19 to 59 were the main collectors and on average spent 1 68 h per day in the project sites and 1 75 h per day in the control sites collecting water on average school age girls aged 7 to 18 spent 0 78 h per day in the project sites and 0 87 h per day in the control sites whereas school age boys spent 0 58 h per day in the project sites and 0 60 h per day in the control sites at the end line survey time spent on water collection in both project and control sites significantly decreased on average households spent 1 43 h per day on water collection in the project sites and 1 46 h per day in the control sites table 3 columns c and d then we evaluate the economic value of time spent on water collection by referring to the market wage rate one thousand zmk per hour equivalent to 1 54 usd per 8 h workday the market wage rate is calculated from the data in our survey on wage rates for unskilled labor in the three districts there are some values used as the weight in valuing time in the literature 11 used 25 of wages for unskilled labor in kenya while 14 showed that the value of time is approximately 50 of wages in kyrgyzstan 34 surveyed the existing studies on the topic and also found support for a commonly used rule of thumb of 50 of unskilled wages and argued that 25 is the lowest existing estimate thus we follow the rule of thumb in the literature to use 50 of wages of unskilled labor in valuing time by putting 50 as the weight the economic value of 3 53 h per day or 161 workdays per year is equivalent to 124 0 usd per year in the project sites while 3 60 h per day or 164 workdays per year is equivalent to 126 8 usd per year in the control sites these numbers indicate that the estimated coping cost spent on water collection is evaluated as 10 3 of total expenditures in the project sites and 10 6 in the control sites at the baseline in the same way we evaluate the value of time spent on water collection at the end line survey which is equivalent to 65 workdays or 46 8 usd per year in the project sites and 67 workdays or 48 2 usd per year in the control sites these numbers suggest that the coping cost for water collection was reduced to 2 9 of total expenditures in the project sites and 3 0 in the control sites we observe a reduction of time spent on fetching water and the consequent economic value of water collection in both treatment and control sites we now employ the difference in differences estimation to investigate the causal effects of new borehole construction on time spent for water collection table 5 reports the estimation results and shows that the project does not cause any change in time spent on water collection column a however we saw a reduction in time for water collection was a common trend over the survey period in both project and control sites even when we consider the effect of the use of the new boreholes column b as well as the interaction terms between the use of and distance to the new boreholes measured in kilometers in column c and in minutes in column d no significant causal effect is detected these results show that the construction of new boreholes did not reduce time spent on water collection in a causal way though the average time on water collection per se declined in both sites the little causal impact is revealed by utilizing a dataset collected under a quasi experimental setting of exogenously available new boreholes contrasting to most of the previous literature relying on cross sectional data we will disentangle behavioral changes in water collection in the next sub section the reduction in water collection time in both sites at the end line survey is partly explained by the difference in weather conditions since the average and maximum temperatures during the end line survey of 2013 were much lower than during the baseline survey period of 2012 the cooler conditions most likely reduced the demand for water particularly for drinking purposes which was highly likely to be a trend common across the project and control sites 18 18 the source of climate information is the global historical weather and climate data authorized by the national centers for environmental information noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration for this study most of the interviews were conducted during the second half of june in both 2012 and 2013 there were 8 days with a drop of 1 7 celsius in the maximum temperature in the middle of june in 2013 on june 18 for instance the maximum temperature was 26 celsius in 2012 and 19 celsius in 2013 the conditions also meant that farmers were expecting an earlier rainy season and began land preparation earlier 19 19 our dataset shows an increase in time spent on income generating activities including farming and a decrease in time spent on water collection for female adults who are often responsible for fetching water time spent on income generating activities increased from 3 78 h to 4 29 h between the baseline and end line surveys in the project sites compared to an increase from 3 60 h to 4 77 h in the control sites we perform a formal test on the difference in the change of time on income generating activities for female adults and confirm that the difference is not statistically significant please refer to appendix 2a and 2b for summary statistics for time use of women and men respectively 5 4 behavioral changes in water collection to explore the reasons for no causal effect of the project on time for water collection we further examine how the project changed behaviors of fetching water first we examine the effect of the project on water volume carried at the baseline survey the households on average fetched 64 1 l of water per day in the project sites and 63 6 l per day in the control sites which reduced to 52 6 l and 49 3 l after the intervention respectively table 3 table 6 presents the difference in differences estimation results to show that we could not find any significant effect of the project on the volume of water carried yet the point estimates suggest that the households in the project sites carried more water volume per day columns a d second we examine the effect of the project on the number of trips made to fetch water on average the households made 3 8 rounds for fetching water per day 23 0 rounds per week in the project sites and 3 6 rounds per day 22 5 rounds per week in the control sites at the baseline survey table 3 the number of trips per day in the project sites was unchanged but decreased to 21 0 rounds per week whereas the number of trips in the control sites decreased to 3 2 rounds per day and 17 9 rounds per week 20 20 we can estimate the volume of water carried per round at the baseline survey the households carried 16 9 l per trip in the project sites and 17 6 l per trip in the control sites which was reduced to 13 8 and 15 3 l per trip at the end line survey respectively the households in the project sites carried a slightly smaller volume of water each time we do not find any significant effect of the project on the number of trips per day columns e h in table 6 yet the point estimates suggest that the households in the project sites made more trips per day looking at the number of trips per week columns i l in table 6 the increase in the number of trips per week among the households living close to the new boreholes is statistically significant suggesting that they made 3 3 more trips for fetching water per week these results suggest that the demand for safe water increased particularly in the project sites because water from the new boreholes was e coli free hence the number of trips increased to obtain a greater volume of water and the total time spent on water collection did not decline this tendency is more pronounced among the borehole users living near the newly constructed boreholes confirming that these behavioral changes in fetching water were caused by new borehole construction 5 5 other coping costs another component of coping cost is the fixed amount payment for maintenance and administration fees to use the new boreholes the majority of the users paid 1 zmk per month at the end line survey after the redenomination of the currency in 2013 equivalent to 2 16 usd per year at the price level of june 2012 other coping costs were comprised of fees for water storage and for utilizing water treatment methods in our survey households used plastic containers and clay pots for storing water and more than 90 stored water for drinking purposes separately of which more than 90 comprised covered containers with a lid we examined behavioral changes in storing water due to the project but we did not find any significant change in the behaviors of storing water at home not shown we also collected information about the utilization of water treatment methods such as boiling water chlorination and filtration among various water treatment methods chlorination was the most popular at the baseline survey 22 6 of the households utilized chlorine in the project sites and 22 9 did in the control sites which decreased to 9 8 and 19 5 respectively table 3 table 7 shows the estimation results from the difference in differences estimations to explore the causal effect of the project on the utilization of chlorine and reports a 10 percentage point decrease which is statistically significant columns a d in addition the households in the project sites tended to stop boiling and filtering columns e l although the application rates of these water treatment methods were low less than 10 of the households boiled water and less than 1 filtered water these results show that households in the treatment sites saved water treatment costs through the construction of new boreholes people tended to cease using chlorine an indication that they believed that the water supply from the new boreholes was safe chlorination also makes the taste of water unpleasant moreover those households cut coping costs for boiling and filtering by reducing the utilization of these water treatment methods the households in the project sites reduced some coping costs saving approximately 2 usd per year 21 21 the market price of one bottle of chlorine to disinfect the maximum of 1 000 l of water needed to satisfy demand for a family with six members for one month in lusaka the capital city of zambia was estimated at 0 2 to 0 3 usd 21 22 we did not include the benefits from the reduction in water treatment costs for the village level benefits since villagers did not commit to water treatment collectively 5 6 estimates of the health benefits of the project now we turn to the health benefits of the project because the project provided safe water we expected a reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases particularly diarrhea 22 22 there is a vast quantity of literature on estimating the impact of water quality and quantity on improvements in health particularly diarrhea for instance see refs 35 36 and 37 our surveys collected information about diarrheal episodes over the previous two weeks and the number of days during which each household member could not perform regular activities due to diarrhea on average the households reported 0 128 diarrhea cases in the project sites and 0 122 cases in the control site at the baseline which decreased to 0 091 cases in the project sites and increased to 0 146 cases in the control sites at the end line survey table 3 table 8 shows the difference in differences estimation results to demonstrate that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 073 cases per household over the previous two weeks equivalent to a 57 decrease in the incidence of diarrhea the magnitude of the impact is larger and statistically significant among the borehole users living close to the new boreholes columns b to estimate the economic values of the health benefits we consider the following age cohorts separately working age adults aged 19 to 59 school age children aged 7 to 18 and pre school age children aged 0 to 6 among working age adults the household reported 0 033 diarrhea cases in the project sites and 0 024 cases in the control site which decreased to 0 026 cases in the project sites and increased to 0 044 cases in the control sites at the end line survey table 3 table 8 reports that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 029 cases column e and days lost by 0 123 days per two weeks or 3 198 days per year column i among working age adults based on these figures we evaluate the health benefit of the project for working age adults by using 50 of the market wage rate which is the same as the valuation of time for water collection the economic value of the reduction in diarrhea incidence among working age adults is estimated as 2 46 usd per year for the school age cohort the households reported 0 026 diarrhea cases over the previous two weeks in the project sites and 0 024 cases in the control site at the baseline survey which decreased to 0 019 cases and 0 015 cases at the end line survey respectively table 3 table 9 provides the difference in differences estimation results to show that no significant causal effect of the project was observed columns a d for the pre school age cohort the households reported 0 068 diarrhea cases over the previous two weeks in the project sites and 0 063 cases in the control site at the baseline survey which decreased to 0 035 cases and increased to 0 078 cases at the end line survey respectively table 9 table 9 shows the difference in differences estimation to reveal that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 055 cases per household over the previous two weeks which is statistically significant columns e and indicates about an 80 decrease in the incidence of diarrhea the magnitude of the health impact is larger among the borehole users columns f h thus we show that the project reduced diarrhea incidence both for school age and preschool age children but significantly only for the latter we do not evaluate the economic value of the decline of diarrhea incidence for preschool age children using a portion of market wage since they are obviously not working the economic value of the decline of diarrhea incidence is considered in the context of daly estimates below 5 7 robustness checks we now turn to the robustness checks of our estimation results first we examined how our empirical findings can be affected by attrition and we investigated how initial conditions of households and villages at the baseline survey were associated with attrition at the end line survey to do so we estimated the probit model and found some systematic patterns that result in attrition hence we employed several bias correction techniques wooldridge 2010 such as an inverse probability weighting ipw regression and heckman s two step selection model nonetheless our estimates were intact 23 23 the results are available upon request from the authors second we need to consider possible violation of the common trend assumption arising from changes in water sources in the control sites new boreholes were constructed by other organizations and residents themselves dug new shallow wells in the control sites however the boreholes in the project sites are differentiated from other water facilities which were shallower and the water quality is likely to be ambiguous moreover between baseline and end line surveys the distance to the nearest water sources was reduced from 454 m to 163 m in the project sites and 547 m to 395 m in the control sites the construction of other water facilities in the control sites is highly likely to underestimate the impacts of the jica project providing a lower bound of estimates 5 8 internal rate of return of the project and potential additional benefits due to dalys averted the economic values of the various components calculated in this section are shown in table 1 armed with the numbers in the table we estimate the internal rate of return of the project we assume the average population in a target village was 480 households and the average construction costs for a new borehole are approximately 20 000 usd we further assume that net benefits from the newly constructed boreholes materialize every year and will continue for 20 years then the estimated internal rate of return of the project is about 1 64 while the estimated internal rate of return based on the static model is not large we are likely to miss some dynamic health benefits a typical and very important one in our context is the decrease in dalys the daly is a health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of healthy life lost by virtue of individuals being in states of poor health or disability 38 dalys for a disease or health condition e g diarrhea in our case are calculated as the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality yll in the population and years of life lost due to disability yld for incident cases of the health condition 39 we apply the concept of the daly prevented by the project to our exercise for two reasons first in the calculation of the internal return of the project we put zero value on the benefits arising from the decrease in diarrhea for school age and preschool age children however once a child reaches the age of a working adult their productivity loss must be taken into account a factor that is not included in the calculation of internal rate of return 24 24 see ref 40 for an attempt at valuing children s health using the concept of dalys in the context of demand for water filters in northern ghana second we want to value mortality risk reduction by avoiding diarrhea which justifies using dalys in our context we acknowledge that some caution is needed in interpreting daly estimates because we double count the productivity loss in the case of working age adults by considering both the economic value estimated from our empirical estimations and the monetary value of dalys that simultaneously include yld there have been some variants of the daly estimates depending on diseases and countries as well as methodologies our estimation relies on age standardized dalys 1015 5 per 100 000 caused by diarrheal diseases in 2013 41 multiplied by the ratio of 1 19 for zambia 42 among all age groups a 57 decrease in diarrhea incidence is associated with 688 1 per 100 000 age standardized dalys averted the average household size of our sample is 5 20 and thus the decrease in dalys corresponds to 8 95 working days for a family which can be evaluated as 6 88 usd using 50 of the market wage rate of unskilled labor in the three districts as a weight 25 25 following 11 we assume 250 working days per year our estimate indicates that the health benefit caused by the reduction in diarrhea incidence is worth 192 3 usd per daly whereas the gdp per capita in zambia was 1 878 usd in 2013 6 conclusion this study attempts to evaluate the economic value of a groundwater development project which provides safe water by constructing new boreholes free from potential contamination we show that the share of time value for water collection in total expenditures was estimated to be about 10 at the baseline survey which was reduced to 3 at the end line survey but the project did not reduce the time burden to collect water because the demand for safe water increased hence the main net benefit of the project lies in improved productivity due to decreased diarrhea incidence among working age adults the estimated internal rate of return of the project is not large however the project is likely to have additional dynamic health benefits due to the decrease in disability adjusted life years dalys corresponding to 192 3 usd per daly and 6 88 usd per household we add to the existing literature by providing new evidence on measuring the economic value of safe water in a quasi experimental setting we acknowledge the limitations of this study in some aspects first we focused on a short run impact of new boreholes since the interval between the baseline and end line surveys is one year and the longer term impact is beyond our scope we also show that conditions were cooler in the post project evaluation which may have reduced the effect of new boreholes in the short term due to lower demand for drinking water among the control and treated groups thus we need to extend the analysis over a longer period to mitigate short run fluctuations second we cannot compare the quality of water with other sources using objective measures though the quality of water is high in new boreholes with a sufficient depth further research should refine economic valuations of safe water from a variety of sources in more rigorous ways in developing countries which will be indispensable for improving the living standards of people suffering from scarcity of water and lack of supply through a better understanding of efficient mechanisms for nonmarket goods supply while it has been established that household perceptions of water quality are important drivers of demand for water supply a rigorous examination and comparison of water quality from each water facility using objective measures is indispensable to measuring the economic benefit of water sources in a more precise way author statement yasuharu shimamura conceptualization main analysis satoshi shimizutani project

8663,access to safe water sources remains scarce in sub saharan african countries we estimate the economic value of safe water from newly constructed boreholes in rural zambia our quasi experimental setting allows us to estimate the revealed preference measure of new safe water sources in a causal way empowered by precise information on water collection and distance to new facilities we show that the share of time value for water collection in total expenditures was about 10 at the baseline survey which was reduced to about 3 at the end line survey but the difference in differences analysis reveals that the project did not reduce the time burden for collecting water due to the greater demand for safe water the main net benefit of the project lies in improved productivity due to decreased diarrhea incidence among working age adults the estimated internal rate of return of the project is not large however the project is likely to have additional dynamic health benefits due to the decrease in disability adjusted life years dalys corresponding to 192 3 usd per daly and 6 88 usd per household keywords nonmarket valuation revealed preference time use borehole groundwater development zambia jel classification i38 j22 o18 1 introduction ensuring access to safe water is a basic need for all people and indispensable to improving their living standards as stated in the united nations 1 sustainable development goals sdgs goal 6 1 1 1 goal 6 1 calls for securing universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all in order to achieve goal 6 which is to ensure access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 united nations n d in 2017 however 579 million people globally did not have access to water from improved sources with access to safe water most limited in sub saharan african ssa countries 2 only 61 of people enjoyed basic drinking water or above in sub saharan africa which is far below the worldwide average of 90 and 135 million people used water sources that required more than 30 min to complete water collection limited access to safe water is attributed to the absolute shortage of a safe water supply moreover a lack of general market mechanisms exacerbates the efficient allocation of safe water thus a large volume of literature predominantly by environmental economists has been devoted to providing quantitative estimates of the economic valuation of safe water since it is a nonmarket resource whose economic value is rarely observed 3 one major strategy to assess the economic valuation of safe water is the revealed preference rp approach used to measure the demand for nonmarket environmental improvements rp works by examining the existing choices of households to make inferences about marginal benefits which is indispensable to developing a better understanding of the efficient working of market mechanisms 2 2 the revealed preference approach includes the travel cost method and averting expenditure method as well as the hedonic valuation method another popular strategy is the stated preference sp approach using survey responses on the willingness to pay for specific changes and includes contingent valuation 3 one popular variant of the rp approach is the coping cost approach averting expenditures that is frequently used to gauge the economic benefits of water supply improvements the typical procedure of the approach is to decompose the coping cost to obtain a monetary valuation of non health benefits such as the reduction of time spent on water collection and treatment market purchase of water as well as the health benefits accrued by avoiding any adverse effects on health and employment caused by waterborne diseases when we constrain our scope to limited water access in developing countries the estimated total coping costs relative to income vary widely between studies 1 of current income in kathmandu nepal 4 7 5 of income in parral mexico 5 0 8 in leon nicaragua 6 12 of reported monthly cash income in kianjai kenya 7 4 of monthly expenditure in zarqa and the eastern part of amman jordan 3 and 15 of income in low income households in chennai india 8 3 3 there are a number of studies on the coping cost of water in developed countries focusing on treatment behavior of tap water with a short collection time e g refs 9 10 most of these studies focus on measuring the values of water treatment costs and water storage investments for urban consumers who suffer from intermittent supply 7 in contrast to many studies using stated preference sp methods to measure willingness to pay for improved water supply directly there have been several empirical studies on coping strategies in rural areas in developing countries 11 use both revealed and stated preference methods to estimate the value of water source protection in rural kenya focusing on coping strategies in water treatment and water collection times without showing detailed estimates of coping cost 12 measured the time costs of water collection storage and treatment as well as poor sanitation and illness in a community demand driven water supply program in india and showed that half of the total coping cost stems from time cost 13 reported that improved water sources reduce household spending on water treatment which offsets 4 of the gains from water quality improvement in rural india 7 estimated the non health benefits from water by measuring the coping cost on water collection time as well as the capital cost for storage and rainwater collection money paid to obtain water treating diarrhea cases and water treatment the results showed that the median total coping cost is 20 usd per month or 12 of monthly cash income in rural kenya this paper provides new estimates of the economic value of safe water by calculating the coping cost of safe water using a revealed preference approach in rural zambia we attempt to add to the existing literature on estimates of the economic valuation of safe water in several new aspects first we estimate the revealed preference measure of new safe water sources in a causal way most of the previous literature has relied on cross sectional data in which it is difficult to disentangle the effects of new water facilities and other confounding factors from the unobservable characteristics of households 4 4 one exception is 14 who used differences in the timing across villages to identify the impacts of shared water infrastructure on household distance to water sources individual time use and agricultural production we utilize a unique dataset collected under a quasi experimental setting in the dry season at sites with new access to safe water sources and without we employ difference in differences did estimates to gauge the causal impact of new boreholes made exogenously available which captures the impact of safe water sources in a more precise way second we examine the impact of access to safe water without contamination at source the newly constructed boreholes have a depth of approximately 63 m a variety of tests were used to confirm that the boreholes were free from potential contamination at source including the amount of escherichia coli e coli before the boreholes were handed over to villagers third we employ a detailed time use survey on a variety of activities including water collection we utilize an exhaustive timetable for the whole day from 5 a m to 10 p m at both project and control sites the merit of a time use survey should be emphasized since there are only a small number of empirical estimates of time spent on traveling and waiting for water collection 4 7 15 5 5 several studies reported the time burden of fetching water 16 show that women spend 2 3 h per day on water

the costs and benefits of newly constructed boreholes installed by the groundwater development project table 1 sets out the costs and benefits of new boreholes by component based on our estimates and calculations the benefits of the project are defined as the coping costs avoided compared with the costs paid for construction and maintenance of the new facilities at the household level we calculate the benefits arising from 1 the reduction in water treatment cost 2 reduction in diarrhea incidence among working age adults 3 reduction in time spent on water collection which is a major component of coping costs in the existing literature and theory 4 reduction in diarrhea treatment costs oral rehydration therapy doctor s fees medicine etc and 5 reduction in purchases of water or storage costs we show how the benefits from 1 2 and 3 are calculated in the following sections while the benefit from 4 is set as 0 because residents seldom go to a hospital or clinic to treat diarrhea the benefit from 5 is also assumed to be 0 because it was negligible in our survey data beyond the costs and benefits of new boreholes obtained from the static theoretical model just discussed we also consider the decrease in age standardized disability adjusted life years dalys as a potential additional benefit in section 5 3 materials 3 1 zambia and luapula province zambia is a landlocked sub saharan african country with 17 million people in 2019 it suffers from limited access to safe water in 2015 only 67 7 of households had access to improved sources of drinking water 23 a slight improvement on 62 in 2010 with a wide regional variation between urban and rural areas 24 as a case study of rural zambia we focus on luapula province located in the northern territory with a population of one million living in an area of 30 thousand square kilometers the province had the highest poverty rate among the provinces in the country in 2010 which worsened to 81 1 in 2015 23 while the province is endowed with rich water sources with more than 40 taken up by lakes and wetland areas fig 1 it suffers from lower access to safe drinking water the proportion of people with access to safe water in the province was among the lowest at only 28 in 2010 but improved to 52 9 in 2015 23 a lack of access to safe water is detrimental to the daily lives of people since they cannot enjoy the health or non health benefits from water facilities for health benefits from safe water there is a growing concern that a lack of access to safe water is a major cause of waterborne diseases including diarrhea which is ranked among the top ten major causes of morbidity in zambia and in more recent years a higher incidence of diarrhea has been observed 26 the national average of diarrhea incidence per 1 000 population in zambia was 8 6 cases and the hospital case fatality rates for diarrhea were 65 deaths per 1 000 admissions in 2012 in the luapula province the incidence of diarrhea per 1 000 registered at 8 3 and the hospital case fatality rates were 69 deaths per 1 000 admissions in the same period 26 the non health benefits of access to safe water stem from a reduction in the time burden required for water collection treatment and storage and the decreased need to purchase water most studies of sub saharan african countries use cross sectional data showing that the estimated time saving by improving access to water sources has ranged widely from 30 to 300 min 27 29 recently 30 reported that 27 min were saved per day by switching from a public to a private connection in morocco s urban area and 31 found that 41 min were saved per day from water collection activities due to the provision of new public water points in rural benin we echo the method of these two papers by using longitudinal data to examine the time saving effect of new water sources rigorously 3 2 the groundwater development project the target project of this study is project for groundwater development in luapula province phase 2 conducted by the japan international cooperation agency jica this is a grant aid project to provide both hardware and software components with the aim of reducing water related diseases by assuring improved access to safe and stable water sources in the project new borehole water supply facilities were constructed with hand pumps at 216 sites between february 2012 and may 2013 each facility was designed to provide 30 l of water for 250 people per day 25 those boreholes have a designed average depth of 63 m below ground level which ensures that water is free from ground contaminants at the source the quality of water at each borehole was tested to satisfy the national standards of zambia before being handed over to the residents 7 7 the tests included electrical conductivity ph iron manganese fluorine content and escherichia coli e coli our survey asked the respondents to evaluate the taste and cleanliness of water from each source subjectively and they gave a higher rating to water from the newly built boreholes the target sites in the project were selected as follows 320 sites in four districts milenge mwense mansa and nchelenge were specified by the government of zambia in its request for grant aid then each specified site was screened using a preparatory survey of seven criteria to consider the feasibility and relevance of the project implementation these criteria were 1 demand for a safe and stable water supply i e population 2 accessibility to the site 3 hydrogeological conditions 4 availability of the existing water supply facilities 5 overlap with other related projects 6 possibility of forming a v washe committee and 7 residents willingness to pay for the operation and maintenance costs of the facilities 25 after examination 291 sites were identified as candidate sites 216 sites the maximum number of facilities the project had the resources to construct were selected as target sites while the remaining 75 sites served as alternatives when drilling was unsuccessful at target sites the number of sites for each district was determined by using the same proportion per district of the original 320 sites with the final target sites in each district selected based on population size since there was still a risk of failing to find underground water a maximum of two drillings were attempted at each site and if both were unsuccessful the site was abandoned and replaced with an alternative 25 in the end the project constructed 216 facilities at 214 sites but 31 target sites were replaced because it was impossible to obtain groundwater 8 8 in milenge district two additional facilities were constructed at two sites since the number of unsuccessful sites exceeded the number of alternative sites 25 the construction of new boreholes was accompanied with re organization of the village water sanitation and health education v washe committee which is responsible for general and daily operations and maintenance at the village level along with a variety of training programs provided to stakeholders 25 3 3 data description the data used in this study consists of the first round baseline survey conducted from june to july 2012 with no facilities available at that time and the second round end line survey from june to august 2013 following the completion of new boreholes both surveys were implemented in the dry season within the almost no rain period the survey was conducted in three districts milenge mwense and nchelenge 9 9 mansa was excluded from the survey since some facilities were handed over to the villagers before the baseline survey was undertaken at the baseline survey 94 sites were randomly selected in each district 50 sites from the list of the target sites and 44 from the control sites however the project was not able to obtain water from new boreholes at some target sites because it was difficult to predict the possibility of obtaining water successfully when blind boring those sites without water could be regarded as control sites in the end line survey and new sites converted from control sites into target sites where it was possible to get water from new boreholes since one of the most important criteria for selecting project sites is the population size in determining the demand for water project sites may have larger populations than the control sites however we do not find a significant difference in population between the project sites and control sites due to unpredictable failures in the target sites moreover there is no statistical difference in the time to collect water at the baseline by household members and females shown in table 3 after these conversions we ended up with 63 project sites with the new boreholes and 31 control sites without them in total fig 2 then 8 households were randomly selected from each of the 94 sites and thus 752 households in total were interviewed 117 households 15 6 of the total could not be revisited in the end line survey the total number of households surveyed at both baseline and end line was 634 429 in the treatment group and 205 in the control group 10 10 we dropped one household that reported extremely large agricultural landholdings 250 ha from our balanced panel sample 11 11 households with fewer family members were more likely to move away but this attrition pattern did not significantly differ between project and control sites 25 we make two remarks on the dataset first the interval between baseline and end line is short only one year which enables us to examine the short term impact of safe water access second villagers living around different sites started to use them at different times with the period for using the new facilities in the project sites averaging six months varying from two months to ten months both rounds of the survey employed household and community questionnaires and these contained a wide variety of socio economic variables related to individuals households and communities the same questionnaire was used in both surveys with minor revisions after another pre test for the end line survey in the survey access to existing water sources outside houses was confirmed by both community and household questionnaires and the practice of fetching water per day from each water source for the day before the interview moreover rich information on health status was collected including episodes of illness injury for each individual family member over the previous two weeks and any diarrhea related symptoms over the same period together furthermore the survey collected detailed time use information by asking respondents to fill in a timetable for a whole day according to 18 types of activities 12 12 the most knowledgeable person was made responsible for providing information on use of time the time use survey allowed us to comprehensively measure the time spent on a variety of activities including time spent on water collection and water related chores 4 empirical model this study employs a difference in differences did approach to estimate the impact of the project the methodology requires a parallel trend as the central assumption we assume that any change between baseline and end line surveys without the intervention caused by unobserved characteristics is common between the project and control sites we perform a balance test at the baseline before the intervention of the project and compare the variables used in the estimation between the project and control sites in the next section we examine the impact of the project on a variety of outcomes related to water collection the basic specification is as follows 1 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 s j β 3 s j t ε i j t where i refers to a household j points to a site or village and t is time t 0 for baseline and t 1 for end line y ijt is the dependent variable y ijt is a continuous variable of 1 time spent on water collection in hours 2 water volume carried yesterday 3 number of trips yesterday and previous one week and 4 working days lost due to diarrhea y ijt is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if a household used a water treatment method chlorination boiling and filtration and 0 otherwise and 1 if a household had any diarrhea incidence all members adults school age children and pre school age children and 0 otherwise turning to the right hand side variables s j is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the site has a successful borehole and 0 otherwise β 0 to β 3 are the parameters to be estimated and β 3 measures the impact of the project on the outcomes ε i j t is an iid error term we employ an ordinary least squared ols estimation to obtain the coefficients and our specification is a linear probability model lpm when the dependent variable is binary the parallel trend assumption may be violated if changes in covariates are not common between the project and control sites therefore we also employ an empirical model which includes some covariates x i j t is a vector to include a set of household characteristics which includes two dummy variables that capture seasonal differences in the survey months july or august with reference to june x j t is a vector containing a set of site village j s characteristics other than success of facility construction s j which includes dummy variables that capture district level fixed effects by adding those covariates we write another version of our empirical model 2 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 s j β 3 s j t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same as in 1 except that γ 1 and γ 2 are vectors of the parameters to be estimated these models estimate the intention to treat itt impact of the project β 3 at the village level since not all households in the project sites used the new boreholes thus the direct impact of new boreholes installed by the project is captured by examining the effect on borehole users we also employ the following specifications 3 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 u i β 3 u i t β 2 e n u i β 3 e n u i t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same except for replacing s j to u i s and nu i u i is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the household used a borehole at the project site and 0 otherwise nu i is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the household does not use a borehole at the project site and 0 otherwise β 3 in specification 3 captures the direct effect while β 3 e captures a spillover effect if any further we employ the following specification to consider difference in distance from each house to boreholes among borehole users 4 y i j t β 0 β 1 t β 2 u i β 3 u i t β 4 u i t d i β 2 e n u i β 3 e n u i t x i j t γ 1 x j t γ 2 ε i j t where the notations are the same as in 3 except for d i which stands for distance to the new borehole in the project sites in terms of physical distance in kilometers and time in minutes all the regression models control for the covariates at the household and village level and all standard errors are clustered at the village level after performing these regressions we use the point estimate of the impact to calculate the economic value of costs and benefits of the new boreholes by each component which we discuss in detail in the following section 5 results and discussion 5 1 use rate of water sources table 2 summarizes the use rate of water sources from which rural households collect water 13 13 appendix 3 provides a brief subjective evaluation of the cleanliness and taste of each water source it is clear that the jica boreholes provide the cleanest and the best tasting water among the listed water sources in the project sites at the baseline survey only about 15 of the households had access to boreholes which were shallower than the new boreholes constructed by the project the majority of households formerly used shallow wells including hand dug wells or surface sub surface sources such as springs streams rivers and lakes at the time of the baseline survey the use rate of shallow wells was higher and the use rate of surface sub surface sources was lower in the project sites however in a broader sense over 90 of the population 95 3 in the project sites and 91 3 in the control sites relied on either shallow wells and or surface sub surface sources which are highly responsive to surface water and rainfall after construction of the new water facilities the end line survey reveals that the average distance to the new boreholes was 255 m and 77 9 of the sampled households used the new boreholes fig 3 shows a histogram of the households in the project sites and examines the relationship between distance to and the use rate of the new boreholes by employing a kernel weighted local polynomial regression the use rate was over 80 near the new boreholes and declined as the distance became greater after constructing the new boreholes the use rate of the other water sources declined significantly in the control sites the use rate of the boreholes rose to 35 because some shallower boreholes were newly constructed nonetheless the use rate of the other water sources remained unchanged suggesting that new borehole construction had limited influence on the control sites 14 14 32 33 examine the household choice of water sources and find that both supply side and demand side characteristics affect household decisions on water source choice note that a site in this study refers to a village we confirm that residents in a village fetch water from water sources in their own village and those in the control group did not collect water from a new borehole installed in a village in the treatment group the average distance to the nearest water source was 454 m in the project sites and 547 m in the control sites at the baseline survey both of which were reduced to 163 m and 395 m respectively 5 2 outcome variables and control covariates table 3 provides a sneak preview of outcome variables used to estimate the coping costs of water and the benefits of the groundwater development project we conducted balance tests of the outcome variables at the baseline survey and can confirm that there is no statistically significant difference between the project sites and control sites including water collection time by household members moreover table 4 reports a balance test of covariates used in the estimation at the household and village levels we do not see any significant difference between the project and control sites at the baseline survey we confirm that there is no statistically significant difference in all variables used in the estimation between project and control sites 15 15 we further confirmed that residents in the project and control sites had similar access to natural resources such as water and firewood and that their communities had similar infrastructure conditions such as roads irrigation and electricity as well as similar access to shops markets schools and health facilities at the time of the baseline survey therefore the balance tests of the initial conditions of the sites confirm that both project and control sites had similar demographic and socio economic characteristics at the baseline survey these observations justify our empirical approach described in the previous section and we can therefore employ the difference in differences estimation to examine if these differences are attributable to the project effect because the common trend assumption is likely to be violated when changes in covariates confound the trend we include control covariates in the estimation the summary statistics of covariates controlled for in multivariate regression analysis are shown in appendix 1 5 3 coping costs for water collection first of all we calculate the coping costs for water collection which is a key component of coping costs in the existing literature to cope with the scarcity of water resources local people spend a lot of time collecting water from various water sources our time use survey reveals that households on average were spending 3 53 h per day collecting water in the project sites and 3 61 h per day in the control sites at the baseline survey table 3 columns a and b 16 16 at the baseline survey l g 0 and the numbers represent l k at the end line survey the numbers represent l g l k in the project sites an increase in l g was accompanied by a decrease in l k this study examines the net effect of the project on the total time for water collection l g g m a x l k g m a x the average household size was 5 22 2 70 females and 2 52 males in the project sites and 5 17 2 58 females and 2 59 males in the control sites 17 17 the figures on household size are not shown in table 3 in the project sites 2 70 females 2 52 males consist of 0 62 0 57 pre school age children aged 0 to 6 0 91 0 87 school age children aged 7 to 18 1 07 0 98 working age adults aged 19 to 59 and 0 11 0 09 elderly aged 60 and above in the control sites 2 58 females 2 59 males consist of 0 65 0 67 pre school age children 0 78 0 82 school age children 1 05 1 03 working age adults and 0 10 0 08 elderly working age females aged 19 to 59 were the main collectors and on average spent 1 68 h per day in the project sites and 1 75 h per day in the control sites collecting water on average school age girls aged 7 to 18 spent 0 78 h per day in the project sites and 0 87 h per day in the control sites whereas school age boys spent 0 58 h per day in the project sites and 0 60 h per day in the control sites at the end line survey time spent on water collection in both project and control sites significantly decreased on average households spent 1 43 h per day on water collection in the project sites and 1 46 h per day in the control sites table 3 columns c and d then we evaluate the economic value of time spent on water collection by referring to the market wage rate one thousand zmk per hour equivalent to 1 54 usd per 8 h workday the market wage rate is calculated from the data in our survey on wage rates for unskilled labor in the three districts there are some values used as the weight in valuing time in the literature 11 used 25 of wages for unskilled labor in kenya while 14 showed that the value of time is approximately 50 of wages in kyrgyzstan 34 surveyed the existing studies on the topic and also found support for a commonly used rule of thumb of 50 of unskilled wages and argued that 25 is the lowest existing estimate thus we follow the rule of thumb in the literature to use 50 of wages of unskilled labor in valuing time by putting 50 as the weight the economic value of 3 53 h per day or 161 workdays per year is equivalent to 124 0 usd per year in the project sites while 3 60 h per day or 164 workdays per year is equivalent to 126 8 usd per year in the control sites these numbers indicate that the estimated coping cost spent on water collection is evaluated as 10 3 of total expenditures in the project sites and 10 6 in the control sites at the baseline in the same way we evaluate the value of time spent on water collection at the end line survey which is equivalent to 65 workdays or 46 8 usd per year in the project sites and 67 workdays or 48 2 usd per year in the control sites these numbers suggest that the coping cost for water collection was reduced to 2 9 of total expenditures in the project sites and 3 0 in the control sites we observe a reduction of time spent on fetching water and the consequent economic value of water collection in both treatment and control sites we now employ the difference in differences estimation to investigate the causal effects of new borehole construction on time spent for water collection table 5 reports the estimation results and shows that the project does not cause any change in time spent on water collection column a however we saw a reduction in time for water collection was a common trend over the survey period in both project and control sites even when we consider the effect of the use of the new boreholes column b as well as the interaction terms between the use of and distance to the new boreholes measured in kilometers in column c and in minutes in column d no significant causal effect is detected these results show that the construction of new boreholes did not reduce time spent on water collection in a causal way though the average time on water collection per se declined in both sites the little causal impact is revealed by utilizing a dataset collected under a quasi experimental setting of exogenously available new boreholes contrasting to most of the previous literature relying on cross sectional data we will disentangle behavioral changes in water collection in the next sub section the reduction in water collection time in both sites at the end line survey is partly explained by the difference in weather conditions since the average and maximum temperatures during the end line survey of 2013 were much lower than during the baseline survey period of 2012 the cooler conditions most likely reduced the demand for water particularly for drinking purposes which was highly likely to be a trend common across the project and control sites 18 18 the source of climate information is the global historical weather and climate data authorized by the national centers for environmental information noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration for this study most of the interviews were conducted during the second half of june in both 2012 and 2013 there were 8 days with a drop of 1 7 celsius in the maximum temperature in the middle of june in 2013 on june 18 for instance the maximum temperature was 26 celsius in 2012 and 19 celsius in 2013 the conditions also meant that farmers were expecting an earlier rainy season and began land preparation earlier 19 19 our dataset shows an increase in time spent on income generating activities including farming and a decrease in time spent on water collection for female adults who are often responsible for fetching water time spent on income generating activities increased from 3 78 h to 4 29 h between the baseline and end line surveys in the project sites compared to an increase from 3 60 h to 4 77 h in the control sites we perform a formal test on the difference in the change of time on income generating activities for female adults and confirm that the difference is not statistically significant please refer to appendix 2a and 2b for summary statistics for time use of women and men respectively 5 4 behavioral changes in water collection to explore the reasons for no causal effect of the project on time for water collection we further examine how the project changed behaviors of fetching water first we examine the effect of the project on water volume carried at the baseline survey the households on average fetched 64 1 l of water per day in the project sites and 63 6 l per day in the control sites which reduced to 52 6 l and 49 3 l after the intervention respectively table 3 table 6 presents the difference in differences estimation results to show that we could not find any significant effect of the project on the volume of water carried yet the point estimates suggest that the households in the project sites carried more water volume per day columns a d second we examine the effect of the project on the number of trips made to fetch water on average the households made 3 8 rounds for fetching water per day 23 0 rounds per week in the project sites and 3 6 rounds per day 22 5 rounds per week in the control sites at the baseline survey table 3 the number of trips per day in the project sites was unchanged but decreased to 21 0 rounds per week whereas the number of trips in the control sites decreased to 3 2 rounds per day and 17 9 rounds per week 20 20 we can estimate the volume of water carried per round at the baseline survey the households carried 16 9 l per trip in the project sites and 17 6 l per trip in the control sites which was reduced to 13 8 and 15 3 l per trip at the end line survey respectively the households in the project sites carried a slightly smaller volume of water each time we do not find any significant effect of the project on the number of trips per day columns e h in table 6 yet the point estimates suggest that the households in the project sites made more trips per day looking at the number of trips per week columns i l in table 6 the increase in the number of trips per week among the households living close to the new boreholes is statistically significant suggesting that they made 3 3 more trips for fetching water per week these results suggest that the demand for safe water increased particularly in the project sites because water from the new boreholes was e coli free hence the number of trips increased to obtain a greater volume of water and the total time spent on water collection did not decline this tendency is more pronounced among the borehole users living near the newly constructed boreholes confirming that these behavioral changes in fetching water were caused by new borehole construction 5 5 other coping costs another component of coping cost is the fixed amount payment for maintenance and administration fees to use the new boreholes the majority of the users paid 1 zmk per month at the end line survey after the redenomination of the currency in 2013 equivalent to 2 16 usd per year at the price level of june 2012 other coping costs were comprised of fees for water storage and for utilizing water treatment methods in our survey households used plastic containers and clay pots for storing water and more than 90 stored water for drinking purposes separately of which more than 90 comprised covered containers with a lid we examined behavioral changes in storing water due to the project but we did not find any significant change in the behaviors of storing water at home not shown we also collected information about the utilization of water treatment methods such as boiling water chlorination and filtration among various water treatment methods chlorination was the most popular at the baseline survey 22 6 of the households utilized chlorine in the project sites and 22 9 did in the control sites which decreased to 9 8 and 19 5 respectively table 3 table 7 shows the estimation results from the difference in differences estimations to explore the causal effect of the project on the utilization of chlorine and reports a 10 percentage point decrease which is statistically significant columns a d in addition the households in the project sites tended to stop boiling and filtering columns e l although the application rates of these water treatment methods were low less than 10 of the households boiled water and less than 1 filtered water these results show that households in the treatment sites saved water treatment costs through the construction of new boreholes people tended to cease using chlorine an indication that they believed that the water supply from the new boreholes was safe chlorination also makes the taste of water unpleasant moreover those households cut coping costs for boiling and filtering by reducing the utilization of these water treatment methods the households in the project sites reduced some coping costs saving approximately 2 usd per year 21 21 the market price of one bottle of chlorine to disinfect the maximum of 1 000 l of water needed to satisfy demand for a family with six members for one month in lusaka the capital city of zambia was estimated at 0 2 to 0 3 usd 21 22 we did not include the benefits from the reduction in water treatment costs for the village level benefits since villagers did not commit to water treatment collectively 5 6 estimates of the health benefits of the project now we turn to the health benefits of the project because the project provided safe water we expected a reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases particularly diarrhea 22 22 there is a vast quantity of literature on estimating the impact of water quality and quantity on improvements in health particularly diarrhea for instance see refs 35 36 and 37 our surveys collected information about diarrheal episodes over the previous two weeks and the number of days during which each household member could not perform regular activities due to diarrhea on average the households reported 0 128 diarrhea cases in the project sites and 0 122 cases in the control site at the baseline which decreased to 0 091 cases in the project sites and increased to 0 146 cases in the control sites at the end line survey table 3 table 8 shows the difference in differences estimation results to demonstrate that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 073 cases per household over the previous two weeks equivalent to a 57 decrease in the incidence of diarrhea the magnitude of the impact is larger and statistically significant among the borehole users living close to the new boreholes columns b to estimate the economic values of the health benefits we consider the following age cohorts separately working age adults aged 19 to 59 school age children aged 7 to 18 and pre school age children aged 0 to 6 among working age adults the household reported 0 033 diarrhea cases in the project sites and 0 024 cases in the control site which decreased to 0 026 cases in the project sites and increased to 0 044 cases in the control sites at the end line survey table 3 table 8 reports that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 029 cases column e and days lost by 0 123 days per two weeks or 3 198 days per year column i among working age adults based on these figures we evaluate the health benefit of the project for working age adults by using 50 of the market wage rate which is the same as the valuation of time for water collection the economic value of the reduction in diarrhea incidence among working age adults is estimated as 2 46 usd per year for the school age cohort the households reported 0 026 diarrhea cases over the previous two weeks in the project sites and 0 024 cases in the control site at the baseline survey which decreased to 0 019 cases and 0 015 cases at the end line survey respectively table 3 table 9 provides the difference in differences estimation results to show that no significant causal effect of the project was observed columns a d for the pre school age cohort the households reported 0 068 diarrhea cases over the previous two weeks in the project sites and 0 063 cases in the control site at the baseline survey which decreased to 0 035 cases and increased to 0 078 cases at the end line survey respectively table 9 table 9 shows the difference in differences estimation to reveal that the project reduced diarrhea incidence by 0 055 cases per household over the previous two weeks which is statistically significant columns e and indicates about an 80 decrease in the incidence of diarrhea the magnitude of the health impact is larger among the borehole users columns f h thus we show that the project reduced diarrhea incidence both for school age and preschool age children but significantly only for the latter we do not evaluate the economic value of the decline of diarrhea incidence for preschool age children using a portion of market wage since they are obviously not working the economic value of the decline of diarrhea incidence is considered in the context of daly estimates below 5 7 robustness checks we now turn to the robustness checks of our estimation results first we examined how our empirical findings can be affected by attrition and we investigated how initial conditions of households and villages at the baseline survey were associated with attrition at the end line survey to do so we estimated the probit model and found some systematic patterns that result in attrition hence we employed several bias correction techniques wooldridge 2010 such as an inverse probability weighting ipw regression and heckman s two step selection model nonetheless our estimates were intact 23 23 the results are available upon request from the authors second we need to consider possible violation of the common trend assumption arising from changes in water sources in the control sites new boreholes were constructed by other organizations and residents themselves dug new shallow wells in the control sites however the boreholes in the project sites are differentiated from other water facilities which were shallower and the water quality is likely to be ambiguous moreover between baseline and end line surveys the distance to the nearest water sources was reduced from 454 m to 163 m in the project sites and 547 m to 395 m in the control sites the construction of other water facilities in the control sites is highly likely to underestimate the impacts of the jica project providing a lower bound of estimates 5 8 internal rate of return of the project and potential additional benefits due to dalys averted the economic values of the various components calculated in this section are shown in table 1 armed with the numbers in the table we estimate the internal rate of return of the project we assume the average population in a target village was 480 households and the average construction costs for a new borehole are approximately 20 000 usd we further assume that net benefits from the newly constructed boreholes materialize every year and will continue for 20 years then the estimated internal rate of return of the project is about 1 64 while the estimated internal rate of return based on the static model is not large we are likely to miss some dynamic health benefits a typical and very important one in our context is the decrease in dalys the daly is a health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death to include equivalent years of healthy life lost by virtue of individuals being in states of poor health or disability 38 dalys for a disease or health condition e g diarrhea in our case are calculated as the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality yll in the population and years of life lost due to disability yld for incident cases of the health condition 39 we apply the concept of the daly prevented by the project to our exercise for two reasons first in the calculation of the internal return of the project we put zero value on the benefits arising from the decrease in diarrhea for school age and preschool age children however once a child reaches the age of a working adult their productivity loss must be taken into account a factor that is not included in the calculation of internal rate of return 24 24 see ref 40 for an attempt at valuing children s health using the concept of dalys in the context of demand for water filters in northern ghana second we want to value mortality risk reduction by avoiding diarrhea which justifies using dalys in our context we acknowledge that some caution is needed in interpreting daly estimates because we double count the productivity loss in the case of working age adults by considering both the economic value estimated from our empirical estimations and the monetary value of dalys that simultaneously include yld there have been some variants of the daly estimates depending on diseases and countries as well as methodologies our estimation relies on age standardized dalys 1015 5 per 100 000 caused by diarrheal diseases in 2013 41 multiplied by the ratio of 1 19 for zambia 42 among all age groups a 57 decrease in diarrhea incidence is associated with 688 1 per 100 000 age standardized dalys averted the average household size of our sample is 5 20 and thus the decrease in dalys corresponds to 8 95 working days for a family which can be evaluated as 6 88 usd using 50 of the market wage rate of unskilled labor in the three districts as a weight 25 25 following 11 we assume 250 working days per year our estimate indicates that the health benefit caused by the reduction in diarrhea incidence is worth 192 3 usd per daly whereas the gdp per capita in zambia was 1 878 usd in 2013 6 conclusion this study attempts to evaluate the economic value of a groundwater development project which provides safe water by constructing new boreholes free from potential contamination we show that the share of time value for water collection in total expenditures was estimated to be about 10 at the baseline survey which was reduced to 3 at the end line survey but the project did not reduce the time burden to collect water because the demand for safe water increased hence the main net benefit of the project lies in improved productivity due to decreased diarrhea incidence among working age adults the estimated internal rate of return of the project is not large however the project is likely to have additional dynamic health benefits due to the decrease in disability adjusted life years dalys corresponding to 192 3 usd per daly and 6 88 usd per household we add to the existing literature by providing new evidence on measuring the economic value of safe water in a quasi experimental setting we acknowledge the limitations of this study in some aspects first we focused on a short run impact of new boreholes since the interval between the baseline and end line surveys is one year and the longer term impact is beyond our scope we also show that conditions were cooler in the post project evaluation which may have reduced the effect of new boreholes in the short term due to lower demand for drinking water among the control and treated groups thus we need to extend the analysis over a longer period to mitigate short run fluctuations second we cannot compare the quality of water with other sources using objective measures though the quality of water is high in new boreholes with a sufficient depth further research should refine economic valuations of safe water from a variety of sources in more rigorous ways in developing countries which will be indispensable for improving the living standards of people suffering from scarcity of water and lack of supply through a better understanding of efficient mechanisms for nonmarket goods supply while it has been established that household perceptions of water quality are important drivers of demand for water supply a rigorous examination and comparison of water quality from each water facility using objective measures is indispensable to measuring the economic benefit of water sources in a more precise way author statement yasuharu shimamura conceptualization main analysis satoshi shimizutani project

8664,this study aims to analyze the effects of local water market formation in a limited region of the gavkhuni basin located in the center of iran an economic optimization mathematical model called inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep is developed to address the study objectives the proposed model seeks to maximize the net benefit of participating agents in the water market mechanism this model can determine the scope of production activities and the monthly volume of water exchange through different technical methods of water transfer results demonstrate that the agriculture sector contributes to an increase in the productions of the agriculture industries and building industries through selling its surplus water although farm agents sell only 1 of their groundwater permits to industrial agents the total net benefit of the agents is increased by more than 30 compared to when the water market is not implemented the shared aquifer method based on common pool groundwater resources is identified as a suitable technical method for water transfer in the groundwater markets finally the socio hydrological analysis of groundwater exchanges reveals that the inter sectoral water market at the local scale can increase the region s employment rate by 45 and mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector these results clarify the efficient role of market based groundwater allocation approach under water scarcity conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords water economics water trading optimization technical instruments inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep 1 introduction rising demand as well as limited and falling water supply have led to an imbalance between water resources and consumption in many river basins of the world 6 17 part of this imbalance is due to the uneconomical uses of water resources for example different consumers have little incentives to efficiently use water resources due to low water tariffs 37 on the other hand the impossibility of increasing the supply leads to a relative water scarcity that increases the value of the water resources 42 consequently a shift has occurred from supply driven policies to water demand management and conservation 47 water market is one of the various tools to implement water demand management policies 7 water market is an institution where water is exchanged based on its economic value between buyers and sellers the trading pattern is such a way that water is allocated to the sectors generating higher benefits 11 accordingly this economic tool provides further access to more efficient water allocation water market modelling is one of the important research fields in recent years for instance analyzing factors affecting water exchanges in an active water market has been achieved using econometric models 15 25 the water market has also been modeled by economic optimization models in which the water exchange processes among various agents have been set to maximize the net benefits and optimize the crop pattern and the consumed water volume 30 41 45 some studies 20 29 combine an economic optimization model with a hydrological balance model this integration of the economic hydrological model leads to a more realistic economic analysis of water trading finally another type of water market modelling approach is to simulate the behaviors of participating agents in the water market mechanism using agent based models 1 2 50 these models determine how one agent interacts with other agents in the water market mechanism by defining a set of behavioral rules for each agent the water market modelling literature mostly examines economic effects 20 30 other aspects have also been studied such as social effects 2 25 equity 1 45 effects on third parties such as the environment and other water rights owners 21 22 and hydrological impacts 1 28 however economic analysis of the impacts of water transfer technical methods on market performance has been received less attention on the other hand almost all water laws have an order of priority for the use of water with the agriculture sector holding the least priority in this regard the domestic sector and sometimes the industry sector would have preferences over the agriculture sector 8 therefore the inter sectoral water market is not usual and previous studies mostly include water exchange modelling among farms 1 45 nonetheless in some cases due to water scarcity conditions and the need to improve water use productivity water trading between farms and the industry sector is generally modeled on an annual time scale 30 49 only the benefits of the industry sector have been analyzed and changes in the production amount of industrial products for which water is a main production input have not been estimated this paper s new contribution to the literature is to consider different agricultural and industrial water market participants the proposed groundwater trading model not only calculates the net benefit of each market participant but also determines the production amount of different products another contribution of the paper is providing the link between the economic and technical aspects of groundwater exchanges so that in the economic analysis of the water market the proposed model detects the most suitable technical methods of water transfer among agents which imposes the minimum transfer costs on the system this paper presents two physical and non physical methods of water transfer in the market mechanism the physical transfer of water is usually by tanker or pipeline 50 however previous studies have less addressed the non physical transfer of groundwater therefore this paper introduces an efficient technical method for non physical exchanges in local water markets which is based on common pool groundwater resources 32 the volumes of water supply and demand for each industrial and agricultural water participant in the water market change monthly according to the monthly water demands of its products therefore another advantage of this research is the planning of groundwater exchanges on a monthly time scale there are also some socio hydrological concerns regarding the inter sectoral groundwater market such as adverse effects on the scope of agricultural activities 38 49 the reduction of return flows to the aquifer and groundwater overexploitation 1 7 31 thus the socio hydrological analysis of such exchanges is necessary this paper s objectives are pursued through the development of an inter sectoral water exchange programming iwep analysis and its application in a real case study located in iran 2 study area in this paper isfahan borkhar plain located in the gavkhuni basin is selected as a case study the average drawdown of the groundwater table in this plain was 0 76 m per year for the 2008 to 2014 period 24 thus iran s ministry of energy has declared the isfahan borkhar plain as a critical plain the volume of surface water resources is also extremely limited 48 given the shortage of groundwater resources in the region supporting the water demand management policies such as the formation of a groundwater market may help meet current water demands especially in the industry sector without putting further pressure on the aquifer and change the water allocation to consumers with higher productivity in the study area several agricultural and industrial agents are usually scattered throughout the region therefore to simplify the modelling process and analyze the implementation effects of the water market mechanism these agents should be classified into homogeneous units for this purpose any type of agent farm greenhouse etc that are spatially close to each other are considered as a unit in this regard the authors have identified and classified similar agents which were close to each other based on geographical maps and their field visits then they used gps device to determine the proper geographical location of the center of these categories which indicates the location of each water market participant in the model this classification has led to 25 participating agents in the inter sectoral water market mechanism and fig 1 presents their geographical locations the required data for the modelling process have been collected through documentary research 23 24 48 survey research and selected expert knowledge table 1 reports the economic data for the farming year 2015 2016 the data includes the price yield production cost and economic value of water for different agricultural and industrial products according to table 1 the economic value of water for each product is calculated as the net benefit divided by the water demand where the net benefit includes the difference between benefits and costs for farm and greenhouse agents the total water demand is considered to calculate the economic value of water the total water demand is obtained as the net water demand divided by the irrigation efficiency 1 1 for instance for wheat the net benefit is equal to 0 36 4700 870 822 us ha the total water demand is 5284 0 45 11 743 m3 as a result the economic value of water is calculated as equal to 822 11 743 0 07 us m3 3 methodology this section presents the structure of the proposed methodology including the conceptual and the computational models for water trading among participating agents in the inter sectoral groundwater market 3 1 conceptual model fig 2 illustrates the conceptual model for the inter sectoral water market of the isfahan borkhar plain the participating agents in this market include farms agriculture industries greenhouse dairy cattle farm and broiler chicken farm and building industries stone cutting and brick factory each agent can be a water buyer and or water seller government control on water market performance can have benefits such as reducing conflicts 38 adverse external effects 31 and environmental damage 7 38 therefore it is necessary to consider a set of control policies by the government through a top down process and inform the participating agents in the water market of such policies these policies include groundwater withdrawal limitations and production limitations in the industry sector under market demand these policies allow the water exchange volume to be determined rationally and prevent the adverse external effects of water exchange such as a decrease in the production amount and the employment rate in the water seller sector moreover each agent participates in the water market only if its initial net benefit is preserved and its further water demand is considered these issues are considered as bottom up utilities for each agent separately after considering the government s goals and the agents utilities the water exchange processes take place directly between buyers and sellers in the processes each water seller agent can trade with several buyers simultaneously the conceptual model is based on the fact that water is a main production input for various agricultural and industrial products therefore if an agent purchases water it will use water as the main input to increase its initial production on the other hand water sales for one agent leads to a reduction in production amount due to a decrease in the available water volume the total net benefit is determined so that the sum of all agents net benefits is maximized note that participation in the water market is voluntary and at least the initial net benefit of each agent must be maintained each agent obtains the follow up net benefit based on net benefits of product sales and water trading the net benefit of product sales for each agent is calculated based on its available water volume which is influenced by the monthly results of the water exchanges the net benefit of water trading is obtained from the difference between water sales benefits and water trading costs finally with the formation of the water market the water seller agents may increase groundwater withdrawal due to the benefits of water sales with the possibility of water transfer from the agriculture sector to the industry sector the return flows to the aquifer will naturally decrease therefore the inter sectoral water market can have adverse effects on the discharge and recharge flows of the aquifer thus the groundwater hydrology analysis to estimate the aquifer s storage volume is essential 3 2 computational model the computational model presents the formulations of the general water trading model derived from the conceptual model the proposed model is a positive mathematical programming pmp model 9 18 this positive model aims to simulate the farm agents behaviors under water trading policy through a calibration process based on the observed reality more details about the proposed pmp model can be found in the appendix section in the following part the objective function and the constraints of the general optimization model are described 3 2 1 objective function the objective function of the general water trading model as expressed in equation 1 presents the total net benefit of participating agents in the water market with regard to constraints and real policies in the region equation 2 calculates the net benefit of each agent based on the economic benefits from product sales and water trading 1 max z i n b i i 1 n 2 n b i n b i p s n b i w t i 1 n the variables nb nb ps and nb wt show the total net benefit net benefits of product sales and net benefits of water trading in us dollars z also represents the value of the objective function the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n product sales equations 3 and 4 calculate the net benefits of crop sales nb ps for farm and greenhouse agents respectively 3 n b i p s c s p c i y c i p c c i i 1 f 4 n b i p s c s p c i y c i a c c i x c i i f 1 l where the variable y is the yield function production function of farming crops kg also the variable pc represents the production cost function us for farm agents these non linear functions are calculated based on three inputs of water land and capital see appendix section 2 2 these non linear functions will be also applicable to greenhouse agents if the adequate and accurate information about the required inputs related costs and the elasticity of substitution of these inputs is provided the parameter sp is the sales price of the crop us kg for farm and greenhouse agents furthermore the decision variable x represents the cultivation area of the greenhouse crop ha the parameters y and ac are the yield of the crop kg ha and the average cost for crop production us ha in greenhouse agents the values of these parameters for each crop are listed in table 1 the yield parameter values for each greenhouse crop are constant thus water exchange which changes the available water volume for greenhouse agents directly affects the decision variable of the cultivation area the subscripts c and i are the indices for crops and farm and greenhouse agents respectively the total number of farm and greenhouse agents is l moreover f shows the total number of farm agents equation 5 encompasses the net benefits of product sales nb ps for the rest of participating agents in the water market these agents include the dairy cattle farm broiler chicken farm stone cutting and brick factory 5 n b i p s u i y i i n d s p i i n d a c i i n d i l 1 n the decision variable u shows the production amount for each agent for the dairy cattle farm and broiler chicken farm agents this variable indicates the number of bred animals 3 3 the number of animals raised in a livestock and poultry farm is an integer that corresponds to the real world nevertheless in this study the number of animals is significantly great and using integer programming increases model solving complexity therefore the number of animals included in the model is considered as continuous variables then after running the model the number of cattle and chickens is reported as an integer the parameters yind and spind show the yield and sales price for each industrial product furthermore the parameter acind is the average cost for production of the industrial product the values of these parameters for each agent are presented in table 1 the stone cutting and brick factory agents do not have the yield parameter the yield parameter value for each agent is considered a constant number that does not change during the water exchange process as a result water exchange directly affects the number of animals or the production amount of building industries the subscript i is the index of each agent as mentioned earlier the number of all agents and the total number of farm and greenhouse agents are n and l respectively therefore the total number of agents for equation 5 is n l water trading equation 6 represents the net benefit of water trading nb wt for each participating agent in the water market according to this equation the net benefit of each agent includes the difference between water sales benefits and water trading costs water trading costs include water purchase cost water transfer cost by different technical methods and transaction costs 6 n b i w t w p 1 0 5 ψ m s w m i t 1 0 5 ψ m b w m i t m j k t c j i k s w m j i k i 1 n where the decision variables sw t and bw t denote the monthly volume of sold and bought water for each agent m3 respectively the tc and ψ represent the water transfer cost and the transaction cost coefficient moreover the wp is the optimal price of water exchange us m3 note that the proposed methodology for determining the water exchange price is presented in detail in section 3 4 the subscripts i and j are the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n furthermore the subscripts m and k indicates the month and technical method of water transfer the coefficient of transaction cost is equal to 0 1 45 the transaction costs are shared equally between the water buyer and the seller agents 1 45 the coefficient of 0 5 is also considered in equation 6 for the same reason two technical methods of water transfer are considered including tanker and shared aquifer the water transfer cost by tanker depends on the transferred water volume and the distance between the buyer and the seller which is 0 05 us m3 km in the model 3 50 in the shared aquifer method using the common pool groundwater resources concept 32 the water buyer agent withdraws the equivalent purchased groundwater volume from its well on the other hand the water seller agent does not withdraw from its own well to sell water therefore only the groundwater permit is exchanged between the buyer and the seller and no physical transfer of water occurs the water transfer cost by the shared aquifer method includes the monitoring cost of water exchanges 3 the cost of this method is related to the administrative affairs of the local water market it is a type of transaction costs independent of the pumping costs and equivalent to 0 1 us m3 for each agent 3 2 2 constraints bottom up utilities under equation 7 the consumed water volume should be equal to the groundwater permit volume and the bought water volume minus the sold water volume this constraint supplies the required water for each farm and greenhouse agent this bottom up utility is similarly developed for other agents in equation 8 7 c w d c m i e i x c i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i 1 l m 8 w d m i i n d u i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i l 1 n m in these equations the parameters wd and wd ind respectively show the water demand for farm and greenhouse crops and industrial products the values of which are presented in table 1 the decision variable x represents the cultivation area of the farm and greenhouse crops ha note that the variable x c i for farm agents is exactly the same as the variable id c q land i used in the proposed pmp model formulations the variable id c q land i shows the land input cultivation area for each crop and farm see appendix section moreover the parameter gp denotes the groundwater permit volume m3 where none of the agents in groundwater extraction from the aquifer is superior to other agents groundwater permit is determined based on the water demand and the current production amount of each agent the irrigation efficiency ie is equal to 0 45 and 0 9 for each farm and greenhouse agent respectively 23 subscripts and other decision variables are defined in the previous equations finally to motivate participation in the water market the limitation on preserving the initial net benefit for each agent is considered in equation 9 9 n b i n b i i n i t i a l i 1 n where the variables nb and nb initial represent net benefit and initial net benefit in us dollars respectively as before the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n top down policies equation 10 states that the sold water volume should be below the groundwater permit to prevent excessive groundwater withdrawal 10 s w m i t g p m i i 1 n m the decision variable sw t and the parameter gp denote the monthly volume of sold water m3 and groundwater permit volume m3 for each agent respectively as before the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n in addition the subscript m indicates the month the cultivation area limitations for farm and greenhouse agents are included in the model according to equation 11 equation 12 reflects the minimum and maximum limitations on each crop s production amount for greenhouse agents note that the proposed pmp model can determine how to distribute the cultivation area for different crops of each farm agent furthermore equation 13 seeks to meet market demand for industrial products 11 x i min c x c i x i max i 1 l 12 x c min i x c i x c max c 13 u i min u i u i max i l 1 n in these equations the decision variable x shows the cultivation area of the crop ha for farm and greenhouse agents as mentioned earlier the variable x c i for farm agents is exactly the same as the variable id c q land i used in the proposed pmp model formulations see appendix section the decision variable u also represents the production amount for other type of agents the subscripts i and c are the indices for agents and greenhouse crops respectively the number of all agents and the total number of farm and greenhouse agents are n and l respectively the minimum cultivation area x min for each farm and greenhouse agent is equivalent to a reduction of 50 of the current cultivation area and maintaining the current cultivation area respectively the maximum cultivation area x max is also the total current cultivation area together with the fallow area finally the upper bound for the production amount of the agriculture industries and building industries products are a 20 and a 50 increment compared to the current production amount respectively the lower bound is also the maintenance of the current production amount water balance in the market equation 14 reflects that the monthly volume of bought water with a technical method bw for each agent i is equal to the sum of the monthly volume of sold water with the same technical method sw from other agents of j to that agent i 14 j s w m j i k b w m i k j 1 n i 1 n m k where the subscripts m and k are the indices for the month and technical method of water transfer moreover n is the number of all agents equation 15 illustrates that the monthly volume of bought water for each agent bw t is equal to the sum of the monthly volume of bought water with different technical methods for each agent bw 15 k b w m i k b w m i t i 1 n m equation 16 presents the water balance in a month accordingly the total monthly volume of sold water by water seller agents equals the total monthly volume of bought water by water buyer agents 16 i b w m i t i s w m i t i 1 n m each agent in the inter sectoral water market mechanism is both seller and buyer so that each agent cannot buy and sell water within the same month equation 17 reflects this limitation 17 b w m i k s w m i s 0 i 1 n k s m where the decision variables sw and bw show the monthly volume of sold and bought water with a technical method for each agent in m3 respectively the subscripts m and i are the indices for month and agent where the number of all agents is n also the subscripts k and s indicates the technical method of water transfer which can differ in terms of selling or purchasing water therefore equation 17 is a non linear constraint finally equation 18 states that water sales from an agent to the same agent sw is not possible 18 s w m i i 0 i 1 n m groundwater hydrology a hydrological system such as an aquifer is in equilibrium when the volume of inflows recharge flows and outflows discharge flows are equal 5 in other words the variation of the aquifer s storage volume should be zero at any time the balance equation can be formulated in equation 19 48 19 δ v r f d f where the variables δv rf and df denote the storage volume changes recharge flows and discharge flows for the studied aquifer in m3 respectively the studied groundwater market is on a local scale and not all wells participate in this market therefore the aquifer s discharge flows are classified into two categories including participating wells and non participating wells in the water market equation 20 illustrates this classification equation 21 also calculates the volume of discharge flows by market participants where this category of discharge flows is affected by the water exchanges volume 20 d f d f n m d f m 21 d f m m i g p m i i 1 n the parameter gp is the groundwater permit volume m3 for each market participant the subscripts i and m are the indices of each agent and month where the number of all agents is n also the symbols m and nm represent the two categories of market participants and non market participants respectively the volume of discharge flows by non participating wells in the water market dfnm is constant equation 22 reflects the recharge flows inflows to the aquifer 48 equation 23 is also developed to calculate the volume of return flows to the aquifer from the participating agents in the water market 22 r f i s f g f r g n m r g m 23 r g m m i φ i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i 1 n where the parameters i sf and gf are the infiltrated precipitation net surface water flows and net groundwater flows entering the aquifer in m3 respectively the value of these parameters is constant the decision variables bw t and sw t represent the monthly volume of bought and sold water in m3 for each agent furthermore rg represents the volume of returned groundwater flows from different consumption classified into the two categories of market participants rgm and non market participants rgnm the volume of return flows from non market participants does not change after water exchanges because the volume of discharge flows by these agents dfnm is constant the subscripts and other variables are already defined finally φ coefficient represents the percentage of consumed water that returns to the aquifer the values of this coefficient for farms agriculture industries and building industries are 0 4 0 05 and 0 1 respectively 24 as a result for the same volume of water consumption the volume of return flows from the agriculture sector is much higher than the industry sector 3 3 solving the computational model the mathematical model s algorithm known as inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep was written in the gams software platform to achieve the optimal solution the proposed model was solved using gams s conopt4 solver as a tool for solving non linear programming nlp problems the proposed groundwater allocation model was run in two modes in one mode the water market existed and the other one was without a water market there is no water exchange in the mode without water market so the decision variables of sold and bought water volume bw t and sw t variables in gams software are set equal to zero 3 4 determination of water exchange price the market price of water wp can be incorporated as a variable in the general water trading model see equation 6 in other words the water exchange price can be determined endogenously inside this market model this endogenous variable turns the iwep model into a non linear one there are several powerful solvers available for gams software that solve the non linear models however as is well known sometimes there are difficulties for solving non linear models and obtaining a global optimum through the solvers of gams software 16 these difficulties usually come from an inadequate definition of the model inadequate scaling of large models low starting points and an insufficient solver selection on the other hand if a global optimum is not obtained a local optimum can be obtained the special attention to the starting point and the model s limits is necessary to ensure that the local optimum obtained is the global optimum 16 there are not enough starting points to reasonably consider the local optimum as the global optimum in this study therefore to deal with the difficulties mentioned above this paper following the previous studies 27 36 proposes an iterative numerical approach to simulate the water market functioning and determine the water exchange price the proposed methodology parameterizes the water price where a variable turns into an external parameter 4 4 in addition to the proposed methodology in this study there are other alternatives in the literature that can yield similar outputs to inform readers some price endogenous approaches can be referred such as deriving the market price as the dual value of water availability limitations 10 43 46 forcing the market equilibrium price to be equal to the shadow price of water 14 26 45 simulating the market equilibrium price based on the obtained water demand curves and various quantities of water supply 4 40 and setting the market price equal to the marginal utility of water for all participants based on the special attention to the starting values for model solving and the validation of the results 16 all of these studies have used gams software to find the endogenous market price this method involves developing a water pricing range so that testing the different prices influences the model functioning to determine the optimal price of water exchange the lower and upper bounds of the water pricing range are selected to be equivalent to the marginal value of water in the farms and industry sectors respectively in other words the minimum sale price for farms and maximum purchase price for the industry is the value added of their water permits note that the marginal value of water is the shadow price of water when there is no market the proposed methodology introduces the pricing range as the search space to determine the optimal price of water exchange in order to be able to find the market price by solvers of gams software this study suggests that the continuous solution space i e the water pricing range be discretized this process should be such that the discretization steps are as small as possible and the continuity of the solution space is maintained in this regard the proposed methodology creates the water prices with a specific numerical distance from each other equivalent to 1 of the lower bound that cover the continuous space between the lower and upper bounds then the general water trading model is executed under discretized prices finally the price that brings the highest net benefit for the set of participating agents in the water market is identified as the optimal price of water exchange 4 results this section encompasses the results of solving the iwep model in three categories water exchanges volume economic analysis and socio hydrological concerns 4 1 water exchanges volume the volume of water supply and demand varies monthly in the inter sectoral water market mechanism because the participants in this type of water market in different months of the year have different water demands therefore it is necessary to evaluate groundwater trading on a monthly time scale fig 3 illustrates the monthly volume of exchanges in the water market mechanism the maximum volume of water exchanges occurs in august and september during these months the livestock and poultry farm agents as well as greenhouse crops have higher water demands additionally the water exchanges volume through the shared aquifer method is higher than the tanker in most months of the year in fact despite the limited capacity of the tanker in the region to transfer water the shared aquifer method has a significant capacity for groundwater exchanges which can be seen in fig 3 based on the monthly scale fig 4 provides the view of supplying the region s water demands as can be seen due to the water scarcity conditions groundwater permits cannot supply all of the region s water demands however the water market mechanism supports 10 of the remaining demands ultimately 11 of the total water demands are still not supplied the sum of water exchanges volume for all months of the year is equal to 217 368 m3 where the shared aquifer method forms more than half of the water transfers according to fig 4 most of the exchanges are performed non physically through the shared aquifer method as its cost is lower than the cost imposed by the tankers economic analysis of the local water market reveals that non physical groundwater transfer is more cost effective than the physical water transfer therefore the shared aquifer method can be a suitable method for water transfer in the groundwater markets the proposed model for inter sectoral groundwater trading is a general model in which each agricultural and industrial agent can be a water buyer and seller agent the execution results of this general model represent that only farm agents sell water and other agents do not sell water to each other in other words all agents are allowed to sell water still the industry sector s production limitations under market demand derived from top down policies in the region affect the water sales flow this is because the industrial agents must maintain their current production on the other hand the available water volume for these agents is limited therefore in order to maintain initial production they cannot be the water seller another finding is that there are no inter farms water exchanges running the model in the absence of the agriculture industry and building industry agents provides the same result the economic values of water are the same for farms thus hypothetically a significant difference is made in the economic value of water for each crop among different farms and the general model is executed the results of this sensitivity analysis illustrate that although water exchange occurs between farms most of the purchased water volume belongs to industrial agents with very high economic value of water consequently it can be concluded that water exchange between farms occurs if there is a difference among the economic values of their water resources so that these differences compensate for the transaction costs this finding is consistent with the results of other studies 1 21 on the theory of water market formation i e the differences in the economic value of water between water buyer and seller agents the economic value of water in the industry sector is high thus the industrial agents purchase water from farms to increase their production fig 5 presents the purchased water volume by these agents due to water demands and production constraints the purchased water volume for broiler chicken farms are much less than other industrial agents the greenhouse and broiler chicken farm agents buy water only through the tanker because water purchase through tanker is more cost effective due to their relatively short geographical distance from the water supplying farms furthermore the dairy cattle farm stone cutting and brick factory agents purchase water mostly through the shared aquifer method according to figs 5 and 93 66 and 95 of purchased water volume in the dairy cattle farm stone cutting and brick factory agents are carried out through the shared aquifer method respectively and tankers transfer the rest additionally the total sold water volume by farms equivalent to the sum of purchased water for all agents is approximately 1 of farms groundwater withdrawal permits in other words farms generally sell only 1 of their groundwater permits to the water purchasing agents through the market mechanism the model does not directly consider a limitation on the water sales volume thus the low volume of water exchanges arises from applying the top down policies on the production amount of various industrial products the inclusion of these restrictive policies makes the rational exchange process and to some extent fair without the direct involvement of the government 4 2 economic analysis table 2 demonstrates the results of the production amount for each agent since the proposed model is a pmp model in the without water market mode the cultivation area of crops should be exactly equal to their current cultivation area at the different farms simulating the farm agents behaviors under non market mode shows that the difference between the cultivated area of farm crops and their current cultivated area at different farms is less than 0 1 following 20 a less than 1 deviation in the crop pattern results is permissible given the small perturbations in the calibration constraints therefore the calibration process of the proposed pmp model has been performed with appropriate accuracy and the parameters of non linear functions have been estimated in such a way as to reproduce the current cropping pattern accurately thus the policy analysis s results of the proposed pmp model can be trusted due to the irrigation water sales the cultivation area for most farm crops decreases compared to the without water market mode only the cultivation area of melon with the highest economic value remains constant moreover barley with the lowest economic value undergone the greatest reduction in cultivation area as a result the fallow area increases by 19 ha after the water exchange the cultivation area for greenhouse crops including tomato and bell pepper remains constant however the cultivation area for cucumber increases by 20 these results indicate that greenhouse agents compensate for the water limitation and increase the production of crops with higher economic value through purchasing water within the market mechanism the production amount of industrial agents has decreased due to water scarcity conditions so that these agents tend to purchase irrigation water to compensate for the water limitation on the other hand the iwep model can determine the production amount of industrial products as a decision variable the exchanged water is the main input for the production of these industrial products the results reported in table 2 show an increase in the production amount of the agriculture industry and building industry agents in the water market mode compared to the mode without water market each agent produces as much as its capacity by purchasing water through the market mechanism the increased production rates per dairy cattle farm or broiler chicken farm and building industry agents are 20 and 50 respectively according to the proposed methodology of the present study in order to determine the market price of water see section 3 4 the lower and upper bounds of the water pricing range are 0 17 and 30 us m3 respectively the discretization process of the solution space leads to the creation of about 18 000 price points within the pricing range therefore in order to find the water exchange price the iwep model has been consecutively executed at 18 000 price points and the corresponding net benefit of the system has been saved the results reveal that the optimal price of water exchange is equal to the lower bound of the pricing range 0 17 us m3 in other words the proposed methodology has been detects the market price equal to the minimum price that can be considered for water input in the region the reason for choosing the lowest possible price for water exchange by the iwep model is that the objective function of the model see equation 1 includes maximizing the total net benefit of the system sum of benefits of water buyers and sellers on the other hand the value added of water in water purchasing industries is much higher than water selling farms see table 1 therefore the price equivalent to the economic value in the agriculture sector which imposes the lowest cost on buyers gives the highest total net benefit for the system fig 6 illustrates the net benefit variations for each agent after water exchange in this figure the net benefit for all agents has increased compared to the mode without water market proving the economic effectiveness of the water market mechanism for the farm agents two factors namely crop sales and irrigation water sales lead to an increase in net benefits other market participating agents increase their net benefits due to increased production the average increase in the net benefit for the dairy cattle farm broiler chicken farm stone cutting and brick factory agents is 19 20 50 and 49 respectively these results indicate that the market based water allocation mechanism significantly raises the system s net benefit by reallocating water to the higher value added consumption finally fig 7 summarizes the results of water exchanges and monetary payments between the water buyer and seller agents in this figure the physical and non physical exchange of water involves the water transfer through the tanker and shared aquifer methods the results clearly demonstrate the economic efficiency of the inter sectoral water market mechanism under water scarcity conditions 4 3 socio hydrological concerns one of the most important social concerns with regard to the inter sectoral water market s formation is the reduction of the agricultural activities scope by providing the possibility of water transfer from the agriculture sector to profitable industrial uses 38 so that skilled farmers may face problems such as unemployment and eventually migration 3 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effects of such exchanges on the employment rate there are also some hydrological concerns with respect to the inter sectoral groundwater market some agents especially farms may increase the groundwater withdrawal volume from the aquifer to increase their water sales benefits 31 on the other hand with the selling of irrigation water to the industry sector the return flows from farms to the aquifer are reduced 31 38 consequently groundwater hydrology analysis is inevitable table 3 provides the report on the assessment results of the socio hydrological concerns regarding the local groundwater market in the study area the employment amount is calculated based on the required labor force to produce each unit of products 23 and the production amount for each agent see table 2 as expected with the irrigation water sales to the industry sector and the increase in the fallow area the employment amount in the farms decreased from 27 500 person year in the mode without water market to 27 200 person year in the water market mode but this employment rate reduction is not so worrying because it is only 1 the main reason for the slight decrease in the farms employment rate is the limited volume of inter sectoral water exchanges in contrast in the agriculture industry agents livestock and poultry farms the employment rate increases by 20 from 390 person year in the mode without water market to 470 person year in the water market mode these changes are insignificant for greenhouse agents the employment amount for building industry agents reaches from 262 000 person year to 393 000 person year in general inter sectoral water exchanges lead to positive changes 45 increase in the region s employment rate the sold water volume of farms has been limited to the groundwater permits see equation 10 on the other hand the participating agents in the water market do not have to extract the total of their water permits nevertheless since groundwater extraction is done to produce profitable agricultural and industrial products this study assumes that the market participants use their own all of the available water volumes see equations 7 and 8 thus after water exchange the groundwater withdrawal volume for market participants does not change and is limited to permits this result indicates that by controlling the agents extraction within the limitations of the groundwater permits the market based water allocation approach can mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector furthermore hydrological calculations demonstrate that the industry sector s return flows to the aquifer increases by 16 300 m3 where the available water volume for the industrial agents has increased through the purchase of irrigation water in contrast this water sales flow significantly reduces the return flow from farms to the aquifer as a result the aquifer s recharge flows are reduced by 70 700 m3 finally the groundwater hydrology analysis reveals that the studied aquifer s storage volume is decreased by 70 700 m3 this is because after the inter sectoral water exchanges discharge flows remain constant and recharge flows decrease by 70 700 m3 therefore to avoid the adverse effects of reducing return flows it seems that implementation of regulatory policies such as capping groundwater permits 2 13 can be useful 5 conclusion this paper presents an inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep approach to promote groundwater use productivity under water scarcity conditions in a real case study the iwep model considers different agricultural and industrial water market participants where the groundwater resources are reallocated to higher value added consumption under techno economic simulations the proposed groundwater trading model determines the optimal production amount of agricultural and industrial products and the monthly volume of water exchanges through different technical methods of water transfer results confirm the findings of other studies 20 28 45 about the positive economic impacts of water market mechanisms in different regions of the world in general this paper concludes that considering the economic value of water in the allocation of groundwater resources through market mechanisms will lead to water use management especially in the water scarcity conditions this conclusion confirms the claim of other studies 38 47 on the shift from supply driven approaches to water demand management policies in the face of frequent droughts and consequently increasing the value of water resources the iwep model simulates the technical instruments of water market exchanges the groundwater exchanges techno economic analysis proposes the shared aquifer method as a suitable technical instrument for the local groundwater trading results show that the shared aquifer method in terms of economic and social benefits can positively impact the target area and at the same time increase water use productivity therefore the shared aquifer method which is based on the common pool groundwater resources can be considered a suitable technical method for water transfer in other groundwater markets however due to the difficulty of monitoring such non physical water exchanges 3 enhancing social controls by ngos is of the essence the iwep model simulates the water exchange price based on the discretization of price points within the pricing range the results reveal that the optimal market price is the minimum possible price for water exchange so that the farms as the only water sellers earn much less benefit than water purchasing industries low exchange price may even negatively affect farms willingness to participate in the water market therefore it is suggested that the total net benefit derived from water trading policy is fairly redistributed among market participants using cooperative game techniques in this regard the readers are referred to previous studies such as 12 33 45 the proposed iwep model prevents the adverse effects of inter sectoral water exchanges by imposing real constraints on production amount and the prohibition of groundwater overexploitation the results reveal that a local groundwater market is an efficient tool in tackling water scarcity conditions if top down policies and bottom up utilities are appropriately considered this paper emphasizes that the irrigation water sales to the industry sector on a local scale can positively change the employment rate however it is necessary to direct water selling farmers to alternative jobs in the industry sector and provide them with job security the groundwater hydrology analysis also reveals that although the inter sectoral groundwater market reduces the aquifer s return flows it can mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector given the capabilities of the proposed iwep model at the local scale and techno economic aspects of groundwater exchanges it is recommended that such a general water market model is applied to other parts of the world to improve groundwater use productivity credit

constructive comments that led to significant changes and improvements of this paper appendix a positive mathematical programming pmp model this study employs a positive mathematical programming pmp model to simulate the decisions and possible responses of farm agents by applying with and without water market policies pmp models attempt to reproduce the observed reality as it is indeed these models aim to reproduce the current crop patterns by using a non linear objective function i e a non linear equation for production function and or cost function and a set of calibration constraints 9 18 44 in general development of a pmp model has the three following steps 1 developing a base linear programming lp model to maximize the net benefit as the objective function with calibration constraints and resource constraints to estimate the shadow prices of crops 2 estimating the coefficients of the non linear objective function using the shadow prices of the lp model and the information of the current cropping pattern and 3 developing a quadratic or non linear programming nlp model by putting the estimated cost function coefficients in the objective function of the final nlp model without the calibration constraints more detailed information about the pmp models and the methodology of developing such models can be found in refs 18 39 most pmp models in previous research have a non linear cost or yield function however following recent studies 20 35 this study simultaneously uses a non linear cost function and a non linear production function in its proposed pmp model in the following these non linear functions are described a 1 production function the non linear production function used in the pmp model is the constant elasticity of substitution ces consisting of three inputs of water land and capital 35 this function expresses the effects of mentioned inputs on farm crops in the study area and equation 24 formulates it 24 y c i c n c i q 1 q β c q i i d c q i 0 0001 s u b 1 s u b s u b s u b 1 i 1 f c where the variable y indicates the yield function production function the variable id and parameter sub are the input demand and the elasticity of substitution of inputs respectively there are insufficient data in the study area to estimate the elasticity of substitution therefore following previous studies 27 36 a value of 0 27 has been assumed for the parameter sub to set the limited substitution between the inputs this limited substitution between inputs is consistent with observed practices where farmers can substitute among inputs over a limited range to achieve the same production level furthermore the parameters cn and β denote the scale parameter and the distribution of input demand the subscripts c and i are the indices of farm crops and farm agents where the number of all farms is f the subscript q is also the index of each input i e water land and capital equation 25 calculates the scale parameter moreover

this parameter reflects the dual value of the calibration constraint equation 35 since the calibration constraint is applied only to land input in the proposed pmp model the value of the parameter λ 1 for water and capital inputs is zero 20 moreover the parameter λ 2 is the dual value of the resource constraint equation 35 the parameter c in shows the cost per unit of inputs in this regard the price of land includes the cost of renting each hectare of land that the farmer must pay to the landowner 23 the cost of water includes the expenses that each farmer pays for each cubic meter of water delivered to a specific crop this cost can consist of irrigation labor or costs associated with irrigation systems at farms 23 note that the cost of water is different from the market price of water wp in equation 6 finally the cost of capital input includes the required capital excluding the cost of water use and land rent for each crop from planting to harvest this capital consists of the cost of purchasing seeds pesticides and fertilizers the cost of machinery and the cost of required labor for crops 23 this study following previous studies 19 20 34 uses 25 of the shadow price of land

8664,this study aims to analyze the effects of local water market formation in a limited region of the gavkhuni basin located in the center of iran an economic optimization mathematical model called inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep is developed to address the study objectives the proposed model seeks to maximize the net benefit of participating agents in the water market mechanism this model can determine the scope of production activities and the monthly volume of water exchange through different technical methods of water transfer results demonstrate that the agriculture sector contributes to an increase in the productions of the agriculture industries and building industries through selling its surplus water although farm agents sell only 1 of their groundwater permits to industrial agents the total net benefit of the agents is increased by more than 30 compared to when the water market is not implemented the shared aquifer method based on common pool groundwater resources is identified as a suitable technical method for water transfer in the groundwater markets finally the socio hydrological analysis of groundwater exchanges reveals that the inter sectoral water market at the local scale can increase the region s employment rate by 45 and mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector these results clarify the efficient role of market based groundwater allocation approach under water scarcity conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords water economics water trading optimization technical instruments inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep 1 introduction rising demand as well as limited and falling water supply have led to an imbalance between water resources and consumption in many river basins of the world 6 17 part of this imbalance is due to the uneconomical uses of water resources for example different consumers have little incentives to efficiently use water resources due to low water tariffs 37 on the other hand the impossibility of increasing the supply leads to a relative water scarcity that increases the value of the water resources 42 consequently a shift has occurred from supply driven policies to water demand management and conservation 47 water market is one of the various tools to implement water demand management policies 7 water market is an institution where water is exchanged based on its economic value between buyers and sellers the trading pattern is such a way that water is allocated to the sectors generating higher benefits 11 accordingly this economic tool provides further access to more efficient water allocation water market modelling is one of the important research fields in recent years for instance analyzing factors affecting water exchanges in an active water market has been achieved using econometric models 15 25 the water market has also been modeled by economic optimization models in which the water exchange processes among various agents have been set to maximize the net benefits and optimize the crop pattern and the consumed water volume 30 41 45 some studies 20 29 combine an economic optimization model with a hydrological balance model this integration of the economic hydrological model leads to a more realistic economic analysis of water trading finally another type of water market modelling approach is to simulate the behaviors of participating agents in the water market mechanism using agent based models 1 2 50 these models determine how one agent interacts with other agents in the water market mechanism by defining a set of behavioral rules for each agent the water market modelling literature mostly examines economic effects 20 30 other aspects have also been studied such as social effects 2 25 equity 1 45 effects on third parties such as the environment and other water rights owners 21 22 and hydrological impacts 1 28 however economic analysis of the impacts of water transfer technical methods on market performance has been received less attention on the other hand almost all water laws have an order of priority for the use of water with the agriculture sector holding the least priority in this regard the domestic sector and sometimes the industry sector would have preferences over the agriculture sector 8 therefore the inter sectoral water market is not usual and previous studies mostly include water exchange modelling among farms 1 45 nonetheless in some cases due to water scarcity conditions and the need to improve water use productivity water trading between farms and the industry sector is generally modeled on an annual time scale 30 49 only the benefits of the industry sector have been analyzed and changes in the production amount of industrial products for which water is a main production input have not been estimated this paper s new contribution to the literature is to consider different agricultural and industrial water market participants the proposed groundwater trading model not only calculates the net benefit of each market participant but also determines the production amount of different products another contribution of the paper is providing the link between the economic and technical aspects of groundwater exchanges so that in the economic analysis of the water market the proposed model detects the most suitable technical methods of water transfer among agents which imposes the minimum transfer costs on the system this paper presents two physical and non physical methods of water transfer in the market mechanism the physical transfer of water is usually by tanker or pipeline 50 however previous studies have less addressed the non physical transfer of groundwater therefore this paper introduces an efficient technical method for non physical exchanges in local water markets which is based on common pool groundwater resources 32 the volumes of water supply and demand for each industrial and agricultural water participant in the water market change monthly according to the monthly water demands of its products therefore another advantage of this research is the planning of groundwater exchanges on a monthly time scale there are also some socio hydrological concerns regarding the inter sectoral groundwater market such as adverse effects on the scope of agricultural activities 38 49 the reduction of return flows to the aquifer and groundwater overexploitation 1 7 31 thus the socio hydrological analysis of such exchanges is necessary this paper s objectives are pursued through the development of an inter sectoral water exchange programming iwep analysis and its application in a real case study located in iran 2 study area in this paper isfahan borkhar plain located in the gavkhuni basin is selected as a case study the average drawdown of the groundwater table in this plain was 0 76 m per year for the 2008 to 2014 period 24 thus iran s ministry of energy has declared the isfahan borkhar plain as a critical plain the volume of surface water resources is also extremely limited 48 given the shortage of groundwater resources in the region supporting the water demand management policies such as the formation of a groundwater market may help meet current water demands especially in the industry sector without putting further pressure on the aquifer and change the water allocation to consumers with higher productivity in the study area several agricultural and industrial agents are usually scattered throughout the region therefore to simplify the modelling process and analyze the implementation effects of the water market mechanism these agents should be classified into homogeneous units for this purpose any type of agent farm greenhouse etc that are spatially close to each other are considered as a unit in this regard the authors have identified and classified similar agents which were close to each other based on geographical maps and their field visits then they used gps device to determine the proper geographical location of the center of these categories which indicates the location of each water market participant in the model this classification has led to 25 participating agents in the inter sectoral water market mechanism and fig 1 presents their geographical locations the required data for the modelling process have been collected through documentary research 23 24 48 survey research and selected expert knowledge table 1 reports the economic data for the farming year 2015 2016 the data includes the price yield production cost and economic value of water for different agricultural and industrial products according to table 1 the economic value of water for each product is calculated as the net benefit divided by the water demand where the net benefit includes the difference between benefits and costs for farm and greenhouse agents the total water demand is considered to calculate the economic value of water the total water demand is obtained as the net water demand divided by the irrigation efficiency 1 1 for instance for wheat the net benefit is equal to 0 36 4700 870 822 us ha the total water demand is 5284 0 45 11 743 m3 as a result the economic value of water is calculated as equal to 822 11 743 0 07 us m3 3 methodology this section presents the structure of the proposed methodology including the conceptual and the computational models for water trading among participating agents in the inter sectoral groundwater market 3 1 conceptual model fig 2 illustrates the conceptual model for the inter sectoral water market of the isfahan borkhar plain the participating agents in this market include farms agriculture industries greenhouse dairy cattle farm and broiler chicken farm and building industries stone cutting and brick factory each agent can be a water buyer and or water seller government control on water market performance can have benefits such as reducing conflicts 38 adverse external effects 31 and environmental damage 7 38 therefore it is necessary to consider a set of control policies by the government through a top down process and inform the participating agents in the water market of such policies these policies include groundwater withdrawal limitations and production limitations in the industry sector under market demand these policies allow the water exchange volume to be determined rationally and prevent the adverse external effects of water exchange such as a decrease in the production amount and the employment rate in the water seller sector moreover each agent participates in the water market only if its initial net benefit is preserved and its further water demand is considered these issues are considered as bottom up utilities for each agent separately after considering the government s goals and the agents utilities the water exchange processes take place directly between buyers and sellers in the processes each water seller agent can trade with several buyers simultaneously the conceptual model is based on the fact that water is a main production input for various agricultural and industrial products therefore if an agent purchases water it will use water as the main input to increase its initial production on the other hand water sales for one agent leads to a reduction in production amount due to a decrease in the available water volume the total net benefit is determined so that the sum of all agents net benefits is maximized note that participation in the water market is voluntary and at least the initial net benefit of each agent must be maintained each agent obtains the follow up net benefit based on net benefits of product sales and water trading the net benefit of product sales for each agent is calculated based on its available water volume which is influenced by the monthly results of the water exchanges the net benefit of water trading is obtained from the difference between water sales benefits and water trading costs finally with the formation of the water market the water seller agents may increase groundwater withdrawal due to the benefits of water sales with the possibility of water transfer from the agriculture sector to the industry sector the return flows to the aquifer will naturally decrease therefore the inter sectoral water market can have adverse effects on the discharge and recharge flows of the aquifer thus the groundwater hydrology analysis to estimate the aquifer s storage volume is essential 3 2 computational model the computational model presents the formulations of the general water trading model derived from the conceptual model the proposed model is a positive mathematical programming pmp model 9 18 this positive model aims to simulate the farm agents behaviors under water trading policy through a calibration process based on the observed reality more details about the proposed pmp model can be found in the appendix section in the following part the objective function and the constraints of the general optimization model are described 3 2 1 objective function the objective function of the general water trading model as expressed in equation 1 presents the total net benefit of participating agents in the water market with regard to constraints and real policies in the region equation 2 calculates the net benefit of each agent based on the economic benefits from product sales and water trading 1 max z i n b i i 1 n 2 n b i n b i p s n b i w t i 1 n the variables nb nb ps and nb wt show the total net benefit net benefits of product sales and net benefits of water trading in us dollars z also represents the value of the objective function the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n product sales equations 3 and 4 calculate the net benefits of crop sales nb ps for farm and greenhouse agents respectively 3 n b i p s c s p c i y c i p c c i i 1 f 4 n b i p s c s p c i y c i a c c i x c i i f 1 l where the variable y is the yield function production function of farming crops kg also the variable pc represents the production cost function us for farm agents these non linear functions are calculated based on three inputs of water land and capital see appendix section 2 2 these non linear functions will be also applicable to greenhouse agents if the adequate and accurate information about the required inputs related costs and the elasticity of substitution of these inputs is provided the parameter sp is the sales price of the crop us kg for farm and greenhouse agents furthermore the decision variable x represents the cultivation area of the greenhouse crop ha the parameters y and ac are the yield of the crop kg ha and the average cost for crop production us ha in greenhouse agents the values of these parameters for each crop are listed in table 1 the yield parameter values for each greenhouse crop are constant thus water exchange which changes the available water volume for greenhouse agents directly affects the decision variable of the cultivation area the subscripts c and i are the indices for crops and farm and greenhouse agents respectively the total number of farm and greenhouse agents is l moreover f shows the total number of farm agents equation 5 encompasses the net benefits of product sales nb ps for the rest of participating agents in the water market these agents include the dairy cattle farm broiler chicken farm stone cutting and brick factory 5 n b i p s u i y i i n d s p i i n d a c i i n d i l 1 n the decision variable u shows the production amount for each agent for the dairy cattle farm and broiler chicken farm agents this variable indicates the number of bred animals 3 3 the number of animals raised in a livestock and poultry farm is an integer that corresponds to the real world nevertheless in this study the number of animals is significantly great and using integer programming increases model solving complexity therefore the number of animals included in the model is considered as continuous variables then after running the model the number of cattle and chickens is reported as an integer the parameters yind and spind show the yield and sales price for each industrial product furthermore the parameter acind is the average cost for production of the industrial product the values of these parameters for each agent are presented in table 1 the stone cutting and brick factory agents do not have the yield parameter the yield parameter value for each agent is considered a constant number that does not change during the water exchange process as a result water exchange directly affects the number of animals or the production amount of building industries the subscript i is the index of each agent as mentioned earlier the number of all agents and the total number of farm and greenhouse agents are n and l respectively therefore the total number of agents for equation 5 is n l water trading equation 6 represents the net benefit of water trading nb wt for each participating agent in the water market according to this equation the net benefit of each agent includes the difference between water sales benefits and water trading costs water trading costs include water purchase cost water transfer cost by different technical methods and transaction costs 6 n b i w t w p 1 0 5 ψ m s w m i t 1 0 5 ψ m b w m i t m j k t c j i k s w m j i k i 1 n where the decision variables sw t and bw t denote the monthly volume of sold and bought water for each agent m3 respectively the tc and ψ represent the water transfer cost and the transaction cost coefficient moreover the wp is the optimal price of water exchange us m3 note that the proposed methodology for determining the water exchange price is presented in detail in section 3 4 the subscripts i and j are the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n furthermore the subscripts m and k indicates the month and technical method of water transfer the coefficient of transaction cost is equal to 0 1 45 the transaction costs are shared equally between the water buyer and the seller agents 1 45 the coefficient of 0 5 is also considered in equation 6 for the same reason two technical methods of water transfer are considered including tanker and shared aquifer the water transfer cost by tanker depends on the transferred water volume and the distance between the buyer and the seller which is 0 05 us m3 km in the model 3 50 in the shared aquifer method using the common pool groundwater resources concept 32 the water buyer agent withdraws the equivalent purchased groundwater volume from its well on the other hand the water seller agent does not withdraw from its own well to sell water therefore only the groundwater permit is exchanged between the buyer and the seller and no physical transfer of water occurs the water transfer cost by the shared aquifer method includes the monitoring cost of water exchanges 3 the cost of this method is related to the administrative affairs of the local water market it is a type of transaction costs independent of the pumping costs and equivalent to 0 1 us m3 for each agent 3 2 2 constraints bottom up utilities under equation 7 the consumed water volume should be equal to the groundwater permit volume and the bought water volume minus the sold water volume this constraint supplies the required water for each farm and greenhouse agent this bottom up utility is similarly developed for other agents in equation 8 7 c w d c m i e i x c i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i 1 l m 8 w d m i i n d u i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i l 1 n m in these equations the parameters wd and wd ind respectively show the water demand for farm and greenhouse crops and industrial products the values of which are presented in table 1 the decision variable x represents the cultivation area of the farm and greenhouse crops ha note that the variable x c i for farm agents is exactly the same as the variable id c q land i used in the proposed pmp model formulations the variable id c q land i shows the land input cultivation area for each crop and farm see appendix section moreover the parameter gp denotes the groundwater permit volume m3 where none of the agents in groundwater extraction from the aquifer is superior to other agents groundwater permit is determined based on the water demand and the current production amount of each agent the irrigation efficiency ie is equal to 0 45 and 0 9 for each farm and greenhouse agent respectively 23 subscripts and other decision variables are defined in the previous equations finally to motivate participation in the water market the limitation on preserving the initial net benefit for each agent is considered in equation 9 9 n b i n b i i n i t i a l i 1 n where the variables nb and nb initial represent net benefit and initial net benefit in us dollars respectively as before the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n top down policies equation 10 states that the sold water volume should be below the groundwater permit to prevent excessive groundwater withdrawal 10 s w m i t g p m i i 1 n m the decision variable sw t and the parameter gp denote the monthly volume of sold water m3 and groundwater permit volume m3 for each agent respectively as before the subscript i is the index of each agent where the number of all agents is n in addition the subscript m indicates the month the cultivation area limitations for farm and greenhouse agents are included in the model according to equation 11 equation 12 reflects the minimum and maximum limitations on each crop s production amount for greenhouse agents note that the proposed pmp model can determine how to distribute the cultivation area for different crops of each farm agent furthermore equation 13 seeks to meet market demand for industrial products 11 x i min c x c i x i max i 1 l 12 x c min i x c i x c max c 13 u i min u i u i max i l 1 n in these equations the decision variable x shows the cultivation area of the crop ha for farm and greenhouse agents as mentioned earlier the variable x c i for farm agents is exactly the same as the variable id c q land i used in the proposed pmp model formulations see appendix section the decision variable u also represents the production amount for other type of agents the subscripts i and c are the indices for agents and greenhouse crops respectively the number of all agents and the total number of farm and greenhouse agents are n and l respectively the minimum cultivation area x min for each farm and greenhouse agent is equivalent to a reduction of 50 of the current cultivation area and maintaining the current cultivation area respectively the maximum cultivation area x max is also the total current cultivation area together with the fallow area finally the upper bound for the production amount of the agriculture industries and building industries products are a 20 and a 50 increment compared to the current production amount respectively the lower bound is also the maintenance of the current production amount water balance in the market equation 14 reflects that the monthly volume of bought water with a technical method bw for each agent i is equal to the sum of the monthly volume of sold water with the same technical method sw from other agents of j to that agent i 14 j s w m j i k b w m i k j 1 n i 1 n m k where the subscripts m and k are the indices for the month and technical method of water transfer moreover n is the number of all agents equation 15 illustrates that the monthly volume of bought water for each agent bw t is equal to the sum of the monthly volume of bought water with different technical methods for each agent bw 15 k b w m i k b w m i t i 1 n m equation 16 presents the water balance in a month accordingly the total monthly volume of sold water by water seller agents equals the total monthly volume of bought water by water buyer agents 16 i b w m i t i s w m i t i 1 n m each agent in the inter sectoral water market mechanism is both seller and buyer so that each agent cannot buy and sell water within the same month equation 17 reflects this limitation 17 b w m i k s w m i s 0 i 1 n k s m where the decision variables sw and bw show the monthly volume of sold and bought water with a technical method for each agent in m3 respectively the subscripts m and i are the indices for month and agent where the number of all agents is n also the subscripts k and s indicates the technical method of water transfer which can differ in terms of selling or purchasing water therefore equation 17 is a non linear constraint finally equation 18 states that water sales from an agent to the same agent sw is not possible 18 s w m i i 0 i 1 n m groundwater hydrology a hydrological system such as an aquifer is in equilibrium when the volume of inflows recharge flows and outflows discharge flows are equal 5 in other words the variation of the aquifer s storage volume should be zero at any time the balance equation can be formulated in equation 19 48 19 δ v r f d f where the variables δv rf and df denote the storage volume changes recharge flows and discharge flows for the studied aquifer in m3 respectively the studied groundwater market is on a local scale and not all wells participate in this market therefore the aquifer s discharge flows are classified into two categories including participating wells and non participating wells in the water market equation 20 illustrates this classification equation 21 also calculates the volume of discharge flows by market participants where this category of discharge flows is affected by the water exchanges volume 20 d f d f n m d f m 21 d f m m i g p m i i 1 n the parameter gp is the groundwater permit volume m3 for each market participant the subscripts i and m are the indices of each agent and month where the number of all agents is n also the symbols m and nm represent the two categories of market participants and non market participants respectively the volume of discharge flows by non participating wells in the water market dfnm is constant equation 22 reflects the recharge flows inflows to the aquifer 48 equation 23 is also developed to calculate the volume of return flows to the aquifer from the participating agents in the water market 22 r f i s f g f r g n m r g m 23 r g m m i φ i g p m i b w m i t s w m i t i 1 n where the parameters i sf and gf are the infiltrated precipitation net surface water flows and net groundwater flows entering the aquifer in m3 respectively the value of these parameters is constant the decision variables bw t and sw t represent the monthly volume of bought and sold water in m3 for each agent furthermore rg represents the volume of returned groundwater flows from different consumption classified into the two categories of market participants rgm and non market participants rgnm the volume of return flows from non market participants does not change after water exchanges because the volume of discharge flows by these agents dfnm is constant the subscripts and other variables are already defined finally φ coefficient represents the percentage of consumed water that returns to the aquifer the values of this coefficient for farms agriculture industries and building industries are 0 4 0 05 and 0 1 respectively 24 as a result for the same volume of water consumption the volume of return flows from the agriculture sector is much higher than the industry sector 3 3 solving the computational model the mathematical model s algorithm known as inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep was written in the gams software platform to achieve the optimal solution the proposed model was solved using gams s conopt4 solver as a tool for solving non linear programming nlp problems the proposed groundwater allocation model was run in two modes in one mode the water market existed and the other one was without a water market there is no water exchange in the mode without water market so the decision variables of sold and bought water volume bw t and sw t variables in gams software are set equal to zero 3 4 determination of water exchange price the market price of water wp can be incorporated as a variable in the general water trading model see equation 6 in other words the water exchange price can be determined endogenously inside this market model this endogenous variable turns the iwep model into a non linear one there are several powerful solvers available for gams software that solve the non linear models however as is well known sometimes there are difficulties for solving non linear models and obtaining a global optimum through the solvers of gams software 16 these difficulties usually come from an inadequate definition of the model inadequate scaling of large models low starting points and an insufficient solver selection on the other hand if a global optimum is not obtained a local optimum can be obtained the special attention to the starting point and the model s limits is necessary to ensure that the local optimum obtained is the global optimum 16 there are not enough starting points to reasonably consider the local optimum as the global optimum in this study therefore to deal with the difficulties mentioned above this paper following the previous studies 27 36 proposes an iterative numerical approach to simulate the water market functioning and determine the water exchange price the proposed methodology parameterizes the water price where a variable turns into an external parameter 4 4 in addition to the proposed methodology in this study there are other alternatives in the literature that can yield similar outputs to inform readers some price endogenous approaches can be referred such as deriving the market price as the dual value of water availability limitations 10 43 46 forcing the market equilibrium price to be equal to the shadow price of water 14 26 45 simulating the market equilibrium price based on the obtained water demand curves and various quantities of water supply 4 40 and setting the market price equal to the marginal utility of water for all participants based on the special attention to the starting values for model solving and the validation of the results 16 all of these studies have used gams software to find the endogenous market price this method involves developing a water pricing range so that testing the different prices influences the model functioning to determine the optimal price of water exchange the lower and upper bounds of the water pricing range are selected to be equivalent to the marginal value of water in the farms and industry sectors respectively in other words the minimum sale price for farms and maximum purchase price for the industry is the value added of their water permits note that the marginal value of water is the shadow price of water when there is no market the proposed methodology introduces the pricing range as the search space to determine the optimal price of water exchange in order to be able to find the market price by solvers of gams software this study suggests that the continuous solution space i e the water pricing range be discretized this process should be such that the discretization steps are as small as possible and the continuity of the solution space is maintained in this regard the proposed methodology creates the water prices with a specific numerical distance from each other equivalent to 1 of the lower bound that cover the continuous space between the lower and upper bounds then the general water trading model is executed under discretized prices finally the price that brings the highest net benefit for the set of participating agents in the water market is identified as the optimal price of water exchange 4 results this section encompasses the results of solving the iwep model in three categories water exchanges volume economic analysis and socio hydrological concerns 4 1 water exchanges volume the volume of water supply and demand varies monthly in the inter sectoral water market mechanism because the participants in this type of water market in different months of the year have different water demands therefore it is necessary to evaluate groundwater trading on a monthly time scale fig 3 illustrates the monthly volume of exchanges in the water market mechanism the maximum volume of water exchanges occurs in august and september during these months the livestock and poultry farm agents as well as greenhouse crops have higher water demands additionally the water exchanges volume through the shared aquifer method is higher than the tanker in most months of the year in fact despite the limited capacity of the tanker in the region to transfer water the shared aquifer method has a significant capacity for groundwater exchanges which can be seen in fig 3 based on the monthly scale fig 4 provides the view of supplying the region s water demands as can be seen due to the water scarcity conditions groundwater permits cannot supply all of the region s water demands however the water market mechanism supports 10 of the remaining demands ultimately 11 of the total water demands are still not supplied the sum of water exchanges volume for all months of the year is equal to 217 368 m3 where the shared aquifer method forms more than half of the water transfers according to fig 4 most of the exchanges are performed non physically through the shared aquifer method as its cost is lower than the cost imposed by the tankers economic analysis of the local water market reveals that non physical groundwater transfer is more cost effective than the physical water transfer therefore the shared aquifer method can be a suitable method for water transfer in the groundwater markets the proposed model for inter sectoral groundwater trading is a general model in which each agricultural and industrial agent can be a water buyer and seller agent the execution results of this general model represent that only farm agents sell water and other agents do not sell water to each other in other words all agents are allowed to sell water still the industry sector s production limitations under market demand derived from top down policies in the region affect the water sales flow this is because the industrial agents must maintain their current production on the other hand the available water volume for these agents is limited therefore in order to maintain initial production they cannot be the water seller another finding is that there are no inter farms water exchanges running the model in the absence of the agriculture industry and building industry agents provides the same result the economic values of water are the same for farms thus hypothetically a significant difference is made in the economic value of water for each crop among different farms and the general model is executed the results of this sensitivity analysis illustrate that although water exchange occurs between farms most of the purchased water volume belongs to industrial agents with very high economic value of water consequently it can be concluded that water exchange between farms occurs if there is a difference among the economic values of their water resources so that these differences compensate for the transaction costs this finding is consistent with the results of other studies 1 21 on the theory of water market formation i e the differences in the economic value of water between water buyer and seller agents the economic value of water in the industry sector is high thus the industrial agents purchase water from farms to increase their production fig 5 presents the purchased water volume by these agents due to water demands and production constraints the purchased water volume for broiler chicken farms are much less than other industrial agents the greenhouse and broiler chicken farm agents buy water only through the tanker because water purchase through tanker is more cost effective due to their relatively short geographical distance from the water supplying farms furthermore the dairy cattle farm stone cutting and brick factory agents purchase water mostly through the shared aquifer method according to figs 5 and 93 66 and 95 of purchased water volume in the dairy cattle farm stone cutting and brick factory agents are carried out through the shared aquifer method respectively and tankers transfer the rest additionally the total sold water volume by farms equivalent to the sum of purchased water for all agents is approximately 1 of farms groundwater withdrawal permits in other words farms generally sell only 1 of their groundwater permits to the water purchasing agents through the market mechanism the model does not directly consider a limitation on the water sales volume thus the low volume of water exchanges arises from applying the top down policies on the production amount of various industrial products the inclusion of these restrictive policies makes the rational exchange process and to some extent fair without the direct involvement of the government 4 2 economic analysis table 2 demonstrates the results of the production amount for each agent since the proposed model is a pmp model in the without water market mode the cultivation area of crops should be exactly equal to their current cultivation area at the different farms simulating the farm agents behaviors under non market mode shows that the difference between the cultivated area of farm crops and their current cultivated area at different farms is less than 0 1 following 20 a less than 1 deviation in the crop pattern results is permissible given the small perturbations in the calibration constraints therefore the calibration process of the proposed pmp model has been performed with appropriate accuracy and the parameters of non linear functions have been estimated in such a way as to reproduce the current cropping pattern accurately thus the policy analysis s results of the proposed pmp model can be trusted due to the irrigation water sales the cultivation area for most farm crops decreases compared to the without water market mode only the cultivation area of melon with the highest economic value remains constant moreover barley with the lowest economic value undergone the greatest reduction in cultivation area as a result the fallow area increases by 19 ha after the water exchange the cultivation area for greenhouse crops including tomato and bell pepper remains constant however the cultivation area for cucumber increases by 20 these results indicate that greenhouse agents compensate for the water limitation and increase the production of crops with higher economic value through purchasing water within the market mechanism the production amount of industrial agents has decreased due to water scarcity conditions so that these agents tend to purchase irrigation water to compensate for the water limitation on the other hand the iwep model can determine the production amount of industrial products as a decision variable the exchanged water is the main input for the production of these industrial products the results reported in table 2 show an increase in the production amount of the agriculture industry and building industry agents in the water market mode compared to the mode without water market each agent produces as much as its capacity by purchasing water through the market mechanism the increased production rates per dairy cattle farm or broiler chicken farm and building industry agents are 20 and 50 respectively according to the proposed methodology of the present study in order to determine the market price of water see section 3 4 the lower and upper bounds of the water pricing range are 0 17 and 30 us m3 respectively the discretization process of the solution space leads to the creation of about 18 000 price points within the pricing range therefore in order to find the water exchange price the iwep model has been consecutively executed at 18 000 price points and the corresponding net benefit of the system has been saved the results reveal that the optimal price of water exchange is equal to the lower bound of the pricing range 0 17 us m3 in other words the proposed methodology has been detects the market price equal to the minimum price that can be considered for water input in the region the reason for choosing the lowest possible price for water exchange by the iwep model is that the objective function of the model see equation 1 includes maximizing the total net benefit of the system sum of benefits of water buyers and sellers on the other hand the value added of water in water purchasing industries is much higher than water selling farms see table 1 therefore the price equivalent to the economic value in the agriculture sector which imposes the lowest cost on buyers gives the highest total net benefit for the system fig 6 illustrates the net benefit variations for each agent after water exchange in this figure the net benefit for all agents has increased compared to the mode without water market proving the economic effectiveness of the water market mechanism for the farm agents two factors namely crop sales and irrigation water sales lead to an increase in net benefits other market participating agents increase their net benefits due to increased production the average increase in the net benefit for the dairy cattle farm broiler chicken farm stone cutting and brick factory agents is 19 20 50 and 49 respectively these results indicate that the market based water allocation mechanism significantly raises the system s net benefit by reallocating water to the higher value added consumption finally fig 7 summarizes the results of water exchanges and monetary payments between the water buyer and seller agents in this figure the physical and non physical exchange of water involves the water transfer through the tanker and shared aquifer methods the results clearly demonstrate the economic efficiency of the inter sectoral water market mechanism under water scarcity conditions 4 3 socio hydrological concerns one of the most important social concerns with regard to the inter sectoral water market s formation is the reduction of the agricultural activities scope by providing the possibility of water transfer from the agriculture sector to profitable industrial uses 38 so that skilled farmers may face problems such as unemployment and eventually migration 3 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effects of such exchanges on the employment rate there are also some hydrological concerns with respect to the inter sectoral groundwater market some agents especially farms may increase the groundwater withdrawal volume from the aquifer to increase their water sales benefits 31 on the other hand with the selling of irrigation water to the industry sector the return flows from farms to the aquifer are reduced 31 38 consequently groundwater hydrology analysis is inevitable table 3 provides the report on the assessment results of the socio hydrological concerns regarding the local groundwater market in the study area the employment amount is calculated based on the required labor force to produce each unit of products 23 and the production amount for each agent see table 2 as expected with the irrigation water sales to the industry sector and the increase in the fallow area the employment amount in the farms decreased from 27 500 person year in the mode without water market to 27 200 person year in the water market mode but this employment rate reduction is not so worrying because it is only 1 the main reason for the slight decrease in the farms employment rate is the limited volume of inter sectoral water exchanges in contrast in the agriculture industry agents livestock and poultry farms the employment rate increases by 20 from 390 person year in the mode without water market to 470 person year in the water market mode these changes are insignificant for greenhouse agents the employment amount for building industry agents reaches from 262 000 person year to 393 000 person year in general inter sectoral water exchanges lead to positive changes 45 increase in the region s employment rate the sold water volume of farms has been limited to the groundwater permits see equation 10 on the other hand the participating agents in the water market do not have to extract the total of their water permits nevertheless since groundwater extraction is done to produce profitable agricultural and industrial products this study assumes that the market participants use their own all of the available water volumes see equations 7 and 8 thus after water exchange the groundwater withdrawal volume for market participants does not change and is limited to permits this result indicates that by controlling the agents extraction within the limitations of the groundwater permits the market based water allocation approach can mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector furthermore hydrological calculations demonstrate that the industry sector s return flows to the aquifer increases by 16 300 m3 where the available water volume for the industrial agents has increased through the purchase of irrigation water in contrast this water sales flow significantly reduces the return flow from farms to the aquifer as a result the aquifer s recharge flows are reduced by 70 700 m3 finally the groundwater hydrology analysis reveals that the studied aquifer s storage volume is decreased by 70 700 m3 this is because after the inter sectoral water exchanges discharge flows remain constant and recharge flows decrease by 70 700 m3 therefore to avoid the adverse effects of reducing return flows it seems that implementation of regulatory policies such as capping groundwater permits 2 13 can be useful 5 conclusion this paper presents an inter sectoral water exchanges programming iwep approach to promote groundwater use productivity under water scarcity conditions in a real case study the iwep model considers different agricultural and industrial water market participants where the groundwater resources are reallocated to higher value added consumption under techno economic simulations the proposed groundwater trading model determines the optimal production amount of agricultural and industrial products and the monthly volume of water exchanges through different technical methods of water transfer results confirm the findings of other studies 20 28 45 about the positive economic impacts of water market mechanisms in different regions of the world in general this paper concludes that considering the economic value of water in the allocation of groundwater resources through market mechanisms will lead to water use management especially in the water scarcity conditions this conclusion confirms the claim of other studies 38 47 on the shift from supply driven approaches to water demand management policies in the face of frequent droughts and consequently increasing the value of water resources the iwep model simulates the technical instruments of water market exchanges the groundwater exchanges techno economic analysis proposes the shared aquifer method as a suitable technical instrument for the local groundwater trading results show that the shared aquifer method in terms of economic and social benefits can positively impact the target area and at the same time increase water use productivity therefore the shared aquifer method which is based on the common pool groundwater resources can be considered a suitable technical method for water transfer in other groundwater markets however due to the difficulty of monitoring such non physical water exchanges 3 enhancing social controls by ngos is of the essence the iwep model simulates the water exchange price based on the discretization of price points within the pricing range the results reveal that the optimal market price is the minimum possible price for water exchange so that the farms as the only water sellers earn much less benefit than water purchasing industries low exchange price may even negatively affect farms willingness to participate in the water market therefore it is suggested that the total net benefit derived from water trading policy is fairly redistributed among market participants using cooperative game techniques in this regard the readers are referred to previous studies such as 12 33 45 the proposed iwep model prevents the adverse effects of inter sectoral water exchanges by imposing real constraints on production amount and the prohibition of groundwater overexploitation the results reveal that a local groundwater market is an efficient tool in tackling water scarcity conditions if top down policies and bottom up utilities are appropriately considered this paper emphasizes that the irrigation water sales to the industry sector on a local scale can positively change the employment rate however it is necessary to direct water selling farmers to alternative jobs in the industry sector and provide them with job security the groundwater hydrology analysis also reveals that although the inter sectoral groundwater market reduces the aquifer s return flows it can mitigate more pressure on the aquifer to meet water demands in the industry sector given the capabilities of the proposed iwep model at the local scale and techno economic aspects of groundwater exchanges it is recommended that such a general water market model is applied to other parts of the world to improve groundwater use productivity credit

constructive comments that led to significant changes and improvements of this paper appendix a positive mathematical programming pmp model this study employs a positive mathematical programming pmp model to simulate the decisions and possible responses of farm agents by applying with and without water market policies pmp models attempt to reproduce the observed reality as it is indeed these models aim to reproduce the current crop patterns by using a non linear objective function i e a non linear equation for production function and or cost function and a set of calibration constraints 9 18 44 in general development of a pmp model has the three following steps 1 developing a base linear programming lp model to maximize the net benefit as the objective function with calibration constraints and resource constraints to estimate the shadow prices of crops 2 estimating the coefficients of the non linear objective function using the shadow prices of the lp model and the information of the current cropping pattern and 3 developing a quadratic or non linear programming nlp model by putting the estimated cost function coefficients in the objective function of the final nlp model without the calibration constraints more detailed information about the pmp models and the methodology of developing such models can be found in refs 18 39 most pmp models in previous research have a non linear cost or yield function however following recent studies 20 35 this study simultaneously uses a non linear cost function and a non linear production function in its proposed pmp model in the following these non linear functions are described a 1 production function the non linear production function used in the pmp model is the constant elasticity of substitution ces consisting of three inputs of water land and capital 35 this function expresses the effects of mentioned inputs on farm crops in the study area and equation 24 formulates it 24 y c i c n c i q 1 q β c q i i d c q i 0 0001 s u b 1 s u b s u b s u b 1 i 1 f c where the variable y indicates the yield function production function the variable id and parameter sub are the input demand and the elasticity of substitution of inputs respectively there are insufficient data in the study area to estimate the elasticity of substitution therefore following previous studies 27 36 a value of 0 27 has been assumed for the parameter sub to set the limited substitution between the inputs this limited substitution between inputs is consistent with observed practices where farmers can substitute among inputs over a limited range to achieve the same production level furthermore the parameters cn and β denote the scale parameter and the distribution of input demand the subscripts c and i are the indices of farm crops and farm agents where the number of all farms is f the subscript q is also the index of each input i e water land and capital equation 25 calculates the scale parameter moreover equations 26 28 obtain the distribution parameter for three inputs of land water and capital respectively 25 c n c i y c i i n i t i a l i a c l a n d i q 1 q β c q i i a c q i 0 0001 s u b 1 s u b s

each farm crop are listed in table 1 the parameter ia also denote the current input amount other parameters and subscripts are already defined under equation 24 moreover the parameter cs is the opportunity cost of input obtained from equation 29 35 29 c s c q i c c q i i n λ c q i 1 λ q i 2 i 1 f q c where the parameter λ 1 represents the dual value shadow price of the consumed input in fact this parameter reflects the dual value of the calibration constraint equation 35 since the calibration constraint is applied only to land input in the proposed pmp model the value of the parameter λ 1 for water and capital inputs is zero 20 moreover the parameter λ 2 is the dual value of the resource constraint equation 35 the parameter c in shows the cost per unit of inputs in this regard the price of land includes the cost of renting each hectare of land that the farmer must pay to the landowner 23 the cost of water includes the expenses that each farmer pays for each cubic meter of water delivered to a specific crop this cost can consist of irrigation labor or costs associated with irrigation systems at farms 23 note that the cost of water is different from the market price of water wp in equation 6 finally the cost of capital input includes the required capital excluding the cost of water use and land rent for each crop from planting to harvest this capital consists of the cost of purchasing seeds pesticides and fertilizers the cost of machinery and the cost of required labor for crops 23 this study following previous studies 19 20 34 uses 25 of the shadow price of land resource resource m land i 4 as a proxy for adjustment of the dual value of the calibration and resource constraint equations in this way equations 30 and 31 based on the adjustment term resource m land i 4 calculate the dual values of calibration and resource constraints for the land input respectively 30 λ c l a n d i 1 c a l i b m c i re s o u r c e m l a n d i 4 i 1 f c 31 λ l a n d i 2 re s

obtain the cost intercept and cost slope parameters in these equations the subscripts and parameters are already defined 34 α c q i c c q i i n λ c q i 1 i 1 f c q 35 γ c q i 2 λ c q i 1 i a c q i i 1
