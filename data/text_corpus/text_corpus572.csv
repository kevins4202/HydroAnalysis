2860,flood is the most common worldwide natural disaster with enormous impacts on human society and the ecosystem consequently the research of flood risk assessment and zonation is critical its research scope is changeable wherein the basin scale research has become more and more important due to the increasing boom of cascade hydropower development in the river basin the study proposed a basin wide integrated flood risk assessment method combining index based evaluation analytical hierarchy process ahp and geographic information system gis technologies which was implemented in the dadu river basin southwestern china to assess and zoning the basin flood risk in the constructed risk assessment index system we use extreme rainfall and dam breach to jointly describe the basin flood disaster inducing factors and select flood control standard and flood routing coefficient as the sub indicators of basic and specific coping capacity to characterize the flood intervention capacity of hydropower engineering the results showed that for the hazard vulnerability and risk zonation maps with five classified levels the southern of midstream and downstream of the basin are prone to frequent floods while higher vulnerability levels mainly concentrate in the downstream but some parts scatter in the medium vulnerability zone the high and very high risk zones account for 3 of the basin area and mainly concentrate in the southern basin while 86 of the basin area is assigned as low and very low risk zones the results of this work quantitatively express the spatial distribution characteristics of basin wide flood hazard vulnerability and risk and provide a reference for practicing an integrated and efficient flood risk management and disaster prevention and alleviation strategies keywords flood disaster risk assessment index system gis dadu river basin 1 introduction floods as one of the most frequent challenging and devastating natural disasters worldwide has resulted in tremendous losses of human life socio economy and ecosystem over the past decades there has been growing awareness of the requirement for ongoing improvement in assessing and zoning flood risk to prevent flood disasters lin et al 2020 marchi et al 2010 the research scopes of flood disaster risk assessment are varied wherein the basin scale flood risk assessment has become increasingly important along with the booming of cascade hydropower development in the river basin due to the impact of climate change and intensified human activities the disaster inducing factors of basin flood are more complex and diverse such as extreme rainfall and dam breach comprehensively assess the basin flood risk is of great significance for improving the risk decision making ability of risk managers flood risk has been studied from a variety of perspectives by researchers with different scientific backgrounds and two different conceptual frameworks of risk assessment have been concluded the combination of hazard and vulnerability and integration of the probability of the hazardous event with the expected damage de brito et al 2017 accordingly two typical approaches probability method apel et al 2006 sarhadi et al 2012 unami et al 2010 and index based method chen et al 2011 ji et al 2013 yoon 2012 are applied to express the level of flood risk the former method is typically applied to a small scale due to requirements for data of high quality and lack of macroscopic consideration for the large scale watershed xiao et al 2017 the index based method usually uses a synthetic value by integrating various forms of indicator information with different risk dimensions i e hydrometeorological topographic ecological social and economic to measure the risk level and has been widely applied based on its simplicity of conducting and low demand for data kazakis et al 2015 pham et al 2021 toosi et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zou et al 2013 it is a comprehensive assessment method that is particularly applicable for assessing flood risk for large scale basins cirella et al 2014 sinha et al 2008 proposed a flood risk index integrating geomorphology land cover topography and social economy to analyze the flood risk in the kosi river basin india balica et al 2009 adopted a flood vulnerability index method in several cases at the river basin sub catchment or urban area scale to observe how the indicators reflect the flood vulnerability and pinpoint local hotspots of flood vulnerability yoon et al 2014 developed a flood risk index combining hydrologic socio economic and ecological parameters to evaluate the flood hazard and vulnerability in the han river basin korea to assess the flood risk in the huaihe river basin china wu et al 2015 constructed a risk assessment index system and specifically proposed reservoir storage modulus and flood detention basin modulus as the indices of describing human intervention capacity on flood using an assessment model based on random forest wang et al 2015 selected 11 risk indicators and trained and tested 5 000 samples to analyze the flood hazard in the dongjiang river basin china ntajal et al 2017 combined indicator based risk assessment method and geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques to assess and map the social flood risk in the lower mono river basin of western africa toosi et al 2019 presented a multi criteria flood hazard index fhi method which has been applied in the mashhad plain basin iran to classify potential basin scale flood hazards it is generally recognized that natural disaster is formed by the combined effects of hazard vulnerability and exposure apel et al 2009 hauger et al 2006 haynes et al 2008 zhou et al 2012 and the indices of the above three aspects and their appurtenant indicators had been explored and used to integrate the flood risk index in many researches castillo rodríguez et al 2014 haynes et al 2008 with the deepening of the research more and more scholars indicated that the coping capacity which is the ability to cope with disaster reduces risk and vulnerability plays an important role as well as exposure of receptors in flood risk assessment and should be a component of vulnerability scheuer et al 2011 within this context we consider risk as the product of hazard and vulnerability and the formation of flood disaster is a process through closely linked disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity to make the risk assessment operational it is important to construct a composite flood risk index by identifying and combining significant factors and indicators for the hazard index hi and vulnerability index vi respectively hi is a function of the disaster inducing factors and disaster inducing environmental factors and vi is formed by the combined effects of the exposure of receptors and coping capacity each of the above four aspects contains a set of indicators to implement the flood risk evaluation flood hazard and vulnerability information such as hydrometeorological and topographic conditions the population and socioeconomic distribution and the cascade reservoir features is needed to be stored processed analyzed and integrated gis has powerful spatial analysis and geo statistical functions chen et al 2015 can build analytic units based on grids or administrative areas and has been an extensively used tool in flood disasters and risk assessment dewan et al 2007 hong et al 2018 lyu et al 2018b mojaddadi et al 2017 tehrany et al 2015 the dadu river basin is subject to multiple natural disasters such as extreme rainfall earthquake and landslide simultaneously as one of 13 hydropower bases in china the basin has been heavily developed to supply cascade hydropower the basin is liable to be threatened by the hydropower engineering failure caused floods as well as the natural caused floods therefore comprehensively considering the two types of disaster inducing factor and using rational indicators to characterize them is essential for integrated basin flood risk assessment for the existing basin scale flood risk assessment system the selection of evaluation indicators seldom refers to the important role of hydraulic structure playing in flood control and the negative influence of hydraulic structure exerting in failure events it is the deficiency of current researches on flood risk assessment at the river basin scale and also the focus of this study the overall aim of the study is to propose an integrated basin scale flood risk assessment method allowing the identification of relatively higher risk areas via easy to comprehend risk maps the corresponding research focuses include constructing a flood risk index system combing the characterization indicators of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity processing normalizing and weighting the data of each selected indicator to integrate the basin flood risk index within the gis environment and defining the ranges of risk levels based on the resultant risk scores to zone various risk areas 2 methodology 2 1 framework of index system many researches reveal hazard vulnerability and risk are three basic elements that are associated with the modern flood management system chakraborty and mukhopadhyay 2019 flood risk is therefore defined as a function of the hazard and vulnerability in this paper a natural disaster risk assessment model proposed by the office of the united nations disaster relief coordinator undro 1991 is applied to assess the river basin scale flood risk which can be expressed as follows 1 r h v where r h and v indicate flood risk hazard and vulnerability indices respectively and have a value ranging from 0 to 1 it is important to differentiate between significant and insignificant indicators for each aspect shrubsole et al 2003 2 2 construction of the index system in natural disaster researches and risk system theory the hazard concept is a function of the disaster inducing factors r1 and disaster forming environment r2 and the vulnerability is formed by the combined effects of exposure of receptors r 3 and coping capability r4 dimensions andrade and szlafsztein 2018 therefore h and v can be subdivided into four aspects of r1 r2 r 3 and r4 r1 and r2 closely related to the occurrence of the disaster are two components of the hazard index r1 as a direct exposure related factor is mainly responsible for the hazard and forms certain spatial and temporal distribution patterns through hydrological processes for the large river where the hydropower engineering constructs in addition to the usually considered climate factor the river basin scale flood control also faces a key challenge from dam failure in the study extreme rainfall h1 and dam breach h2 are identified as two typical disaster inducing sources of basin catastrophic floods on the one hand the frequent peak floods caused by extreme rainfall will cause flood disasters once they exceed the flood discharge capacity of the river channel on the other hand for the cascade reservoir system located in a river basin once the flood results in the dam breach of the upstream reservoir the safety of the downstream cascade and even the whole river basin will be catastrophically threatened the environmental components such as terrain and vegetation cover involved in the basin flood hazard index are concluded as physical exposure h3 according to expert knowledge flood vulnerability index consists of social exposure of flood disasters and the ability of various elements to anticipate and cope with the disaster impact i e r 3 and r4 wherein r 3 refers to the exposures of receptors in the human socio economic system threatened by river basin scale floods denoted as v1 which is characterizing the human distribution and socioeconomic status and the greater the exposure is the higher the risk is combined with the features of the disaster inducing factor for river basin floods coping capacity is divided into basic coping capacity v2 and special coping capacity v3 disaggregate the above aspects into more specific indicators based on relevance representativeness accuracy and replicability andrade and szlafsztein 2018 birkmann et al 2006 cutter et al 2010 the final established framework of the river basin scale flood risk index system is shown in fig 1 2 2 1 hazard index h 2 2 1 1 disaster inducing factors r1 disaster inducing factors r1 are mainly responsible for the occurrence of the hazards for instance extreme rainfall may induce floods and dam break may cause catastrophic floods it describes the extreme climatic and hydropower engineering loadings at the basin scale 1 extreme rainfall h1 extreme rainfall h1 can cause flooding and this flood type can develop rapidly therefore the relationship between flood disasters and extreme rainfall is inseparable the magnitude of extreme rainfall induced flooding depends on the intensity and duration of the rainfall shrubsole et al 2003 many indicators can be used to describe the extreme rainfall event wherein a suite of extreme rainfall indices recommended by expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi has been partially or completely employed in different regional studies recently and manifested their suitability for analyzing extreme rainfall characteristics the eleven extreme rainfall indices with characteristics of weak extremity low noisy and strong significantly are divided into two categories in the light of reflecting the intensity or duration of extreme precipitation and can indicate extreme rainfall changes in different aspects according to previous researches caesar et al 2011 klein tank et al 2006 the following three representative and frequently used indicators are selected for expressing the features in intensity and duration of the extreme rainfall event their changes can profoundly impact on particular sectors of society or ecosystems alexander et al 2006 maximum 5 day precipitation r5day h11 is a maximum event intensity indicator represents maximum values within a year and is more representative of the rainfall that causes floods via being compared with maximum 1 day precipitation r1day very heavy precipitation days r20 h12 is a duration indicator and indicates the annual count of days when the daily precipitation 20 mm it defines the number of days on which a precipitation value falls above a fixed threshold and can summarize the wet part of the year r99 extreme daily precipitation r99p h13 describes the fraction of the annual total rainfall falling above the 99th percentile and includes but is not be limited to the most extreme precipitation events in a year alexander et al 2006 2 dam breach h2 in the dam break problem the factors influencing the dam break risk are mostly derived from the internal and external environments of dams the external risk factors are uncontrollable and difficult to be prevented the internal risk factors appear mostly in the way of a dam s intrinsic qualities high dams or large reservoirs or relatively low discharge capacity can release significant uncontrolled outflows in case of dam failure and expose extensive downstream areas to potential flooding urs corporation 2001 therefore reservoir capacity h21 dam height h22 and discharge capacity h23 are selected 2 2 1 2 disaster forming environment r2 the flood disaster formative environment r2 mainly includes topography geomorphology vegetation coverage etc among the topographical and geomorphological factors elevation h31 and slope h32 have the greatest impact on flood formation areas with lower elevation and smaller terrain slope are more prone to flooding normalized difference vegetation index ndvi h33 as the most common used vegetation coverage indicator represents the condition of vegetation coverage and reflects the background influence of the plant canopy the lower ndvi the smaller capacity of buffering the higher the flood hazard guo et al 2014 therefore elevation slope and ndvi are selected as the representative indicators of r2 2 2 2 vulnerability index v 2 2 2 1 exposure of receptors r 3 in the study exposure of receptors mainly refers to the exposure in the human socio economic system threated by regional flooding according to the suggestion of the flood directive people and economic activities are two key types of social exposure ronco et al 2014 correspondingly population density v11 and gdp density v12 are selected based on the availability and evaluability as the exposure indicators population density reflects the distribution attribute of the regional population and illustrates the regional life exposure a highly populated district is usually a highly vulnerable place that may suffer from flood disasters gdp density describes the development level and regional socioeconomic exposure the higher the gdp is the greater the vulnerability is 2 2 2 2 coping capacity r4 coping capacity can be reflected by the flood control project construction standards and the disaster prevention and mitigation investment considering that the construction investment of non engineering measures is directly proportional to the regional per capita gdp therefore per capita gdp v22 is selected to characterize the disaster prevention capacity of non engineering measures flood control engineering measures are the main means of regional disaster prevention and mitigation cascade reservoirs provide storage capacity to impound flood water small floods are impounded but larger floods contain more water than can be impounded and so the excess must be spilled downstream lave and balvanyos 1998 therefore the flood control design standard v21 of cascade dams is selected as the indicator of representing the regional engineering disaster prevention capacity in the paper it refers to the standards of preventing flood which various flood control projects are required to meet that is the design flood standards of flood control projects themselves expressed in terms of the flood return period the higher the used standard is the lower the risk is for the cascade reservoir system when the upstream dam fails the rapidly formed dam break flood characterized as high flood peak and large volume causes rapid water level rise of the downstream dam when the discharge capacity of the downstream reservoir is seriously insufficient a new danger will arise in general the downstream reservoir has a certain ability to reduce upstream floods which can be generalized as a special coping capacity indicator measured by the flood routing coefficient k v31 it is assumed that the upstream dam failure with a storage capacity of cu will produce a certain proportion p e g p 20 of reservoir water overflow when the total overflow volume of upstream dam failure cu p is lower than a certain proportion 1 2 p e g 1 2 p 10 of the downstream storage capacity cd it is considered that the downstream dam will completely reduce the additional impact of the overflow induced by the upstream dam failure correspondingly k is used to measure the ability of the reservoir to reduce the upstream flood and defined as lei 2011 lei et al 2010 2 k c d 1 2 p c u p c d 2 c u if k 1 0 the downstream dam will completely reduce the additional impact of the overflow induced by the upstream dam failure and if k 1 0 the upstream dam failure will have an additional impact on the downstream dam 2 3 indicator normalization in general different indicator data sources possess different dimensions or magnitudes to make the indicators comparable and the risk aggregation possible the input indicator layers should be transformed into unified map coordinates and normalized to the value ranging from 0 to 1 furthermore there are two functional relationships between the indicator values and risk index positive and negative which means when the indicators tend to increase and decrease the flood risk respectively correspondingly different normalization methods the maximum method i and the maximum method ii are applied as follows 3 y i x i x i min x i max x i min 4 y i x i max x i x i max x i min where y i x i x i max and x i min are the normalized value the observed value the maximum value and the minimum value of indicator i respectively eq 3 and eq 4 are used for indicators positively and negatively correlated with the risk index respectively 2 4 indicator weighting the analytic hierarchy process ahp method developed by saaty 1977 is utilized to assign indicator weights as a widely used method for deriving the indicator weights in the researches of natural disaster risk assessment it uses a pair wise comparison process based on a basic scale of absolute numbers table 1 to represent the individual preferences saaty 2008 to arrive at a scale of preferences among a set of alternatives fernández and lutz 2010 ahp provides the consistency ratio cr to check the consistency of the preference judgment or of the comparison matrix which allows the judgment or the preference to be consistent only if the cr 0 10 cr can be expressed as follows 5 cr ci ri where ci and ri are the consistency index and the random index ri value is determined by the number of criteria n and ci is calculated in terms of 6 ci λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of the comparison matrix and n is the number of criteria the reclassed indicator rasters were assigned their respective weights w based on the consistent comparison matrix chakraborty and mukhopadhyay 2019 2 5 aggregation and risk zonation after collecting and preprocessing the data of each indicator various thematic layers are normalized weighted and integrated with the gis environment the integration modes of the hazard and vulnerability indices are as follows 7 h r 1 r 2 i 1 l h 1 i w h 1 i j 1 m h 2 j w h 2 j k 1 n h 3 k w h 3 k 8 v w r 3 r 3 w r 4 1 r 4 w r 3 i 1 m v 1 i w v 1 i w r 4 1 j 1 n v 2 j w v 2 j v 3 w 3 where w with subscripts represent weights of each indicator they are non negative and add up to 1 h v and r with subscripts are transformed performance scores for indicators at different levels on a scale of 0 to 1 the resultant hazard and vulnerability index scores are multiplied based on eq 1 to obtain the integrated risk index by using the map algebra tool of gis the accessed hazard vulnerability and risk index scores vary from 0 to 1 respectively and are classified into 5 levels very low low medium high very high using the natural breaks method to map the spatial distribution of hazard vulnerability and risk to floods in the investigated area the generated maps with five levels are visually clear and logically distinguishable and the classification has been commonly used in the presentation of flood risk level kourgialas and karatzas 2011 xiao et al 2018 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the dadu river basin is located in southwestern china and lies between longitude 99 42 103 48 e and latitude 28 15 33 33 n fig 2 the dadu river flows from north to south with a catchment area of 77 400 km2 the altitude of the surrounding mountains is more than 3000 m and the highest peaks are 5123 m and 5241 m on the left and right banks respectively 22 large sized cascade reservoirs have been planned designed and constructed in the basin which constituted a typical mixed cascade hydropower system with integrated functions of power generation flood control and irrigation chen and lin 2019 the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 634 9 mm increasing from northwest to southeast about 90 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in may october and more than 64 of the precipitation is concentrated in june august which is the rainiest period chen et al 2017 according to the characteristics of the basin water system and precipitation the basin is divided into upper middle and lower reaches by two boundary points of luding and tongjiezi of which the catchment areas are 58943 km2 17440 km2 and 1017 km2 respectively and accounting for 76 2 22 5 and 1 3 of the basin respectively according to the measured and investigated flood analyses floods seldom occurred simultaneously in different reaches of the basin 3 2 data sources r5day r20 and r99p are derived from the daily precipitation data at the observational stations of the basin recorded from 1960 to 2008 and these indicator values of each station are interpolated by using the kriging method within a gis environment elevation and slope are extracted from a digital elevation model dem with a 30 m resolution in the gis environment lyu et al 2018a dem data and ndvi data can be obtained from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn the statistical data of the regional population and gdp and the characteristic values of cascade reservoirs are obtained from the related yearbooks and investigation reports the obtained spatial distribution maps of each indicator are shown in figs 3 4 4 results 4 1 indicator weights after constructing the risk assessment index system of the dadu river basin the data for each indicator are normalized and converted to a raster format within the arcgis platform the pair wise comparison matrixes consistency ratios and indicator weights can be calculated which are shown in tables 2 4 the weight sets corresponding to eqs 7 8 are w h 1 i 0 2505 0 2505 0 2505 w h 2 j 0 0778 0 0359 0 1348 w h 3 k 0 5396 0 1634 0 2970 w v 1 i 0 6667 0 3333 and w v 2 j 0 1260 0 4161 0 4579 respectively in addition w r 3 w r 4 0 5 4 2 distribution characteristics of hazard vulnerability and risk indices the spatial distribution of flood hazard vulnerability and risk indices are drawn using the gis raster overlay and spatial analysis functions based on eq 1 7 and 8 the resultant maps are further reclassified into five levels very low low medium high and very high which are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 a that high and very high hazard areas are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin accounting for 20 15373 km2 of the basin area this is because that the midstream and downstream are located in the qingyi river mabian river anning river rainstorm belt where the extreme rainfall caused flood frequently occurs the narrow terrain and widely spread mountainous area in the midstream and downstream create favorable conditions for the formation of extreme rainfall but also limit the relocation of extreme rainfall hence a local high intensity precipitation the main source of floods in the basin is easily being formed the formed floods with large flow peaks and moderate flood volumes steeply rise and fall which can cause massive damage 80 62027 km2 of the basin area undergoes a very low to medium flood hazard which is mainly located in the upstream of the basin the upstream is affected by the terrain geography and surface vegetation and subject to small amounts of precipitation which leads to neither the flood volumes nor the peak flows being large and the flood fluctuation process is slow as analyzed in fig 5 b 4 of the basin area suffers high and very high flood vulnerability 18 is under moderate flood vulnerability and 78 is least vulnerable the population of this basin is unevenly distributed affected by natural conditions such as climate and land it basically shows a gradual increase in population from the upstream to the downstream and the economy is gradually active from west to east highly vulnerable zones match with high population density and high gdp density along with this the low overlay effect of flood control standard per capita gdp and flood routing coefficient in these regions makes them more vulnerable to the flood disaster the influences of the hazard and vulnerability indices in integrating the risk index distribution were observed to be varied at places in the midstream to downstream area of the basin the proportion of high and very high risk zones is very large primarily caused by the high to very high hazard values combined with medium to very high vulnerability values the downstream is found to be the least safe zone followed by the southeastern part of the midstream the very high risk zones occupy approximately 1 5 of the basin which is in accordance with the very high hazard and vulnerability class associated with the area 4 3 results validation to validate the assessment results we compare the assessed flood risk zones with three records of historical flood disasters that occurred in the basin during 1960 2008 the records listed in table 5 are extracted from government publications chen 1995 dong 2007 tian 1992 xiao 2008 and show the main disaster situations and the affected areas by comparing it can be derived that for the selected flood disasters the probability that it occurs in the high to very high risk areas and medium to very high risk region is 67 and 34 respectively and demonstrated that the integrated basin flood risk assessment results are reliable and can be used in further risk decision making 5 discussion researches assessing the joint impact of climate change and dams have been conducted successively in large river basins around the world such as the yuan river wen et al 2018 the carpathian river kędra and wiejaczka 2018 the mekong river basin yang et al 2019 etc in addition there are many studies on basin wide flood risk as well but rare researches fully investigate the relationships between flood disaster inducing factors and the basin flood risk or explore the basin flood risk degree and distribution under the concurrent influence of dam failure and climate change construction of dams on large rivers is useful for regulating storing and mitigating flood but may induce a series of consequences that may or may not have been anticipated such as dam break flood which has not received as much attention as the natural causes of flooding nguyen tien et al 2018 wang et al 2017 to meet the demands of authorities and stakeholders for a better understanding of the flood risk in river basins where dams are distributed significant efforts are required to provide theoretical methods and case studies that allow for the construction of an ideal basin scale flood risk assessment framework which should comprise all possible dimensions of disaster inducing factors including natural and human considering that the flood risk exists in the whole process of flood disaster formation propagation and mitigation with various expression forms only via conducting a comprehensive analysis of flood risk its overall characteristics and essential attributes can be abstracted therefore flood risk assessment and management gradually present a trend of integrated research with the frequent occurrence of heavy rainfall events and high speed development of basin cascade hydropower exploring the effective integrated flood risk assessment framework for data scarce river basins is vital xiao et al 2017 the index based method can consider the combined influence of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capability and is considered an effective means of matching this trend of integrated research and an important scientific reference for flood disaster risk management and relevant decision making in large scale basins wang et al 2015 within this context this paper developed an integrated basin flood risk assessment framework at the basin scale under the combined effects of extreme rainfall and cascade dams with two sub indices hazard index and vulnerability index and one target index risk index based on the disaster system theory and risk assessment theory which uses a complete set of gis tools to achieve the visualization and allows assessing how flood risk would change corresponding to the changes in population climate and hydropower engineering construction this is an improvement over the conventional assessment method of basin wide flood risk influenced by a single flood disaster inducing factor a novel attempt to simultaneously consider the extreme rainfall and dam break as the two main types of basin flood disaster inducing factor to this specific field and more applicable to the objective reality of river basins which is liable to be threatened by the hydropower engineering failure caused floods in addition the important role played by the cascade reservoirs in flood control was discussed and represented by the basic and special coping capacity which were characterized by the indicators of flood control standard and flood routing coefficient of cascade dams in view of the basin hydropower development situation based on the ability to provide an overall flood risk assessment in heavily developed river basins and the guidance of disaster prevention and alleviation for the relatively prioritize risk areas the implementation of the developed framework in the dadu river basin shows significant potential and practical suitability the application of the assessment method represents only the beginning and depends on data availability indicator selection weighting and integration in which prominently affect the final classification therefore more efforts are needed to collect high precision indicator data and explore less contested and more scientific weighting mechanisms 6 conclusions river basin scale flood is a catastrophic disaster event to surrounding society and the environment to comprehensively assess and zoning the flood risk in heavily developed river basins is critical for making disaster prevention and alleviation plans in the light of various risk classified areas although there are many studies on flood risk in river basins the research for the integrated risk assessment of natural disaster dam downstream society system still needs to be further strengthened to fill these gaps in research this study designed to propose an integrated basin wide flood risk assessment and zonation method which has not been applied till date specifically speaking according to the natural disaster and risk assessment theories and basin flood disaster characteristics a flood risk index system with 14 indicators selected from the aspects of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity was built and used to characterize the hydrometeorology topography socioeconomic situation cascade reservoir features and flood control characteristics the application of the developed framework in the dadu river basin china has verified its practical suitability compared with previous researches the main novelty of the proposed integrated risk assessment method is that it widened up the selection scope of flood disaster inducing factors to incorporate the disaster inductivity of extreme rainfall caused flood and dam break flood and defined the coping capacity indicators of characterizing the flood control features of hydraulic engineering in addition to reflect the growing tendency of widening up the vulnerability concept the ability of human society and engineering systems to face disasters was incorporated in the framework as well specifically it takes advantage of the data of hydraulic engineering characteristic parameters to quantify the new addition of disaster inducing factors and components of coping capacity the novelty of this contribution is represented by three points 1 the method can combine indicator layers into a single composite index in the gis environment via a series of appropriate operations improved situations where data deficits originally limited evaluation of flash flood risk with high efficiency and flexibility this method thus will offer preferable assessment results with the support of high accuracy and abundant data 2 the proposed risk assessment framework considering multiple elements at risk and presenting floods more realistically is its ability to provide an overall assessment of flood risk wherein the delineation of flood risk prone areas is critical for making disaster prevention and alleviation plans it can be extended to evaluate the flood risk in other basins under three different scenarios no dam development combined with extreme precipitation changed dam development combined with no climate change and dam development combined with extreme precipitation changed 3 the generated flood hazard vulnerability and risk maps by the proposed method could provide insights into the identification of the spatial distribution of basin flood risk and for improving and innovating water and risk management practices and be a valuable guide for decision making regarding river basin flood management it can be adopted and extended in other river basins under similar potential flood threats based on areal features and data availability which provides a new way of basin wide flood risk assessment and theoretical guidance for flood risk mitigation the constructed assessment framework can obtain relatively good evaluation results based on the flood risk formation mechanism and simple operation processes and is intelligible reproducible and applicable in other river basins around the globe for other types of natural disasters credit authorship contribution statement yu chen conceptualization methodology

2860,flood is the most common worldwide natural disaster with enormous impacts on human society and the ecosystem consequently the research of flood risk assessment and zonation is critical its research scope is changeable wherein the basin scale research has become more and more important due to the increasing boom of cascade hydropower development in the river basin the study proposed a basin wide integrated flood risk assessment method combining index based evaluation analytical hierarchy process ahp and geographic information system gis technologies which was implemented in the dadu river basin southwestern china to assess and zoning the basin flood risk in the constructed risk assessment index system we use extreme rainfall and dam breach to jointly describe the basin flood disaster inducing factors and select flood control standard and flood routing coefficient as the sub indicators of basic and specific coping capacity to characterize the flood intervention capacity of hydropower engineering the results showed that for the hazard vulnerability and risk zonation maps with five classified levels the southern of midstream and downstream of the basin are prone to frequent floods while higher vulnerability levels mainly concentrate in the downstream but some parts scatter in the medium vulnerability zone the high and very high risk zones account for 3 of the basin area and mainly concentrate in the southern basin while 86 of the basin area is assigned as low and very low risk zones the results of this work quantitatively express the spatial distribution characteristics of basin wide flood hazard vulnerability and risk and provide a reference for practicing an integrated and efficient flood risk management and disaster prevention and alleviation strategies keywords flood disaster risk assessment index system gis dadu river basin 1 introduction floods as one of the most frequent challenging and devastating natural disasters worldwide has resulted in tremendous losses of human life socio economy and ecosystem over the past decades there has been growing awareness of the requirement for ongoing improvement in assessing and zoning flood

applied based on its simplicity of conducting and low demand for data kazakis et al 2015 pham et al 2021 toosi et al 2019 wu et al 2020 zou et al 2013 it is a comprehensive assessment method that is particularly applicable for assessing flood risk for large scale basins cirella et al 2014 sinha et al 2008 proposed a flood risk index integrating geomorphology land cover topography and social economy to analyze the flood risk in the kosi river basin india balica et al 2009 adopted a flood vulnerability index method in several cases at the river basin sub catchment or urban area scale to observe how the indicators reflect the flood vulnerability and pinpoint local hotspots of flood vulnerability yoon et al 2014 developed a flood risk index combining hydrologic socio economic and ecological parameters to evaluate the flood hazard and vulnerability in the han river basin korea to assess the flood risk in the huaihe river basin china wu et al 2015 constructed a risk assessment index system and specifically proposed reservoir storage modulus and flood detention basin modulus as the indices of describing human intervention capacity on flood using an assessment model based on random forest wang et al 2015 selected 11 risk indicators and trained and tested 5 000 samples to analyze the flood hazard in the dongjiang river basin china ntajal et al 2017 combined indicator based risk assessment method and geographic information system gis and remote sensing rs techniques to assess and map the social flood risk in the lower mono river basin of western africa toosi et al 2019 presented a multi criteria flood hazard index fhi method which has been applied in the mashhad plain basin iran to classify potential basin scale flood hazards it is generally recognized that natural disaster is formed by the combined effects of hazard vulnerability and exposure apel et al 2009 hauger et al 2006 haynes et al 2008 zhou et al 2012 and the indices of the above three aspects and their appurtenant indicators had been explored and used to integrate the flood risk index in many researches castillo rodríguez et al 2014 haynes et al 2008 with the deepening of the research more and more scholars indicated that the coping capacity which is the ability to cope with disaster reduces risk and vulnerability plays an important role as well as exposure of receptors in flood risk assessment and should be a component of vulnerability scheuer et al 2011 within this context we consider risk as the product of hazard and vulnerability and the formation of flood disaster is a process through closely linked disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity to make the risk assessment operational it is important to construct a composite flood risk index by identifying and combining significant factors and indicators for the hazard index hi and vulnerability index vi respectively hi is a function of the disaster inducing factors and disaster inducing environmental factors and vi is formed by the combined effects of the exposure of receptors and coping capacity each of the above four aspects contains a set of indicators to implement the flood risk evaluation flood hazard and vulnerability information such as hydrometeorological and topographic conditions the population and socioeconomic distribution and the cascade reservoir features is needed to be stored processed analyzed and integrated gis has powerful spatial analysis and geo statistical functions chen et al 2015 can build analytic units based on grids or administrative areas and has been an extensively used tool in flood disasters and risk assessment dewan et al 2007 hong et al 2018 lyu et al 2018b mojaddadi et al 2017 tehrany et al 2015 the dadu river basin is subject to multiple natural disasters such as extreme rainfall earthquake and landslide simultaneously as one of 13 hydropower bases in china the basin has been heavily developed to supply cascade hydropower the basin is liable to be threatened by the hydropower engineering failure caused floods as well as the natural caused floods therefore comprehensively considering the two types of disaster inducing factor and using rational indicators to characterize them is essential for integrated basin flood risk assessment for the existing basin scale flood risk assessment system the selection of evaluation indicators seldom refers to the important role of hydraulic structure playing in flood control and the negative influence of hydraulic structure exerting in failure events it is the deficiency of current researches on flood risk assessment at the river basin scale and also the focus of this study the overall aim of the study is to propose an integrated basin scale flood risk assessment method allowing the identification of relatively higher risk areas via easy to comprehend risk maps the corresponding research focuses include constructing a flood risk index system combing the characterization indicators of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity processing normalizing and weighting the data of each selected indicator to integrate the basin flood risk index within the gis environment and defining the ranges of risk levels based on the resultant risk scores to zone various risk areas 2 methodology 2 1 framework of index system many researches reveal hazard vulnerability and risk are three basic elements that are associated with the modern flood management system chakraborty and mukhopadhyay 2019 flood risk is therefore defined as a function of the hazard and vulnerability in this paper a natural disaster risk assessment model proposed by the office of the united nations disaster relief coordinator undro 1991 is applied to assess the river basin scale flood risk which can be expressed as follows 1 r h v where r h and v indicate flood risk hazard and vulnerability indices respectively and have a value ranging from 0 to 1 it is important to differentiate between significant and insignificant indicators for each aspect shrubsole et al 2003 2 2 construction of the index system in natural disaster researches and risk system theory the hazard concept is a function of the disaster inducing factors r1 and disaster forming environment r2 and the vulnerability is formed by the combined effects of exposure of receptors r 3 and coping capability r4 dimensions andrade and szlafsztein 2018 therefore h and v can be subdivided into four aspects of r1 r2 r 3 and r4 r1 and r2 closely related to the occurrence of the disaster are two components of the hazard index r1 as a direct exposure related factor is mainly responsible for the hazard and forms certain spatial and temporal distribution patterns through hydrological processes for the large river where the hydropower engineering constructs in addition to the usually considered climate factor the river basin scale flood control also faces a key challenge from dam failure in the study extreme rainfall h1 and dam breach h2 are identified as two typical disaster inducing sources of basin catastrophic floods on the one hand the frequent peak floods caused by extreme rainfall will cause flood disasters once they exceed the flood discharge capacity of the river channel on the other hand for the cascade reservoir system located in a river basin once the flood results in the dam breach of the upstream reservoir the safety of the downstream cascade and even the whole river basin will be catastrophically threatened the environmental components such as terrain and vegetation cover involved in the basin flood hazard index are concluded as physical exposure h3 according to expert knowledge flood vulnerability index consists of social exposure of flood disasters and the ability of various elements to anticipate and cope with the disaster impact i e r 3 and r4 wherein r 3 refers to the exposures of receptors in the human socio economic system threatened by river basin scale floods denoted as v1 which is characterizing the human distribution and socioeconomic status and the greater the exposure is the higher the risk is combined with the features of the disaster inducing factor for river basin floods coping capacity is divided into basic coping capacity v2 and special coping capacity v3 disaggregate the above aspects into more specific indicators based on relevance representativeness accuracy and replicability andrade and szlafsztein 2018 birkmann et al 2006 cutter et al 2010 the final established framework of the river basin scale flood risk index system is shown in fig 1 2 2 1 hazard index h 2 2 1 1 disaster inducing factors r1 disaster inducing factors r1 are mainly responsible for the occurrence of the hazards for instance extreme rainfall may induce floods and dam break may cause catastrophic floods it describes the extreme climatic and hydropower engineering loadings at the basin scale 1 extreme rainfall h1 extreme rainfall h1 can cause flooding and this flood type can develop rapidly therefore the relationship between flood disasters and extreme rainfall is inseparable the magnitude of extreme rainfall induced flooding depends on the intensity and duration of the rainfall shrubsole et al 2003 many indicators can be used to describe the extreme rainfall event wherein a suite of extreme rainfall indices recommended by expert team on climate change detection monitoring and indices etccdmi has been partially or completely employed in different regional studies recently and manifested their suitability for analyzing extreme rainfall characteristics the eleven extreme rainfall indices with characteristics of weak extremity low noisy and strong significantly are divided into two categories in the light of reflecting the intensity or duration of extreme precipitation and can indicate extreme rainfall changes in different aspects according to previous researches caesar et al 2011 klein tank et al 2006 the following three representative and frequently used indicators are selected for expressing the features in intensity and duration of the extreme rainfall event their changes can profoundly impact on particular sectors of society or ecosystems alexander et al 2006 maximum 5 day precipitation r5day h11 is a maximum event intensity indicator represents maximum values within a year and is more representative of the rainfall that causes floods via being compared with maximum 1 day precipitation r1day very heavy precipitation days r20 h12 is a duration indicator and indicates the annual count of days when the daily precipitation 20 mm it defines the number of days on which a precipitation value falls above a fixed threshold and can summarize the wet part of the year r99 extreme daily precipitation r99p h13 describes the fraction of the annual total rainfall falling above the 99th percentile and includes but is not be limited to the most extreme precipitation events in a year alexander et al 2006 2 dam breach h2 in the dam break problem the factors influencing the dam break risk are mostly derived from the internal and external environments of dams the external risk factors are uncontrollable and difficult to be prevented the internal risk factors appear mostly in the way of a dam s intrinsic qualities high dams or large reservoirs or relatively low discharge capacity can release significant uncontrolled outflows in case of dam failure and expose extensive downstream areas to potential flooding urs corporation 2001 therefore reservoir capacity h21 dam height h22 and discharge capacity h23 are selected 2 2 1 2 disaster forming environment r2 the flood disaster formative environment r2 mainly includes topography geomorphology vegetation coverage etc among the topographical and geomorphological factors elevation h31 and slope h32 have the greatest impact on flood formation areas with lower elevation and smaller terrain slope are more prone to flooding normalized difference vegetation index ndvi h33 as the most common used vegetation coverage indicator represents the condition of vegetation coverage and reflects the background influence of the plant canopy the lower ndvi the smaller capacity of buffering the higher the flood hazard guo et al 2014 therefore elevation slope and ndvi are selected as the representative indicators of r2 2 2 2 vulnerability index v 2 2 2 1 exposure of receptors r 3 in the study exposure of receptors mainly refers to the exposure in the human socio economic system threated by regional flooding according to the suggestion of the flood directive people and economic activities are two key types of social exposure ronco et al 2014 correspondingly population density v11 and gdp density v12 are selected based on the availability and evaluability as the exposure indicators population density reflects the distribution attribute of the regional population and illustrates the regional life exposure a highly populated district is usually a highly vulnerable place that may suffer from flood disasters gdp density describes the development level and regional socioeconomic exposure the higher the gdp is the greater the vulnerability is 2 2 2 2 coping capacity r4 coping capacity can be reflected by the flood control project construction standards and the disaster prevention and mitigation investment considering that the construction investment of non engineering measures is directly proportional to the regional per capita gdp therefore per capita gdp v22 is selected to characterize the disaster prevention capacity of non engineering measures flood control engineering measures are the main means of regional disaster prevention and mitigation cascade reservoirs provide storage capacity to impound flood water small floods are impounded but larger floods contain more water than can be impounded and so the excess must be spilled downstream lave and balvanyos 1998 therefore the flood control design standard v21 of cascade dams is selected as the indicator of representing the regional engineering disaster prevention capacity in the paper it refers to the standards of preventing flood which various flood control projects are required to meet that is the design flood standards of flood control projects themselves expressed in terms of the flood return period the higher the used standard is the lower the risk is for the cascade reservoir system when the upstream dam fails the rapidly formed dam break flood characterized as high flood peak and large volume causes rapid water level rise of the downstream dam when the discharge capacity of the downstream reservoir is seriously insufficient a new danger will arise in general the downstream reservoir has a certain ability to reduce upstream floods which can be generalized as a special coping capacity indicator measured by the flood routing coefficient k v31 it is assumed that the upstream dam failure with a storage capacity of cu will produce a certain proportion p e g p 20 of reservoir water overflow when the total overflow volume of upstream dam failure cu p is lower than a certain proportion 1 2 p e g 1 2 p 10 of the downstream storage capacity cd it is considered that the downstream dam will completely reduce the additional impact of the overflow induced by the upstream dam failure correspondingly k is used to measure the ability of the reservoir to reduce the upstream flood and defined as lei 2011 lei et al 2010 2 k c d 1 2 p c u p c d 2 c u if k 1 0 the downstream dam will completely reduce the additional impact of the overflow induced by the upstream dam failure and if k 1 0 the upstream dam failure will have an additional impact on the downstream dam 2 3 indicator normalization in general different indicator data sources possess different dimensions or magnitudes to make the indicators comparable and the risk aggregation possible the input indicator layers should be transformed into unified map coordinates and normalized to the value ranging from 0 to 1 furthermore there are two functional relationships between the indicator values and risk index positive and negative which means when the indicators tend to increase and decrease the flood risk respectively correspondingly different normalization methods the maximum method i and the maximum method ii are applied as follows 3 y i x i x i min x i max x i min 4 y i x i max x i x i max x i min where y i x i x i max and x i min are the normalized value the observed value the maximum value and the minimum value of indicator i respectively eq 3 and eq 4 are used for indicators positively and negatively correlated with the risk index respectively 2 4 indicator weighting the analytic hierarchy process ahp method developed by saaty 1977 is utilized to assign indicator weights as a widely used method for deriving the indicator weights in the researches of natural disaster risk assessment it uses a pair wise comparison process based on a basic scale of absolute numbers table 1 to represent the individual preferences saaty 2008 to arrive at a scale of preferences among a set of alternatives fernández and lutz 2010 ahp provides the consistency ratio cr to check the consistency of the preference judgment or of the comparison matrix which allows the judgment or the preference to be consistent only if the cr 0 10 cr can be expressed as follows 5 cr ci ri where ci and ri are the consistency index and the random index ri value is determined by the number of criteria n and ci is calculated in terms of 6 ci λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the largest eigenvalue of the comparison matrix and n is the number of criteria the reclassed indicator rasters were assigned their respective weights w based on the consistent comparison matrix chakraborty and mukhopadhyay 2019 2 5 aggregation and risk zonation after collecting and preprocessing the data of each indicator various thematic layers are normalized weighted and integrated with the gis environment the integration modes of the hazard and vulnerability indices are as follows 7 h r 1 r 2 i 1 l h 1 i w h 1 i j 1 m h 2 j w h 2 j k 1 n h 3 k w h 3 k 8 v w r 3 r 3 w r 4 1 r 4 w r 3 i 1 m v 1 i w v 1 i w r 4 1 j 1 n v 2 j w v 2 j v 3 w 3 where w with subscripts represent weights of each indicator they are non negative and add up to 1 h v and r with subscripts are transformed performance scores for indicators at different levels on a scale of 0 to 1 the resultant hazard and vulnerability index scores are multiplied based on eq 1 to obtain the integrated risk index by using the map algebra tool of gis the accessed hazard vulnerability and risk index scores vary from 0 to 1 respectively and are classified into 5 levels very low low medium high very high using the natural breaks method to map the spatial distribution of hazard vulnerability and risk to floods in the investigated area the generated maps with five levels are visually clear and logically distinguishable and the classification has been commonly used in the presentation of flood risk level kourgialas and karatzas 2011 xiao et al 2018 3 study area and data sources 3 1 study area the dadu river basin is located in southwestern china and lies between longitude 99 42 103 48 e and latitude 28 15 33 33 n fig 2 the dadu river flows from north to south with a catchment area of 77 400 km2 the altitude of the surrounding mountains is more than 3000 m and the highest peaks are 5123 m and 5241 m on the left and right banks respectively 22 large sized cascade reservoirs have been planned designed and constructed in the basin which constituted a typical mixed cascade hydropower system with integrated functions of power generation flood control and irrigation chen and lin 2019 the mean annual precipitation of the basin is 634 9 mm increasing from northwest to southeast about 90 of the annual precipitation is concentrated in may october and more than 64 of the precipitation is concentrated in june august which is the rainiest period chen et al 2017 according to the characteristics of the basin water system and precipitation the basin is divided into upper middle and lower reaches by two boundary points of luding and tongjiezi of which the catchment areas are 58943 km2 17440 km2 and 1017 km2 respectively and accounting for 76 2 22 5 and 1 3 of the basin respectively according to the measured and investigated flood analyses floods seldom occurred simultaneously in different reaches of the basin 3 2 data sources r5day r20 and r99p are derived from the daily precipitation data at the observational stations of the basin recorded from 1960 to 2008 and these indicator values of each station are interpolated by using the kriging method within a gis environment elevation and slope are extracted from a digital elevation model dem with a 30 m resolution in the gis environment lyu et al 2018a dem data and ndvi data can be obtained from the geospatial data cloud https www gscloud cn the statistical data of the regional population and gdp and the characteristic values of cascade reservoirs are obtained from the related yearbooks and investigation reports the obtained spatial distribution maps of each indicator are shown in figs 3 4 4 results 4 1 indicator weights after constructing the risk assessment index system of the dadu river basin the data for each indicator are normalized and converted to a raster format within the arcgis platform the pair wise comparison matrixes consistency ratios and indicator weights can be calculated which are shown in tables 2 4 the weight sets corresponding to eqs 7 8 are w h 1 i 0 2505 0 2505 0 2505 w h 2 j 0 0778 0 0359 0 1348 w h 3 k 0 5396 0 1634 0 2970 w v 1 i 0 6667 0 3333 and w v 2 j 0 1260 0 4161 0 4579 respectively in addition w r 3 w r 4 0 5 4 2 distribution characteristics of hazard vulnerability and risk indices the spatial distribution of flood hazard vulnerability and risk indices are drawn using the gis raster overlay and spatial analysis functions based on eq 1 7 and 8 the resultant maps are further reclassified into five levels very low low medium high and very high which are shown in fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 a that high and very high hazard areas are mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the basin accounting for 20 15373 km2 of the basin area this is because that the midstream and downstream are located in the qingyi river mabian river anning river rainstorm belt where the extreme rainfall caused flood frequently occurs the narrow terrain and widely spread mountainous area in the midstream and downstream create favorable conditions for the formation of extreme rainfall but also limit the relocation of extreme rainfall hence a local high intensity precipitation the main source of floods in the basin is easily being formed the formed floods with large flow peaks and moderate flood volumes steeply rise and fall which can cause massive damage 80 62027 km2 of the basin area undergoes a very low to medium flood hazard which is mainly located in the upstream of the basin the upstream is affected by the terrain geography and surface vegetation and subject to small amounts of precipitation which leads to neither the flood volumes nor the peak flows being large and the flood fluctuation process is slow as analyzed in fig 5 b 4 of the basin area suffers high and very high flood vulnerability 18 is under moderate flood vulnerability and 78 is least vulnerable the population of this basin is unevenly distributed affected by natural conditions such as climate and land it basically shows a gradual increase in population from the upstream to the downstream and the economy is gradually active from west to east highly vulnerable zones match with high population density and high gdp density along with this the low overlay effect of flood control standard per capita gdp and flood routing coefficient in these regions makes them more vulnerable to the flood disaster the influences of the hazard and vulnerability indices in integrating the risk index distribution were observed to be varied at places in the midstream to downstream area of the basin the proportion of high and very high risk zones is very large primarily caused by the high to very high hazard values combined with medium to very high vulnerability values the downstream is found to be the least safe zone followed by the southeastern part of the midstream the very high risk zones occupy approximately 1 5 of the basin which is in accordance with the very high hazard and vulnerability class associated with the area 4 3 results validation to validate the assessment results we compare the assessed flood risk zones with three records of historical flood disasters that occurred in the basin during 1960 2008 the records listed in table 5 are extracted from government publications chen 1995 dong 2007 tian 1992 xiao 2008 and show the main disaster situations and the affected areas by comparing it can be derived that for the selected flood disasters the probability that it occurs in the high to very high risk areas and medium to very high risk region is 67 and 34 respectively and demonstrated that the integrated basin flood risk assessment results are reliable and can be used in further risk decision making 5 discussion researches assessing the joint impact of climate change and dams have been conducted successively in large river basins around the world such as the yuan river wen et al 2018 the carpathian river kędra and wiejaczka 2018 the mekong river basin yang et al 2019 etc in addition there are many studies on basin wide flood risk as well but rare researches fully investigate the relationships between flood disaster inducing factors and the basin flood risk or explore the basin flood risk degree and distribution under the concurrent influence of dam failure and climate change construction of dams on large rivers is useful for regulating storing and mitigating flood but may induce a series of consequences that may or may not have been anticipated such as dam break flood which has not received as much attention as the natural causes of flooding nguyen tien et al 2018 wang et al 2017 to meet the demands of authorities and stakeholders for a better understanding of the flood risk in river basins where dams are distributed significant efforts are required to provide theoretical methods and case studies that allow for the construction of an ideal basin scale flood risk assessment framework which should comprise all possible dimensions of disaster inducing factors including natural and human considering that the flood risk exists in the whole process of flood disaster formation propagation and mitigation with various expression forms only via conducting a comprehensive analysis of flood risk its overall characteristics and essential attributes can be abstracted therefore flood risk assessment and management gradually present a trend of integrated research with the frequent occurrence of heavy rainfall events and high speed development of basin cascade hydropower exploring the effective integrated flood risk assessment framework for data scarce river basins is vital xiao et al 2017 the index based method can consider the combined influence of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capability and is considered an effective means of matching this trend of integrated research and an important scientific reference for flood disaster risk management and relevant decision making in large scale basins wang et al 2015 within this context this paper developed an integrated basin flood risk assessment framework at the basin scale under the combined effects of extreme rainfall and cascade dams with two sub indices hazard index and vulnerability index and one target index risk index based on the disaster system theory and risk assessment theory which uses a complete set of gis tools to achieve the visualization and allows assessing how flood risk would change corresponding to the changes in population climate and hydropower engineering construction this is an improvement over the conventional assessment method of basin wide flood risk influenced by a single flood disaster inducing factor a novel attempt to simultaneously consider the extreme rainfall and dam break as the two main types of basin flood disaster inducing factor to this specific field and more applicable to the objective reality of river basins which is liable to be threatened by the hydropower engineering failure caused floods in addition the important role played by the cascade reservoirs in flood control was discussed and represented by the basic and special coping capacity which were characterized by the indicators of flood control standard and flood routing coefficient of cascade dams in view of the basin hydropower development situation based on the ability to provide an overall flood risk assessment in heavily developed river basins and the guidance of disaster prevention and alleviation for the relatively prioritize risk areas the implementation of the developed framework in the dadu river basin shows significant potential and practical suitability the application of the assessment method represents only the beginning and depends on data availability indicator selection weighting and integration in which prominently affect the final classification therefore more efforts are needed to collect high precision indicator data and explore less contested and more scientific weighting mechanisms 6 conclusions river basin scale flood is a catastrophic disaster event to surrounding society and the environment to comprehensively assess and zoning the flood risk in heavily developed river basins is critical for making disaster prevention and alleviation plans in the light of various risk classified areas although there are many studies on flood risk in river basins the research for the integrated risk assessment of natural disaster dam downstream society system still needs to be further strengthened to fill these gaps in research this study designed to propose an integrated basin wide flood risk assessment and zonation method which has not been applied till date specifically speaking according to the natural disaster and risk assessment theories and basin flood disaster characteristics a flood risk index system with 14 indicators selected from the aspects of disaster inducing factors disaster forming environment exposure of receptors and coping capacity was built and used to characterize the hydrometeorology topography socioeconomic situation cascade reservoir features and flood control characteristics the application of the developed framework in the dadu river basin china has verified its practical suitability compared with previous researches the main novelty of the proposed integrated risk assessment method is that it widened up the selection scope of flood disaster inducing factors to incorporate the disaster inductivity of extreme rainfall caused flood and dam break flood and defined the coping capacity indicators of characterizing the flood control features of hydraulic engineering in addition to reflect the growing tendency of widening up the vulnerability concept the ability of human society and engineering systems to face disasters was incorporated in the framework as well specifically it takes advantage of the data of hydraulic engineering characteristic parameters to quantify the new addition of disaster inducing factors and components of coping capacity the novelty of this contribution is represented by three points 1 the method can combine indicator layers into a single composite index in the gis environment via a series of appropriate operations improved situations where data deficits originally limited evaluation of flash flood risk with high efficiency and flexibility this method thus will offer preferable assessment results with the support of high accuracy and abundant data 2 the proposed risk assessment framework considering multiple elements at risk and presenting floods more realistically is its ability to provide an overall assessment of flood risk wherein the delineation of flood risk prone areas is critical for making disaster prevention and alleviation plans it can be extended to evaluate the flood risk in other basins under three different scenarios no dam development combined with extreme precipitation changed dam development combined with no climate change and dam development combined with extreme precipitation changed 3 the generated flood hazard vulnerability and risk maps by the proposed method could provide insights into the identification of the spatial distribution of basin flood risk and for improving and innovating water and risk management practices and be a valuable guide for decision making regarding river basin flood management it can be adopted and extended in other river basins under similar potential flood threats based on areal features and data availability which provides a new way of basin wide flood risk assessment and theoretical guidance for flood risk mitigation the constructed assessment framework can obtain relatively good evaluation results based on the flood risk formation mechanism and simple operation processes and is intelligible reproducible and applicable in other river basins around the globe for other types of natural disasters credit authorship contribution statement yu chen conceptualization methodology

2861,common approaches for characterizing streambed architecture and its influence on groundwater surface water gw sw exchanges are generally limited by their invasiveness and low spatial sampling density which is a particular issue in streambeds that typically have high spatial heterogeneity combined dc resistivity and induced polarization dc ip imaging can provide rapid non invasive and continuous information on streambed lithology however its full potential remains unrealized leading to its underutilization for streambed investigations the objective of this study is to demonstrate the value of dc ip imaging in both 3d and high resolution for characterizing streambed architecture and interpretating gw sw exchange patterns the study focused on a 50 m long stream reach located in kintore ontario canada traditional methods streambed temperature mapping vertical head gradient measurements streambed porewater quality and sediment cores were used to qualitatively identify spatial gw sw exchanges underwater 3d dc ip surveying was then conducted across the stream reach to obtain high resolution distributions of resistivity and chargeability resistivity first identified three distinct zones along the stream reach zone 1 0 12 m and zone 3 38 50 m exhibits high resistivity 100 ohm m while zone 2 12 38 m exhibits relatively low resistivity 40 ohm m chargeability highly complements resistivity by confirming that the shallow streambed contains only non clayey materials therefore the more resistive zones 1 and 3 is attributed to more permeable coarse sand and gravel while the more conductive zone 2 is attributed to less permeable finer sand and consequently increased porewater ec due to longer residence times and hyporheic exchanges this geoelectrical interpretation is well supported by information from traditional methods e g higher temperature and hydraulic gradients correspond to the more permeable zone 1 and zone 3 this study demonstrates the unrealized value of spatially continuous high resolution dc ip information for mapping streambed architecture and its control on gw sw exchange patterns keywords streambed heterogeneity lithology

interactions play an important role for the water quantity water quality and ecosystem health in streams this includes for example maintaining baseflows temperature and oxygen regulation and the fate and transport of chemicals including nutrients both within and supplied to the stream from the aquifer gw sw exchange patterns in streams are dynamic and typically highly heterogeneous with exchange patterns varying on a scale of centimeters to meters schilling et al 2017 earon et al 2020 spatiotemporal variations in gw sw exchange patterns are driven by changing hydraulic head differences across the streambed over time and space and spatial variation in sediment hydraulic properties binley et al 2013 conant et al 2019 streambed lithology and physical hydraulic properties such as sediment surface area porosity and permeability influence hyporheic flow pathways and preferential flow pathways from the adjacent aquifer to the stream as well as the residence times and biogeochemical conditions along these pathways e g conant et al 2004 gu et al 2007 accurate mapping of streambed architecture can enhance the interpretation of the complex and heterogeneous gw sw exchange patterns

objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of high resolution centimeter scale 3d dc ip to characterize streambed architecture for improved interpretation of gw sw exchanges the study was conducted along a 50 m long headwater stream reach with a high resolution underwater 3d dc ip survey with corresponding measurements of temperature differences vertical head gradients and porewater sampling this study highlights the complementary benefits of combined dc and ip with ip more clearly describing mineralogy compared to dc resistivity which is influenced by variable porewater quality that may be caused by spatially varying groundwater flow paths residence times and geochemistry 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study area is a stream reach in the headwaters of kintore creek which is located within the thames river watershed in southwestern ontario canada fig 1 kintore creek is situated within the great lakes and st lawrence lowlands climatic region and is subjected to a mean annual precipitation of 1011 mm and minimum and maximum monthly temperatures of 5 6 c and 20 8 c respectively eccc 2021 agriculture is the dominant land use within kintore creek and phosphorus loads from this creek are expected to contribute to the high phosphorus loading to downstream lake erie the soil type in the area is primarily sandy loam and silty loam utrca 2017 and there is low regional topographic relief the regional hydrogeology including the hydraulic gradients are not well characterized but the stream reach used in this study was selected following a large scale longitudinal 222 radon tracer survey conducted during baseflow conditions along kintore creek that identified this reach to be groundwater gaining boreux et al 2019 in addition preliminary vertical head difference measurements indicated high variability in gw sw exchange patterns along the reach together with high concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous srp in the streambed porewater the stream reach is 50 m long x direction with a slight meander and its transverse widths vary from 1 2 m to 3 8 m y direction see fig 1 the mean annual stream stage was 0 21 m just downstream of the reach with minimum and maximum stream stage of 0 1 m and 0 47 m respectively recorded over the study period the surficial streambed sediments varied from fine sands to loose gravelly sand with larger cobbles present at the upstream section of the reach the land adjacent to the stream is used for agricultural crops corn with approximately 10 m wide riparian zones on both sides of the stream consisting of tall grasses and small trees with a steep 2 m decline in elevation at the stream banks 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 groundwater surface water exchange patterns spatial high resolution temperature mapping of the shallow streambed and stream water was conducted for qualitative evaluation of the gw sw exchange patterns along and across the stream temperature mapping was conducted during baseflow conditions in summer july 2 2020 and winter march 8 2021 when temperature contrasts between the groundwater and stream water are largest i e groundwater is colder in summer warmer in winter temperatures throughout the streambed at a consistent depth of 0 1 m were measured by inserting a high accuracy thermometer checktemp 1 digital thermometer hanna instruments into the streambed and held until the temperature stabilized streambed temperatures were measured along a 2d surface grid consisting of 36 transverse lines at 1 m offsets between x distances of 5 m and 40 m along the stream reach fig 1 with temperature measurements of streambed and stream water measured at 0 2 m spacings along each line both summer and winter surveys were completed within a 3 hour period to limit the variation in the diurnal stream water temperature and ensure an accurate characterization of temperature contrasts between the streambed and stream water a total of 339 and 358 measurements were recorded in the summer and winter surveys respectively with kriging interpolation employed to generate continuous 2d spatial maps of the difference in temperature between streambed and stream water vertical head differences were measured between the shallow groundwater and stream water at 26 locations distributed along the reach fig 1 measurements were made using a potentio manometer attached to a drive point piezometer with a screen length of 0 1 m that was installed 0 2 m below the streambed surface positive head differences indicate groundwater upwelling flow groundwater discharge and negative head differences indicate groundwater downwelling stream recharge additional measurements were attempted between 28 m and 36 m but it was not possible to draw sufficient groundwater into the tubing likely a result of low hydraulic conductivity conditions 2 2 2 streambed porewater collection and analyses multi level samplers and dedicated tip samplers were installed at nine locations along the stream reach as indicated in fig 1 these samplers were installed at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m below the streambed surface four 1 8 m long pvc piezometers were also installed at distances of 10 m and 25 m along the stream with one piezometer on the east bank and one on the west bank each piezometer had a 15 cm slotted screen at the bottom with all piezometers installed to approximately 0 95 m to 1 1 m below the surface porewater samples were collected approximately monthly between june 2020 and june 2021 using a peristaltic pump samples from well flowing samplers and the piezometers were analyzed immediately in the field for electrical conductivity ec and ph using a handheld multiparameter probe either hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter or ysi 650 multiparameter meter porewater from each sampler was filtered in the field using 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters and stored in 30 ml and 15 ml hdpe bottles samples for metal analysis were acidified using concentrated 15 6 m nitric acid and stored in a cooler while in the field and for transportation to western university dissolved concentrations of iron fe manganese mn and aluminum al were determined using a flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas instrument 141 agilent 200 series vga 77 for this analysis qa qc measures were used including standard dilutions on every sample run and duplicate standards and duplicate samples run every 5 10 samples 2 2 3 dc ip imaging 2 2 3 1 theory dc resistivity measures the electrical resistivity distribution of the streambed while ip measures the corresponding chargeability chargeability is the degree to which the subsurface can store electrical charge via diffusion polarization mechanisms at mineral grain pore fluid interfaces in this context this is usually via accumulation of local charge gradients in the electrical double layer edl of clayey minerals the so called membrane polarization slater and lesmes 2002 as chargeability is a measure of the ip effect and sensitive to both the bulk conduction through the pore space i e pore fluid chemistry and surface polarization i e lithology a normalized chargeability mn can be attained by dividing the inverted chargeability m by the inverted electrical resistivity ρ normalized chargeability is independent of bulk conduction effects and better distinguishes the ip effect due to lithology only it has been widely used in various geoenvironmental studies including the detection of various materials such as clays e g amaya et al 2016 slater and lesmes 2002 and sulfidic minerals e g power et al 2018 2 2 3 2 survey design a 2d surface grid consisting of 10 parallel longitudinal lines with an interline spacing of 0 2 m was used to perform the 3d dc ip survey for characterization of the streambed architecture see fig 1 in august 2020 each line had an inline electrode spacing of 0 2 m requiring a total of 240 electrodes to obtain a survey length of 47 8 m as a 48 electrode resistivity meter was used the roll along survey method was employed to capture each survey line through nine smaller successive segments with 24 electrodes being moved for each segment to ensure 50 overlap loke et al 2014 small stainless steel electrodes 0 02 m were gently placed along the surface of the streambed sediment and weighted to ensure submersion the depth of stream water at each electrode was then measured forward and inverse modelling of dc ip surveys in hypothetical streams confirmed that submerged electrodes provide higher resolution than floating electrodes due to the reduction of current leakage to the stream channel e g crook et al 2008 in total the dc ip survey employed 2400 electrodes to capture a 3d streambed volume with a length of 47 8 m width of 1 8 m and depth of 1 5 m table 1 presents a summary of the dc ip survey parameters the streambed surface topography along the stream reach was also mapped in august 2020 using a total station topcon gts 239 w a larger 3d dc ip survey was also performed across the riparian zone to image the general geological structure surrounding the stream this survey is detailed in supplementary material 2 2 3 3 data acquisition a multi channel syscal pro switch 48 resistivity meter iris instruments france was used to record the distribution of apparent resistivity raw dc data and apparent chargeability raw ip data this instrument allows for high productivity measurements with a precision of 0 2 and threshold voltage of 1 μv the system features an internal switching board for 48 electrodes and an internal 250 w power source the dipole dipole array exhibits high lateral and vertical resolution and was used to measure the dc and ip data however since it can be sensitive to noise the multi gradient array which has a higher signal to noise ratio but lower resolution dahlin and zhou 2004 was also used to assess the reliability of dipole dipole data and assist its interpretation the acquisition time for resistivity measurements was 0 5 s while it was 2 s for chargeability due to the long measurement times associated with ip data chargeability was only acquired with the dipole dipole array and with less measurements than the corresponding resistivity data i e 931 vs 1194 see table 1 at each electrode location strong ground coupling was attained ground resistance 1kilo ohm which is particularly necessary for high quality ip measurements e g power et al 2018 2 2 3 4 data processing and inversion the apparent resistivity and apparent chargeability data were first processed with bin2ip which is a matlab based data filtering program by nivorlis 2017 each measurement was first assessed on its signal to noise ratio with low signal and extreme value measurements removed the standard deviation of resistance was then used to assess and filter out measurements with significant errors instead of simply using the single intrinsic chargeability value based on the integral below the ip decay curve all 20 ip time windows were assessed noting i the first two and last five time windows were ignored and ii measurements with erratic or non montonic decay curves were removed e g power et al 2018 the construction of subsurface images from dc and ip data is a nonlinear inverse problem with the goal of recovering the model resistivity and chargeability that reproduces the recorded raw data in this study the recorded dc ip data summarized in table 1 were inverted with dc 3dpro an iterative least squares smoothness constrained inversion program kim 2016 the elevation at each electrode location in the stream reach was incorporated into the inversion all inversions were run to a maximum of seven iterations showing good convergence with low root mean square rms error for the dc data both dipole dipole and multi gradient arrays produced good data quality and inversion images with similar subsurface resistivity distributions while both datasets were assessed for improved interpretation only the dipole dipole results are presented in section 3 the ip data dipole dipole only exhibited good data quality with the bin2ip program only filtering out approximately 12 of the total amount of measurements finally normalized chargeability was calculated by dividing the inverting chargeability by the inverted resistivity 2 2 4 streambed sediment coring after all sampling and surveying was completed sediment cores were extracted adjacent to the nine porewater sampler locations to assess streambed architecture and its potential influence on associated gw sw exchange patterns a 5 7 cm diameter ams soil auger ams inc usa was used to extract cores to a depth of 0 5 m at each location the cores were then logged to assess the lithology sediment 500 g from each lithological layer identified in the cores was subsampled and sieved to produce grain size distributions 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater stream water interactions 3 1 1 streambed temperature differences spatial maps of the temperature differences between the streambed sediments 0 1 m depth and the stream water measured during summer and winter baseflow conditions fig 2 a and 2b respectively can reveal patterns of gw sw exchange given that groundwater is typically colder and warmer than the stream water in summer and winter respectively during summer the stream water was warmer than the streambed with temperature differences between the stream water and streambed ranging from 0 8 c to 7 3 c accordingly areas with larger positive temperature differences blue regions in fig 2a can be used to infer higher upwelling of colder groundwater to the streambed and stream during winter the stream water was colder than the streambed and the temperature difference ranged from 5 4 c to 1 9 c areas with larger negative differences blue regions in fig 2b infer higher upwelling of warmer groundwater it is noted that linear patterns exist at some locations along the stream reach e g 22 m in fig 2b which is possibly a measurement artefact related to the timing of the stream water measurements the spatial patterns evident in the summer and winter temperature maps are similar suggesting consistent gw sw exchange patterns along and across the stream reach during baseflow regardless of season the temperature maps show three distinct zones along the stream reach zone 1 from 0 m to 13 m zone 2 from 13 m to 36 m and zone 3 from 36 m to 40 m fig 2 the maps show large temperature differences across the full stream width in zone 1 4 c difference in summer 1 5 c difference in winter indicating groundwater upwelling the temperature differences are generally low across zone 2 2 5 c in summer 0 c in winter indicating minimal groundwater upwelling or possible stream water downwelling small areas with higher temperature differences between 17 m and 25 m occur in zone 2 suggesting some groundwater upwelling may occur at isolated locations across this zone finally larger temperature differences were observed in zone 3 4 c in summer 1 c gradient 0 c in winter indicating groundwater upwelling with higher temperature differences observed and therefore higher groundwater upwelling occurring on the east side of the stream 3 1 2 vertical hydraulic differences the vertical hydraulic differences measured between the streambed and stream water are shown in the bubble plot in fig 2c and are generally consistent with the streambed temperature mapping these provide evidence of the likely direction of water flow into or out of the shallow sediments but the actual water fluxes will depend on the sediment permeability in addition to the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient increasing bubble size is indicative of increasing gradient positive vertical head differences blue indicate potential groundwater upwelling whereas negative vertical head differences yellow indicate possible surface water downwelling large positive differences groundwater upwelling occur at 10 m 11 m and 37 m which correlate to the zones of groundwater upwelling inferred from the temperature differences zone 1 and zone 3 in fig 2a and 2b negative head differences stream water to groundwater exchange occur between 17 m and 23 m in zone 2 suggesting possible surface water downwelling also in zone 2 the differences change between positive and negative which possibly indicate hyporheic flow patterns linked to streambed topography these changes correlate to the low and high temperature differences in fig 2a and 2b e g low to high temperature change at 18 m at all other locations negligible head differences exist that suggest zones of minimal groundwater upwelling 3 1 3 streambed porewater quality porewater ec a c and dissolved iron concentrations d f from porewater samples installed along the centerline of the stream are shown in the bubble plots in fig 3 data is shown for the three sampling events completed in the fall of 2020 as these sampling events correspond to the timing of the dc ip surveys increasing color intensity and bubble size is indicative of increasing ec and iron concentration in zone 1 ec and iron is relatively uniform with depth across all sampling events with cumulative median values of 605 μs cm interquartile range iqr 22 μs cm n 12 and 0 08 mg l iqr 0 03 mg l n 9 respectively zone 3 is similar with ec and iron having median values of 655 μs cm iqr 84 μs cm n 6 and 5 mg l iqr 5 mg l n 5 respectively in contrast ec and iron were larger in zone 2 with median values of 922 μs cm iqr 459 μs cm n 28 and 12 mg l iqr 18 mg l n 71 respectively while it was not possible to measure porewater ec at depths 0 1 m below the streambed surface due to the low sample volumes obtained the deeper iron data exhibits even higher concentrations this suggests that ec if measured would also have been high up to a depth of 0 5 m this is also supported by the concentrations of other inorganic compounds including sulfate mn and al not shown the groundwater sampled from the four piezometers on the stream bank were found to have cumulative median ec and iron values of 634 μs cm iqr 77 μs cm n 6 and 0 16 mg l iqr 0 34 mg l n 3 respectively for the three sampling events in the fall of 2020 this indicates that the chemistry of the shallow incoming groundwater is similar to the porewater in the shallow streambed in zones 1 and 3 whereas the ec and iron concentration of porewater in the shallow streambed in zone 2 is considerably higher which may be due to longer residence times and sediment aqueous interactions using these traditional sampling approaches we obtain a sense of the general spatial patterns of gw sw exchanges along the stream reach however we do not have a good idea on the magnitude of the fluxes and what role does the streambed material and architecture play high resolution spatially connected information from dc ip imaging may be able to provide greater insight into these questions 3 2 dc ip imaging 3 2 1 stream reach to make the initial interpretation easier 2d cross sectional slices were first extracted from the 3d inverted domains of resistivity and chargeability fig 4 a and 4b present the 2d resistivity cross sections at transverse distances of 0 4 m and 1 2 m respectively aligning with lines s3 and s7 see fig 1 the white dotted line indicates the surface of the streambed while the x distance and depth of the extracted soil cores within the stream reach are indicated by grey boxes the top layer of low resistivity 20 ohm m above white dotted line represents the stream water and corresponds to the measured stream water resistivity of 17 ohm m the streambed resistivity distributions indicate three distinct zones along the stream reach which coincide with the three zones identified above based on the temperature mapping and vertical head difference measurements within the uppermost 0 8 m very high resistivity 400 ohm m exists from 0 m to 13 m zone 1 and 36 m to 48 m zone 3 though zone 3 exhibits more variability across the stream width i e west side exhibits low to moderate resistivity while the east side exhibits very high resistivity the top 0 8 m between 13 m and 36 m zone 2 comprises highly heterogeneous material with predominantly low to moderate resistivity blue to green with some areas of very low 20 ohm m and high 400 ohm m resistivity the resistivity suggests this zone consists of highly heterogeneous soils with centimeter scale changes below a depth of 0 8 m a discontinuous layer of low resistivity blue 40 ohm m interspersed with high resistivity purple 400 ohm m is evident the bulk resistivity in fig 4 includes contributions from both porewater water quality porosity saturation and grain surface conduction mineralogy archie 1942 therefore while the high resistivity areas shallow zones 1 and 3 parts of zone 2 likely represent coarser sediment materials with low porewater ec the low resistivity zones in fig 4 could be caused by high porewater ec and or conductive clay rich materials this is where chargeability can provide valuable and complementary information the corresponding normalized chargeability images lines s3 and s7 shown in fig 5 indicate that the uppermost 0 8 m exhibits low chargeability with isolated pockets of high chargeability e g 14 m and 28 m this means that the low resistivity in zone 2 is likely influenced by high porewater ec rather than clayey materials below 0 8 m depth larger zones of high chargeability an indication of clay sediment materials are interspersed amongst the generally low chargeability material joint interpretation of resistivity and chargeability from the combined dc ip survey infers that the uppermost 0 8 m in the streambed contains non clayey materials such as sands and gravel these materials span a small range of porosity i e 0 25 to 0 4 with variability related to grain size and uniformity i e higher uniformity equals higher porosity as the pore space is always fully saturated the variability of resistivity in fig 4 may be related to variable porewater ec along the stream reach for example the lower resistivity values in zone 2 relative to zones 1 and 3 indicates that the porewater in the top 0 8 m below the streambed surface is more conductive in this zone of the stream reach furthermore the porewater in the top 0 8 m below the streambed surface of zone 2 is more conductive than the deeper porewater approximately 0 8 m depth suggesting that if groundwater is upwelling in this zone its ec is changing as the porewater travels towards the stream i e slower flow longer residence times alternately much of the deeper groundwater might be bypassing around the shallow low permeability sediments in this zone this interpretation is supported by the measured porewater ec in fig 3 where porewater is consistently more conductive in zone 2 median 922 μs cm or 10 ohm m than zone 1 and zone 3 median 605 μs cm or 17 ohm m the 3d domain for resistivity and normalized chargeability respectively are provided in fig 6 a and 6b a horizontal depth slice is presented at 0 2 m below the stream water surface to coincide with the approximate streambed surface while the 2d lines in fig 4a and 5a capture the general zones along the stream reach fig 6a identifies the highly variable resistivity distribution across the stream width highlighting the value of high resolution continuous 3d imaging in heterogeneous streambeds fig 6a also presents 3d isovolumes of higher resistivity 250 ohm m to indicate the areas of high resistivity across the full depth which mainly exist throughout zone 1 and the east side of zone 3 fig 6b confirms that the chargeable clayey zones 0 6 ms m mostly exist at larger greater depths below the streambed surface the streambed architecture identified by 3d dc ip corresponds to the spatial gw sw exchange patterns identified by the temperature and vertical head differences in fig 2 the higher resistivity in zone 1 and zone 3 indicates more permeable gravelly sand materials which correlate to the areas of groundwater upwelling and explains why strong upward gradients there are associated with large temperature differences i e gives large upward groundwater flux for example zone 3 exhibits low resistivity on the west side with high resistivity on the east side as shown in fig 6a which directly supports the gw sw exchange conditions of upwelling only occurring on the east side see fig 2a furthermore the more clayey material existing below 0 8 m depth in these zones may be constraining groundwater adjacent to the stream reach from flowing deeper instead driving greater upward flux and shorter residence times in contrast the low to moderate resistivity in zone 2 infers fine grained non clayey material that correlates to the little to no upwelling and possible stream water downwelling shown in fig 2 the centimeter scale changes identified in figs 4 to 6 highlight the value of doing full continuous 3d imaging compared to irregular and sparsely located 2d lines that can miss important features such as zones of high permeability and potential groundwater discharge windows for example zone 2 did contain a distinct area of high resistivity at 19 m see fig 4a which matched the isolated areas of large temperature difference and groundwater upwelling within zone 2 see fig 3 furthermore the complementary information provided by combined dc ip was extremely beneficial to discriminate between soil types particularly clays from fine sands the spatial patterns identified within the stream reach extended into the larger 3d dc ip survey that was also performed across the riparian zones on each side of the stream the results of this survey are detailed in supplementary material 3 2 2 comparison with sediment core data fig 7 summarizes the soil classification with depth for each 0 5 m deep soil core extracted from the streambed all locations consist of soils ranging from fine sand to sandy gravel with a maximum of 7 fines silt clay the cores at 10 m zone 1 and 38 m zone 3 are characterized by coarse sand and gravel which generally have lower porosity but higher hydraulic conductivity thereby explaining the high resistivity in these areas i e lower porosity higher resistivity and larger gw sw exchange patterns at all central locations zone 2 the cores are characterized by fine to medium sands that typically have higher porosity but lower hydraulic conductivity this explains the low resistivity measurements and higher porewater ec which may be caused by higher residences times providing longer time scales for aqueous sediment interactions including mineral dissolution and organic matter mineralization 4 conclusions this study assessed the potential of combined dc resistivity and induced polarization dc ip geophysical imaging for improving the characterization of streambeds and better understanding of associated gw sw exchange patterns in streams streambeds can be highly heterogeneous and traditional techniques are invasive costly and provide sparsely distributed point information while standalone 2d dc resistivity imaging has been used for mapping streambeds the full value of combined dc ip remains unrealized high resolution 3d dc ip surveys were conducted at a headwater stream reach in kintore in southwestern ontario canada traditional techniques were first employed to characterize the stream reach with temperature and vertical hydraulic head difference measurements used to assess gw sw exchanges and pore water sampling defining the variability of porewater quality within the stream reach three distinct zones along the stream reach were identified 1 upstream zone with high groundwater upwelling 2 middle zone with little to no upwelling but higher porewater ec and 3 downstream zone with groundwater upwelling particularly on the east side of the stream the inverted 3d distributions of resistivity and chargeability revealed the composition within the streambed highly complementing and enhancing the initial interpretation of the gw sw exchange patterns chargeability measurements suggested that no clayey material exists within the uppermost 0 8 m of the streambed which was confirmed by sediment coring indicating that the corresponding resistivity measurements were only influenced by porewater quality and porosity the upstream and downstream zones exhibited high resistivity indicating coarse permeable material that is allowing groundwater upwelling which is supported by the similarity in water quality within the aquifer streambed and stream in contrast the middle zone exhibited much lower resistivity indicative of fine grained less permeable material that can resist groundwater upwelling the porewater ec within the streambed was elevated which may be caused by longer residence times and more hyporheic exchange the variation throughout the stream reach was on the centimeter scale which is typical of many streambeds this study highlighted the value of full continuous 3d imaging compared to previous studies that typically used irregular and sparsely located 2d lines that can miss important features such as pockets of highly permeable material and potential groundwater discharge furthermore the complementary information provided by combined dc ip specifically resistivity and normalized chargeability was highly valuable to improve lithological interpretation and its influence on gw sw exchanges although this study involved a mostly non clayey streambed the chargeability data were still valuable to confirm the absence of clayey material and that bulk resistivity was mostly influenced by porewater quality overall this study demonstrates that combined dc ip can be a valuable non invasive site tool for streambed and gw sw investigations dc ip can be highly complementary to traditional techniques to improve characterization of streambed heterogeneity and interpretation of associated gw sw exchange patterns such high resolution continuous information can be used as more realistic inputs to numerical models or geostatistical framework it is recommended that dc ip imaging be performed first to optimize subsequent field monitoring programs including the choice and location of sampling methods furthermore the dc ip instrumentation could be left in place and used for time lapse monitoring of gw sw exchanges over time 5 authorship contribution statement kyle robinson methodology formal analysis investigation writing review editing visualization clare robinson

2861,common approaches for characterizing streambed architecture and its influence on groundwater surface water gw sw exchanges are generally limited by their invasiveness and low spatial sampling density which is a particular issue in streambeds that typically have high spatial heterogeneity combined dc resistivity and induced polarization dc ip imaging can provide rapid non invasive and continuous information on streambed lithology however its full potential remains unrealized leading to its underutilization for streambed investigations the objective of this study is to demonstrate the value of dc ip imaging in both 3d and high resolution for characterizing streambed architecture and interpretating gw sw exchange patterns the study focused on a 50 m long stream reach located in kintore ontario canada traditional methods streambed temperature mapping vertical head gradient measurements streambed porewater quality and sediment cores were used to qualitatively identify spatial gw sw exchanges underwater 3d dc ip surveying was then conducted across the stream reach to obtain high resolution distributions of resistivity and chargeability resistivity first identified three distinct zones along the stream reach zone 1 0 12 m and zone 3 38 50 m exhibits high resistivity 100 ohm m while zone 2 12 38 m exhibits relatively low resistivity 40 ohm m chargeability highly complements resistivity by confirming that the shallow streambed contains only non clayey materials therefore the more resistive zones 1 and 3 is attributed to more permeable coarse sand and gravel while the more conductive zone 2 is attributed to less permeable finer sand and consequently increased porewater ec due to longer residence times and hyporheic exchanges this geoelectrical interpretation is well supported by information from traditional methods e g higher temperature and hydraulic gradients correspond to the more permeable zone 1 and zone 3 this study demonstrates the

interactions play an important role for the water quantity water quality and ecosystem health in streams this includes for example maintaining baseflows temperature and oxygen regulation and the fate and transport of chemicals including nutrients both within and supplied to the stream from the aquifer gw sw exchange patterns in streams are dynamic and typically highly heterogeneous with exchange patterns varying on a scale of centimeters to meters schilling et al 2017 earon et al 2020 spatiotemporal variations in gw sw exchange patterns are driven by changing hydraulic head differences across the streambed over time and space and spatial variation in sediment hydraulic properties binley et al 2013 conant et al 2019 streambed lithology and physical hydraulic properties such as sediment

objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of high resolution centimeter scale 3d dc ip to characterize streambed architecture for improved interpretation of gw sw exchanges the study was conducted along a 50 m long headwater stream reach with a high resolution underwater 3d dc ip survey with corresponding measurements of temperature differences vertical head gradients and porewater sampling this study highlights the complementary benefits of combined dc and ip with ip more clearly describing mineralogy compared to dc resistivity which is influenced by variable porewater quality that may be caused by spatially varying groundwater flow paths residence times and geochemistry 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study area is a stream reach in the headwaters of kintore creek which is located within the thames river watershed in southwestern ontario canada fig 1 kintore creek is situated within the great lakes and st lawrence lowlands climatic region and is subjected to a mean annual precipitation of 1011 mm and minimum and maximum monthly temperatures of 5 6 c and 20 8 c respectively eccc 2021 agriculture is the dominant land use within kintore creek and phosphorus loads from this creek are expected to contribute to the high phosphorus loading to downstream lake erie the soil type in the area is primarily sandy loam and silty loam utrca 2017 and there is low regional topographic relief the regional hydrogeology including the hydraulic gradients are not well characterized but the stream reach used in this study was selected following a large scale longitudinal 222 radon tracer survey conducted during baseflow conditions along kintore creek that identified this reach to be groundwater gaining boreux et al 2019 in addition preliminary vertical head difference measurements indicated high variability in gw sw exchange patterns along the reach together with high concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorous srp in the streambed porewater the stream reach is 50 m long x direction with a slight meander and its transverse widths vary from 1 2 m to 3 8 m y direction see fig 1 the mean annual stream stage was 0 21 m just downstream of the reach with minimum and maximum stream stage of 0 1 m and 0 47 m respectively recorded over the study period the surficial streambed sediments varied from fine sands to loose gravelly sand with larger cobbles present at the upstream section of the reach the land adjacent to the stream is used for agricultural crops corn with approximately 10 m wide riparian zones on both sides of the stream consisting of tall grasses and small trees with a steep 2 m decline in elevation at the stream banks 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 groundwater surface water exchange patterns spatial high resolution temperature mapping of the shallow streambed and stream water was conducted for qualitative evaluation of the gw sw exchange patterns along and across the stream temperature mapping was conducted during baseflow conditions in summer july 2 2020 and winter march 8 2021 when temperature contrasts between the groundwater and stream water are largest i e groundwater is colder in summer warmer in winter temperatures throughout the streambed at a consistent depth of 0 1 m were measured by inserting a high accuracy thermometer checktemp 1 digital thermometer hanna instruments into the streambed and held until the temperature stabilized streambed temperatures were measured along a 2d surface grid consisting of 36 transverse lines at 1 m offsets between x distances of 5 m and 40 m along the stream reach fig 1 with temperature measurements of streambed and stream water measured at 0 2 m spacings along each line both summer and winter surveys were completed within a 3 hour period to limit the variation in the diurnal stream water temperature and ensure an accurate characterization of temperature contrasts between the streambed and stream water a total of 339 and 358 measurements were recorded in the summer and winter surveys respectively with kriging interpolation employed to generate continuous 2d spatial maps of the difference in temperature between streambed and stream water vertical head differences were measured between the shallow groundwater and stream water at 26 locations distributed along the reach fig 1 measurements were made using a potentio manometer attached to a drive point piezometer with a screen length of 0 1 m that was installed 0 2 m below the streambed surface positive head differences indicate groundwater upwelling flow groundwater discharge and negative head differences indicate groundwater downwelling stream recharge additional measurements were attempted between 28 m and 36 m but it was not possible to draw sufficient groundwater into the tubing likely a result of low hydraulic conductivity conditions 2 2 2 streambed porewater collection and analyses multi level samplers and dedicated tip samplers were installed at nine locations along the stream reach as indicated in fig 1 these samplers were installed at depths of 0 1 m 0 2 m 0 3 m and 0 4 m below the streambed surface four 1 8 m long pvc piezometers were also installed at distances of 10 m and 25 m along the stream with one piezometer on the east bank and one on the west bank each piezometer had a 15 cm slotted screen at the bottom with all piezometers installed to approximately 0 95 m to 1 1 m below the surface porewater samples were collected approximately monthly between june 2020 and june 2021 using a peristaltic pump samples from well flowing samplers and the piezometers were analyzed immediately in the field for electrical conductivity ec and ph using a handheld multiparameter probe either hach hq40d portable multi parameter meter or ysi 650 multiparameter meter porewater from each sampler was filtered in the field using 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filters and stored in 30 ml and 15 ml hdpe bottles samples for metal analysis were acidified using concentrated 15 6 m nitric acid and stored in a cooler while in the field and for transportation to western university dissolved concentrations of iron fe manganese mn and aluminum al were determined using a flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas instrument 141 agilent 200 series vga 77 for this analysis qa qc measures were used including standard dilutions on every sample run and duplicate standards and duplicate samples run every 5 10 samples 2 2 3 dc ip imaging 2 2 3 1 theory dc resistivity measures the electrical resistivity distribution of the streambed while ip measures the corresponding chargeability chargeability is the degree to which the subsurface can store electrical charge via diffusion polarization mechanisms at mineral grain pore fluid interfaces in this context this is usually via accumulation of local charge gradients in the electrical double layer edl of clayey minerals the so called membrane polarization slater and lesmes 2002 as chargeability is a measure of the ip effect and sensitive to both the bulk conduction through the pore space i e pore fluid chemistry and surface polarization i e lithology a normalized chargeability mn can be attained by dividing the inverted chargeability m by the inverted electrical resistivity ρ normalized chargeability is independent of bulk conduction effects and better distinguishes the ip effect due to lithology only it has been widely used in various geoenvironmental studies including the detection of various materials such as clays e g amaya et al 2016 slater and lesmes 2002 and sulfidic minerals e g power et al 2018 2 2 3 2 survey design a 2d surface grid consisting of 10 parallel longitudinal lines with an interline spacing of 0 2 m was used to perform the 3d dc ip survey for characterization of the streambed architecture see fig 1 in august 2020 each line had an inline electrode spacing of 0 2 m requiring a total of 240 electrodes to obtain a survey length of 47 8 m as a 48 electrode resistivity meter was used the roll along survey method was employed to capture each survey line through nine smaller successive segments with 24 electrodes being moved for each segment to ensure 50 overlap loke et al 2014 small stainless steel electrodes 0 02 m were gently placed along the surface of the streambed sediment and weighted to ensure submersion the depth of stream water at each electrode was then measured forward and inverse modelling of dc ip surveys in hypothetical streams confirmed that submerged electrodes provide higher resolution than floating electrodes due to the reduction of current leakage to the stream channel e g crook et al 2008 in total the dc ip survey employed 2400 electrodes to capture a 3d streambed volume with a length of 47 8 m width of 1 8 m and depth of 1 5 m table 1 presents a summary of the dc ip survey parameters the streambed surface topography along the stream reach was also mapped in august 2020 using a total station topcon gts 239 w a larger 3d dc ip survey was also performed across the riparian zone to image the general geological structure surrounding the stream this survey is detailed in supplementary material 2 2 3 3 data acquisition a multi channel syscal pro switch 48 resistivity meter iris instruments france was used to record the distribution of apparent resistivity raw dc data and apparent chargeability raw ip data this instrument allows for high productivity measurements with a precision of 0 2 and threshold voltage of 1 μv the system features an internal switching board for 48 electrodes and an internal 250 w power source the dipole dipole array exhibits high lateral and vertical resolution and was used to measure the dc and ip data however since it can be sensitive to noise the multi gradient array which has a higher signal to noise ratio but lower resolution dahlin and zhou 2004 was also used to assess the reliability of dipole dipole data and assist its interpretation the acquisition time for resistivity measurements was 0 5 s while it was 2 s for chargeability due to the long measurement times associated with ip data chargeability was only acquired with the dipole dipole array and with less measurements than the corresponding resistivity data i e 931 vs 1194 see table 1 at each electrode location strong ground coupling was attained ground resistance 1kilo ohm which is particularly necessary for high quality ip measurements e g power et al 2018 2 2 3 4 data processing and inversion the apparent resistivity and apparent chargeability data were first processed with bin2ip which is a matlab based data filtering program by nivorlis 2017 each measurement was first assessed on its signal to noise ratio with low signal and extreme value measurements removed the standard deviation of resistance was then used to assess and filter out measurements with significant errors instead of simply using the single intrinsic chargeability value based on the integral below the ip decay curve all 20 ip time windows were assessed noting i the first two and last five time windows were ignored and ii measurements with erratic or non montonic decay curves were removed e g power et al 2018 the construction of subsurface images from dc and ip data is a nonlinear inverse problem with the goal of recovering the model resistivity and chargeability that reproduces the recorded raw data in this study the recorded dc ip data summarized in table 1 were inverted with dc 3dpro an iterative least squares smoothness constrained inversion program kim 2016 the elevation at each electrode location in the stream reach was incorporated into the inversion all inversions were run to a maximum of seven iterations showing good convergence with low root mean square rms error for the dc data both dipole dipole and multi gradient arrays produced good data quality and inversion images with similar subsurface resistivity distributions while both datasets were assessed for improved interpretation only the dipole dipole results are presented in section 3 the ip data dipole dipole only exhibited good data quality with the bin2ip program only filtering out approximately 12 of the total amount of measurements finally normalized chargeability was calculated by dividing the inverting chargeability by the inverted resistivity 2 2 4 streambed sediment coring after all sampling and surveying was completed sediment cores were extracted adjacent to the nine porewater sampler locations to assess streambed architecture and its potential influence on associated gw sw exchange patterns a 5 7 cm diameter ams soil auger ams inc usa was used to extract cores to a depth of 0 5 m at each location the cores were then logged to assess the lithology sediment 500 g from each lithological layer identified in the cores was subsampled and sieved to produce grain size distributions 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater stream water interactions 3 1 1 streambed temperature differences spatial maps of the temperature differences between the streambed sediments 0 1 m depth and the stream water measured during summer and winter baseflow conditions fig 2 a and 2b respectively can reveal patterns of gw sw exchange given that groundwater is typically colder and warmer than the stream water in summer and winter respectively during summer the stream water was warmer than the streambed with temperature differences between the stream water and streambed ranging from 0 8 c to 7 3 c accordingly areas with larger positive temperature differences blue regions in fig 2a can be used to infer higher upwelling of colder groundwater to the streambed and stream during winter the stream water was colder than the streambed and the temperature difference ranged from 5 4 c to 1 9 c areas with larger negative differences blue regions in fig 2b infer higher upwelling of warmer groundwater it is noted that linear patterns exist at some locations along the stream reach e g 22 m in fig 2b which is possibly a measurement artefact related to the timing of the stream water measurements the spatial patterns evident in the summer and winter temperature maps are similar suggesting consistent gw sw exchange patterns along and across the stream reach during baseflow regardless of season the temperature maps show three distinct zones along the stream reach zone 1 from 0 m to 13 m zone 2 from 13 m to 36 m and zone 3 from 36 m to 40 m fig 2 the maps show large temperature differences across the full stream width in zone 1 4 c difference in summer 1 5 c difference in winter indicating groundwater upwelling the temperature differences are generally low across zone 2 2 5 c in summer 0 c in winter indicating minimal groundwater upwelling or possible stream water downwelling small areas with higher temperature differences between 17 m and 25 m occur in zone 2 suggesting some groundwater upwelling may occur at isolated locations across this zone finally larger temperature differences were observed in zone 3 4 c in summer 1 c gradient 0 c in winter indicating groundwater upwelling with higher temperature differences observed and therefore higher groundwater upwelling occurring on the east side of the stream 3 1 2 vertical hydraulic differences the vertical hydraulic differences measured between the streambed and stream water are shown in the bubble plot in fig 2c and are generally consistent with the streambed temperature mapping these provide evidence of the likely direction of water flow into or out of the shallow sediments but the actual water fluxes will depend on the sediment permeability in addition to the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient increasing bubble size is indicative of increasing gradient positive vertical head differences blue indicate potential groundwater upwelling whereas negative vertical head differences yellow indicate possible surface water downwelling large positive differences groundwater upwelling occur at 10 m 11 m and 37 m which correlate to the zones of groundwater upwelling inferred from the temperature differences zone 1 and zone 3 in fig 2a and 2b negative head differences stream water to groundwater exchange occur between 17 m and 23 m in zone 2 suggesting possible surface water downwelling also in zone 2 the differences change between positive and negative which possibly indicate hyporheic flow patterns linked to streambed topography these changes correlate to the low and high temperature differences in fig 2a and 2b e g low to high temperature change at 18 m at all other locations negligible head differences exist that suggest zones of minimal groundwater upwelling 3 1 3 streambed porewater quality porewater ec a c and dissolved iron concentrations d f from porewater samples installed along the centerline of the stream are shown in the bubble plots in fig 3 data is shown for the three sampling events completed in the fall of 2020 as these sampling events correspond to the timing of the dc ip surveys increasing color intensity and bubble size is indicative of increasing ec and iron concentration in zone 1 ec and iron is relatively uniform with depth across all sampling events with cumulative median values of 605 μs cm interquartile range iqr 22 μs cm n 12 and 0 08 mg l iqr 0 03 mg l n 9 respectively zone 3 is similar with ec and iron having median values of 655 μs cm iqr 84 μs cm n 6 and 5 mg l iqr 5 mg l n 5 respectively in contrast ec and iron were larger in zone 2 with median values of 922 μs cm iqr 459 μs cm n 28 and 12 mg l iqr 18 mg l n 71 respectively while it was not possible to measure porewater ec at depths 0 1 m below the streambed surface due to the low sample volumes obtained the deeper iron data exhibits even higher concentrations this suggests that ec if measured would also have been high up to a depth of 0 5 m this is also supported by the concentrations of other inorganic compounds including sulfate mn and al not shown the groundwater sampled from the four piezometers on the stream bank were found to have cumulative median ec and iron values of 634 μs cm iqr 77 μs cm n 6 and 0 16 mg l iqr 0 34 mg l n 3 respectively for the three sampling events in the fall of 2020 this indicates that the chemistry of the shallow incoming groundwater is similar to the porewater in the shallow streambed in zones 1 and 3 whereas the ec and iron concentration of porewater in the shallow streambed in zone 2 is considerably higher which may be due to longer residence times and sediment aqueous interactions using these traditional sampling approaches we obtain a sense of the general spatial patterns of gw sw exchanges along the stream reach however we do not have a good idea on the magnitude of the fluxes and what role does the streambed material and architecture play high resolution spatially connected information from dc ip imaging may be able to provide greater insight into these questions 3 2 dc ip imaging 3 2 1 stream reach to make the initial interpretation easier 2d cross sectional slices were first extracted from the 3d inverted domains of resistivity and chargeability fig 4 a and 4b present the 2d resistivity cross sections at transverse distances of 0 4 m and 1 2 m respectively aligning with lines s3 and s7 see fig 1 the white dotted line indicates the surface of the streambed while the x distance and depth of the extracted soil cores within the stream reach are indicated by grey boxes the top layer of low resistivity 20 ohm m above white dotted line represents the stream water and corresponds to the measured stream water resistivity of 17 ohm m the streambed resistivity distributions indicate three distinct zones along the stream reach which coincide with the three zones identified above based on the temperature mapping and vertical head difference measurements within the uppermost 0 8 m very high resistivity 400 ohm m exists from 0 m to 13 m zone 1 and 36 m to 48 m zone 3 though zone 3 exhibits more variability across the stream width i e west side exhibits low to moderate resistivity while the east side exhibits very high resistivity the top 0 8 m between 13 m and 36 m zone 2 comprises highly heterogeneous material with predominantly low to moderate resistivity blue to green with some areas of very low 20 ohm m and high 400 ohm m resistivity the resistivity suggests this zone consists of highly heterogeneous soils with centimeter scale changes below a depth of 0 8 m a discontinuous layer of low resistivity blue 40 ohm m interspersed with high resistivity purple 400 ohm m is evident the bulk resistivity in fig 4 includes contributions from both porewater water quality porosity saturation and grain surface conduction mineralogy archie 1942 therefore while the high resistivity areas shallow zones 1 and 3 parts of zone 2 likely represent coarser sediment materials with low porewater ec the low resistivity zones in fig 4 could be caused by high porewater ec and or conductive clay rich materials this is where chargeability can provide valuable and complementary information the corresponding normalized chargeability images lines s3 and s7 shown in fig 5 indicate that the uppermost 0 8 m exhibits low chargeability with isolated pockets of high chargeability e g 14 m and 28 m this means that the low resistivity in zone 2 is likely influenced by high porewater ec rather than clayey materials below 0 8 m depth larger zones of high chargeability an indication of clay sediment materials are interspersed amongst the generally low chargeability material joint interpretation of resistivity and chargeability from the combined dc ip survey infers that the uppermost 0 8 m in the streambed contains non clayey materials such as sands and gravel these materials span a small range of porosity i e 0 25 to 0 4 with variability related to grain size and uniformity i e higher uniformity equals higher porosity as the pore space is always fully saturated the variability of resistivity in fig 4 may be related to variable porewater ec along the stream reach for example the lower resistivity values in zone 2 relative to zones 1 and 3 indicates that the porewater in the top 0 8 m below the streambed surface is more conductive in this zone of the stream reach furthermore the porewater in the top 0 8 m below the streambed surface of zone 2 is more conductive than the deeper porewater approximately 0 8 m depth suggesting that if groundwater is upwelling in this zone its ec is changing as the porewater travels towards the stream i e slower flow longer residence times alternately much of the deeper groundwater might be bypassing around the shallow low permeability sediments in this zone this interpretation is supported by the measured porewater ec in fig 3 where porewater is consistently more conductive in zone 2 median 922 μs cm or 10 ohm m than zone 1 and zone 3 median 605 μs cm or 17 ohm m the 3d domain for resistivity and normalized chargeability respectively are provided in fig 6 a and 6b a horizontal depth slice is presented at 0 2 m below the stream water surface to coincide with the approximate streambed surface while the 2d lines in fig 4a and 5a capture the general zones along the stream reach fig 6a identifies the highly variable resistivity distribution across the stream width highlighting the value of high resolution continuous 3d imaging in heterogeneous streambeds fig 6a also presents 3d isovolumes of higher resistivity 250 ohm m to indicate the areas of high resistivity across the full depth which mainly exist throughout zone 1 and the east side of zone 3 fig 6b confirms that the chargeable clayey zones 0 6 ms m mostly exist at larger greater depths below the streambed surface the streambed architecture identified by 3d dc ip corresponds to the spatial gw sw exchange patterns identified by the temperature and vertical head differences in fig 2 the higher resistivity in zone 1 and zone 3 indicates more permeable gravelly sand materials which correlate to the areas of groundwater upwelling and explains why strong upward gradients there are associated with large temperature differences i e gives large upward groundwater flux for example zone 3 exhibits low resistivity on the west side with high resistivity on the east side as shown in fig 6a which directly supports the gw sw exchange conditions of upwelling only occurring on the east side see fig 2a furthermore the more clayey material existing below 0 8 m depth in these zones may be constraining groundwater adjacent to the stream reach from flowing deeper instead driving greater upward flux and shorter residence times in contrast the low to moderate resistivity in zone 2 infers fine grained non clayey material that correlates to the little to no upwelling and possible stream water downwelling shown in fig 2 the centimeter scale changes identified in figs 4 to 6 highlight the value of doing full continuous 3d imaging compared to irregular and sparsely located 2d lines that can miss important features such as zones of high permeability and potential groundwater discharge windows for example zone 2 did contain a distinct area of high resistivity at 19 m see fig 4a which matched the isolated areas of large temperature difference and groundwater upwelling within zone 2 see fig 3 furthermore the complementary information provided by combined dc ip was extremely beneficial to discriminate between soil types particularly clays from fine sands the spatial patterns identified within the stream reach extended into the larger 3d dc ip survey that was also performed across the riparian zones on each side of the stream the results of this survey are detailed in supplementary material 3 2 2 comparison with sediment core data fig 7 summarizes the soil classification with depth for each 0 5 m deep soil core extracted from the streambed all locations consist of soils ranging from fine sand to sandy gravel with a maximum of 7 fines silt clay the cores at 10 m zone 1 and 38 m zone 3 are characterized by coarse sand and gravel which generally have lower porosity but higher hydraulic conductivity thereby explaining the high resistivity in these areas i e lower porosity higher resistivity and larger gw sw exchange patterns at all central locations zone 2 the cores are characterized by fine to medium sands that typically have higher porosity but lower hydraulic conductivity this explains the low resistivity measurements and higher porewater ec which may be caused by higher residences times providing longer time scales for aqueous sediment interactions including mineral dissolution and organic matter mineralization 4 conclusions this study assessed the potential of combined dc resistivity and induced polarization dc ip geophysical imaging for improving the characterization of streambeds and better understanding of associated gw sw exchange patterns in streams streambeds can be highly heterogeneous and traditional techniques are invasive costly and provide sparsely distributed point information while standalone 2d dc resistivity imaging has been used for mapping streambeds the full value of combined dc ip remains unrealized high resolution 3d dc ip surveys were conducted at a headwater stream reach in kintore in southwestern ontario canada traditional techniques were first employed to characterize the stream reach with temperature and vertical hydraulic head difference measurements used to assess gw sw exchanges and pore water sampling defining the variability of porewater quality within the stream reach three distinct zones along the stream reach were identified 1 upstream zone with high groundwater upwelling 2 middle zone with little to no upwelling but higher porewater ec and 3 downstream zone with groundwater upwelling particularly on the east side of the stream the inverted 3d distributions of resistivity and chargeability revealed the composition within the streambed highly complementing and enhancing the initial interpretation of the gw sw exchange patterns chargeability measurements suggested that no clayey material exists within the uppermost 0 8 m of the streambed which was confirmed by sediment coring indicating that the corresponding resistivity measurements were only influenced by porewater quality and porosity the upstream and downstream zones exhibited high resistivity indicating coarse permeable material that is allowing groundwater upwelling which is supported by the similarity in water quality within the aquifer streambed and stream in contrast the middle zone exhibited much lower resistivity indicative of fine grained less permeable material that can resist groundwater upwelling the porewater ec within the streambed was elevated which may be caused by longer residence times and more hyporheic exchange the variation throughout the stream reach was on the centimeter scale which is typical of many streambeds this study highlighted the value of full continuous 3d imaging compared to previous studies that typically used irregular and sparsely located 2d lines that can miss important features such as pockets of highly permeable material and potential groundwater discharge furthermore the complementary information provided by combined dc ip specifically resistivity and normalized chargeability was highly valuable to improve lithological interpretation and its influence on gw sw exchanges although this study involved a mostly non clayey streambed the chargeability data were still valuable to confirm the absence of clayey material and that bulk resistivity was mostly influenced by porewater quality overall this study demonstrates that combined dc ip can be a valuable non invasive site tool for streambed and gw sw investigations dc ip can be highly complementary to traditional techniques to improve characterization of streambed heterogeneity and interpretation of associated gw sw exchange patterns such high resolution continuous information can be used as more realistic inputs to numerical models or geostatistical framework it is recommended that dc ip imaging be performed first to optimize subsequent field monitoring programs including the choice and location of sampling methods furthermore the dc ip instrumentation could be left in place and used for time lapse monitoring of gw sw exchanges over time 5 authorship contribution statement kyle robinson methodology formal analysis investigation writing review editing visualization clare robinson

2862,the influence of climate change and human interference bring high nonstationary characteristics that are different from the original long term stable state so that investigating runoff variation and attribution under changing environments is important for implementing adaptive management of global water resources especially on the interannual scale in this study the attribution of measured runoff change in the wuding river basin wrb of the loess plateau china was studied using the elasticity method based on the budyko framework and groundwater storage change analysis on an interannual scale the change in the measured runoff driven factors was divided into three categories climate change human induced land use land cover hi lulc change and water withdrawal change the results show that the contribution rate of climate change was the largest with the mean value 54 07 followed by the hi lulc change with the mean value 43 85 and the minimum is ww change with the mean value 2 08 climate change had a maximum contribution to runoff change of which precipitation was dominant followed by relative humidity net radiation and wind speed air temperature had a minimal impact in addition the ecological change tendency was analyzed by combining hi lulc and ndvi data the analysis results of ecological change tendency indicate that the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control caused the ecological restoration to some extent but also led to a decrease in runoff this study provides scientific and useful information for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management in the wrb and enriches the knowledge of contribution analysis of runoff variation which can be referenced by other basins across the globe keywords attribution analysis budyko framework climatic elasticities water withdrawal loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades changes in climate and land use land cover lulc have become increasingly significant ipcc 2007 ye et al 2018 affecting the hydrological cycle in many regions dey and mishra 2017 yang et al 2014a ren et al 2019 and have caused significant decreases in runoff in some basins such as the nile river basin in africa hasan et al 2018 the hai river basin xu et al 2014 and yellow river basin in china kong et al 2016 at present decreases in runoff are serious threats to the security in some regions and thus the dominant reason for runoff reduction needs to be determined therefore attribution analysis of runoff reduction has received considerable attention for regional runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management and utilization zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 liu and du 2017 to date methods for attribution analysis of runoff change can be largely divided into two categories hydrological simulation and water energy balance methods based on the budyko framework wang 2014 dey and mishra 2017 zhang et al 2019 the advantage of the hydrological simulation method is that it has a certain interpretation of the physical mechanism of runoff generation through the hydrological model and the time scale of simulation can span from day to year rigon et al 2006 huang et al 2020 although the hydrological model is an effective tool the results are easily affected by uncertainties in the model structure inputs and parameters sivapalan 2003 zhou et al 2021 in addition the simulation of the hydrological model requires high quality data especially the distributed hydrological model which reduces the applicability of the model to some extent hapuarachchi et al 2011 similar to the hydrological model the water energy balance equation based on the budyko framework also has an obvious physical mechanism different from the traditional mathematical statistical empirical method and can describe runoff generation from water balance and energy balance it is considered an ideal analysis method on a long term scale and has been widely used to investigate the quantitative attribution of runoff changes dooge 1992 fernandez and sayama 2015 mianabadi et al 2020 the budyko framework was proposed by budyko when he was carrying out global water and energy balance analysis budyko 1961 this framework can calculate the actual evapotranspiration e with inputs of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e0 huang et al 2016 subsequently various budyko type equations were derived and used to describe the relationship between e p and e0 over a long period milly 1994 dooge et al 1999 zhang et al 2001 arora 2002 in addition these equations were used to estimate the evapotranspiration change triggered by changes in climate and hi lulc and to further analyze the impact on runoff yang et al 2014a zhou et al 2016 huang et al 2016 the choudhury yang equation is a classic and popular budyko type equation proposed by mezentsev 1955 choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 and is often used to analyze the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff variation roderick and farauhar 2011 the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 and elasticity method yang and yang 2011 developed from the choudhury yang equation are the two main methods for quantifying the contribution of climate change and human interference the decomposition method was proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 and argues that climate change will only cause the point movement along the budyko curve while human interferences may drive the ordinate change of point to deviate from the budyko curve thus the impacts of climate change and human activity on runoff can be calculated according to the deviation of the point from the budyko curve wang and hejazi 2011 many scholars have applied this method to analyze the attribution of runoff variation in various catchments for example sun et al 2014 used the decomposition method to investigate the contribution of climate change and human activities to the decrease in runoff observed in the han river basin in china liang et al 2015a explored the responses of runoff to different driving factors using the decomposition method in 14 catchments in the loess plateau these results indicated that the decomposition method has an advantage in quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff change however it should be noted that the decomposition method is unsatisfactory in quantifying the impact of a single climatic factor e g net radiation wind speed and air temperature on runoff change in contrast the elasticity method is often used to calculate the elasticity coefficient of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e0 and parameter n and to further evaluate the contribution of climate change on runoff evolution fortunately the elasticity of climatic factors e g net radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature can also be derived using the penman monteith equation cai et al 2007 guan et al 2021 and it undoubtedly provides an effective way to quantify the contributions of various climatic factors to runoff change yang and yang 2011 gao et al 2016 for example ma et al 2010a derived the climate elasticities of precipitation and air temperature and assessed the impacts of these two climatic factors on the inflow of the miyun reservoir in beijing china yang and yang 2011 derived the climate elasticities of precipitation net radiation air temperature wind speed at 2 m above ground and relative humidity to assess the influence of these factors on runoff over a long time scale in 89 catchments in china yang et al 2014b analyzed the spatial distribution of parameter n representing the catchment characteristics in china and assessed the contributions of climatic factors on runoff by climate elasticities todhunter et al 2020 evaluated the contribution of streamflow changes due to climate change and human activities in the mauvais coulee basin it can be found from the above studies that the decomposition method and elasticity method theoretically applied the water energy balance equation at the long term scale or estimated the contributions of runoff variation based on the average annual value of e p e 0 and other parameters yang et al 2014b zhou et al 2016 huang et al 2016 this is reasonable for hydrological processes with stationary characteristics even if non stationary features appear such as runoff and precipitation rougé et al 2013 jeon et al 2016 xie et al 2018 the hydrological variables before and after the abrupt point is relatively stable jeon et al 2016 xie et al 2018 however many studies have found that the influence of climate change and human interference show high nonstationary characteristics as opposed to the original long term stable state representing obvious variation at the interannual scale li et al 2019 sadegh et al 2019 the multi year average scale of runoff change attribution analysis with the budyko framework is not suitable thus an investigation at an interannual scale or a reduction of the multi year scale average condition to an interannual scale from year to year is expected which can provide a positive and efficient tool to implement hydrological simulation and water resource management under the current environment with continuous change the foundation of the budyko hypothesis is the water balance on a muti year scale yang et al 2014a todhunter et al 2020 therefore the budyko framework can be applied to the inter annual scale if we can establish an annual water balance formula which covered the changes in surface and groundwater storage in this study the water balance formula on an annual scale was established first then the elasticity methods based on the budyko framework are used to analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities serving for basin water resource management at an interannual scale it should also be noted that the meaning of parameter n in the decomposition and elasticity method when the scale is reduced to interannual from the average annual it has been mentioned in the choudhury yang formulation that evapotranspiration was only affected by parameter n except for p and e0 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 p and e0 represent the climatic variables and n should represent the sum of all factors affecting evapotranspiration except for the climatic variables zhang et al 2018a in existing studies n mainly refers to catchment characteristics for example soil type topography and vegetation xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014a liu et al 2017 the runoff change triggered by the variation of n is usually seen as the streamflow change driven by land use and land cover lulc change caused by human activities human induced lulc tan and gan 2015 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a abera et al 2019 this idea is valid on a long term scale when the change in long time surface water and groundwater storage is negligible however as shown in some studies human induced lulc hi lulc changes do not cover all the characteristics represented by n saha et al 2020 for example water withdrawal ww may influence the water balance on an interannual scale because it provides other ways of water evaporation except for hi lulc oki and kanae 2006 lettenmaier 2014 it is thus clear that n representing the sum of all factors affecting evapotranspiration except the climatic variables should produce more contribution to runoff change than that from the catchment hi lulc change in other words the impact of water withdrawal on runoff change cannot be ignored and should be incorporated into n the meaning of parameter n is discussed further in section 5 2 wuding river basin wrb is a typical loess plateau terrain with intensive evapotranspiration lower vegetational cover and serious soil erosion shi et al 2019 dang et al 2021 furthermore the runoff wrb is vulnerable to the effects of climate change since the 1960s a series of projects and measures have been implemented due to its serious soil erosion xu and wang 2011 such as the project grain for green on the loess plateau has returned farmland to forest and grassland exceeding 16 000 km2 5000 main check dams and 50 000 small and medium sized check dams were built shi et al 2019 dang et al 2021 the above policy implementation caused a great lulc change to sum up runoff change in wrb is vulnerable to climate change and human activities the contribution analysis of runoff changes in wrb is highly representative which can provide theoretical reference for other similar basins in arid areas that are significantly affected by climate change and human activities to analyze the contribution of interannual runoff variation in wrb the water balance equation of the wrb was first established at the interannual scale then the elasticity method was performed at the corresponding scale to evaluate the contribution of climate change and catchment changes to the runoff climate change is represented by changes in precipitation relative humidity net radiation wind speed and air temperature and the catchment changes are represented by the parameter n mainly including the hi lulc and water withdrawal changes the attribution analysis of groundwater storage change was also performed at the interannual scale because the water balance equation cannot ignore the groundwater storage change at the interannual scale therefore the measured runoff attribution analysis can be performed by combining the elasticity method and attribution analysis of groundwater storage change it can be foreseen that the study will provide scientific and useful information for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management in the wrb loess plateau and enrich the knowledge of contribution analysis of runoff variation which can be referenced by other similar basins across the world 2 methodology 2 1 water balance at the interannual scale generally the water balance in a basin can be expressed in the long term as shown in eq 1 1 r p e where r is the measured runoff in a basin mm p is the precipitation mm and e is the actual evapotranspiration mm at the interannual scale the changes in the amount of surface water and groundwater storage should be introduced into the equation as shown in eq 2 2 r p e δ s δ g where δs is the change in surface water storage mm and δg is the change in groundwater storage mm in arid areas the change in surface water storage is almost negligible because the natural surface water body is very small under the impact of intensive evaporation and the human induced surface water body has little change in different years without multi year regulation reservoir in addition δs can be regarded as approximately zero thus eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 r r δ g p e where r is the coupled runoff which coupling the measured runoff and the change of groundwater storage assuming that lateral recharge and discharge are equal in the groundwater system the groundwater balance equation is established mainly considering vertical water transfer to estimate δg as follows 4 δ g g r g b g e where gr is the amount of vertical groundwater recharge mm gb is the base flow or discharge to the river mm and ge is the human induced exploitation quantity of groundwater mm to calculate gr the recession curve displacement method proposed by hall was applied in this study including three steps jing et al 2016 1 selecting the main recession curve 2 calculating the recession constant and critical duration and 3 calculating the groundwater recharge the eckhardt filter method was used to calculate gb eckhardt 2008 and the detailed calculation formula is as follows 5 g b t 1 b f i max a r b t 1 1 a b f i max q t 1 a b f i max where gb t and gb t 1 are the baseflow at time t and t 1 respectively q t is the measured runoff at time t a is the filter parameter and bfi max is the maximum value of the baseflow index the filter parameter a was selected as 0 9 as referred to by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and the maximum value of the baseflow index bfi max was selected as 0 5 eckhardt 2008 the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 was employed to calculate the ge due to the data of groundwater extraction are difficult to obtain field investigations have found that water withdrawal for domestic livestock and industry in the wrb is generally supplied by the groundwater owing to the river streamflow having hyper concentration of sediment ma et al 2010b it needs further explanation that the reason of water withdrawal for domestic livestock and industrial is generally supplied by the groundwater the wrb is subject to serious soil erosion the mean annual runoff and sediment loads are 11 2 108 m3 and 1 1 108 t respectively han et al 2019 research jing et al 2022 shows that suspended sediment in the dry season is almost equal to the rainy season which means that the river has a high suspended sediment level throughout the year wrb has no large reservoirs to deposit sediment to meet water quality requirements for domestic livestock and industrial besides the water consumption for domestic livestock and industrial was the exploited groundwater based on the water resources bulletin of yulin city china almost the whole wrb is located in yulin city china the water resources bulletin of yulin can be obtained from the official website of the water conservancy bureau of yulin city https slj yl gov cn index html then the exploited groundwater is estimated by summing the water withdrawal of domestic livestock and industry departments 6 w g wg ind wg d wg ls 7 w g ind vg ind qg ind 8 w g d pop city q city pop coun q coun 9 w g ls ng ls qg ls where wg represents the groundwater exploitation m3 ge 1000wg a and a notes the basin area m2 wgind represents the exploited groundwater for industry and wgd m3 and wgls m3 represent the exploited groundwater for domestic and livestock consumption respectively vgind is the value of industrial production 104cny and qgind is the water withdrawal quota per 104cny industrial production m3 104cny pop city and pop coun are populations of the city and countryside p respectively the q city and q coun are water withdrawal quotas for city and countryside domestic respectively m3 p a ngls is the number of livestock p and qgls is the water withdrawal quota of livestock m3 p a all quotas were ascertained and published by the local government 2 2 elasticity method the budyko hypothesis was postulated by a russian climatologist mikhail ivanovich budyko to analyze regional differences in long term annual average water and energy balances budyko 1961 the partition of water from the atomsphere p between evapotranspiration e and runoff r is treated as a functional balance between the supply of p and the demand for water by the atmosphere potential evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration capacity e 0 roderick and farquhar 2011 in this study the choudhury yang formulation was employed to calculate the e as follows choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 10 e e 0 p p n e 0 n 1 n where e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration and n is the catchment parameter the parameter n can be calculated with eq 10 in combination with the water balance equation eq 2 in eq 10 e0 can be calculated with the p m formula eq 16 p is the precipitation e is the actual evapotranspiration and it can be calculated with eq 2 then the parameter n can be obtained the climate elasticity proposed by yang and yang 2011 was selected to evaluate the runoff change caused by climate change and human activities denoting eq 10 as e f e0 p n the corresponding total differential is as follows 11 d e f p d p f e 0 d e 0 f n d n then the total differential of the water balance equation on the interannual scale r p e is derived and described in combination with eq 11 as follows 12 d r r 1 f p p r dp p f e 0 e 0 r d e 0 e 0 f n n r dn n the climatic elasticities of p e0 and n was given as 13 ε p 1 f p p r 14 ε e 0 f e 0 e 0 r 15 ε n f n n r where ε p ε e 0 and ε n are the elasticities of p e0 and n respectively it is well known that the food and agriculture organization fao corrected the penman monteith formula to calculate e0 in different climate areas gong et al 2006 this equation can be expressed as follows 16 e 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s 1 0 01 r h δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure versus air temperature curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 rn and g are the net radiation and soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 respectively t is the air temperature c es is the saturated vapor pressure kpa rh is the relative humidity and u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 it can be seen from eq 16 that e0 is strongly influenced by climatic variables the contributions of climatic variables to the change in e0 can then be estimated as follows yang and yang 2011 17 de 0 e 0 r n d r n e 0 t d t e 0 u 2 d u 2 e 0 r h d r h similarly the climate elasticities of different variables can be given according to eqs 13 to 17 18 ε r n ε e 0 r n e 0 e 0 r n 19 ε t ε e 0 1 e 0 e 0 t 20 ε u 2 ε e 0 u 2 e 0 e 0 u 2 21 ε rh ε e 0 rh e 0 e 0 r h where ε r n ε t ε u 2 and ε rh are the climatic elasticities of net radiation air temperature wind speed at a height of 2 m and relative humidity respectively finally the runoff change induced by climatic variable changes and parameter n can be calculated using to the following formula 22 δ r x ε x r x δ x where is the climatic variable or parameter n εx is the elasticity of climatic variables or parameter n and δ r x is the runoff change caused by the corresponding climatic variables or parameter n mm δ r x can be calculated by using the elasticity method considering the driving sources of runoff change δ r is divided into δ r c and δ r h δ r c as the runoff change driven by climatic variables can be similarly calculated by the elasticity coefficients method the value of δ r c is the sum of the runoff changes induced by climate variables p rn t rh and u 2 δ r h is the runoff change driven by human activities parameter n which is represented by δ r n however as mentioned in the introduction the runoff change caused by human activities δ r h needs to be considered induced by hi lulc and ww in addition because groundwater withdrawal was considered in the change of δg the runoff change caused by human activities δ r h needs to be considered to be induced from hi lulc and surface water withdrawal sww sww can be calculated quantitatively using the investigation method hui et al 2012 the hi lulc change induced runoff change δ r lu can be obtained using the following equation 23 δ r lu δ r h δ r sww where δ r sww is the runoff change caused by the sww change which is numerically equivalent to the difference between adjacent data in the sww series that is δ r sww δ s w w sww can be calculated using the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 the sww in the wrb can be divided into irrigation and afforestation water the sww for irrigation was calculated as follows 24 w irr f irr h irr 1000 a where wirr is the sww for irrigation mm f irr is the irrigation area m2 hirr is the sww quota for irrigation m3 m2 a is the basin area the sww for afforestation was calculated using the following equation 25 w aff f aff q aff 1000 a where waff is the water withdrawal for afforestation mm faff is the area of afforestation km2 qaff is the water withdrawal quota of afforestation m3 km2 and a is the basin area total sww was obtained by sum the above items 26 sww w irr w aff the water withdrawal quota was ascertained based on a statistical manual published by the local government sww wirr waff was calculated and transferred to the runoff depth 2 3 measured runoff change attribution according to eq 3 the measured runoff change δr can be expressed as follows 27 δ r δ r δ g where δr is the interannual change in measured runoff δ r is the interannual change in r and δg is the interannual change in groundwater storage δg δ r and δg can be divided into the climate change induced and human activities induced eq 27 can be expressed as follows by coupling the eq 4 28 δ r δ r c δ r h δ g r δ g b δ g e where δ r c is the interannual change of r induced by climate change δ r h is the interannual change of r induced by human activities δ g r is the interannual change of gr δ g b is the interannual change in gb and δ g e is the interannual change in ge in section 2 2 δ r c was divided into runoff change induced by different climate variables and δ r h was divided into δ r sww and δ r lu eq 28 can be expressed as 29 δ r δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ r lu δ r sww δ g r c δ g r h δ g b δ g e where δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ r lu and δ r sww represent the runoff change induced by p rn t u 2 rh hi lulc and sww respectively δ g r c and δ g r h represent the changes in vertical groundwater recharge induced by climate change and human activities respectively δgb represents the changes in base flow and δge represents the changes in the human induced exploitation quantity of groundwater groundwater withdrawal δ g r represents the changes in the vertical recharge of groundwater which is mainly recharged from precipitation in the wrb irrigation water vertically recharges groundwater it is difficult for afforestation water to recharge groundwater because of the intense evaporation and adsorption of plant roots therefore δ g r h which represents the vertical recharge change caused by human activities was mainly the vertical recharge from irrigation water wirr δ g r h can be seen as a change in recharge water induced by irrigation human induced the infiltration recharge coefficient of irrigation of 0 3 in the wrb was ascertained and published by the local government therefore δ g r h can be calculated as follows 31 δ g r h 0 3 w irr then δ g r c is the difference value between δ g r and δ g r h 32 δ g r c δ g r δ g r h 3 runoff change contribution in eq 29 δ g e represents the interannual change of groundwater withdrawal and δ r sww represents the interannual change of surface water withdrawal these two parts can be combined to the water withdrawal ww which represents the total water withdrawal the change in baseflow was influenced by the hi lulc and climatic variables precipitation and temperature are the main climatic variables that influence baseflow dong et al 2014 however the response of baseflow to precipitation can be ignored at an interannual scale dong et al 2014 in addition the influence of temperature on baseflow is mainly in regions with glaciers and frozen soil at high altitudes dong et al 2014 while the loess plateau has no glaciers and less frozen soil therefore we can assume that δ g b was mainly affected by the change in hi lulc in the study area eq 28 can be rewritten as equation 33 therefore the runoff change can be divided into three categories climate change induced ww change induced and hi lulc change induced δ r δ r c δ r lu δ r ww 33 where δr is the measured runoff change δrww is the measured runoff change caused by the change in ww contained surface and groundwater withdrawal δrlu is the measured runoff change caused by the change in hi lulc and δrc is the measured runoff change driven by climate change among them δ r c δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ g r c 34 δ r lu δ r lu δ g b 35 δ r ww δ r sww δ g r h δ g e 36 the attribution analysis framework of measured runoff was shown in fig 1 the contributions of climate variables and two types of human activities hi lulc and ww can be calculated as follows 37 δ r i δ r i s um δ r i 100 where δri is the contribution rate of the ith runoff change driven factor such as climate change and hi lulc change and δri is the runoff change caused by the ith driven factor such as climate change and hi lulc change 4 study area and data 4 1 study area and runoff data the wuding river is the first order tributary of the yellow river the main river in northern shaanxi china most of the wrb belongs to the loess plateau china and has intensive evapotranspiration the annual precipitation and runoff depth of the basin are 366 9 and 35 mm respectively li et al 2007 the location of the wrb is shown in fig 2 the river originates in the northern part of baiyunshan mountain in dingbian county and flows into the yellow river in qingjian county zhou et al 2013 the main channel of the wuding river is 491 km long with a basin area of 30261 km2 and an average slope of 1 97 li et al 2007 the low vegetation coverage and unique soil characteristics in the wrb in the loess plateau cause serious water and soil erosion shi et al 2019 the local government began to make efforts to control water and soil erosion in the late 1970s which greatly changed the lulc in the wrb xu and wang 2011 the runoff series in the wrb has been decreasing continuously since the beginning of the statistical period quantitative attribution analysis of the runoff decrease in the wrb provides guidance for the sustainable development and management of water resources the runoff data used in this study were measured runoff series 1975 2010 from the baijiachuan hydrological gauge which is the control hydrological gauge of the wrb the data were collected from hydrological manuals published by the hydrological bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china and are shown in fig 3 the distribution of hydrological and meteorological gauges used in this study is shown in fig 2 4 2 climatic variables the climatic data of the wrb from 1975 to 2010 were collected at the national climatic information center china http data cma cn surface climatic data were acquired using the tyson polygon method wang et al 2015 in arcgis five climatic variables p rn u2 rh and t were selected to evaluate the contribution of climate variables to changes in runoff in the estimation of net radiation solar radiation was derived from the relative sunshine duration minimum and maximum air temperature and vapor pressure as recommended by the fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the five climatic variables mentioned above are shown in fig 3 a e 4 3 water withdrawal water withdrawal includes two parts in this paper surface water withdrawal sww and groundwater withdrawal ge the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 was employed to acquire data on sww and ge as mentioned in section 2 1 and 2 3 sww can be calculated with the eqs 24 to 26 and ge can be obtained based on the eqs 6 to 9 the series of ge and sww are shown in fig 4 sww showed a decreasing trend after 2000 whereas ge grew continually during the study period 5 results 5 1 groundwater storage change the change in groundwater storage can be obtained based on baseflow groundwater recharge and groundwater exploitation the results are shown in fig 5 additionally groundwater recharge was calculated based on the recession curve displacement method jing et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 the mean groundwater recharge was 15 66 mm which is consistent with the conclusion of zhu et al 2010 the data of the exploited groundwater are also drawn in fig 5 and the series of groundwater storage is shown in fig 5 to visually represent the change in groundwater storage the baseflow and exploited groundwater were set as negative values and the sum of the above three items was the groundwater storage change if the groundwater storage variable is positive it means that the groundwater system receives more recharge than the sum of discharge and exploitation in that year and the groundwater storage increases conversely when the recharge of groundwater is less than the sum of discharge and exploitation the groundwater storage variable is negative and the storage of groundwater decreases as shown in fig 5 the groundwater storage series can be divided into two stages before the 1990s the change in groundwater storage fluctuated around zero indicating that the groundwater storage was at a relatively stable level since the 1990s almost all changes in groundwater storage variables have been negative indicating that the sum of discharge and exploitation of groundwater has been continually greater than the recharge accordingly the groundwater storage has continued to decrease this is because the amount of groundwater recharge decreased with the decrease in precipitation during this period additionally the amount of groundwater exploitation increased continuously during this period leading to a continuous decrease in groundwater storage 5 2 elasticities of parameter n and climate variables the coupled runoff r was obtained based on the measured runoff r and the groundwater storage change δg the series of e e 0 and parameter n are shown in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 6 e 0 and e exhibit a slightly decreasing trend whereas n exhibit an increasing trend after calculating the surface climate data fig 3 and parameter n of the wrb the elasticities of climatic variables and parameter n can be calculated to quantitatively evaluate the change in coupled runoff r driven by climatic variables and human activities the elasticities of precipitation εp net radiation εrn air temperature εt wind speed at 2m above ground εu2 relative humidity εrh and parameter n εn on an interannual scale were calculated and are shown in fig 7 it can be seen in fig 7 that the absolute values of all elasticities have increasing trends over time including climatic variables and parameter n comparing the means of the absolute value of elasticities ε p ε n ε rh ε r n ε u 2 ε t this indicates that the change in precipitation has a more significant impact on coupled runoff followed by a change of parameter n which includes the change in sww and hi lulc the lowest impact is from εt that is the effects of air temperature change on runoff were relatively small compared to other climatic variables and human activities 5 3 climate change hi lulc and water withdrawal contribution on measured runoff as shown in fig 1 the measured runoff changes δr contain the coupled runoff changes δ r and groundwater storage changes δg the changes in δ r can be separated into runoff changes driven by the change in climate variables hi lulc and sww in this section the driving factors of δ r will be analyzed first in section 4 3 1 with the elasticity method and the driving factors of δr will be analyzed in section 4 3 2 coupled with the driving factors of δg then all of the driving factors are divided into three main categories measured runoff changes driven by climate change δrc hi lulc change δrlu and water withdrawal change δrww 5 3 1 runoff change δ r analysis with elasticity method the series of runoff change caused by climate variables δ r p δ r rh δ r r n δ r t δ r u 2 and human activities δ r h equivalence with δ r n was listed in fig 8 δ r h was divided into runoff change induced by surface water withdrawal δ r sww and hi lulc change δ r lu the amount of changed runoff δ r caused by the climatic variables hi lulc and water consumption were calculated and are shown in fig 8 it is apparent from fig 8 that δ r was mostly negative which also supports the objective fact that runoff has decreased the changes in p and hi lulc had a significant influence on runoff the value of δ r lu exhibits a decreasing trend among the climatic variables the change in runoff caused by precipitation followed by relative humidity net radiation and wind speed air temperature had a minimal impact 5 3 2 measured runoff change δr analysis after separating the driving factors of δ r the driving factors of the measured runoff change are analyzed in this section δg includes three items δgr δgb and δge δgr δgb and δge are equivalent to the difference of adjacent data in the gr gb and ge series respectively among them δgr can be divided into δ g r c climate change induced and δ g r h human activities induced the series of δ g r c δ g r h δgb and δge are shown in fig 9 the change in the measured runoff δr was divided into δrc δrlu and δrww the series of δrc δrlu and δrww are shown in fig 10 it is obvious from fig 10 that the main driving factors of the measured runoff change are climate and hi lulc change the measured runoff change caused by ww showed a decreasing trend in the wrb with the trend analysis δrlu and δrww exhibited a slight decrease trend in contrast δrc showed an increasing trend this indicates that the runoff change caused by climate change was continuous growth whereas runoff changes caused by human activities decreased the contribution rates of climate change hi lulc and ww δrc δrlu and δrww were calculated and is shown in fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11 the contribution rate of climate change to measured runoff is mostly negative that is climate change caused the measured runoff to decrease in most years this trend is consistent with precipitation which is the largest driving factor of climate variables on runoff change the absolute values of the contribution rate were calculated to compare the driving forces of the above factors δrc δrlu and δrww the absolute values of δrc δrlu and δrww were 4 04 88 56 10 98 90 92 and 0 06 9 67 respectively the trend of the above three variables during the study period was analyzed the results showed that the contribution rate of climate change and ww had an increasing trend conversely the contribution rate of hi lulc had a decreasing trend the trend of the contribution rate of the above three factors is consistent with the trend of runoff change driven by the above factors except for ww the trend difference between the contribution rate of ww and the trend of runoff change driven by ww may be due to the decrease in runoff change at the end of the study period thus δrww exhibits a decreasing trend and δrww has an increasing trend to understand the reason for the change in δrlu which has a decreasing trend we found that a series of soil and water conservation policies were carried out in the wrb li et al 2010 at the beginning of the statistical period which caused significant changes in hi lulc and resulted in large changes in runoff the contribution of hi lulc on measured runoff change consisted by the δ r lu and δ g b among the two above items δ r lu is the dominant variable δ r lu was calculated based on the equation 22 the positive or negative values of contribution rate was mainly affected by the amount change of runoff the contribution rate is positive when the runoff decreased contribution rate is negative when the runoff increased because the elasticities of parameter n is negative the rationality of the results was discussed further in section 5 3 6 discussion 6 1 ecological change tendency and its impacts on runoff changes in climate and hi lulc are the two main driving factors of changes in runoff the change in climate variables is shown visually in fig 3 the ecological hi lulc change tendency in the wrb and its impacts on runoff are discussed in this section the hi lulc changes in the wrb 1980 2010 are shown in table 1 shi et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the area of green land including cropland forestland and grassland and water has significantly increased the change in hi lulc indicates that the wrb has an ecological restoration tendency the reason for the increase in green land and water is the implementation of soil and water erosion control policy issued by the local government in the wrb from the late 1970s the control measures include returning farmland to forests afforestation and the construction of a large number of check dams xu and wang 2011 shi et al 2019 to support this trend of ecological restoration we conducted a trend analysis of normalized vegetation index ndvi data 1982 2010 in the wrb the ndvi data 1982 2010 of the wrb were derived from the ndvi dataset produced by the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms and are shown in fig 12 the mann kendall trend test was performed with the ndvi series and the results showed that the ndvi showed a significant increasing trend which indicated that the vegetation cover increased the trend in ndvi has proved the ecological restoration of the wrb in addition the runoff change caused by hi lulc showed a decreasing trend therefore it can be concluded that the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control restored the ecological environment but led to a decrease in runoff this conclusion is consistent with the results of other studies on ecological restoration which has been found to reduce runoff in most river basins liang et al 2015b zhang et al 2018b 6 2 the meaning of parameter n in the above research the parameter n in the budyko framework is the underlying surface parameter which represents the catchment characteristics including soil type topography and vegetation xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014a liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 the elasticity of parameter n was used to reflect the contribution of lulc change to runoff xu et al 2013 liu et al 2017 besides some researchers pointed out that the parameter n is correlated with climate seasonality except for vegetation variation ning et al 2017 liu et al 2018 then the empirical method to calculate parameter n was established ning et al 2017 liu et al 2018 it can be used for the ungauged basin to estimate the parameter n in the elasticity method however climate seasonality mainly reflects the non uniformity in the intra annual distribution of water and energy ning et al 2017 in this study the parameter n was calculated with the measured meteorologic and hydrologic data besides the contribution analysis of runoff change is concentrated on the interannual scale and the non uniformity in the intra annual distribution of water and energy brought by the climate seasonality can be neglected to separate the effect of climate change and human activities on runoff change some researches defined that the change of the parameter n was attributed to human activities xu et al 2014 yang et al 2022 meantime some research declared that the effect of human activities on runoff change can be obtained by minus the change caused by climate factors using the total change in runoff yang et al 2020 dang et al 2021 considering the above two theories the climatic elasticities were used to quantify the contribution of climate change to runoff variation and the elasticity of parameter n represents the comprehensive influence except for climatic variables this comprehensive effect includes the change in hi lulc and ww this is also consistent with the research conclusions of other scholars yang et al 2022 6 3 the uncertainty of method and data to verify the rationality of the results we compare changes between the simulated runoff and the measured runoff fig 13 which shows a good agreement in most year besides the coefficient of determination r2 dodge 2006 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta and kling 2011 normalized mean square error nmse ritter and munoz carpena 2013 were calculated which were used to evaluate the accuracy of modeled value the results were shown in table 1 as can be seen in table 2 the error is within a reasonable range so it can be considered the model in this paper can simulate the interannual runoff variation accurately in this study there are multiple sources of uncertainty present there is a hypothesis that the parameter n is not correlated with the climatic variables however the complexity of the hydrological process determines that this absolute situation does not exist some researches declared that the parameter n is affected by the climatic variables liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 besides the uncertainties of data will also affect the results of the model such as groundwater storage data and water withdrawal the groundwater storage data was used to establish the water balance equation in section 2 1 the absence of measured groundwater storage data will lead to the uncertainty of the results as for the soil moisture most of the water in the soil evaporates into the atmosphere due to intense evaporation 1000 1400 mm year in the loess plateau tian et al 2018 dang et al 2021 the change of soil moisture on the interannual scale is small which can be ignored in loess plateau liu et al 2009 there may also be some deviation between the ww data calculated by the subentry investigation method and the actual ww data although results existed with a certain uncertainty the elasticity method based on the budyko framework avoided the negative impacts of complicated parameterization and model structure and was an effective tool to assess the responses of runoff changes to climate changes and human activities such as hi lulc and ww 7 conclusion the contribution analysis of interannual runoff change in wrb located in the northern part of the loess plateau china can provide scientific guidance for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management the water balance equation was established on an interannual scale so that the budyko framework could be applied on an interannual scale the elasticity method based on the budyko framework was used to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities on runoff change in the wrb changes in runoff caused by climate change can be divided into different climate variables combining the data of ww and groundwater storage change the driving factors of measured runoff change can be divided into three categories climate change hi lulc change and ww change in addition the ecological change tendency was analyzed by combining hi lulc and ndvi data the specific conclusions are summarized as follows a groundwater storage is continuing to decrease due to the decrease in groundwater recharge and the continuous increase of groundwater withdrawal since the 1990 s in the wrb b the elasticities of the climate variables were calculated on an interannual scale the results show that among the climatic variables that affected the runoff change the precipitation relative humidity net radiation wind speed air temperature from high contribution to low c the measured runoff change driven factors were divided into three categories climate change hi lulc change and ww change the contribution rate of climate change was greater than that of other factors the contribution rate of ww was minimal and showed an increasing trend which is consistent with the trend of the contribution rate of climate change the contribution rate of hi lulc showed a decreasing trend indicating that the lulc disturbance caused by human activities to runoff reduced across the study period d it was found that green land water area and ndvi significantly increased in the wrb this implies that the ecological environment has a restorative tendency the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control improved the ecological environment to some extent but also led to a decrease in runoff declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2862,the influence of climate change and human interference bring high nonstationary characteristics that are different from the original long term stable state so that investigating runoff variation and attribution under changing environments is important for implementing adaptive management of global water resources especially on the interannual scale in this study the attribution of measured runoff change in the wuding river basin wrb of the loess plateau china was studied using the elasticity method based on the budyko framework and groundwater storage change analysis on an interannual scale the change in the measured runoff driven factors was divided into three categories climate change human induced land use land cover hi lulc change and water withdrawal change the results show that the contribution rate of climate change was the largest with the mean value 54 07 followed by the hi lulc change with the mean value 43 85 and the minimum is ww change with the mean value 2 08 climate change had a maximum contribution to runoff change of which precipitation was dominant followed by relative humidity net radiation and wind speed air temperature had a minimal impact in addition the ecological change tendency was analyzed by combining hi lulc and ndvi data the analysis results of ecological change tendency indicate that the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control caused the ecological restoration to some extent but also led to a decrease in runoff this study provides scientific and useful information for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management in the wrb and enriches the knowledge of contribution analysis of runoff variation which can be referenced by other basins across the globe keywords attribution analysis budyko framework climatic elasticities water withdrawal loess plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past decades changes in climate and land use land cover lulc have become increasingly significant ipcc 2007 ye et al 2018 affecting the hydrological cycle in many regions dey and mishra 2017 yang et al 2014a ren et al 2019 and have caused significant decreases in runoff in some basins such as the nile river basin in africa hasan et al 2018 the hai river basin xu et al 2014 and yellow river basin in china kong et al 2016 at present decreases in runoff are serious threats to the security in some regions and thus the dominant reason for runoff reduction needs to be determined therefore attribution analysis of runoff reduction has received considerable attention for regional runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management and utilization zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 liu and du 2017 to date methods for attribution analysis of runoff change can be largely divided into two categories hydrological simulation and water energy balance methods based on the budyko framework wang 2014 dey and mishra 2017 zhang et al 2019 the advantage of the hydrological simulation method is that it has a certain interpretation of the physical mechanism of runoff generation through the hydrological model and the time scale of simulation can span from day to year rigon et al 2006 huang et al 2020 although the hydrological model is an effective tool the results are easily affected by uncertainties in the model structure inputs and parameters sivapalan 2003 zhou et al 2021 in addition the simulation of the hydrological model requires high quality data especially the distributed hydrological model which reduces the applicability of the model to some extent hapuarachchi et al 2011 similar to the hydrological model the water energy balance equation based on the budyko framework also has an obvious physical mechanism different from the traditional mathematical statistical empirical method and can describe runoff generation from water balance and energy balance it is considered an ideal analysis method on a long term scale and has been widely used to investigate the quantitative attribution of runoff changes dooge 1992 fernandez and sayama 2015 mianabadi et al 2020 the budyko framework was proposed by budyko when he was carrying out global water and energy balance analysis budyko 1961 this framework can calculate the actual evapotranspiration e with inputs of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e0 huang et al 2016 subsequently various budyko type equations were derived and used to describe the relationship between e p and e0 over a long period milly 1994 dooge et al 1999 zhang et al 2001 arora 2002 in addition these equations were used to estimate the evapotranspiration change triggered by changes in climate and hi lulc and to further analyze the impact on runoff yang et al 2014a zhou et al 2016 huang et al 2016 the choudhury yang equation is a classic and popular budyko type equation proposed by mezentsev 1955 choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 and is often used to analyze the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff variation roderick and farauhar 2011 the decomposition method wang and hejazi 2011 and elasticity method yang and yang 2011 developed from the choudhury yang equation are the two main methods for quantifying the contribution of climate change and human interference the decomposition method was proposed by wang and hejazi 2011 and argues that climate change will only cause the point movement along the budyko curve while human interferences may drive the ordinate change of point to deviate from the budyko curve thus the impacts of climate change and human activity on runoff can be calculated according to the deviation of the point from the budyko curve wang and hejazi 2011 many scholars have applied this method to analyze the attribution of runoff variation in various catchments for example sun et al 2014 used the decomposition method to investigate the contribution of climate change and human activities to the decrease in runoff observed in the han river basin in china liang et al 2015a explored the responses of runoff to different driving factors using the decomposition method in 14 catchments in the loess plateau these results indicated that the decomposition method has an advantage in quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff change however it should be noted that the decomposition method is unsatisfactory in quantifying the impact of a single climatic factor e g net radiation wind speed and air temperature on runoff change in contrast the elasticity method is often used to calculate the elasticity coefficient of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e0 and parameter n and to further evaluate the contribution of climate change on runoff evolution fortunately the elasticity of climatic factors e g net radiation wind speed relative humidity and temperature can also be derived using the penman monteith equation cai et al 2007 guan et al 2021 and it undoubtedly provides an effective way to quantify the contributions of various climatic factors to runoff change yang and yang 2011 gao et al 2016 for example ma et al 2010a derived the climate elasticities of precipitation and air temperature and assessed the impacts of these two climatic factors on the inflow of the miyun reservoir in beijing china yang and yang 2011 derived the climate elasticities of precipitation net radiation air temperature wind speed at 2 m above ground and relative humidity to assess the influence of these factors on runoff over a long time scale in 89 catchments in china yang et al 2014b analyzed the spatial distribution of parameter n representing the catchment characteristics in china and assessed the contributions of climatic factors on runoff by climate elasticities todhunter et al 2020 evaluated the contribution of streamflow changes due to climate change and human activities in the mauvais coulee basin it can be found from the above studies that the decomposition method and elasticity method theoretically applied the water energy balance equation at the long term scale or estimated the contributions of runoff variation based on the average annual value of e p e 0 and other parameters yang et al 2014b zhou et al 2016 huang et al 2016 this is reasonable for hydrological processes with stationary characteristics even if non stationary features appear such as runoff and precipitation rougé et al 2013 jeon et al 2016 xie et al 2018 the hydrological variables before and after the abrupt point is relatively stable jeon et al 2016 xie et al 2018 however many studies have found that the influence of climate change and human interference show high nonstationary characteristics as opposed to the original long term stable state representing obvious variation at the interannual scale li et al 2019 sadegh et al 2019 the multi year average scale of runoff change attribution analysis with the budyko framework is not suitable thus an investigation at an interannual scale or a reduction of the multi year scale average condition to an interannual scale from year to year is expected which can provide a positive and efficient tool to implement hydrological simulation and water resource management under the current environment with continuous change the foundation of the budyko hypothesis is the water balance on a muti year scale yang et al 2014a todhunter et al 2020 therefore the budyko framework can be applied to the inter annual scale if we can establish an annual water balance formula which covered the changes in surface and groundwater storage in this study the water balance formula on an annual scale was established first then the elasticity methods based on the budyko framework are used to analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities serving for basin water resource management at an interannual scale it should also be noted that the meaning of parameter n in the decomposition and elasticity method when the scale is reduced to interannual from the average annual it has been mentioned in the choudhury yang formulation that evapotranspiration was only affected by parameter n except for p and e0 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 p and e0 represent the climatic variables and n should represent the sum of all factors affecting evapotranspiration except for the climatic variables zhang et al 2018a in existing studies n mainly refers to catchment characteristics for example soil type topography and vegetation xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014a liu et al 2017 the runoff change triggered by the variation of n is usually seen as the streamflow change driven by land use and land cover lulc change caused by human activities human induced lulc tan and gan 2015 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a abera et al 2019 this idea is valid on a long term scale when the change in long time surface water and groundwater storage is negligible however as shown in some studies human induced lulc hi lulc changes do not cover all the characteristics represented by n saha et al 2020 for example water withdrawal ww may influence the water balance on an interannual scale because it provides other ways of water evaporation except for hi lulc oki and kanae 2006 lettenmaier 2014 it is thus clear that n representing the sum of all factors affecting evapotranspiration except the climatic variables should produce more contribution to runoff change than that from the catchment hi lulc change in other words the impact of water withdrawal on runoff change cannot be ignored and should be incorporated into n the meaning of parameter n is discussed further in section 5 2 wuding river basin wrb is a typical loess plateau terrain with intensive evapotranspiration lower vegetational cover and serious soil erosion shi et al 2019 dang et al 2021 furthermore the runoff wrb is vulnerable to the effects of climate change since the 1960s a series of projects and measures have been implemented due to its serious soil erosion xu and wang 2011 such as the project grain for green on the loess plateau has returned farmland to forest and grassland exceeding 16 000 km2 5000 main check dams and 50 000 small and medium sized check dams were built shi et al 2019 dang et al 2021 the above policy implementation caused a great lulc change to sum up runoff change in wrb is vulnerable to climate change and human activities the contribution analysis of runoff changes in wrb is highly representative which can provide theoretical reference for other similar basins in arid areas that are significantly affected by climate change and human activities to analyze the contribution of interannual runoff variation in wrb the water balance equation of the wrb was first established at the interannual scale then the elasticity method was performed at the corresponding scale to evaluate the contribution of climate change and catchment changes to the runoff climate change is represented by changes in precipitation relative humidity net radiation wind speed and air temperature and the catchment changes are represented by the parameter n mainly including the hi lulc and water withdrawal changes the attribution analysis of groundwater storage change was also performed at the interannual scale because the water balance equation cannot ignore the groundwater storage change at the interannual scale therefore the measured runoff attribution analysis can be performed by combining the elasticity method and attribution analysis of groundwater storage change it can be foreseen that the study will provide scientific and useful information for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management in the wrb loess plateau and enrich the knowledge of contribution analysis of runoff variation which can be referenced by other similar basins across the world 2 methodology 2 1 water balance at the interannual scale generally the water balance in a basin can be expressed in the long term as shown in eq 1 1 r p e where r is the measured runoff in a basin mm p is the precipitation mm and e is the actual evapotranspiration mm at the interannual scale the changes in the amount of surface water and groundwater storage should be introduced into the equation as shown in eq 2 2 r p e δ s δ g where δs is the change in surface water storage mm and δg is the change in groundwater storage mm in arid areas the change in surface water storage is almost negligible because the natural surface water body is very small under the impact of intensive evaporation and the human induced surface water body has little change in different years without multi year regulation reservoir in addition δs can be regarded as approximately zero thus eq 2 can be simplified as follows 3 r r δ g p e where r is the coupled runoff which coupling the measured runoff and the change of groundwater storage assuming that lateral recharge and discharge are equal in the groundwater system the groundwater balance equation is established mainly considering vertical water transfer to estimate δg as follows 4 δ g g r g b g e where gr is the amount of vertical groundwater recharge mm gb is the base flow or discharge to the river mm and ge is the human induced exploitation quantity of groundwater mm to calculate gr the recession curve displacement method proposed by hall was applied in this study including three steps jing et al 2016 1 selecting the main recession curve 2 calculating the recession constant and critical duration and 3 calculating the groundwater recharge the eckhardt filter method was used to calculate gb eckhardt 2008 and the detailed calculation formula is as follows 5 g b t 1 b f i max a r b t 1 1 a b f i max q t 1 a b f i max where gb t and gb t 1 are the baseflow at time t and t 1 respectively q t is the measured runoff at time t a is the filter parameter and bfi max is the maximum value of the baseflow index the filter parameter a was selected as 0 9 as referred to by nathan and mcmahon 1990 and the maximum value of the baseflow index bfi max was selected as 0 5 eckhardt 2008 the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 was employed to calculate the ge due to the data of groundwater extraction are difficult to obtain field investigations have found that water withdrawal for domestic livestock and industry in the wrb is generally supplied by the groundwater owing to the river streamflow having hyper concentration of sediment ma et al 2010b it needs further explanation that the reason of water withdrawal for domestic livestock and industrial is generally supplied by the groundwater the wrb is subject to serious soil erosion the mean annual runoff and sediment loads are 11 2 108 m3 and 1 1 108 t respectively han et al 2019 research jing et al 2022 shows that suspended sediment in the dry season is almost equal to the rainy season which means that the river has a high suspended sediment level throughout the year wrb has no large reservoirs to deposit sediment to meet water quality requirements for domestic livestock and industrial besides the water consumption for domestic livestock and industrial was the exploited groundwater based on the water resources bulletin of yulin city china almost the whole wrb is located in yulin city china the water resources bulletin of yulin can be obtained from the official website of the water conservancy bureau of yulin city https slj yl gov cn index html then the exploited groundwater is estimated by summing the water withdrawal of domestic livestock and industry departments 6 w g wg ind wg d wg ls 7 w g ind vg ind qg ind 8 w g d pop city q city pop coun q coun 9 w g ls ng ls qg ls where wg represents the groundwater exploitation m3 ge 1000wg a and a notes the basin area m2 wgind represents the exploited groundwater for industry and wgd m3 and wgls m3 represent the exploited groundwater for domestic and livestock consumption respectively vgind is the value of industrial production 104cny and qgind is the water withdrawal quota per 104cny industrial production m3 104cny pop city and pop coun are populations of the city and countryside p respectively the q city and q coun are water withdrawal quotas for city and countryside domestic respectively m3 p a ngls is the number of livestock p and qgls is the water withdrawal quota of livestock m3 p a all quotas were ascertained and published by the local government 2 2 elasticity method the budyko hypothesis was postulated by a russian climatologist mikhail ivanovich budyko to analyze regional differences in long term annual average water and energy balances budyko 1961 the partition of water from the atomsphere p between evapotranspiration e and runoff r is treated as a functional balance between the supply of p and the demand for water by the atmosphere potential evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration capacity e 0 roderick and farquhar 2011 in this study the choudhury yang formulation was employed to calculate the e as follows choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 10 e e 0 p p n e 0 n 1 n where e 0 is the potential evapotranspiration and n is the catchment parameter the parameter n can be calculated with eq 10 in combination with the water balance equation eq 2 in eq 10 e0 can be calculated with the p m formula eq 16 p is the precipitation e is the actual evapotranspiration and it can be calculated with eq 2 then the parameter n can be obtained the climate elasticity proposed by yang and yang 2011 was selected to evaluate the runoff change caused by climate change and human activities denoting eq 10 as e f e0 p n the corresponding total differential is as follows 11 d e f p d p f e 0 d e 0 f n d n then the total differential of the water balance equation on the interannual scale r p e is derived and described in combination with eq 11 as follows 12 d r r 1 f p p r dp p f e 0 e 0 r d e 0 e 0 f n n r dn n the climatic elasticities of p e0 and n was given as 13 ε p 1 f p p r 14 ε e 0 f e 0 e 0 r 15 ε n f n n r where ε p ε e 0 and ε n are the elasticities of p e0 and n respectively it is well known that the food and agriculture organization fao corrected the penman monteith formula to calculate e0 in different climate areas gong et al 2006 this equation can be expressed as follows 16 e 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s 1 0 01 r h δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure versus air temperature curve kpa c 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 rn and g are the net radiation and soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 respectively t is the air temperature c es is the saturated vapor pressure kpa rh is the relative humidity and u 2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m m s 1 it can be seen from eq 16 that e0 is strongly influenced by climatic variables the contributions of climatic variables to the change in e0 can then be estimated as follows yang and yang 2011 17 de 0 e 0 r n d r n e 0 t d t e 0 u 2 d u 2 e 0 r h d r h similarly the climate elasticities of different variables can be given according to eqs 13 to 17 18 ε r n ε e 0 r n e 0 e 0 r n 19 ε t ε e 0 1 e 0 e 0 t 20 ε u 2 ε e 0 u 2 e 0 e 0 u 2 21 ε rh ε e 0 rh e 0 e 0 r h where ε r n ε t ε u 2 and ε rh are the climatic elasticities of net radiation air temperature wind speed at a height of 2 m and relative humidity respectively finally the runoff change induced by climatic variable changes and parameter n can be calculated using to the following formula 22 δ r x ε x r x δ x where is the climatic variable or parameter n εx is the elasticity of climatic variables or parameter n and δ r x is the runoff change caused by the corresponding climatic variables or parameter n mm δ r x can be calculated by using the elasticity method considering the driving sources of runoff change δ r is divided into δ r c and δ r h δ r c as the runoff change driven by climatic variables can be similarly calculated by the elasticity coefficients method the value of δ r c is the sum of the runoff changes induced by climate variables p rn t rh and u 2 δ r h is the runoff change driven by human activities parameter n which is represented by δ r n however as mentioned in the introduction the runoff change caused by human activities δ r h needs to be considered induced by hi lulc and ww in addition because groundwater withdrawal was considered in the change of δg the runoff change caused by human activities δ r h needs to be considered to be induced from hi lulc and surface water withdrawal sww sww can be calculated quantitatively using the investigation method hui et al 2012 the hi lulc change induced runoff change δ r lu can be obtained using the following equation 23 δ r lu δ r h δ r sww where δ r sww is the runoff change caused by the sww change which is numerically equivalent to the difference between adjacent data in the sww series that is δ r sww δ s w w sww can be calculated using the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 the sww in the wrb can be divided into irrigation and afforestation water the sww for irrigation was calculated as follows 24 w irr f irr h irr 1000 a where wirr is the sww for irrigation mm f irr is the irrigation area m2 hirr is the sww quota for irrigation m3 m2 a is the basin area the sww for afforestation was calculated using the following equation 25 w aff f aff q aff 1000 a where waff is the water withdrawal for afforestation mm faff is the area of afforestation km2 qaff is the water withdrawal quota of afforestation m3 km2 and a is the basin area total sww was obtained by sum the above items 26 sww w irr w aff the water withdrawal quota was ascertained based on a statistical manual published by the local government sww wirr waff was calculated and transferred to the runoff depth 2 3 measured runoff change attribution according to eq 3 the measured runoff change δr can be expressed as follows 27 δ r δ r δ g where δr is the interannual change in measured runoff δ r is the interannual change in r and δg is the interannual change in groundwater storage δg δ r and δg can be divided into the climate change induced and human activities induced eq 27 can be expressed as follows by coupling the eq 4 28 δ r δ r c δ r h δ g r δ g b δ g e where δ r c is the interannual change of r induced by climate change δ r h is the interannual change of r induced by human activities δ g r is the interannual change of gr δ g b is the interannual change in gb and δ g e is the interannual change in ge in section 2 2 δ r c was divided into runoff change induced by different climate variables and δ r h was divided into δ r sww and δ r lu eq 28 can be expressed as 29 δ r δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ r lu δ r sww δ g r c δ g r h δ g b δ g e where δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ r lu and δ r sww represent the runoff change induced by p rn t u 2 rh hi lulc and sww respectively δ g r c and δ g r h represent the changes in vertical groundwater recharge induced by climate change and human activities respectively δgb represents the changes in base flow and δge represents the changes in the human induced exploitation quantity of groundwater groundwater withdrawal δ g r represents the changes in the vertical recharge of groundwater which is mainly recharged from precipitation in the wrb irrigation water vertically recharges groundwater it is difficult for afforestation water to recharge groundwater because of the intense evaporation and adsorption of plant roots therefore δ g r h which represents the vertical recharge change caused by human activities was mainly the vertical recharge from irrigation water wirr δ g r h can be seen as a change in recharge water induced by irrigation human induced the infiltration recharge coefficient of irrigation of 0 3 in the wrb was ascertained and published by the local government therefore δ g r h can be calculated as follows 31 δ g r h 0 3 w irr then δ g r c is the difference value between δ g r and δ g r h 32 δ g r c δ g r δ g r h 3 runoff change contribution in eq 29 δ g e represents the interannual change of groundwater withdrawal and δ r sww represents the interannual change of surface water withdrawal these two parts can be combined to the water withdrawal ww which represents the total water withdrawal the change in baseflow was influenced by the hi lulc and climatic variables precipitation and temperature are the main climatic variables that influence baseflow dong et al 2014 however the response of baseflow to precipitation can be ignored at an interannual scale dong et al 2014 in addition the influence of temperature on baseflow is mainly in regions with glaciers and frozen soil at high altitudes dong et al 2014 while the loess plateau has no glaciers and less frozen soil therefore we can assume that δ g b was mainly affected by the change in hi lulc in the study area eq 28 can be rewritten as equation 33 therefore the runoff change can be divided into three categories climate change induced ww change induced and hi lulc change induced δ r δ r c δ r lu δ r ww 33 where δr is the measured runoff change δrww is the measured runoff change caused by the change in ww contained surface and groundwater withdrawal δrlu is the measured runoff change caused by the change in hi lulc and δrc is the measured runoff change driven by climate change among them δ r c δ r p δ r rn δ r t δ r u 2 δ r rh δ g r c 34 δ r lu δ r lu δ g b 35 δ r ww δ r sww δ g r h δ g e 36 the attribution analysis framework of measured runoff was shown in fig 1 the contributions of climate variables and two types of human activities hi lulc and ww can be calculated as follows 37 δ r i δ r i s um δ r i 100 where δri is the contribution rate of the ith runoff change driven factor such as climate change and hi lulc change and δri is the runoff change caused by the ith driven factor such as climate change and hi lulc change 4 study area and data 4 1 study area and runoff data the wuding river is the first order tributary of the yellow river the main river in northern shaanxi china most of the wrb belongs to the loess plateau china and has intensive evapotranspiration the annual precipitation and runoff depth of the basin are 366 9 and 35 mm respectively li et al 2007 the location of the wrb is shown in fig 2 the river originates in the northern part of baiyunshan mountain in dingbian county and flows into the yellow river in qingjian county zhou et al 2013 the main channel of the wuding river is 491 km long with a basin area of 30261 km2 and an average slope of 1 97 li et al 2007 the low vegetation coverage and unique soil characteristics in the wrb in the loess plateau cause serious water and soil erosion shi et al 2019 the local government began to make efforts to control water and soil erosion in the late 1970s which greatly changed the lulc in the wrb xu and wang 2011 the runoff series in the wrb has been decreasing continuously since the beginning of the statistical period quantitative attribution analysis of the runoff decrease in the wrb provides guidance for the sustainable development and management of water resources the runoff data used in this study were measured runoff series 1975 2010 from the baijiachuan hydrological gauge which is the control hydrological gauge of the wrb the data were collected from hydrological manuals published by the hydrological bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china and are shown in fig 3 the distribution of hydrological and meteorological gauges used in this study is shown in fig 2 4 2 climatic variables the climatic data of the wrb from 1975 to 2010 were collected at the national climatic information center china http data cma cn surface climatic data were acquired using the tyson polygon method wang et al 2015 in arcgis five climatic variables p rn u2 rh and t were selected to evaluate the contribution of climate variables to changes in runoff in the estimation of net radiation solar radiation was derived from the relative sunshine duration minimum and maximum air temperature and vapor pressure as recommended by the fao of the united nations allen et al 1998 the five climatic variables mentioned above are shown in fig 3 a e 4 3 water withdrawal water withdrawal includes two parts in this paper surface water withdrawal sww and groundwater withdrawal ge the subentry investigation method hui et al 2012 was employed to acquire data on sww and ge as mentioned in section 2 1 and 2 3 sww can be calculated with the eqs 24 to 26 and ge can be obtained based on the eqs 6 to 9 the series of ge and sww are shown in fig 4 sww showed a decreasing trend after 2000 whereas ge grew continually during the study period 5 results 5 1 groundwater storage change the change in groundwater storage can be obtained based on baseflow groundwater recharge and groundwater exploitation the results are shown in fig 5 additionally groundwater recharge was calculated based on the recession curve displacement method jing et al 2016 as shown in fig 5 the mean groundwater recharge was 15 66 mm which is consistent with the conclusion of zhu et al 2010 the data of the exploited groundwater are also drawn in fig 5 and the series of groundwater storage is shown in fig 5 to visually represent the change in groundwater storage the baseflow and exploited groundwater were set as negative values and the sum of the above three items was the groundwater storage change if the groundwater storage variable is positive it means that the groundwater system receives more recharge than the sum of discharge and exploitation in that year and the groundwater storage increases conversely when the recharge of groundwater is less than the sum of discharge and exploitation the groundwater storage variable is negative and the storage of groundwater decreases as shown in fig 5 the groundwater storage series can be divided into two stages before the 1990s the change in groundwater storage fluctuated around zero indicating that the groundwater storage was at a relatively stable level since the 1990s almost all changes in groundwater storage variables have been negative indicating that the sum of discharge and exploitation of groundwater has been continually greater than the recharge accordingly the groundwater storage has continued to decrease this is because the amount of groundwater recharge decreased with the decrease in precipitation during this period additionally the amount of groundwater exploitation increased continuously during this period leading to a continuous decrease in groundwater storage 5 2 elasticities of parameter n and climate variables the coupled runoff r was obtained based on the measured runoff r and the groundwater storage change δg the series of e e 0 and parameter n are shown in fig 6 as can be seen in fig 6 e 0 and e exhibit a slightly decreasing trend whereas n exhibit an increasing trend after calculating the surface climate data fig 3 and parameter n of the wrb the elasticities of climatic variables and parameter n can be calculated to quantitatively evaluate the change in coupled runoff r driven by climatic variables and human activities the elasticities of precipitation εp net radiation εrn air temperature εt wind speed at 2m above ground εu2 relative humidity εrh and parameter n εn on an interannual scale were calculated and are shown in fig 7 it can be seen in fig 7 that the absolute values of all elasticities have increasing trends over time including climatic variables and parameter n comparing the means of the absolute value of elasticities ε p ε n ε rh ε r n ε u 2 ε t this indicates that the change in precipitation has a more significant impact on coupled runoff followed by a change of parameter n which includes the change in sww and hi lulc the lowest impact is from εt that is the effects of air temperature change on runoff were relatively small compared to other climatic variables and human activities 5 3 climate change hi lulc and water withdrawal contribution on measured runoff as shown in fig 1 the measured runoff changes δr contain the coupled runoff changes δ r and groundwater storage changes δg the changes in δ r can be separated into runoff changes driven by the change in climate variables hi lulc and sww in this section the driving factors of δ r will be analyzed first in section 4 3 1 with the elasticity method and the driving factors of δr will be analyzed in section 4 3 2 coupled with the driving factors of δg then all of the driving factors are divided into three main categories measured runoff changes driven by climate change δrc hi lulc change δrlu and water withdrawal change δrww 5 3 1 runoff change δ r analysis with elasticity method the series of runoff change caused by climate variables δ r p δ r rh δ r r n δ r t δ r u 2 and human activities δ r h equivalence with δ r n was listed in fig 8 δ r h was divided into runoff change induced by surface water withdrawal δ r sww and hi lulc change δ r lu the amount of changed runoff δ r caused by the climatic variables hi lulc and water consumption were calculated and are shown in fig 8 it is apparent from fig 8 that δ r was mostly negative which also supports the objective fact that runoff has decreased the changes in p and hi lulc had a significant influence on runoff the value of δ r lu exhibits a decreasing trend among the climatic variables the change in runoff caused by precipitation followed by relative humidity net radiation and wind speed air temperature had a minimal impact 5 3 2 measured runoff change δr analysis after separating the driving factors of δ r the driving factors of the measured runoff change are analyzed in this section δg includes three items δgr δgb and δge δgr δgb and δge are equivalent to the difference of adjacent data in the gr gb and ge series respectively among them δgr can be divided into δ g r c climate change induced and δ g r h human activities induced the series of δ g r c δ g r h δgb and δge are shown in fig 9 the change in the measured runoff δr was divided into δrc δrlu and δrww the series of δrc δrlu and δrww are shown in fig 10 it is obvious from fig 10 that the main driving factors of the measured runoff change are climate and hi lulc change the measured runoff change caused by ww showed a decreasing trend in the wrb with the trend analysis δrlu and δrww exhibited a slight decrease trend in contrast δrc showed an increasing trend this indicates that the runoff change caused by climate change was continuous growth whereas runoff changes caused by human activities decreased the contribution rates of climate change hi lulc and ww δrc δrlu and δrww were calculated and is shown in fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11 the contribution rate of climate change to measured runoff is mostly negative that is climate change caused the measured runoff to decrease in most years this trend is consistent with precipitation which is the largest driving factor of climate variables on runoff change the absolute values of the contribution rate were calculated to compare the driving forces of the above factors δrc δrlu and δrww the absolute values of δrc δrlu and δrww were 4 04 88 56 10 98 90 92 and 0 06 9 67 respectively the trend of the above three variables during the study period was analyzed the results showed that the contribution rate of climate change and ww had an increasing trend conversely the contribution rate of hi lulc had a decreasing trend the trend of the contribution rate of the above three factors is consistent with the trend of runoff change driven by the above factors except for ww the trend difference between the contribution rate of ww and the trend of runoff change driven by ww may be due to the decrease in runoff change at the end of the study period thus δrww exhibits a decreasing trend and δrww has an increasing trend to understand the reason for the change in δrlu which has a decreasing trend we found that a series of soil and water conservation policies were carried out in the wrb li et al 2010 at the beginning of the statistical period which caused significant changes in hi lulc and resulted in large changes in runoff the contribution of hi lulc on measured runoff change consisted by the δ r lu and δ g b among the two above items δ r lu is the dominant variable δ r lu was calculated based on the equation 22 the positive or negative values of contribution rate was mainly affected by the amount change of runoff the contribution rate is positive when the runoff decreased contribution rate is negative when the runoff increased because the elasticities of parameter n is negative the rationality of the results was discussed further in section 5 3 6 discussion 6 1 ecological change tendency and its impacts on runoff changes in climate and hi lulc are the two main driving factors of changes in runoff the change in climate variables is shown visually in fig 3 the ecological hi lulc change tendency in the wrb and its impacts on runoff are discussed in this section the hi lulc changes in the wrb 1980 2010 are shown in table 1 shi et al 2019 as shown in table 1 the area of green land including cropland forestland and grassland and water has significantly increased the change in hi lulc indicates that the wrb has an ecological restoration tendency the reason for the increase in green land and water is the implementation of soil and water erosion control policy issued by the local government in the wrb from the late 1970s the control measures include returning farmland to forests afforestation and the construction of a large number of check dams xu and wang 2011 shi et al 2019 to support this trend of ecological restoration we conducted a trend analysis of normalized vegetation index ndvi data 1982 2010 in the wrb the ndvi data 1982 2010 of the wrb were derived from the ndvi dataset produced by the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms and are shown in fig 12 the mann kendall trend test was performed with the ndvi series and the results showed that the ndvi showed a significant increasing trend which indicated that the vegetation cover increased the trend in ndvi has proved the ecological restoration of the wrb in addition the runoff change caused by hi lulc showed a decreasing trend therefore it can be concluded that the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control restored the ecological environment but led to a decrease in runoff this conclusion is consistent with the results of other studies on ecological restoration which has been found to reduce runoff in most river basins liang et al 2015b zhang et al 2018b 6 2 the meaning of parameter n in the above research the parameter n in the budyko framework is the underlying surface parameter which represents the catchment characteristics including soil type topography and vegetation xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014a liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 the elasticity of parameter n was used to reflect the contribution of lulc change to runoff xu et al 2013 liu et al 2017 besides some researchers pointed out that the parameter n is correlated with climate seasonality except for vegetation variation ning et al 2017 liu et al 2018 then the empirical method to calculate parameter n was established ning et al 2017 liu et al 2018 it can be used for the ungauged basin to estimate the parameter n in the elasticity method however climate seasonality mainly reflects the non uniformity in the intra annual distribution of water and energy ning et al 2017 in this study the parameter n was calculated with the measured meteorologic and hydrologic data besides the contribution analysis of runoff change is concentrated on the interannual scale and the non uniformity in the intra annual distribution of water and energy brought by the climate seasonality can be neglected to separate the effect of climate change and human activities on runoff change some researches defined that the change of the parameter n was attributed to human activities xu et al 2014 yang et al 2022 meantime some research declared that the effect of human activities on runoff change can be obtained by minus the change caused by climate factors using the total change in runoff yang et al 2020 dang et al 2021 considering the above two theories the climatic elasticities were used to quantify the contribution of climate change to runoff variation and the elasticity of parameter n represents the comprehensive influence except for climatic variables this comprehensive effect includes the change in hi lulc and ww this is also consistent with the research conclusions of other scholars yang et al 2022 6 3 the uncertainty of method and data to verify the rationality of the results we compare changes between the simulated runoff and the measured runoff fig 13 which shows a good agreement in most year besides the coefficient of determination r2 dodge 2006 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta and kling 2011 normalized mean square error nmse ritter and munoz carpena 2013 were calculated which were used to evaluate the accuracy of modeled value the results were shown in table 1 as can be seen in table 2 the error is within a reasonable range so it can be considered the model in this paper can simulate the interannual runoff variation accurately in this study there are multiple sources of uncertainty present there is a hypothesis that the parameter n is not correlated with the climatic variables however the complexity of the hydrological process determines that this absolute situation does not exist some researches declared that the parameter n is affected by the climatic variables liu et al 2018 li et al 2020 besides the uncertainties of data will also affect the results of the model such as groundwater storage data and water withdrawal the groundwater storage data was used to establish the water balance equation in section 2 1 the absence of measured groundwater storage data will lead to the uncertainty of the results as for the soil moisture most of the water in the soil evaporates into the atmosphere due to intense evaporation 1000 1400 mm year in the loess plateau tian et al 2018 dang et al 2021 the change of soil moisture on the interannual scale is small which can be ignored in loess plateau liu et al 2009 there may also be some deviation between the ww data calculated by the subentry investigation method and the actual ww data although results existed with a certain uncertainty the elasticity method based on the budyko framework avoided the negative impacts of complicated parameterization and model structure and was an effective tool to assess the responses of runoff changes to climate changes and human activities such as hi lulc and ww 7 conclusion the contribution analysis of interannual runoff change in wrb located in the northern part of the loess plateau china can provide scientific guidance for the conservation of water and soil runoff prediction and sustainable water resource management the water balance equation was established on an interannual scale so that the budyko framework could be applied on an interannual scale the elasticity method based on the budyko framework was used to quantitatively analyze the contribution of climate change and human activities on runoff change in the wrb changes in runoff caused by climate change can be divided into different climate variables combining the data of ww and groundwater storage change the driving factors of measured runoff change can be divided into three categories climate change hi lulc change and ww change in addition the ecological change tendency was analyzed by combining hi lulc and ndvi data the specific conclusions are summarized as follows a groundwater storage is continuing to decrease due to the decrease in groundwater recharge and the continuous increase of groundwater withdrawal since the 1990 s in the wrb b the elasticities of the climate variables were calculated on an interannual scale the results show that among the climatic variables that affected the runoff change the precipitation relative humidity net radiation wind speed air temperature from high contribution to low c the measured runoff change driven factors were divided into three categories climate change hi lulc change and ww change the contribution rate of climate change was greater than that of other factors the contribution rate of ww was minimal and showed an increasing trend which is consistent with the trend of the contribution rate of climate change the contribution rate of hi lulc showed a decreasing trend indicating that the lulc disturbance caused by human activities to runoff reduced across the study period d it was found that green land water area and ndvi significantly increased in the wrb this implies that the ecological environment has a restorative tendency the policy implementation of soil and water erosion control improved the ecological environment to some extent but also led to a decrease in runoff declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research was supported by the joint funds of the national natural science foundation of china

2863,in response to the increasing threats of flash flooding how to generate flood maps in real time has drawn great attention in this study a hybrid ml model was developed for flood map generation with multiple lead times based on the combination of the support vector regression svr method and heun s scheme for numerical correction in which the hydraulic simulation results are used for model training while rainfall and flood sensor data are used as input variables namely the svr rfn model to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model two additional svr models were developed and used as references for comparison the first one used rainfall as input variables without sensor data namely the svr r model and the second one added flood sensor data as input variables without numerical correction namely the svr rf model the three models are tested and compared with a hydraulic model for a historical event in sanyei river basin taiwan using the hydraulic model as the benchmark the hybrid model performed the best by reducing 63 of flood depth error and had the least deterioration of accuracy as lead time increased the svr rf model performed the second by reducing the flood depth errors by 46 whereas the hydraulic model was more accurate than the svr r model in a comparison of flood extents the hydraulic model showed overestimation the svr r model showed significant underestimation whereas the two models with sensor data had balanced predictions the flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied for dike safety evaluation and showed a good capability in forecasting the risk of dike breach keywords hydraulic simulation machine learning numerical correction flood map dike breach data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in response to the rainfall extremes caused by climate change accurate flood maps have become a crucial reference for evaluating the risk of river overtopping dike breach economic loss and social impacts traditionally two dimensional 2d hydraulic models have often been used for flood map generation which are accurate but also very computationally expensive requiring much time and data for construction and calibration in recent years machine learning ml models have been widely adopted for flood forecasting amir et al 2018 chang et al 2019 compared with hydraulic models ml models are faster and more easily established because the relationship between the parameters can be self trained without prior knowledge of physical laws when ml models are applied to flood forecasting disaster related geological and hydrological factors are input as variables to predict flood depths discharges extents and susceptibility kia et al 2011 adopted rainfall slope elevation flow accumulation soil land use and geology as inputs in an artificial neural network ann model for flood depth prediction in the johor river basin malaysia tehrany et al 2014 combined the support vector machine svm and weights of evidence methods to generate flood susceptibility maps from variables such as slope stream power altitude rainfall land use cover and soil type termeh et al 2018 input similar variables to an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for determining flood susceptibility in the jahrom basin iran woznicki et al 2019 used random forest classification to complete the flood maps of the conterminous united states using a digital elevation model soil and land cover as inputs zhao et al 2019 identified the flood prone areas in beijing city from meteorological geographical and anthropogenic factors using a weakly labeled svm model despite having many advantages ml models also have disadvantages first ml models use a data driven method to detect the relationship between inputs and outputs which is a black box process lacking physical interpretability sadler et al 2018 sun and scanlon 2019 moreover the performance of ml models can be greatly reduced due to inadequate training data caused by biases and misses in records ostfeld and solomatine 2008 to cope with these many researchers have recently adopted hydraulic models to generate massive amounts of data on a physical basis for ml training chang et al 2010 built a clustering based hybrid inundation model using the inundation depths simulated by a 2d hydraulic model for ann model training shen and chang 2013 proposed a recurrent configuration of nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs r narx model for real time flood depth forecasting based on a large number of inundation data generated by a 2d inundation model chang et al 2014 proposed an ml model based on hydraulic inundation data and dynamic neural networks to improve flood forecasting during typhoon events in yilan county taiwan jhong et al 2017 used the data simulated by the flo 2d model as the database for svm training and reduced the errors in flood mapping at large lead times bermúdez et al 2019 combined a 2d shallow water equation model and an ml model based on least squares svm regression to predict the maximum flood depth and velocity in a coastal urban area of spain berkhahn et al 2019 adopted the results predicted by a coupled surface sewer hydraulic model as a virtual truth for ann training for predicting the maximum water levels during flash flood events kabir et al 2020 used deep convolutional neural networks to realize rapid flood prediction based on the flood data generated by a 2d hydraulic model lisflood fp yan et al 2021 coupled neural networks and a hydraulic model pcswmm to quickly predict the high risk flood areas in tianjin municipality china hou et al 2021 established a rapid flood forecasting model based on two machine learning algorithms random forest and k nearest neighbor using the simulation results from a 2d hydrodynamic model for fengxi new town china jang et al 2022 combined multiple additive regression trees mart and four orders of runge kutta rk schemes for river stage forecasting in keelung river taiwan and showed that the errors can be greatly reduced even with low order rk schemes benefiting from the recent development of internet of things iot technology some researchers have introduced flood sensor data as inputs for ml model training wu et al 2011 and shen et al 2015 proposed a real time error correction algorithm according to observed flood depths based on an autoregressive moving average model and showed that the accuracy of flood depth forecasting with 3 hour lead times can be effectively improved pan et al 2018 showed that flood disasters can be more accurately predicted using a deep learning based model with the help of monitored flood depths obtained from an unmanned surveillance system via a web platform wu et al 2020 corrected the flood simulation results according to real time observations and reduced the errors in flood depth forecasting by 42 at gauged grids yang and chang 2020 input sensor data into an ml model and reduced the underestimation in flood depth forecasting for the erren river basin taiwan although ml models using hydraulic simulation results for training and flood sensor data for error correction showed positive results such models still inherit parametric and structural errors from the individual elements hostache et al 2011 the reduction in forecasting errors was mainly attributed to the introduction of new information sensor data instead of solving the structural errors lying within the hydraulic and ml models moreover the accuracy of ml models at sensor grids may be improved but the performance in large scale flood extent forecasting and impact assessment remains unevaluated to address these issues a new hybrid ml model was developed in this study through the combination of support vector regression svr and heun s numerical scheme to reduce the structural errors in flood forecasting the hybrid model was tested in a historical event in taiwan and compared with conventional data driven ml models without the hybrid treatment for practical application the flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied to evaluate the risk of dike breach caused by river overtopping 2 study area and events the sanyei river basin fig 1 located in the southwest taiwan was selected as the study area having a total area of 63 km2 an elevation ranging between 2 and 30 m and an average slope of 1 1 700 the study basin has a canyon shaped topography descending southwestward with high hills on the east and west sides the sanyei river flows through densely populated areas in tainan city which has an average annual rainfall of 1 779 mm in which 90 is accumulated from may to september after rainfall surface runoff flows into the nearest side ditches and finally into the sanyei river through a total of 17 sub drainage systems designed for flood protection under 10 year return period due to the flat topography and insufficient water conveyance rainfall water cannot be easily drained by gravity which often causes severe flooding during typhoon seasons for example typhoon morakot in 2009 brought a rainfall with return period larger than 200 years and the resulting flood areas amounted to 2350 ha with flood depths of 0 5 m 0 6 m the rainstorm event on august 13 2019 namely the 0813 event brought a rainfall exceeding 328 mm within 12 h and caused flood areas of 237 ha with flood depths between 0 3 m and 0 7 m we selected 24 events from 2013 to 2018 with the top 12 hour rainfall amounts at rende rainfall station for model training and the 0813 event in 2019 for model testing as listed in table 1 the dimensionless cumulative rainfall curves for the historical events and the rainfall hyetograph for the 0813 event are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the flood depth data for the 0813 event were collected at the 10 sensors in fig 1 installed by the water resources agency since 2019 on the roadside to measure real time flood depth based on iot technology in which sensors 5 6 8 9 and 10 are installed beside a drainage channel and the rest are distributed in residential areas the flood sensors measured the water level according to the variation of capacitance within a cylinder with a probe installed inside and transmitted the data via radio frequency and lorawan 3g technologies although the flood sensors are accurate in water level measurement with millimeter accuracy they are quite expensive to install and maintain on a large scale therefore the sensors were only installed at a few flood prone locations and served as a support for model calibration and flood warning 3 methodology the study flowchart is shown in fig 3 initially the 24 historical rainfall events between 2013 and 2018 were input into a 2d hydraulic model to generate flood depth datasets for ml training based on the svr theorem since the concentration time is about 90 min for each sub drainage system three models based on svr were developed to forecast the flood depths with 30 60 and 90 min of lead time for each grid in the basin domain the first model used rainfalls as the only variable for flood depth forecasting namely the svr r model the second one used rainfall and the flood depths observed by iot sensors as variables for flood depth forecasting namely the svr rf model which has been studied by a few researchers e g yang and chang 2020 the third one is a hybrid model that coupled the svr rf model with a heun s scheme for numerical correction using both rainfall and sensor data as variables namely the svr rfn model which is firstly proposed in this study the time series of flood depth and the maximum flood extent forecasted by different models were compared for the 0813 event in 2019 finally a dike breach index was defined and the results generated by the svr rfn model was applied to evaluate the dike safety during the 0813 event 3 1 2d hydraulic model to generate flood data for ml training the cos flow model coupled overland sewer flow model developed by jang et al 2018 was adopted which has been well validated and applied in urban areas in the prediction of flood depth and extent jang et al 2019 hsiao et al 2021 jang and chang 2022 the cos flow model comprises a 2d overland flow module and a 1d channel flow module in which the 2d module solves the shallow water equations as below 1 h t u h x v h y q q a o 2 u t u u x v u y g h z x g u n x 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg 3 v t u v x v v y g h z y g v n y 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg where u and v are flow velocities in x and y directions respectively h is water depth q is the effective rainfall z is the ground elevation n x and n y are manning s coefficients in x and y directions respectively q is the discharge received from the 1d module the alternate direction explicit method and courant friedrichs lewy restrictions courant et al 1967 were used to improve numerical accuracy and stability respectively in this study we used a structured mesh system with a grid size of 20 m and the ground elevation z at each grid center was interpolated from a lidar derived digital elevation model dem with 20 m resolution which is free and accessible for anyone https data gov tw dataset 35430 the 1d channel flow module also solves the shallow water equation as below 4 a t v a s q l 5 v a t v a s g a h s z s s n s 2 v v r 4 3 where a is the cross sectional area of channel flow v is the flow velocity in channels r is hydraulic radius h s is flow depth in channels z s is channel bed elevation n s is manning s coefficient in s direction the numerical scheme is constructed using the implicit backward euler method ascher and petzold 1998 and the picard iteration method picard 1890 a parallel computation method using the openmp open multi processing platform was adopted to speed up the routing according to the calibration conducted by jang et al 2018 for urban flood simulation the manning s coefficients for the 2d module n x and n y are 0 035 and the manning s coefficient for the 1d module n s is 0 017 the value of q is determined by weir or orifice equation based on the relative hydraulic heads between overland and channel flows in which the weir and the orifice coefficients are set as 0 48 and 0 57 respectively 3 2 ml models in this study the ml models are established based on the svr theorem proposed by vapnik 1995 as a category of svm the svr theorem finds a linear regression function in a high dimensional feature space where the input data are mapped via nonlinear kernel functions according to hong et al 2018 and tien and hoang 2017 the radial basis kernel has better performance in hydrological forecasting which transformed the input data into datasets with normal distribution characteristics 6 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j 2 where x i and x j are the input data pairs γ is a coefficient which affects the concentration of data after mapping the svr regression function can be expressed as 7 f x ω x b where x r n is the input vector ω r n is the coefficient vector b r is the intercept to optimize the ω and b in eq 7 the objective function is 8 l ω b argmin ω b 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m l ε f x i y i where c is the penalty parameter large c values may result in overfitting and vice versa l ε is the ε insensitive loss function which is defined as 9 l ε z 0 z ε z ε o t h e r w i s e where ε is a parameter to be determined if the ε value is too small too many support vectors will be included and overfitting may occur and vice versa in the training stage the best parameter values are determined using a grid search algorithm by testing the c value from 1 to 100 and the ε values from 0 to 0 003 with ten divisions respectively to improve training efficiency the input data are normalized using z score standardization before training 10 z x μ σ n 0 1 σ 0 where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of sample data respectively 3 2 1 svr r model the svr r model only uses rainfall as variables which can be expressed as 11 h i t 1 h i t 3 f 1 r t 3 r t 3 where i represents the serial number of grids in the hydraulic model with 156 945 grids in total h i t 1 h i t 3 are the forecasted flood depths at grid i for t 1 t 3 respectively r t 3 r t 3 are the rainfalls at rende station for t 3 t 3 respectively since the flood depths are forecasted with a temporal division of 30 min the lead time increases by 30 min when t increases by 1 to rule out the uncertainty from rainfall forecast and objectively assess the performance of ml models the forecasted rainfall r t 1 r t 3 are given as the observations at rende station in this study for the historical events in practical application such as flood warning the r t 1 r t 3 can be obtained in advance from the predictions of weather forecasting models released by the central weather bureau in taiwan 3 2 1 1 svr rf model in addition to rainfall the svr rf model adds the flood depths measured by iot sensors as variables 12 h i t 1 h i t 3 f 2 r t 3 r t 3 h j t 3 h j t where j is the serial number of sensors in fig 1 with 10 sensors in total h j t 3 h j t are the observed flood depths at sensor j for t 3 t respectively because the iot sensors have only been in operation since 2019 the observed flood depths were not available during the training events for model training the values of h j t 3 h j t are given as the flood depths simulated by the hydraulic model at the grid overlaying sensor j namely the pseudo sensor data shown in fig 3 as for the 0813 event in 2019 used for model testing the values of h j t 3 h j t are given by the real sensors the inclusion of pseudo sensor data forced the svr rf model to generate predictions closer to the simulations at the sensor grids in this case the relative differences are more important than the absolute errors since the simulated flood depths are regarded as pseudo facts when the pseudo sensor data were replaced by iot sensor data the svr rf model will force the predictions to fit the observation at the sensor grids as well 3 2 1 2 svr rfn model to improve model accuracy the svr rfn used the heun s method to correct the flood depths predicted by svr rf the heun s method also referred to as modified euler scheme is a commonly used numerical scheme to improve the accuracy of the euler method the euler method predicts the flood depth y t 1 at t 1 with first order accuracy using the following equation conte and de boor 1980 13 y t 1 y t δ t f t y t where f t y t k 1 is the temporal derivative of flood depth at t δ t is the time increment since the flood depth derivative may vary with time the heun s method modifies eq 13 as hornbeck 1975 14 y t 1 y t δ t 2 f t y t f t 1 y t 1 where y t 1 is the forecasted flood depth at t 1 with second order accuracy f t 1 y t 1 k 2 represents the reforecasted flood depth derivative at t 1 using the y t 1 predicted in eq 13 combining the svr rf model and heun s method we used finite difference slope approximation to calculate the flood depth derivatives as below 15 k 1 h i t 1 h i t δ t 16 k 2 h i t 2 h i t 1 δ t where h i t is the observed flood depth at grid i for t h i t 1 is the forecasted flood depth at grid i for t 1 as defined in eq 12 h i t 2 is the reforecasted flood depth at grid i for t 2 as below 17 h i t 2 f 2 r t 3 r t 3 h j t 2 h j t h i t 1 eq 17 is similar to eq 12 by replacing the h i t 3 with the h i t 1 obtained from the svr rf model by doing so the svr rfn model corrects the svr rf s predictions without the need to establish a new ml model that saves a lot of training time introducing eq 15 eq 16 and eq 17 into eq 14 the svr rfn forecasts the flood depth at grid i for t 1 as below 18 h i t 1 h i t h i t 2 2 with this treatment the errors in k 1 and k 2 caused by the misestimation of h i t 1 offset and the predictions are improved through the reforecasting process since the h i t and h i t 2 are determined based on the same rainfall variables r t 3 r t 3 as shown in eq 12 and eq 17 respectively without adding new rainfall information the flood depth variations at t and t 1 would show a smooth and continuous pattern which satisfies the requirement of applying heun s method following the same steps and shifting the time steps for h i and h i in eqs 15 18 the flood depths for t 2 and t 3 can be obtained sequentially 3 3 performance indicators three indicators are used to evaluate model performance on flood depth forecasting at sensor grids fu et al 2019 including root mean square error rmse coefficient of efficiency ce and error in peak flood depth epd 19 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 20 c e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 e p d y p y p y p where n is the number of data points y i is the forecasted flood depth y i is the observed flood depth y is the average of the observed flood depth y p is the peak value of the forecasted flood depth y p is the peak value of the observed flood depth the rmse represents the absolute error between the predicted and observed values in unit of meters the ce and epd are dimensionless and represent the prediction errors relative to the observations the model has smaller prediction errors when the values of rmse and epd approach zero and it has a better prediction of flood depth patterns when the value of ce approaches one to evaluate the accuracy of flood extent forecasting the following indicators are used jang et al 2018 jang et al 2019 22 o c r r c r m f c 23 h t r r r m 24 f a r f f c where r is the area flooded and correctly predicted by the model m is the area flooded but not predicted by the model f is the area not flooded but falsely predicted by the model and c is the area not flooded and correctly predicted by the model in the calculation of the indicators the flood extent data investigated by water resource agency wra 2022 are used as the benchmark the ocr htr and far represent the overall correctness rate hit rate and false alarm rate respectively the flood extents are more accurately predicted when htr and ocr approach 1 and far approaches 0 3 4 dike breach index overtopping caused by extreme floods which leads to the erosion on dike crest and slope sliding has been shown one of the major causes for dike breach singh 1996 coleman et al 2002 schmocker and hager 2010 to evaluate the risk of dike breach caused by water overtopping a dike breach index i d is defined as 25 i d a o a r where a r is the plane area of river channels bounded by dikes a o is the water surface areas in river channels with flood depths higher than neighboring dike heights ranging between 0 and 1 a higher value of i d represents that a larger portion of river sections are at dike breach risk 4 results 4 1 flood depth comparison in fig 4 the time series of flood depth forecasted by the numerical and three svr models are compared at 10 sensor grids and three lead times for the 0813 event among the models the hydraulic model used a stepwise routing algorithm so that the results are independent of lead time whereas the svr models are lead time dependent because different models were established for different lead times the flood depths predicted by the hydraulic model were more fluctuated and overestimated at peaks especially at sensors 1 4 and 10 on the contrary the svr r model had the mildest variation of flood depth and understated the peaks at almost all sensor grids this implies that rainfall is an insensitive predictor that tends to smooth the flood depths in space and time with the inclusion of sensor data the flood depths predicted by svr rf and svr rfn coincided better with the observations with fewer fluctuations and deviations in the peaks however the flood depths predicted by the two models showed a time lag in comparison with observations at sensors 5 8 especially at large lead times this may be caused by the increase of time difference between the observed and predicted flood depths in eq 12 as lead time increased the svr rfn model outperformed the svr rf model by having smaller error increments as the lead time increased showing that heun s numerical correction increases the reliability of long term forecasting fig 5 shows the comparison of rmse ce and epd for the hydraulic model and three svr models at 10 sensor grids and three lead times at t 1 the svr rfn had the smallest rmse the largest ce and the smallest epd at all sensor grids except at sensor 6 where the epd was slightly larger than the hydraulic model the svr rf had the second best prediction the numerical and svr r models performed the worst the hydraulic model had the largest rmse and epd at sensors 1 and 3 due to overestimation whereas svr r had the largest rmse and epd at sensors 4 6 8 and 10 due to underestimation at sensor 9 the ce values suddenly dropped to 6 for the numerical and svr r models because the flood depths leveled off without varying with time for each models and lead time table 2 summaries the average values of rmse ce and epd at the 10 sensor grids at all lead times the average values of rmse and epd decreased from the svr r hydraulic model and svr rf to svr rfn whereas the values of average ce decreased reversely the flood depth patterns were not well predicted by the svr r and hydraulic models for having negative average ce values whereas the svr rfn model had positive ce values at all lead times as lead time increased the accuracies of the svr models decreased especially for the svr rf model indicating that the improvements made by the inclusion of sensor data decreased for long term forecasting when the lead time increased from t 1 to t 3 the accuracies of svr rf model decreased significantly with rmse increased from 0 08 m to 0 13 m ce decreased from 0 58 to 0 51 and epd increased from 0 15 m to 0 27 m whereas the svr rfn model had less deterioration in flood depth prediction as lead time increased with a slight increase in rmse from 0 05 m to 0 10 m a smaller decrease in ce from 0 78 to 0 16 and even a decrease in epd from 0 11 m to 0 05 m 4 2 flood extent comparison since the svr models predicted the flood depths for all grids in the study basin the flood extents defined as the area with maximum flood depth higher than 0 3 m above which the water level exceeds children s knees and limits their ability to escape liu et al 2021 can be delineated and compared with the investigation for different lead times as shown in fig 6 overall the flood extents were the largest for the numerical smallest for the svr r model and median for the two models considering sensor data the investigated flood extents were mostly in the upstream areas marked by the black lines in fig 6 in the upper part of the basins but the forecasted flood extents show that there was significant flooding in the downstream areas as well this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the downstream areas are mostly fish farms and ponds which retain water in normal times and tend to be ruled out in flood investigations unlike the sensor flood depths the flood extents for each model did not show many discrepancies for different lead times this is because the flood extents were delineated as the area of grids with maximum flood depths exceeding a threshold which blurred the differences in flood depth variation with lead times table 2 shows the performance indicators for flood extent forecasting at first glance the svr r and the hydraulic models seem to perform the best and the worst for having the highest and lowest ocr values respectively this may not be true because the high ocr values of the svr r model came from the decrease in far not from the increase in htr the htr values for the svr r model range between 0 19 and 0 22 indicating that about 80 of flood extents were unpredicted by the svr r model in contrast the far value for hydraulic model may be slightly higher but a 64 accuracy rate of correct predictions htr 0 64 is more preferable for warning applications the performances of svr rf and svr rfn were similar and range between the svr and hydraulic models in flood extent forecasting compared with the svr r model the svr rf and svr rfn models greatly increased htr to about 0 5 by slightly sacrificing far showing that the inclusion of sensor data at limited points improves regional flood prediction 4 3 dike safety evaluation we adopted the hybrid model i e the svr rfn model to evaluate the dike safety during 0813 event since it had been shown superior in the prediction of flood depth and area fig 7 shows the temporal variations of dike breach index predicted by the hybrid model with three lead times started with a low value below 0 1 at 3 00 the dike breach index increased rapidly with rainfall since 5 00 peaked at 8 00 with a value around 0 6 and then decreased to nearly 0 3 at 12 00 in the rising limb between 5 00 and 8 00 the values of dike breach index became larger as lead time increased in the falling limb the dike breach index for t 3 declined more rapidly and became smaller than that for t 2 sine 9 30 this implies that the relative magnitude of dike breach index for different lead times can be used as a signal to determine if dike breach risk reaches its peak in this case warning should be given between 5 00 and 9 00 at which the dike breach index increased from t 1 t 2 to t 3 fig 8 demonstrates the relative flood depths maximum flood depth minus dike height predicted by the hybrid model for t 3 in which the two sections squared by blue dash lines are at higher risk of dike breach for having higher relative flood depths the one in the middle stream is located at confluence of sanyei river main stream and rende drainage while the downstream one is a meandering channel with a mild slope 5 discussions 5 1 novelty and strength to generate 2d flood maps physics based hydraulic models are more accurate but time consuming whereas ml models are faster but lack of physical considerations this study demonstrated that the hybrid ml model can outperform conventional ml models through the incorporation of flood sensor data and the combination with numerical correction schemes this coincides with the findings in previous studies which improved the accuracy of flood depth forecasting through the inclusion of sensor data e g pan et al 2018 wu et al 2020 yang and chang 2020 and numerical schemes jang et al 2022 the methodology in this study was firstly proposed and applied for 2d flood map generation which pointed out a new direction to combine ml and numerical methods in solving practical flood problems using an existing svr based ml model as a plugin prediction engine and forcing it under heun s numerical scheme the hybrid model required no additional training so it preserved the efficiency of ml models and the accuracy of hydraulic models at the same time in other words any existing ml models and numerical schemes can be combined in this manner to establish new hybrid models 5 2 applicability compared with the hydraulic model the hybrid model was not only more accurate but also required much less computation time in generating flood maps on an intel core i7 8700 processor with 16 gb of ram the hydraulic svr rf and svr rfn models took 86 min 506 s and 1 006 s respectively in a 12 hour forecasting of flood depth for the 156 945 grids in the study area using the svr rfn model the rmse reduced by 29 the ce increased by 744 and the epd reduced by 56 in average for the three lead times compared with those for the svr rf model these obvious decreases of errors showed that the heun s method was worth taking because the increased computational time 500 s only occupied 9 of the flood warning lead time 1 5 h this means that large scale long term and real time forecasting of flood maps can be realized and used for emergency response in this study we used 2d flood maps to instantaneously identify the river sections with higher risk of dike breach caused by water overtopping which in the past can only be realized using cross section average information obtained from simplified one dimensional models the methodology proposed in this study is general and can be applied in other cases by reconstructing the numerical and ml models with localized data in different areas 5 3 future work in this study the hybrid model was established based on the combination of svr and heun s scheme which can be replaced by other ml and numerical methods to find the best combinations due to the late installation of rainfall station and flood sensors the temporal sample sizes in this research are only 576 and 24 for training and testing respectively based on the 25 historical events between 2013 and 2019 this may not fully cover all hydrological phenomena in the system especially when rainfall is expected to be more extreme under climate change in the future model accuracy can be improved by including more events iot sensor data physical laws and regularization approaches in the construction of ml methods seifert and rasp 2020 beucler et al 2020 brenowitz et al 2020 although model accuracy declines in long term predictions further studies on extending the lead time are worth doing for flood early warning finally this research demonstrated the application of flood mapping for dike safety evaluation which can be combined with social economic factors in the future for real time flood loose risk estimations 6 conclusions in this study we developed three svr based models for flood forecasting with 30 60 and 90 min of lead time including 1 the svr r model which used rainfalls as variables and hydraulic simulation results for model training based on the svr theorem 2 the svr rf model which was based on the svr r model but with added iot sensor observed flood depths as variables and 3 the svr rfn model which hybrid the svr rf model and heun s scheme for numerical correction the svr and hydraulic models were compared with the observations in the prediction of flood depths and flood extents for a historical event in the sanyei river basin taiwan from the comparison of flood depths patterns and peaks at sensor grids the svr r model had the largest errors followed by the hydraulic model the svr rf model and the svr rfn model the svr r model had the highest errors because it used hydraulic results for training and only rainfalls as the input without introducing new information so it inherited inaccuracies from both the hydraulic and svr models by adding flood sensor data as input the errors in flood depth prediction greatly decreased by half for the svr rf model however this improvement made by the inclusion of sensor data reduced rapidly as lead time increased through the combination with heun s scheme the svr rfn model outperformed the svr rf model in long term forecasting because the numerical correction reduced the errors in temporal routing in the prediction of flood extents the svr r model seriously underestimated the hydraulic model overestimated and the svr rf and svr rfn had more balanced predictions this means that even by including limited and scattered sensor data regional flood predictions can be improved overall the svr rfn model not only performed better at the prediction of flood peaks but also at the full phenomena of flood depth patterns compared with the observations the entire variations of flood depth predicted by the svr rfn model had the least errors the highest correction and the least deterioration as lead time increased in the evaluation of dike system safety the svr rfn model showed a good capability in capturing the rising and falling patterns of dike breach risk which were expected to be underestimated and overestimated by the svr r and svr rf respectively credit authorship contribution statement jiun huei jang methodology supervision project administration visualization cheng yu hsieh software visualization tse wei li writing

2863,in response to the increasing threats of flash flooding how to generate flood maps in real time has drawn great attention in this study a hybrid ml model was developed for flood map generation with multiple lead times based on the combination of the support vector regression svr method and heun s scheme for numerical correction in which the hydraulic simulation results are used for model training while rainfall and flood sensor data are used as input variables namely the svr rfn model to evaluate the performance of the hybrid model two additional svr models were developed and used as references for comparison the first one used rainfall as input variables without sensor data namely the svr r model and the second one added flood sensor data as input variables without numerical correction namely the svr rf model the three models are tested and compared with a hydraulic model for a historical event in sanyei river basin taiwan using the hydraulic model as the benchmark the hybrid model performed the best by reducing 63 of flood depth error and had the least deterioration of accuracy as lead time increased the svr rf model performed the second by reducing the flood depth errors by 46 whereas the hydraulic model was more accurate than the svr r model in a comparison of flood extents the hydraulic model showed overestimation the svr r model showed significant underestimation whereas the two models with sensor data had balanced predictions the flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied for dike safety evaluation and showed a good capability in forecasting the risk of dike breach keywords hydraulic simulation machine learning numerical correction flood map dike breach data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction in response to the rainfall extremes caused by climate change accurate flood maps have become a crucial reference for evaluating the risk of river overtopping dike breach economic loss and social impacts traditionally two dimensional 2d hydraulic models have often been used for flood map generation which are accurate but also very computationally expensive requiring much time and data for construction and calibration in recent years machine learning ml models have been widely adopted for flood forecasting amir et al 2018 chang et al 2019 compared with hydraulic models ml models are faster and more easily established because the relationship between the parameters can be self trained without prior knowledge of physical laws when ml models are applied to flood forecasting disaster related geological and hydrological factors are input as variables to predict flood depths discharges extents and susceptibility kia et al 2011 adopted rainfall slope elevation flow accumulation soil land use and geology as inputs in an artificial neural network ann model for flood depth prediction in the johor river basin malaysia tehrany et al 2014 combined the support vector machine svm and weights of evidence methods to generate flood susceptibility maps from variables such as slope stream power altitude rainfall land use cover and soil type termeh et al 2018 input similar variables to an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for determining flood susceptibility in the jahrom basin iran woznicki et al 2019 used random forest classification to complete the flood maps of the conterminous united states using a digital elevation model soil and land cover as inputs zhao et al 2019 identified the flood prone areas in beijing city from meteorological geographical and anthropogenic factors using a weakly labeled svm model despite having many advantages ml models also have disadvantages first ml models use a data driven method to detect the relationship between inputs and outputs which is a black box process lacking physical interpretability sadler et al 2018 sun and scanlon 2019 moreover the performance of ml models can be greatly reduced due to inadequate training data caused by biases and misses in records ostfeld and solomatine 2008 to cope with these many researchers have recently adopted hydraulic models to generate massive amounts of data on a physical basis for ml training chang et al 2010 built a clustering based hybrid inundation model using the inundation depths simulated by a 2d hydraulic model for ann model training shen and chang 2013 proposed a recurrent configuration of nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs r narx model for real time flood depth forecasting based on a large number of inundation data generated by a 2d inundation model chang et al 2014 proposed an ml model based on hydraulic inundation data and dynamic neural networks to improve flood forecasting during typhoon events in yilan county taiwan jhong et al 2017 used the data simulated by the flo 2d model as the database for svm training and reduced the errors in flood mapping at large lead times bermúdez et al 2019 combined a 2d shallow water equation model and an ml model based on least squares svm regression to predict the maximum flood depth and velocity in a coastal urban area of spain berkhahn et al 2019 adopted the results predicted by a coupled surface sewer hydraulic model as a virtual truth for ann training for predicting the maximum water levels during flash flood events kabir et al 2020 used deep convolutional neural networks to realize rapid flood prediction based on the flood data generated by a 2d hydraulic model lisflood fp yan et al 2021 coupled neural networks and a hydraulic model pcswmm to quickly predict the high risk flood areas in tianjin municipality china hou et al 2021 established a rapid flood forecasting model based on two machine learning algorithms random forest and k nearest neighbor using the simulation results from a 2d hydrodynamic model for fengxi new town china jang et al 2022 combined multiple additive regression trees mart and four orders of runge kutta rk schemes for river stage forecasting in keelung river taiwan and showed that the errors can be greatly reduced even with low order rk schemes benefiting from the recent development of internet of things iot technology some researchers have introduced flood sensor data as inputs for ml model training wu et al 2011 and shen et al 2015 proposed a real time error correction algorithm according to observed flood depths based on an autoregressive moving average model and showed that the accuracy of flood depth forecasting with 3 hour lead times can be effectively improved pan et al 2018 showed that flood disasters can be more accurately predicted using a deep learning based model with the help of monitored flood depths obtained from an unmanned surveillance system via a web platform wu et al 2020 corrected the flood simulation results according to real time observations and reduced the errors in flood depth forecasting by 42 at gauged grids yang and chang 2020 input sensor data into an ml model and reduced the underestimation in flood depth forecasting for the erren river basin taiwan although ml models using hydraulic simulation results for training and flood sensor data for error correction showed positive results such models still inherit parametric and structural errors from the individual elements hostache et al 2011 the reduction in forecasting errors was mainly attributed to the introduction of new information sensor data instead of solving the structural errors lying within the hydraulic and ml models moreover the accuracy of ml models at sensor grids may be improved but the performance in large scale flood extent forecasting and impact assessment remains unevaluated to address these issues a new hybrid ml model was developed in this study through the combination of support vector regression svr and heun s numerical scheme to reduce the structural errors in flood forecasting the hybrid model was tested in a historical event in taiwan and compared with conventional data driven ml models without the hybrid treatment for practical application the flood maps generated by the hybrid model were applied to evaluate the risk of dike breach caused by river overtopping 2 study area and events the sanyei river basin fig 1 located in the southwest taiwan was selected as the study area having a total area of 63 km2 an elevation ranging between 2 and 30 m and an average slope of 1 1 700 the study basin has a canyon shaped topography descending southwestward with high hills on the east and west sides the sanyei river flows through densely populated areas in tainan city which has an average annual rainfall of 1 779 mm in which 90 is accumulated from may to september after rainfall surface runoff flows into the nearest side ditches and finally into the sanyei river through a total of 17 sub drainage systems designed for flood protection under 10 year return period due to the flat topography and insufficient water conveyance rainfall water cannot be easily drained by gravity which often causes severe flooding during typhoon seasons for example typhoon morakot in 2009 brought a rainfall with return period larger than 200 years and the resulting flood areas amounted to 2350 ha with flood depths of 0 5 m 0 6 m the rainstorm event on august 13 2019 namely the 0813 event brought a rainfall exceeding 328 mm within 12 h and caused flood areas of 237 ha with flood depths between 0 3 m and 0 7 m we selected 24 events from 2013 to 2018 with the top 12 hour rainfall amounts at rende rainfall station for model training and the 0813 event in 2019 for model testing as listed in table 1 the dimensionless cumulative rainfall curves for the historical events and the rainfall hyetograph for the 0813 event are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the flood depth data for the 0813 event were collected at the 10 sensors in fig 1 installed by the water resources agency since 2019 on the roadside to measure real time flood depth based on iot technology in which sensors 5 6 8 9 and 10 are installed beside a drainage channel and the rest are distributed in residential areas the flood sensors measured the water level according to the variation of capacitance within a cylinder with a probe installed inside and transmitted the data via radio frequency and lorawan 3g technologies although the flood sensors are accurate in water level measurement with millimeter accuracy they are quite expensive to install and maintain on a large scale therefore the sensors were only installed at a few flood prone locations and served as a support for model calibration and flood warning 3 methodology the study flowchart is shown in fig 3 initially the 24 historical rainfall events between 2013 and 2018 were input into a 2d hydraulic model to generate flood depth datasets for ml training based on the svr theorem since the concentration time is about 90 min for each sub drainage system three models based on svr were developed to forecast the flood depths with 30 60 and 90 min of lead time for each grid in the basin domain the first model used rainfalls as the only variable for flood depth forecasting namely the svr r model the second one used rainfall and the flood depths observed by iot sensors as variables for flood depth forecasting namely the svr rf model which has been studied by a few researchers e g yang and chang 2020 the third one is a hybrid model that coupled the svr rf model with a heun s scheme for numerical correction using both rainfall and sensor data as variables namely the svr rfn model which is firstly proposed in this study the time series of flood depth and the maximum flood extent forecasted by different models were compared for the 0813 event in 2019 finally a dike breach index was defined and the results generated by the svr rfn model was applied to evaluate the dike safety during the 0813 event 3 1 2d hydraulic model to generate flood data for ml training the cos flow model coupled overland sewer flow model developed by jang et al 2018 was adopted which has been well validated and applied in urban areas in the prediction of flood depth and extent jang et al 2019 hsiao et al 2021 jang and chang 2022 the cos flow model comprises a 2d overland flow module and a 1d channel flow module in which the 2d module solves the shallow water equations as below 1 h t u h x v h y q q a o 2 u t u u x v u y g h z x g u n x 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg 3 v t u v x v v y g h z y g v n y 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg where u and v are flow velocities in x and y directions respectively h is water depth q is the effective rainfall z is the ground elevation n x and n y are manning s coefficients in x and y directions respectively q is the discharge received from the 1d module the alternate direction explicit method and courant friedrichs lewy restrictions courant et al 1967 were used to improve numerical accuracy and stability respectively in this study we used a structured mesh system with a grid size of 20 m and the ground elevation z at each grid center was interpolated from a lidar derived digital elevation model dem with 20 m resolution which is free and accessible for anyone https data gov tw dataset 35430 the 1d channel flow module also solves the shallow water equation as below 4 a t v a s q l 5 v a t v a s g a h s z s s n s 2 v v r 4 3 where a is the cross sectional area of channel flow v is the flow velocity in channels r is hydraulic radius h s is flow depth in channels z s is channel bed elevation n s is manning s coefficient in s direction the numerical scheme is constructed using the implicit backward euler method ascher and petzold 1998 and the picard iteration method picard 1890 a parallel computation method using the openmp open multi processing platform was adopted to speed up the routing according to the calibration conducted by jang et al 2018 for urban flood simulation the manning s coefficients for the 2d module n x and n y are 0 035 and the manning s coefficient for the 1d module n s is 0 017 the value of q is determined by weir or orifice equation based on the relative hydraulic heads between overland and channel flows in which the weir and the orifice coefficients are set as 0 48 and 0 57 respectively 3 2 ml models in this study the ml models are established based on the svr theorem proposed by vapnik 1995 as a category of svm the svr theorem finds a linear regression function in a high dimensional feature space where the input data are mapped via nonlinear kernel functions according to hong et al 2018 and tien and hoang 2017 the radial basis kernel has better performance in hydrological forecasting which transformed the input data into datasets with normal distribution characteristics 6 k x i x j e x p γ x i x j 2 where x i and x j are the input data pairs γ is a coefficient which affects the concentration of data after mapping the svr regression function can be expressed as 7 f x ω x b where x r n is the input vector ω r n is the coefficient vector b r is the intercept to optimize the ω and b in eq 7 the objective function is 8 l ω b argmin ω b 1 2 ω 2 c i 1 m l ε f x i y i where c is the penalty parameter large c values may result in overfitting and vice versa l ε is the ε insensitive loss function which is defined as 9 l ε z 0 z ε z ε o t h e r w i s e where ε is a parameter to be determined if the ε value is too small too many support vectors will be included and overfitting may occur and vice versa in the training stage the best parameter values are determined using a grid search algorithm by testing the c value from 1 to 100 and the ε values from 0 to 0 003 with ten divisions respectively to improve training efficiency the input data are normalized using z score standardization before training 10 z x μ σ n 0 1 σ 0 where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of sample data respectively 3 2 1 svr r model the svr r model only uses rainfall as variables which can be expressed as 11 h i t 1 h i t 3 f 1 r t 3 r t 3 where i represents the serial number of grids in the hydraulic model with 156 945 grids in total h i t 1 h i t 3 are the forecasted flood depths at grid i for t 1 t 3 respectively r t 3 r t 3 are the rainfalls at rende station for t 3 t 3 respectively since the flood depths are forecasted with a temporal division of 30 min the lead time increases by 30 min when t increases by 1 to rule out the uncertainty from rainfall forecast and objectively assess the performance of ml models the forecasted rainfall r t 1 r t 3 are given as the observations at rende station in this study for the historical events in practical application such as flood warning the r t 1 r t 3 can be obtained in advance from the predictions of weather forecasting models released by the central weather bureau in taiwan 3 2 1 1 svr rf model in addition to rainfall the svr rf model adds the flood depths measured by iot sensors as variables 12 h i t 1 h i t 3 f 2 r t 3 r t 3 h j t 3 h j t where j is the serial number of sensors in fig 1 with 10 sensors in total h j t 3 h j t are the observed flood depths at sensor j for t 3 t respectively because the iot sensors have only been in operation since 2019 the observed flood depths were not available during the training events for model training the values of h j t 3 h j t are given as the flood depths simulated by the hydraulic model at the grid overlaying sensor j namely the pseudo sensor data shown in fig 3 as for the 0813 event in 2019 used for model testing the values of h j t 3 h j t are given by the real sensors the inclusion of pseudo sensor data forced the svr rf model to generate predictions closer to the simulations at the sensor grids in this case the relative differences are more important than the absolute errors since the simulated flood depths are regarded as pseudo facts when the pseudo sensor data were replaced by iot sensor data the svr rf model will force the predictions to fit the observation at the sensor grids as well 3 2 1 2 svr rfn model to improve model accuracy the svr rfn used the heun s method to correct the flood depths predicted by svr rf the heun s method also referred to as modified euler scheme is a commonly used numerical scheme to improve the accuracy of the euler method the euler method predicts the flood depth y t 1 at t 1 with first order accuracy using the following equation conte and de boor 1980 13 y t 1 y t δ t f t y t where f t y t k 1 is the temporal derivative of flood depth at t δ t is the time increment since the flood depth derivative may vary with time the heun s method modifies eq 13 as hornbeck 1975 14 y t 1 y t δ t 2 f t y t f t 1 y t 1 where y t 1 is the forecasted flood depth at t 1 with second order accuracy f t 1 y t 1 k 2 represents the reforecasted flood depth derivative at t 1 using the y t 1 predicted in eq 13 combining the svr rf model and heun s method we used finite difference slope approximation to calculate the flood depth derivatives as below 15 k 1 h i t 1 h i t δ t 16 k 2 h i t 2 h i t 1 δ t where h i t is the observed flood depth at grid i for t h i t 1 is the forecasted flood depth at grid i for t 1 as defined in eq 12 h i t 2 is the reforecasted flood depth at grid i for t 2 as below 17 h i t 2 f 2 r t 3 r t 3 h j t 2 h j t h i t 1 eq 17 is similar to eq 12 by replacing the h i t 3 with the h i t 1 obtained from the svr rf model by doing so the svr rfn model corrects the svr rf s predictions without the need to establish a new ml model that saves a lot of training time introducing eq 15 eq 16 and eq 17 into eq 14 the svr rfn forecasts the flood depth at grid i for t 1 as below 18 h i t 1 h i t h i t 2 2 with this treatment the errors in k 1 and k 2 caused by the misestimation of h i t 1 offset and the predictions are improved through the reforecasting process since the h i t and h i t 2 are determined based on the same rainfall variables r t 3 r t 3 as shown in eq 12 and eq 17 respectively without adding new rainfall information the flood depth variations at t and t 1 would show a smooth and continuous pattern which satisfies the requirement of applying heun s method following the same steps and shifting the time steps for h i and h i in eqs 15 18 the flood depths for t 2 and t 3 can be obtained sequentially 3 3 performance indicators three indicators are used to evaluate model performance on flood depth forecasting at sensor grids fu et al 2019 including root mean square error rmse coefficient of efficiency ce and error in peak flood depth epd 19 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 20 c e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 e p d y p y p y p where n is the number of data points y i is the forecasted flood depth y i is the observed flood depth y is the average of the observed flood depth y p is the peak value of the forecasted flood depth y p is the peak value of the observed flood depth the rmse represents the absolute error between the predicted and observed values in unit of meters the ce and epd are dimensionless and represent the prediction errors relative to the observations the model has smaller prediction errors when the values of rmse and epd approach zero and it has a better prediction of flood depth patterns when the value of ce approaches one to evaluate the accuracy of flood extent forecasting the following indicators are used jang et al 2018 jang et al 2019 22 o c r r c r m f c 23 h t r r r m 24 f a r f f c where r is the area flooded and correctly predicted by the model m is the area flooded but not predicted by the model f is the area not flooded but falsely predicted by the model and c is the area not flooded and correctly predicted by the model in the calculation of the indicators the flood extent data investigated by water resource agency wra 2022 are used as the benchmark the ocr htr and far represent the overall correctness rate hit rate and false alarm rate respectively the flood extents are more accurately predicted when htr and ocr approach 1 and far approaches 0 3 4 dike breach index overtopping caused by extreme floods which leads to the erosion on dike crest and slope sliding has been shown one of the major causes for dike breach singh 1996 coleman et al 2002 schmocker and hager 2010 to evaluate the risk of dike breach caused by water overtopping a dike breach index i d is defined as 25 i d a o a r where a r is the plane area of river channels bounded by dikes a o is the water surface areas in river channels with flood depths higher than neighboring dike heights ranging between 0 and 1 a higher value of i d represents that a larger portion of river sections are at dike breach risk 4 results 4 1 flood depth comparison in fig 4 the time series of flood depth forecasted by the numerical and three svr models are compared at 10 sensor grids and three lead times for the 0813 event among the models the hydraulic model used a stepwise routing algorithm so that the results are independent of lead time whereas the svr models are lead time dependent because different models were established for different lead times the flood depths predicted by the hydraulic model were more fluctuated and overestimated at peaks especially at sensors 1 4 and 10 on the contrary the svr r model had the mildest variation of flood depth and understated the peaks at almost all sensor grids this implies that rainfall is an insensitive predictor that tends to smooth the flood depths in space and time with the inclusion of sensor data the flood depths predicted by svr rf and svr rfn coincided better with the observations with fewer fluctuations and deviations in the peaks however the flood depths predicted by the two models showed a time lag in comparison with observations at sensors 5 8 especially at large lead times this may be caused by the increase of time difference between the observed and predicted flood depths in eq 12 as lead time increased the svr rfn model outperformed the svr rf model by having smaller error increments as the lead time increased showing that heun s numerical correction increases the reliability of long term forecasting fig 5 shows the comparison of rmse ce and epd for the hydraulic model and three svr models at 10 sensor grids and three lead times at t 1 the svr rfn had the smallest rmse the largest ce and the smallest epd at all sensor grids except at sensor 6 where the epd was slightly larger than the hydraulic model the svr rf had the second best prediction the numerical and svr r models performed the worst the hydraulic model had the largest rmse and epd at sensors 1 and 3 due to overestimation whereas svr r had the largest rmse and epd at sensors 4 6 8 and 10 due to underestimation at sensor 9 the ce values suddenly dropped to 6 for the numerical and svr r models because the flood depths leveled off without varying with time for each models and lead time table 2 summaries the average values of rmse ce and epd at the 10 sensor grids at all lead times the average values of rmse and epd decreased from the svr r hydraulic model and svr rf to svr rfn whereas the values of average ce decreased reversely the flood depth patterns were not well predicted by the svr r and hydraulic models for having negative average ce values whereas the svr rfn model had positive ce values at all lead times as lead time increased the accuracies of the svr models decreased especially for the svr rf model indicating that the improvements made by the inclusion of sensor data decreased for long term forecasting when the lead time increased from t 1 to t 3 the accuracies of svr rf model decreased significantly with rmse increased from 0 08 m to 0 13 m ce decreased from 0 58 to 0 51 and epd increased from 0 15 m to 0 27 m whereas the svr rfn model had less deterioration in flood depth prediction as lead time increased with a slight increase in rmse from 0 05 m to 0 10 m a smaller decrease in ce from 0 78 to 0 16 and even a decrease in epd from 0 11 m to 0 05 m 4 2 flood extent comparison since the svr models predicted the flood depths for all grids in the study basin the flood extents defined as the area with maximum flood depth higher than 0 3 m above which the water level exceeds children s knees and limits their ability to escape liu et al 2021 can be delineated and compared with the investigation for different lead times as shown in fig 6 overall the flood extents were the largest for the numerical smallest for the svr r model and median for the two models considering sensor data the investigated flood extents were mostly in the upstream areas marked by the black lines in fig 6 in the upper part of the basins but the forecasted flood extents show that there was significant flooding in the downstream areas as well this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the downstream areas are mostly fish farms and ponds which retain water in normal times and tend to be ruled out in flood investigations unlike the sensor flood depths the flood extents for each model did not show many discrepancies for different lead times this is because the flood extents were delineated as the area of grids with maximum flood depths exceeding a threshold which blurred the differences in flood depth variation with lead times table 2 shows the performance indicators for flood extent forecasting at first glance the svr r and the hydraulic models seem to perform the best and the worst for having the highest and lowest ocr values respectively this may not be true because the high ocr values of the svr r model came from the decrease in far not from the increase in htr the htr values for the svr r model range between 0 19 and 0 22 indicating that about 80 of flood extents were unpredicted by the svr r model in contrast the far value for hydraulic model may be slightly higher but a 64 accuracy rate of correct predictions htr 0 64 is more preferable for warning applications the performances of svr rf and svr rfn were similar and range between the svr and hydraulic models in flood extent forecasting compared with the svr r model the svr rf and svr rfn models greatly increased htr to about 0 5 by slightly sacrificing far showing that the inclusion of sensor data at limited points improves regional flood prediction 4 3 dike safety evaluation we adopted the hybrid model i e the svr rfn model to evaluate the dike safety during 0813 event since it had been shown superior in the prediction of flood depth and area fig 7 shows the temporal variations of dike breach index predicted by the hybrid model with three lead times started with a low value below 0 1 at 3 00 the dike breach index increased rapidly with rainfall since 5 00 peaked at 8 00 with a value around 0 6 and then decreased to nearly 0 3 at 12 00 in the rising limb between 5 00 and 8 00 the values of dike breach index became larger as lead time increased in the falling limb the dike breach index for t 3 declined more rapidly and became smaller than that for t 2 sine 9 30 this implies that the relative magnitude of dike breach index for different lead times can be used as a signal to determine if dike breach risk reaches its peak in this case warning should be given between 5 00 and 9 00 at which the dike breach index increased from t 1 t 2 to t 3 fig 8 demonstrates the relative flood depths maximum flood depth minus dike height predicted by the hybrid model for t 3 in which the two sections squared by blue dash lines are at higher risk of dike breach for having higher relative flood depths the one in the middle stream is located at confluence of sanyei river main stream and rende drainage while the downstream one is a meandering channel with a mild slope 5 discussions 5 1 novelty and strength to generate 2d flood maps physics based hydraulic models are more accurate but time consuming whereas ml models are faster but lack of physical considerations this study demonstrated that the hybrid ml model can outperform conventional ml models through the incorporation of flood sensor data and the combination with numerical correction schemes this coincides with the findings in previous studies which improved the accuracy of flood depth forecasting through the inclusion of sensor data e g pan et al 2018 wu et al 2020 yang and chang 2020 and numerical schemes jang et al 2022 the methodology in this study was firstly proposed and applied for 2d flood map generation which pointed out a new direction to combine ml and numerical methods in solving practical flood problems using an existing svr based ml model as a plugin prediction engine and forcing it under heun s numerical scheme the hybrid model required no additional training so it preserved the efficiency of ml models and the accuracy of hydraulic models at the same time in other words any existing ml models and numerical schemes can be combined in this manner to establish new hybrid models 5 2 applicability compared with the hydraulic model the hybrid model was not only more accurate but also required much less computation time in generating flood maps on an intel core i7 8700 processor with 16 gb of ram the hydraulic svr rf and svr rfn models took 86 min 506 s and 1 006 s respectively in a 12 hour forecasting of flood depth for the 156 945 grids in the study area using the svr rfn model the rmse reduced by 29 the ce increased by 744 and the epd reduced by 56 in average for the three lead times compared with those for the svr rf model these obvious decreases of errors showed that the heun s method was worth taking because the increased computational time 500 s only occupied 9 of the flood warning lead time 1 5 h this means that large scale long term and real time forecasting of flood maps can be realized and used for emergency response in this study we used 2d flood maps to instantaneously identify the river sections with higher risk of dike breach caused by water overtopping which in the past can only be realized using cross section average information obtained from simplified one dimensional models the methodology proposed in this study is general and can be applied in other cases by reconstructing the numerical and ml models with localized data in different areas 5 3 future work in this study the hybrid model was established based on the combination of svr and heun s scheme which can be replaced by other ml and numerical methods to find the best combinations due to the late installation of rainfall station and flood sensors the temporal sample sizes in this research are only 576 and 24 for training and testing respectively based on the 25 historical events between 2013 and 2019 this may not fully cover all hydrological phenomena in the system especially when rainfall is expected to be more extreme under climate change in the future model accuracy can be improved by including more events iot sensor data physical laws and regularization approaches in the construction of ml methods seifert and rasp 2020 beucler et al 2020 brenowitz et al 2020 although model accuracy declines in long term predictions further studies on extending the lead time are worth doing for flood early warning finally this research demonstrated the application of flood mapping for dike safety evaluation which can be combined with social economic factors in the future for real time flood loose risk estimations 6 conclusions in this study we developed three svr based models for flood forecasting with 30 60 and 90 min of lead time including 1 the svr r model which used rainfalls as variables and hydraulic simulation results for model training based on the svr theorem 2 the svr rf model which was based on the svr r model but with added iot sensor observed flood depths as variables and 3 the svr rfn model which hybrid the svr rf model and heun s scheme for numerical correction the svr and hydraulic models were compared with the observations in the prediction of flood depths and flood extents for a historical event in the sanyei river basin taiwan from the comparison of flood depths patterns and peaks at sensor grids the svr r model had the largest errors followed by the hydraulic model the svr rf model and the svr rfn model the svr r model had the highest errors because it used hydraulic results for training and only rainfalls as the input without introducing new information so it inherited inaccuracies from both the hydraulic and svr models by adding flood sensor data as input the errors in flood depth prediction greatly decreased by half for the svr rf model however this improvement made by the inclusion of sensor data reduced rapidly as lead time increased through the combination with heun s scheme the svr rfn model outperformed the svr rf model in long term forecasting because the numerical correction reduced the errors in temporal routing in the prediction of flood extents the svr r model seriously underestimated the hydraulic model overestimated and the svr rf and svr rfn had more balanced predictions this means that even by including limited and scattered sensor data regional flood predictions can be improved overall the svr rfn model not only performed better at the prediction of flood peaks but also at the full phenomena of flood depth patterns compared with the observations the entire variations of flood depth predicted by the svr rfn model had the least errors the highest correction and the least deterioration as lead time increased in the evaluation of dike system safety the svr rfn model showed a good capability in capturing the rising and falling patterns of dike breach risk which were expected to be underestimated and overestimated by the svr r and svr rf respectively credit authorship contribution statement jiun huei jang methodology supervision project administration visualization cheng yu hsieh software visualization tse wei li writing

2864,changes in the hydrological cycle have far reaching impacts on agricultural productivity transport availability energy supply for example increasing intensity and declining frequency of rainfall in china have led to a prolonged period of drought as well as more floods with serious impacts on economics and environment different hydrological indices for instance the accumulated precipitation the palmer drought severity index etc which can reflect the intensity of precipitation or drought have been proposed to understand the change of hydrological cycle however they lead to obvious disagreements in case of china s hydrological cycle because various indices emphasis mainly on either wet or dry feature of the hydrological cycle the disagreements interfere our ability to manage environmental assets drought risks and flood hazards to reconcile these disagreements this study has utilized a hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which is proposed innovatively by previous study with advantages in quantifying the intensity of hydrological cycle hy int integrates and amplifies the signals of precipitation intensity and dry spell length viewing the response of these two metrics to warming as deeply interconnected an increase of hy int represents the accelerated hydrological cycle and the increased risks of wet and or dry extremes based on the daily gauged precipitation at 540 stations within mainland china this study has assessed the change of hy int in china during 1961 2017 the results show an increasing trend of hy int in central east china indicating the increasing intensity of hydrological cycle i e more severe droughts and or rainfall events while a decreasing trend of hy int is observed in northwestern china which implies less wet dry extremes future change of hy int is further assessed based on the outputs from climate models in the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 and phase 6 cmip5 and cmip6 under the more realistic medium stabilization emission scenarios the models are weighted by the performances in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed hy int results of weighted multi model ensemble suggest an increased hydrological cycle over most part of china especially in the yangtze river basin indicating more wet dry extremes while an exception is seen in northwest china where the hy int will decline due to the dominance of the decreased dry spell length over the increased precipitation intensity this reveals an alleviated intensity of hydrological cycle and fewer wet dry extreme events therein similar to the change in recent decades the changes of hy int are attributed to the different variation patterns in the precipitation probability which are associated with the change in atmospheric instability and moisture content keywords hydroclimatic intensity climate projection global warming hydrological cycle china weighted multi model ensemble data availability the daily gauged precipitation data are obtained from the national meteorological information center at website http www nmic the daily precipitation data from the 57 cmip5 6 models listed in table 1 are available at website https esgf node llnl gov 1 introduction mainland china is located in eastern asia with vast territory and various climates due to its large population and developed economics weather and climate extremes can lead to substantial adverse impacts on mainland china during the past decades it has experienced record flood and drought events which to a considerate extent are attributed to the changing water equilibrium maintained by atmosphere precipitation and surface evapotranspiration under global warming huntington 2006 troch et al 2008 ziegler et al 2003 for example anomalous rainstorm wrought havoc in south and east china in 2015 2017 2020 xie et al 2016 wei et al 2020 and also a series of drought events hit much of south china in 2009 2011 2013 2016 tang et al 2014 xiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the flood and drought lead to numerous economic losses related to diminish harvests transportation and energy disruption and human casualties chou et al 2019 javadinejad et al 2021 talebmorad et al 2021 particularly the average annual economic loss in china caused by flood was us 16 5 billion in 2012 2020 wei et al 2020 and the loss caused by drought was us 23 2 billion in 2010 2017 zhang et al 2020 far more than other meteorological hazards it is therefore of vital importance to investigate the change of extreme hydrological events related to precipitation as this will provide insight into probable changes in the occurrence and magnitude of flood and drought this will then guide suitable adaptation strategies and disaster mitigation policies fatahi et al 2021 wei et al 2018 the occurrences of extreme hydrological events are closely tied to the change in precipitation intensity and or frequency zhai et al 2005 used gauged rainfall from 1951 to 2000 at 750 stations of china and revealed an increased trend in total annual accumulated precipitation in eastern and northwestern china and a decreased trend in a southwest northeast orientated region consisting of much china a similar but greater trend in total annual rainfall was obtained by yin and sun 2018 with the observations at 2 400 stations from 1961 to 2017 and by zhou et al 2016 with gridded precipitation records from 1961 to 2010 additionally zhai et al 2005 found an increased trend in precipitation intensity in whole china as for the frequency of precipitation studies showed a decrease throughout most of china except for its northwest liu et al 2005 zhang and cong 2014 further long spell precipitation events with moderate and light intensities had decreased while short spell events with heavy intensity increased in much of the country bai et al 2007 shi et al 2018 the future trend of precipitation was also concerned the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 models projected no significant change in total annual precipitation in china as a whole but an increase in western china li et al 2016 they have also projected an increased intensity of daily rainfall in the country as a whole along with a decreased frequency in south china but an increase in north china li et al 2016 xu et al 2015 the changes in total amount as well as the intensity and frequency of precipitation are important factors reflecting the hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2011 zhang and cong 2014 having recognized changes of rainfall features studies attempted to use various climate indices based on precipitation to qualitatively understand the change of hydrological cycle in china huang et al 2020 zhai et al 2010 these indices include annual accumulated precipitation amount palmer drought severity index standardized precipitation precipitation recycling and aridity index etc the indices yielded an overall consensus in southeast china where there were increased extreme precipitation events and also the intensified drought occurrences in the past decades implying an increased hydrological cycle however different even opposite results are seen elsewhere for example focusing on northeast china gao et al 2006 used precipitation amount and zhai et al 2010 used palmer drought severity index to assess the hydrological cycle both indices concluded a decreasing trend while the standardized precipitation index exhibited no change in most stations zhai et al 2010 in southwest china the precipitation recycling index indicated that the hydrological cycle had decreased in the western area but increased in eastern area guo and wang 2014 but an overall increase was found by a standardized precipitation index tang et al 2021 as for semiarid and arid areas of northwest china disagreements were even evident huang et al 2020 found an increase in its central part and a decrease elsewhere using an aridity index while yao et al 2020 suggested a significantly accelerated hydrological cycle in whole region based on a precipitation recycling index using a modified palmer drought severity index yu et al 2019 found no significant signal because the irrigation can alleviate most of the negative change xu et al 2022 concluded a mitigated likelihood of hydrological cycle using a dry condition index these disagreements in the change of hydrological cycle brought obvious inconvenience to the management and planning of local water resources as well as the enactment of disaster mitigation policies huang et al 2020 ostad ali askari et al 2017 sun et al 2022 such disagreements may arise from that these various indices emphasis on different aspects of hydrological cycle it is known that a same hydroclimatic response may manifest a different change of wet and dry events giorgi et al 2011 trenberth et al 2003 for example an increase in total precipitation can arise from several different ways in terms of precipitation characteristics 1 more frequent and more intense rainfall events 2 more frequent but less intense events and 3 less frequent and more intense events thus the indices in the aforementioned previous studies only using separated or partial wet and dry features may be imperfect since they lack an integrated signal of hydroclimatic response this can account for the disagreements in the change of regional hydrological cycle in recent decades to address the above issue giorgi et al 2011 proposed a single index hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which is the product of the normalized precipitation intensity int times the normalized dry spell length dsl it provides an overall metric of hydroclimatic intensity previously int is used to measure the intensity of precipitation events regardless of its frequency while dsl is used to measure the frequency of precipitation regardless of its intensity their product hy int integrates and amplifies both the change signals of int and dsl and thus exhibits an advantage over either int or dsl in quantifying hydrological cycle this will be seen from the following analysis assume the total precipitation remains constant but with an intensified amplitude and a reduced frequency this yields an increase in both int and dsl resulting in an amplified increase of hy int relative to either int or dsl and thus highlighting an acceleration of the hydrological cycle besides for a specific situation with a large increase in total precipitation along with a substantial increase in int but a nearly unchanged dsl a contradictory result is obtained when using int to quantify the hydrological cycle with that when using dsl the former deduces an accelerating hydrological cycle but nearly unchanged for the latter however when using hy int the increased hydrological cycle can be captured because the change in int overwhelms that in dsl this means that the adaption of hy int can capture the change in hydrological cycle which may be missed when using single wet or dry indices thus hy int is an innovative measure of the strength of hydrological cycle as reflected by precipitation features and an increasing in hy int represents an increasing risk of wet and or dry extreme see section 3 hy int has exhibited the advantages in detecting and attributing the changes of hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2014a giorgi et al 2014b studies in india korean peninsula africa and south america by using hy int suggested intensified hydrological cycles and the signal was stronger than that revealed by single int or dsl giorgi et al 2014b im et al 2016 mohan and rajeevan 2017 under the context of global warming it s intriguing to investigate whether hydrological cycle in china has changed and how it will change in future so far no research has used the hy int to analyze the changes of hydrological cycle in china as a whole therefore assessing the changes of hydrological cycle during the past decades projecting its future changes and discussing the properties by using the hy int index based on the observation and the state of the art cmip5 6 model ensemble are the primary objectives of the present study the results will not only provide a new perspective for the study of hydrological cycle change and projection in china but also reconcile the prevalent regional disagreements in previous studies the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes datasets and methods in particular the definition of hy int section 3 analyzes the observed change of hy int section 4 projects the future trend of hy int by using cmip5 6 projection experiments weighted multi model ensemble strategy weighted mme is used finally conclusions and discussions are given in section 5 2 datasets and methods 2 1 datasets daily gauged precipitation data at 540 stations throughout china fig 1 a from 1 january 1961 to 31 december 2017 is provided by the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration in order to discard flaw or artificial trends stations with the annual sum day number with default precipitation over 5 of the total daily series length have been excluded to address the changes in future climate gridded daily precipitation outputs from thirty one models participating in cmip5 and twenty six models participating in cmip6 are employed table 1 in order to treat all the models equally only their first run r1i1p1 r1i1p1f1 is analyzed the experiments include the historical run with historically evolving forcing for 1961 2005 in cmip5 and 1961 2014 in cmip6 the projection run with prescribed forcing of representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario rcp4 5 for 2006 2100 in cmip5 and shared socioeconomic pathway 2 4 5 scenario ssp2 4 5 for 2015 2100 in cmip6 taylor et al 2012 o neill et al 2016 rcp4 5 is a medium stabilization scenario that follows a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 4 5 w m2 in 2100 ssp2 4 5 is an update version of rcp4 5 which represents a combined scenario of a medium energy intensive socio economic developmental path with a rising radiative forcing peaking at 4 5 w m2 in 2100 details on the cmip5 6 models and their configurations are described at https esgf node llnl gov consider the mismatch of horizontal resolution of the cmip5 6 models all simulation data are re gridded to a mid resolution horizontal grid of 1 0 1 0 using a bilinear interpolation algorithm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 calculation of hy int index following giorgi et al 2011 the value of hy int for a given year at a single station or grid cell is simply given as follows 1 hy i n t i n t d s l here int is the normalized mean annual precipitation intensity averaged rainfall intensity during wet days and dsl is the normalized mean annual dry spell length number of dry days during each dry spell event normalized is relative to the climatological mean for 1961 2017 when calculating hy int daily precipitation is only considered to rainy days when the precipitation amount in that day is above 1 mm day giorgi et al 2011 im et al 2016 mohan and rajeevan 2017 otherwise the day is treated as a dry day from the above eq 1 hy int increases when both int and dsl increase or when the increase in each overwhelms the decrease in the other when without large change in mean precipitation but with reduced rain frequency and enhanced intensity both int and dsl could increase in an interconnected fashion giorgi et al 2011 as such an increasing hy int indicates a combined response toward a regime with more intense but less frequent rain events 2 2 2 weighted multi model ensemble since experiments from a total of 31 cmip5 and 26 cmip6 models are available to project the future hy int here the multi model ensemble mme is used considering the diversity of models results ma et al 2022 xu et al 2015 briefly a weighted multi model ensemble weighted mme strategy proposed by li et al 2016 is used the strategy first evaluates the performances of each model in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed hy int then it can rank all the models based on their integrated behaviors consequently the strategy uses the former ranks to calculate the weight for each model in that way we can assign higher weights to the models with better skills before building weighted mme and vice versa the details on the processes of building weighted mme of the present study are described in appendix studies have shown that the new generation cmip6 models show improvements compared to the last generation cmip5 models but in some aspects such as the uncertainty range and systematic frequency biases of precipitation jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 the cmip6 models do not exhibit substantial improvements the weighted mme strategy allows us to favor the models with good precipitation simulation regardless of their generation and also profoundly increase the sample size of weighted mme studies have proved that the weighted mme has better credibility relative to the equal weight mme or a single model e g acharya et al 2014 li et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2020 wanders and wood 2016 the trend is computed by using least squares linear regression for each station in observation or for each grid cell in the models the significance of the results is validated by using a two tailed student s t test 2 2 3 regional definitions to understand the regional hydroclimatic response to global warming mainland china is divided into six subregions fig 1a northeast china nec north china nc northwest china nwc southwest china swc the mid lower yangtze river valley yr and south china sc based on their different topography social and climate condition xu et al 2011 the climates in four subregions including sc yr nc and nec are governed by the seasonal progress of east asian monsoon and that in nwc is arid and semi arid inland climate pattern and that in swc is tropical subtropical plateau climate pattern 3 change of observed hy int fig 1a c show the spatial distributions of observed int dsl and hy int in 1961 2017 int is quite unevenly distributed across china decreasing from southeastern coastal areas to northwestern inlands the least int value is only 3 mm day and the largest is 22 mm day for the dsl the observation exhibits low values over southeastern china increasing northwestward the largest dsl is observed in the inland deserts of the nwc with a value of 96 1 days such int and dsl distributions are attributed to china s monsoon climate based on int and dsl the distribution of hy int is shown in the fig 1c which suggests a clear spatial heterogeneity in general the high hy int climatology is observed in a southwest northeast orientated region of china where is at the margin of the east asian monsoon region the abundant or deficient states of water vapor alternately occurred in this region making it one of the regions with strong hydrological cycle in china specifically at the junction of nc and nec a higher hy int center is observed with a value reaching more than 1 030 and at the west side of yr sc and the east side swc observation also shows a high hy int area with a maximum value of 1 032 by contrast the low hy int is observed in nwc which implies a slow hydrological cycle it is worth noting that the high values are observed in the context of low hy int peripherally at several stations in the two red boxes of fig 1c these stations are all located in a unique transition zone between desert and wetland the dry climate background results in long term droughts here while the precipitation events also occur frequently due to the sufficiently local water supply these are responsible for the high hy int at these stations fig 1d f show the spatial distribution of observed trend in int dsl and hy int during 1961 2017 in china as a whole int has increased by 7 1 since 1961 with a trend value of 0 12 mm day per decade over 75 stations show growth with high numbers in sc yr and nwc these results are consistent with zhai et al 2005 who displayed an enhanced intensity of precipitation during the recent decades as for dsl it exhibits a decrease by 8 4 since 1961 0 15 days per decade the decreases occur at about 60 stations particularly in west and northeast china albeit an increase in central china a similar change was reported by duan et al 2016 and lei and duan 2011 the trend of each subregion is displayed in table 2 which suggests an int increase in nwc swc yr and sc and a dsl decrease in nwc along with insignificant change elsewhere as for hy int fig 1f a significant increase is observed over central south china which is in agreement with the congruent increase of int and dsl this means a shift toward a regime of intensified daily precipitation intensity but with fewer shorter rainy days in east yr the increased hy int is attributed to the overwhelming role of int over that of dsl indicating the intensified daily precipitation amount and more rainy days and increase in the total precipitation subsequently an exception is in nwc and nec the hy int shows a decrease because of the dominance of decreased dsl implying an alleviated hydrological cycle fig 2 presents temporal evolution of regional hy int a significant decrease is seen in nwc with a rate of 0 026 per decade fig 2a along with a significant increase in sc yr and nc with a rate of 0 029 0 018 and 0 017 per decade fig 2c 2e respectively in comparison the change is insignificant in swc 0 008 per decade and nec 0 006 per decade here we obtain a reduction of hydrological cycle in nwc which is in agreement with the reduced dry days liu et al 2014 and increased precipitation li et al 2019 although the dry wet changes in nwc is controversial and the results are discrepant in previous studies based on different data periods and indices hy int is an index measuring the intensity of hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2011 more importantly it can be a useful indicator of the risks of exceptionally wet dry extremes to further elucidate the relationship between hy int and extreme events in china two extreme indices r95 the total amount with daily precipitation rate above the 95 percentile and mcd the maximum number of consecutive dry days are used comparing fig 1 with fig 3 it can find the high similarities in the climatology and the trend of geographical pattern between r95 and int mcd and dsl specifically the correlation coefficient between climatology int and r95 dsl and mcd is 0 98 0 87 moreover 80 stations observe the same trend for int and r95 and that for dsl and mcd are 70 stations these similarities indicate a large hy int can be considered as a high occurrence of extreme hydrological events extreme wet and or dry events and the increasing of hy int can represent increasing risks of extreme hydrological events thus in fig 1c and 1f the high value and the increase of hy int in central east china imply a high probability of extreme hydrological events indeed previous studies show that the extreme precipitation and drought have become more frequent therein xie et al 2016 tang et al 2014 xiang et al 2015 compared to east low value and the decrease of hy int in nwc indicate it is less likely to experience hydrological extremes several papers have indeed found a decrease in drought frequency in nwc over the past decades albeit with an increased intensity ma et al 2022 yu et al 2019 4 future projection of hy int 4 1 the validation of weighted mme here we use a weighted mme strategy to reduce the uncertainties of the projection it decides the weights for different models based on their performances in reproducing observed hydrological feature in the historical simulation the evaluation of models and the calculation of the weights are presented in appendix to illustrate the advantage of weighted mme strategy we compare the weighted mme and the simple mme equal weight mme with the observation the spatial correlation coefficient between observation and simple mme int dsl hy int is 0 78 0 56 0 29 by applying the weighted mme it exhibits substantial improvement in reproducing the observation with the spatial correlation coefficient of int dsl hy int rising to 0 89 0 63 0 50 hereafter just the results from weighted mme are shown fig 4 a c show the spatial distribution of int dsl and hy int based on weighted mme in 1961 2017 weighted mme reproduces the int s pattern of more in south and less in north but it tends to underestimate the magnitude in southeastern china which arises from the commonly systemic bias with underestimated rainfall intensity in most of the cmip5 6 models jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 for dsl weighted mme captures the large scale features well the low values in the southeast and high values in northwest desert are reproduced as for hy int the high value center in nec nc and southeast as well as the low value in northwest are well captured by weighted mme however due to the coarse resolution of cmip5 6 model weighted mme fails to resolve the local scale hydrological features like the high hy int of several stations in nwc fig 4d f show the spatial distribution of weighted mme s trend in 1961 2017 int shows an increasing trend in most parts of china but the significant increase is mainly located in the north and west this is different from the observed increase concentrating in the south the trend of simulated dsl exhibits good agreement with observed in the most part of china except for east in the eastern china a visible increase is simulated which is opposite to the observation as for hy int the weighted mme s trend is fairly consistent with observation with a decrease in west and part of northeast and an increase in southeast table 3 lists the reproduced trends of int dsl and hy int in the six subregions the int trend in nwc swc sc yr nc as well as the dsl trend in nwc swc sc nec are consistent with observation as for hy int the observed decrease in nwc and the increase in swc sc yr and nc are reproduced as for individual models more than half of the models yield consistent trend with weighted mme the above analyses suggest an overall consistence in simulation with observation this lays a basis for projecting hy int s future trend by using weighted mme 4 2 projection results fig 5 shows the projected trend of int dsl and hy int over china by weighted mme from 2018 to 2100 int exhibits a significant growth throughout china with the maximum in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the largest increased trend is 0 18 mm day per decade dsl is projected to increase in the southeastern china and south side of tibet plateau but decrease in northern china the most prominent reduction occurs in the arid northwest with the largest value by 1 38 days per decade as for hy int it is projected to increase in majority area of china but decrease in northwestern china the most visible increase occurs at the southern side of the tibetan plateau with a maximum growth rate of 0 031 per decade additionally the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river plain is also projected to be a center of hy int increase with a value reaching 0 022 per decade it is worth noting that the two regions have observed high hy int fig 1c and fig 4c in the past few decades and the significant increase may indicate more record extreme hydrological events in future the most visible hy int reduction occurs at northwest of nwc with a minimum value of 0 029 per decades which implies a lower probability of occurrence in hydrological extremes in future table 4 lists the projected trend of int and dsl averaged in individual subregions int shows significant increase in all six subregions 0 024 0 126 mm day per decade as for dsl the decrease in nwc swc nc and nec and the increase in sc and yr are projected it is worth specifying that the trend of dsl in nwc 0 297 days per decade is much greater than that of other regions 0 046 0 007 days per decade which is because of the higher climatology dsl in nwc 14 8 days compared to 3 9 to 8 6 days in other regions as for individual models almost all of 57 models yield a consistent increase in int the dsl also shows high model agreements over nwc swc nc and nec fig 6 presents evolution of hy int by weighted mme black lines averaged in individual subregions in 2018 2100 a deceased hy int in nwc 0 006 per decade fig 6a is projected which is attributed to the predominant dsl decrease in swc nc and nec hy int exhibits an increase 0 011 0 003 and 0 004 per decade fig 6b 6e 6f which is attributed to the overwhelming of the increased int over the decreased dsl besides weighted mme projects a prominent increase of hy int in sc and yr 0 014 and 0 015 per decade fig 6c and 6d because of the increase in both int and dsl please note that the projected trend of all subregions is statistically significant implying that hy int is a sensitive index to the emission scenarios and is indeed a powerful measure for detecting and accessing the response of hydroclimatic signatures to global warming moreover the individual models show a high model agreement with about 63 1 70 2 75 4 89 5 66 7 and 70 2 models yield a same trend as weighted mme over nwc swc sc yr nc and nec respectively this indicates high credibility of hy int decrease in nwc and increase in other subregions in order to quantify the change of hy int fig 7 illustrates the change ratio of int dsl and hy int encompassing the period for the early 2021 2040 mid 2051 2070 and late 2081 2100 future relative to 1981 2000 int shows increases fig 7a which are consistent with above analysis the growths are more pronounced but with larger inter model range in eastern china yr nc and nec for the late future the greatest int growth of weighted mme occurs in yr of about 11 8 followed by nc 11 5 and nec 11 2 it can find a relatively small inter model range in nwc and swc which could be an indication of more reliable projections the dsl exhibits a visible decrease in nwc nc and nec fig 7b particularly the 75th quantiles of the three regions are all negative in the three periods indicating a good agreement among the models the most notable dsl decline occurs in nwc with about 22 6 in late future however the 75th quantile is positive while the 25th quantile is negative in swc sc and yr implying a large discrepancy between models and an uncertainty of the projection in term of hy int the decreased dsl overwhelms the increased int causing a relative reduction in nwc with about 2 4 4 3 and 5 8 in near mid and late future in the other five subregions the dominant increase of int results in an increased hy int in all three future periods the greatest weighted mme growth of hy int occurs in yr of about 14 4 followed by sc 13 9 and swc 12 7 in late future the 75th quantile of nwc is close to 0 and the 25th quantile of other five regions are generally positive indicating a high model agreement additionally the change ratio of weighted mme is generally greater than that of median this means the high weight models project more prominent change compared to the others as indicated by hy int the key of hydrological cycle change lies in the changes in precipitation features thus an in depth analysis in the probability distribution changes of daily precipitation amount is conducted below for this analysis data from all grid cells are taken into account fig 8 shows the change of daily precipitation amount for the three future periods across various rainfall intervals in nwc nc and nec fig 8a 8e and 8f the change pattern is similar that is most of the models yield a decreased number of non rainy days below 1 mm day and an increased number of rainy days above 1 mm day in spite of an in between difference the increased intensity in all rainfall intervals is responsible for the increased int while the decreased non rainy days accounts for decreased dsl however such similar pattern reveals different hy int changes decrease in nwc but increase in nc and nec which may because the increase of light rainy days and the decrease of dry days in nwc are the most prominent another similar change pattern appears in sc and yr cases which is an increase in higher intensity rainfall above 10 mm day and a reduction in weaker intensity rainfall 1 10 mm day the increase of dsl is attributed to the reduced light moderate precipitation along with intensified heavy precipitation leading to an increased hy int in swc models yield a large disagreement in the changes of dry days and light rainy days which results in no obvious change in dsl while the enhanced moderate heavy precipitation above 5 mm day increases the int which can explain the growth of hy int 5 conclusions and discussions the changing climate is significantly influencing the hydrological cycle and consequently affecting behavior of climate extremes however different hydrological indices lead to obvious disagreements in the changes of hydrological cycle in china because various indices emphasis mainly on either wet or dry feature of the hydrological cycle to reconcile these disagreements this study has utilized a hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which integrates two hydroclimatic wet int and dry dsl metrics it can provide a more specific signal for hydrological cycle and give a new perspective in understanding the response of the hydrological extremes due to global warming using a daily gauged precipitation dataset hy int change in china over the past decades has been assessed next based on cmip5 6 model outputs the future projection is carried out using a weighted mme strategy specifically we quantitatively assess the 57 cmip5 6 models based on their abilities in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed precipitation and rank the models based on their integrated skills the weight is calculated according to above model ranks when building weighted mme ensemble main conclusions are as follows 1 the high hy int centers observed by the gauges are located in the northeastern and southwestern china exhibiting a southwest northeast orientated distribution the hy int in the southeastern china is moderate while the low values are observed in the arid and semi arid regions of the northwestern china as for the trend in the past decades by and large the observed hy int records are characterized by increase over center south china which indicates the hydrological cycle has accelerated and more extreme hydrological events have occurred while hy int shows a decrease in northwestern china implying the reduction of hydrological cycle based on the historical simulation it is found that weighted mme strategy can well reproduce the spatial distribution and the trend of observed hy int this lay a basis for the credibility of future projection based on weighted mme 2 during the twenty first century 2018 2100 hy int shows a change pattern like the high get higher and the low get lower in china it is project to increase over the most area of china which is in agreement with the overwhelming of the increased int moreover weighted mme shows that the regions like southeastern china with moderate hy int would increase profoundly these regions will become more vulnerable to hydrological extremes in future an exception is in northwestern china where the hy int exhibits a decline which is attributed to the dominance of the decreased dsl over the increased int the present study provides a clear change signal of hydrological cycle in china by hy int index in east china such as an intensified likelihood of regional hydrological cycle is attributed to the shift of asian monsoon and the increase of atmospheric instability several studies have indicated that the summer monsoon is projected to stronger in the twenty first century bao 2012 jiang et al 2020 the northward moisture transport is greatly enhanced thus leading to more moisture supply for the occurrence of precipitation coupled with increased atmospheric instability due to surface warming li et al 2016 the extreme precipitation would also increase the associated potential risks of wet dry extreme are deserved to pay more attention and provide support mitigation strategies by the public and decision makers in northwest china the decline of hy int is associated with the increased rainfall intensity and increased rainy days which is consistent with the consensus in previous studies that climate is transiting from dry to wet therein yang et al 2021 the increased rainfall is caused by the obvious increase in moisture flux convergence peng and zhou 2017 despite the horizontal moisture advection appears to reduced and the enhanced evaporation increases the occurrence of rainy cloudiness and further decreases the dry spell days shen et al 2022 these corresponding changes of precipitation can all be seen in the variation of probability in fig 8 it is worth noting that the change of hydrological cycle in northwest china has always been a controversial issue the studies based on different periods and indices often yield disagreements in the current study hy int suggests an alleviation of climatologic hydrological cycle the observed increases of rainfall and vegetation cover dai et al 2011 as well as decreased drought frequency ma et al 2022 yu et al 2019 seem support the results it is good to find that the better consensus among the models in their projected trend of hy int however there still exist some uncertainties in the present study the weighted mme strategy is a challenge because the weight can amplify the deficiencies of the model li et al 2016 wanders and wood 2016 therefore studies suggested that the projection based on simple mme is also essential jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 here a statistical downscaling strategy the quantile mapping bias correction simple mme biascorrect mme is applied to achieve the same projection objective the strategy matches the distribution function of the model s raw rainfall series to the observed through adjusting mean variance and quantile distribution and thus preserves the extremes intrinsic to the model themeβl et al 2012 grillakis et al 2013 fang et al 2015 which is an effective strategy to improve the confidence of projection generally the trends of this strategy the red lines in fig 6 are consistent with weighted mme despite with different change magnitude this similar change supports the analysis of weighted mme and thus indicates a robust projection of hy int in the present study in our future work since cmip5 6 models generally have coarse horizontal resolution and thus yield low credibility in projecting regional extreme climate the application of dynamical downscaling methods of regional models nested within global models fang et al 2015 im et al 2016 specifically for precipitation will be certainly needed to refine the climate information with coarse resolution and to support further assessment of hy int credit authorship contribution

reviewers for their comments and constructive suggestions appendix the weights used in the present study are obtained by the performances for reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed variables referring to li et al 2016 and chen et al 2011 to assess models overall ability in reproducing spatial distribution the taylor diagram taylor 2001 is employed which can provide a statistical summary of comparison between simulations and observation in terms of their spatial correlation coefficient cc root mean square difference rms and standard deviations difference sd the rms and the sd are normalized by the corresponding observed a perfect spatial simulation is characterized by both the rms and sd are equal to 0 and the cc is close to 1 in terms of temporal variation because of no initialization for the oceanic model component in cmip5 6 models one should not expect that their historical runs have the ability to reproduce the observed evolution jiang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 but we can expect that models can reproduce the temporal standard deviation which is evaluated by a measure of skill score inter annual variability skill ivs described by chen et al 2011 as follows a1 ivs std m std o std o std m 2 where stdm and stdo denote the inter annual standard deviation of model simulations and observation respectively a better agreement between the simulations and observation would be that the ivs value is close to 0 then we can rank models ranka based on their taylor diagram indices and ivs respectively the rank of the best performing model is 1st and the worst model is 57st for its rank and an overall rank considering spatial and temporal indices can be obtained with a comprehensive rating index mr respectively which is defined as a2 mr 1 1 mn i 1 n rank a i where the m is the number of models and n is the number of indices n 3 in spatial n 1 in temporal the value of mr which is closer to 1 means the higher skill after we got the sum of mr rank rankb in spatial and temporal the weight wi of each model is obtained as described by chen et al 2011 jiang et al 2016 a3 r i i 1 m rankb i rankb i and a4 w i r i i 1 m r i ri can be considered as combined performance indicator for an individual model i higher value indicates a better model skill the evaluation of models and the calculation of the weights in the present study are as follows considering the hy int is a diagnostic variable which is difficult to reproduce just its component int and dsl are used fig a1 a shows the rank for three spatial indices cc rms and sd in 1961 2005 as shading column 1 3 for int column 5 7 for dsl for int kace 1 0 g 0 90 exhibits best performance in cc followed by ec earth3 veg lr 0 88 mri esm2 0 0 87 and access

institution perform with similar skills to each other and the models with higher rank generally have a higher resolution for example the horizontal resolution of the first fourteen spatial ranked models is less than 2 2 except for noresm2 lm but that of the last four models is greater than 2 table 1 this validates that the insufficient spatial resolution is one major source of uncertainty for the spatial simulation jiang et al 2020 sillmann et al 2013 also the models with higher skills in reproducing spatial pattern in whole china generally perform better in the subregions not shown column 2 of fig a1b shows the models ranks based on their ivs access cm2 shows the highest rank with mr of 0 96 followed by kace 1 0 g 0 89 mri esm2 0 0 88 noresm2 lm 0 84 and cmcc cm2 sr5 0 83 next we use the former ranks to calculate the weight for each model before building weighted mme first we integrate the mr ranks of taylor diagram indices and ivs into one i e the sum of column 1 and 2 in fig a1b from table a1 column of sum of mr rank access cm2 and kace 1 0 g are the most perfect models followed by mri esm2 0 then by cmcc cms and cmcc esm2 interestingly the ranks of cmip6 models are general higher than those of cmip5 for example the best three models all belong to cmip6 eight of the top ten models are members of cmip6 the average rank of cmip6 models is 24 9 while that of cmip5 models is 32 5 these suggest that cmip6 models show overall improvement in simulating precipitation features in china compared with cmip5 the correspondent weight column of weight in table a1 for each model can be calculated using the eq a4 the model with a weight greater than the mean weight 0 018 or 1 57 is marked with boldface indicating a larger than mean ratio when building the weighted mme consequently based on the weight assigned to all 57 models the models are combined to calculate the weighted mme ensemble using eq a5 a5 weighted mme i 1 57 w i v i where vi is the variables int dsl hy iny value

2864,changes in the hydrological cycle have far reaching impacts on agricultural productivity transport availability energy supply for example increasing intensity and declining frequency of rainfall in china have led to a prolonged period of drought as well as more floods with serious impacts on economics and environment different hydrological indices for instance the accumulated precipitation the palmer drought severity index etc which can reflect the intensity of precipitation or drought have been proposed to understand the change of hydrological cycle however they lead to obvious disagreements in case of china s hydrological cycle because various indices emphasis mainly on either wet or dry feature of the hydrological cycle the disagreements interfere our ability to manage environmental assets drought risks and flood hazards to reconcile these disagreements this study has utilized a hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which is proposed innovatively by previous study with advantages in quantifying the intensity of hydrological cycle hy int integrates and amplifies the signals of precipitation intensity and dry spell length viewing the response of these two metrics to warming as deeply interconnected an increase of hy int represents the accelerated hydrological cycle and the increased risks of wet and or dry extremes based on the daily gauged precipitation at 540 stations within mainland china this study has assessed the change of hy int in china during 1961 2017 the results show an increasing trend of hy int in central east china indicating the increasing intensity of hydrological cycle i e more severe droughts and or rainfall events while a decreasing trend of hy int is observed in northwestern china which implies less wet dry extremes future change of hy int is further assessed based on the outputs from climate models in the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 and phase 6 cmip5 and cmip6 under the more realistic medium stabilization emission scenarios the models are weighted by the performances in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed hy int results of weighted multi model ensemble suggest an increased hydrological cycle over most part of china especially in the yangtze river basin indicating more wet dry extremes while an exception is seen in northwest china where the hy int will decline due to the dominance of the decreased dry spell length over the increased precipitation intensity this reveals an alleviated intensity of hydrological cycle and fewer wet dry extreme events therein similar to the change in recent decades the changes of hy int are attributed to the different variation patterns in the precipitation probability which are associated with the change in atmospheric instability and moisture content keywords hydroclimatic intensity climate projection global warming hydrological cycle china weighted multi model ensemble data availability the daily gauged precipitation data are obtained from the national meteorological information center at website http www nmic the daily precipitation data from the 57 cmip5 6 models listed in table 1 are available at website https esgf node llnl gov 1 introduction mainland china is located in eastern asia with vast territory and various climates due to its large population and developed economics weather and climate extremes can lead to substantial adverse impacts on mainland china during the past decades it has experienced record flood and drought events which to a considerate extent are attributed to the changing water equilibrium maintained by atmosphere precipitation and surface evapotranspiration under global warming huntington 2006 troch et al 2008 ziegler et al 2003 for example anomalous rainstorm wrought havoc in south and east china in 2015 2017 2020 xie et al 2016 wei et al 2020 and also a series of drought events hit much of south china in 2009 2011 2013 2016 tang et al 2014 xiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 the flood and drought lead to numerous economic losses related to diminish harvests transportation and energy disruption and human casualties chou et al 2019 javadinejad et al 2021 talebmorad et al 2021 particularly the average annual economic loss in china caused by flood was us 16 5 billion in 2012 2020 wei et al 2020 and the loss caused by drought was us 23 2 billion in 2010 2017 zhang et al 2020 far more than other meteorological hazards it is therefore of vital importance to investigate the change of extreme hydrological events related to precipitation as this will provide insight into probable changes in the occurrence and magnitude of flood and drought this will then guide suitable adaptation strategies and disaster mitigation policies fatahi et al 2021 wei et al 2018 the occurrences of extreme hydrological events are closely tied to the change in precipitation intensity and or frequency zhai et al 2005 used gauged rainfall from 1951 to 2000 at 750 stations of china and revealed an increased trend in total annual accumulated precipitation in eastern and northwestern china and a decreased trend in a southwest northeast orientated region consisting of much china a similar but greater trend in total annual rainfall was obtained by yin and sun 2018 with the observations at 2 400 stations from 1961 to 2017 and by zhou et al 2016 with gridded precipitation records from 1961 to 2010 additionally zhai et al 2005 found an increased trend in precipitation intensity in whole china as for the frequency of precipitation studies showed a decrease throughout most of china except for its northwest liu et al 2005 zhang and cong 2014 further long spell precipitation events with moderate and light intensities had decreased while short spell events with heavy intensity increased in much of the country bai et al 2007 shi et al 2018 the future trend of precipitation was also concerned the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 models projected no significant change in total annual precipitation in china as a whole but an increase in western china li et al 2016 they have also projected an increased intensity of daily rainfall in the country as a whole along with a decreased frequency in south china but an increase in north china li et al 2016 xu et al 2015 the changes in total amount as well as the intensity and frequency of precipitation are important factors reflecting the hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2011 zhang and cong 2014 having recognized changes of rainfall features studies attempted to use various climate indices based on precipitation to qualitatively understand the change of hydrological cycle in china huang et al 2020 zhai et al 2010 these indices include annual accumulated precipitation amount palmer drought severity index standardized precipitation precipitation recycling and aridity index etc the indices yielded an overall consensus in southeast china where there were increased extreme precipitation events and also the intensified drought occurrences in the past decades implying an increased hydrological cycle however different even opposite results are seen elsewhere for example focusing on northeast china gao et al 2006 used precipitation amount and zhai et al 2010 used palmer drought severity index to assess the hydrological cycle both indices concluded a decreasing trend while the standardized precipitation index exhibited no change in most stations zhai et al 2010 in southwest china the precipitation recycling index indicated that the hydrological cycle had decreased in the western area but increased in eastern area guo and wang 2014 but an overall increase was found by a standardized precipitation index tang et al 2021 as for semiarid and arid areas of northwest china disagreements were even evident huang et al 2020 found an increase in its central part and a decrease elsewhere using an aridity index while yao et al 2020 suggested a significantly accelerated hydrological cycle in whole region based on a precipitation recycling index using a modified palmer drought severity index yu et al 2019 found no significant signal because the irrigation can alleviate most of the negative change xu et al 2022 concluded a mitigated likelihood of hydrological cycle using a dry condition index these disagreements in the change of hydrological cycle brought obvious inconvenience to the management and planning of local water resources as well as the enactment of disaster mitigation policies huang et al 2020 ostad ali askari et al 2017 sun et al 2022 such disagreements may arise from that these various indices emphasis on different aspects of hydrological cycle it is known that a same hydroclimatic response may manifest a different change of wet and dry events giorgi et al 2011 trenberth et al 2003 for example an increase in total precipitation can arise from several different ways in terms of precipitation characteristics 1 more frequent and more intense rainfall events 2 more frequent but less intense events and 3 less frequent and more intense events thus the indices in the aforementioned previous studies only using separated or partial wet and dry features may be imperfect since they lack an integrated signal of hydroclimatic response this can account for the disagreements in the change of regional hydrological cycle in recent decades to address the above issue giorgi et al 2011 proposed a single index hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which is the product of the normalized precipitation intensity int times the normalized dry spell length dsl it provides an overall metric of hydroclimatic intensity previously int is used to measure the intensity of precipitation events regardless of its frequency while dsl is used to measure the frequency of precipitation regardless of its intensity their product hy int integrates and amplifies both the change signals of int and dsl and thus exhibits an advantage over either int or dsl in quantifying hydrological cycle this will be seen from the following analysis assume the total precipitation remains constant but with an intensified amplitude and a reduced frequency this yields an increase in both int and dsl resulting in an amplified increase of hy int relative to either int or dsl and thus highlighting an acceleration of the hydrological cycle besides for a specific situation with a large increase in total precipitation along with a substantial increase in int but a nearly unchanged dsl a contradictory result is obtained when using int to quantify the hydrological cycle with that when using dsl the former deduces an accelerating hydrological cycle but nearly unchanged for the latter however when using hy int the increased hydrological cycle can be captured because the change in int overwhelms that in dsl this means that the adaption of hy int can capture the change in hydrological cycle which may be missed when using single wet or dry indices thus hy int is an innovative measure of the strength of hydrological cycle as reflected by precipitation features and an increasing in hy int represents an increasing risk of wet and or dry extreme see section 3 hy int has exhibited the advantages in detecting and attributing the changes of hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2014a giorgi et al 2014b studies in india korean peninsula africa and south america by using hy int suggested intensified hydrological cycles and the signal was stronger than that revealed by single int or dsl giorgi et al 2014b im et al 2016 mohan and rajeevan 2017 under the context of global warming it s intriguing to investigate whether hydrological cycle in china has changed and how it will change in future so far no research has used the hy int to analyze the changes of hydrological cycle in china as a whole therefore assessing the changes of hydrological cycle during the past decades projecting its future changes and discussing the properties by using the hy int index based on the observation and the state of the art cmip5 6 model ensemble are the primary objectives of the present study the results will not only provide a new perspective for the study of hydrological cycle change and projection in china but also reconcile the prevalent regional disagreements in previous studies the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes datasets and methods in particular the definition of hy int section 3 analyzes the observed change of hy int section 4 projects the future trend of hy int by using cmip5 6 projection experiments weighted multi model ensemble strategy weighted mme is used finally conclusions and discussions are given in section 5 2 datasets and methods 2 1 datasets daily gauged precipitation data at 540 stations throughout china fig 1 a from 1 january 1961 to 31 december 2017 is provided by the national meteorological information center china meteorological administration in order to discard flaw or artificial trends stations with the annual sum day number with default precipitation over 5 of the total daily series length have been excluded to address the changes in future climate gridded daily precipitation outputs from thirty one models participating in cmip5 and twenty six models participating in cmip6 are employed table 1 in order to treat all the models equally only their first run r1i1p1 r1i1p1f1 is analyzed the experiments include the historical run with historically evolving forcing for 1961 2005 in cmip5 and 1961 2014 in cmip6 the projection run with prescribed forcing of representative concentration pathway 4 5 scenario rcp4 5 for 2006 2100 in cmip5 and shared socioeconomic pathway 2 4 5 scenario ssp2 4 5 for 2015 2100 in cmip6 taylor et al 2012 o neill et al 2016 rcp4 5 is a medium stabilization scenario that follows a rising radiative forcing pathway leading to 4 5 w m2 in 2100 ssp2 4 5 is an update version of rcp4 5 which represents a combined scenario of a medium energy intensive socio economic developmental path with a rising radiative forcing peaking at 4 5 w m2 in 2100 details on the cmip5 6 models and their configurations are described at https esgf node llnl gov consider the mismatch of horizontal resolution of the cmip5 6 models all simulation data are re gridded to a mid resolution horizontal grid of 1 0 1 0 using a bilinear interpolation algorithm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 calculation of hy int index following giorgi et al 2011 the value of hy int for a given year at a single station or grid cell is simply given as follows 1 hy i n t i n t d s l here int is the normalized mean annual precipitation intensity averaged rainfall intensity during wet days and dsl is the normalized mean annual dry spell length number of dry days during each dry spell event normalized is relative to the climatological mean for 1961 2017 when calculating hy int daily precipitation is only considered to rainy days when the precipitation amount in that day is above 1 mm day giorgi et al 2011 im et al 2016 mohan and rajeevan 2017 otherwise the day is treated as a dry day from the above eq 1 hy int increases when both int and dsl increase or when the increase in each overwhelms the decrease in the other when without large change in mean precipitation but with reduced rain frequency and enhanced intensity both int and dsl could increase in an interconnected fashion giorgi et al 2011 as such an increasing hy int indicates a combined response toward a regime with more intense but less frequent rain events 2 2 2 weighted multi model ensemble since experiments from a total of 31 cmip5 and 26 cmip6 models are available to project the future hy int here the multi model ensemble mme is used considering the diversity of models results ma et al 2022 xu et al 2015 briefly a weighted multi model ensemble weighted mme strategy proposed by li et al 2016 is used the strategy first evaluates the performances of each model in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed hy int then it can rank all the models based on their integrated behaviors consequently the strategy uses the former ranks to calculate the weight for each model in that way we can assign higher weights to the models with better skills before building weighted mme and vice versa the details on the processes of building weighted mme of the present study are described in appendix studies have shown that the new generation cmip6 models show improvements compared to the last generation cmip5 models but in some aspects such as the uncertainty range and systematic frequency biases of precipitation jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 the cmip6 models do not exhibit substantial improvements the weighted mme strategy allows us to favor the models with good precipitation simulation regardless of their generation and also profoundly increase the sample size of weighted mme studies have proved that the weighted mme has better credibility relative to the equal weight mme or a single model e g acharya et al 2014 li et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2020 wanders and wood 2016 the trend is computed by using least squares linear regression for each station in observation or for each grid cell in the models the significance of the results is validated by using a two tailed student s t test 2 2 3 regional definitions to understand the regional hydroclimatic response to global warming mainland china is divided into six subregions fig 1a northeast china nec north china nc northwest china nwc southwest china swc the mid lower yangtze river valley yr and south china sc based on their different topography social and climate condition xu et al 2011 the climates in four subregions including sc yr nc and nec are governed by the seasonal progress of east asian monsoon and that in nwc is arid and semi arid inland climate pattern and that in swc is tropical subtropical plateau climate pattern 3 change of observed hy int fig 1a c show the spatial distributions of observed int dsl and hy int in 1961 2017 int is quite unevenly distributed across china decreasing from southeastern coastal areas to northwestern inlands the least int value is only 3 mm day and the largest is 22 mm day for the dsl the observation exhibits low values over southeastern china increasing northwestward the largest dsl is observed in the inland deserts of the nwc with a value of 96 1 days such int and dsl distributions are attributed to china s monsoon climate based on int and dsl the distribution of hy int is shown in the fig 1c which suggests a clear spatial heterogeneity in general the high hy int climatology is observed in a southwest northeast orientated region of china where is at the margin of the east asian monsoon region the abundant or deficient states of water vapor alternately occurred in this region making it one of the regions with strong hydrological cycle in china specifically at the junction of nc and nec a higher hy int center is observed with a value reaching more than 1 030 and at the west side of yr sc and the east side swc observation also shows a high hy int area with a maximum value of 1 032 by contrast the low hy int is observed in nwc which implies a slow hydrological cycle it is worth noting that the high values are observed in the context of low hy int peripherally at several stations in the two red boxes of fig 1c these stations are all located in a unique transition zone between desert and wetland the dry climate background results in long term droughts here while the precipitation events also occur frequently due to the sufficiently local water supply these are responsible for the high hy int at these stations fig 1d f show the spatial distribution of observed trend in int dsl and hy int during 1961 2017 in china as a whole int has increased by 7 1 since 1961 with a trend value of 0 12 mm day per decade over 75 stations show growth with high numbers in sc yr and nwc these results are consistent with zhai et al 2005 who displayed an enhanced intensity of precipitation during the recent decades as for dsl it exhibits a decrease by 8 4 since 1961 0 15 days per decade the decreases occur at about 60 stations particularly in west and northeast china albeit an increase in central china a similar change was reported by duan et al 2016 and lei and duan 2011 the trend of each subregion is displayed in table 2 which suggests an int increase in nwc swc yr and sc and a dsl decrease in nwc along with insignificant change elsewhere as for hy int fig 1f a significant increase is observed over central south china which is in agreement with the congruent increase of int and dsl this means a shift toward a regime of intensified daily precipitation intensity but with fewer shorter rainy days in east yr the increased hy int is attributed to the overwhelming role of int over that of dsl indicating the intensified daily precipitation amount and more rainy days and increase in the total precipitation subsequently an exception is in nwc and nec the hy int shows a decrease because of the dominance of decreased dsl implying an alleviated hydrological cycle fig 2 presents temporal evolution of regional hy int a significant decrease is seen in nwc with a rate of 0 026 per decade fig 2a along with a significant increase in sc yr and nc with a rate of 0 029 0 018 and 0 017 per decade fig 2c 2e respectively in comparison the change is insignificant in swc 0 008 per decade and nec 0 006 per decade here we obtain a reduction of hydrological cycle in nwc which is in agreement with the reduced dry days liu et al 2014 and increased precipitation li et al 2019 although the dry wet changes in nwc is controversial and the results are discrepant in previous studies based on different data periods and indices hy int is an index measuring the intensity of hydrological cycle giorgi et al 2011 more importantly it can be a useful indicator of the risks of exceptionally wet dry extremes to further elucidate the relationship between hy int and extreme events in china two extreme indices r95 the total amount with daily precipitation rate above the 95 percentile and mcd the maximum number of consecutive dry days are used comparing fig 1 with fig 3 it can find the high similarities in the climatology and the trend of geographical pattern between r95 and int mcd and dsl specifically the correlation coefficient between climatology int and r95 dsl and mcd is 0 98 0 87 moreover 80 stations observe the same trend for int and r95 and that for dsl and mcd are 70 stations these similarities indicate a large hy int can be considered as a high occurrence of extreme hydrological events extreme wet and or dry events and the increasing of hy int can represent increasing risks of extreme hydrological events thus in fig 1c and 1f the high value and the increase of hy int in central east china imply a high probability of extreme hydrological events indeed previous studies show that the extreme precipitation and drought have become more frequent therein xie et al 2016 tang et al 2014 xiang et al 2015 compared to east low value and the decrease of hy int in nwc indicate it is less likely to experience hydrological extremes several papers have indeed found a decrease in drought frequency in nwc over the past decades albeit with an increased intensity ma et al 2022 yu et al 2019 4 future projection of hy int 4 1 the validation of weighted mme here we use a weighted mme strategy to reduce the uncertainties of the projection it decides the weights for different models based on their performances in reproducing observed hydrological feature in the historical simulation the evaluation of models and the calculation of the weights are presented in appendix to illustrate the advantage of weighted mme strategy we compare the weighted mme and the simple mme equal weight mme with the observation the spatial correlation coefficient between observation and simple mme int dsl hy int is 0 78 0 56 0 29 by applying the weighted mme it exhibits substantial improvement in reproducing the observation with the spatial correlation coefficient of int dsl hy int rising to 0 89 0 63 0 50 hereafter just the results from weighted mme are shown fig 4 a c show the spatial distribution of int dsl and hy int based on weighted mme in 1961 2017 weighted mme reproduces the int s pattern of more in south and less in north but it tends to underestimate the magnitude in southeastern china which arises from the commonly systemic bias with underestimated rainfall intensity in most of the cmip5 6 models jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 for dsl weighted mme captures the large scale features well the low values in the southeast and high values in northwest desert are reproduced as for hy int the high value center in nec nc and southeast as well as the low value in northwest are well captured by weighted mme however due to the coarse resolution of cmip5 6 model weighted mme fails to resolve the local scale hydrological features like the high hy int of several stations in nwc fig 4d f show the spatial distribution of weighted mme s trend in 1961 2017 int shows an increasing trend in most parts of china but the significant increase is mainly located in the north and west this is different from the observed increase concentrating in the south the trend of simulated dsl exhibits good agreement with observed in the most part of china except for east in the eastern china a visible increase is simulated which is opposite to the observation as for hy int the weighted mme s trend is fairly consistent with observation with a decrease in west and part of northeast and an increase in southeast table 3 lists the reproduced trends of int dsl and hy int in the six subregions the int trend in nwc swc sc yr nc as well as the dsl trend in nwc swc sc nec are consistent with observation as for hy int the observed decrease in nwc and the increase in swc sc yr and nc are reproduced as for individual models more than half of the models yield consistent trend with weighted mme the above analyses suggest an overall consistence in simulation with observation this lays a basis for projecting hy int s future trend by using weighted mme 4 2 projection results fig 5 shows the projected trend of int dsl and hy int over china by weighted mme from 2018 to 2100 int exhibits a significant growth throughout china with the maximum in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the largest increased trend is 0 18 mm day per decade dsl is projected to increase in the southeastern china and south side of tibet plateau but decrease in northern china the most prominent reduction occurs in the arid northwest with the largest value by 1 38 days per decade as for hy int it is projected to increase in majority area of china but decrease in northwestern china the most visible increase occurs at the southern side of the tibetan plateau with a maximum growth rate of 0 031 per decade additionally the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river plain is also projected to be a center of hy int increase with a value reaching 0 022 per decade it is worth noting that the two regions have observed high hy int fig 1c and fig 4c in the past few decades and the significant increase may indicate more record extreme hydrological events in future the most visible hy int reduction occurs at northwest of nwc with a minimum value of 0 029 per decades which implies a lower probability of occurrence in hydrological extremes in future table 4 lists the projected trend of int and dsl averaged in individual subregions int shows significant increase in all six subregions 0 024 0 126 mm day per decade as for dsl the decrease in nwc swc nc and nec and the increase in sc and yr are projected it is worth specifying that the trend of dsl in nwc 0 297 days per decade is much greater than that of other regions 0 046 0 007 days per decade which is because of the higher climatology dsl in nwc 14 8 days compared to 3 9 to 8 6 days in other regions as for individual models almost all of 57 models yield a consistent increase in int the dsl also shows high model agreements over nwc swc nc and nec fig 6 presents evolution of hy int by weighted mme black lines averaged in individual subregions in 2018 2100 a deceased hy int in nwc 0 006 per decade fig 6a is projected which is attributed to the predominant dsl decrease in swc nc and nec hy int exhibits an increase 0 011 0 003 and 0 004 per decade fig 6b 6e 6f which is attributed to the overwhelming of the increased int over the decreased dsl besides weighted mme projects a prominent increase of hy int in sc and yr 0 014 and 0 015 per decade fig 6c and 6d because of the increase in both int and dsl please note that the projected trend of all subregions is statistically significant implying that hy int is a sensitive index to the emission scenarios and is indeed a powerful measure for detecting and accessing the response of hydroclimatic signatures to global warming moreover the individual models show a high model agreement with about 63 1 70 2 75 4 89 5 66 7 and 70 2 models yield a same trend as weighted mme over nwc swc sc yr nc and nec respectively this indicates high credibility of hy int decrease in nwc and increase in other subregions in order to quantify the change of hy int fig 7 illustrates the change ratio of int dsl and hy int encompassing the period for the early 2021 2040 mid 2051 2070 and late 2081 2100 future relative to 1981 2000 int shows increases fig 7a which are consistent with above analysis the growths are more pronounced but with larger inter model range in eastern china yr nc and nec for the late future the greatest int growth of weighted mme occurs in yr of about 11 8 followed by nc 11 5 and nec 11 2 it can find a relatively small inter model range in nwc and swc which could be an indication of more reliable projections the dsl exhibits a visible decrease in nwc nc and nec fig 7b particularly the 75th quantiles of the three regions are all negative in the three periods indicating a good agreement among the models the most notable dsl decline occurs in nwc with about 22 6 in late future however the 75th quantile is positive while the 25th quantile is negative in swc sc and yr implying a large discrepancy between models and an uncertainty of the projection in term of hy int the decreased dsl overwhelms the increased int causing a relative reduction in nwc with about 2 4 4 3 and 5 8 in near mid and late future in the other five subregions the dominant increase of int results in an increased hy int in all three future periods the greatest weighted mme growth of hy int occurs in yr of about 14 4 followed by sc 13 9 and swc 12 7 in late future the 75th quantile of nwc is close to 0 and the 25th quantile of other five regions are generally positive indicating a high model agreement additionally the change ratio of weighted mme is generally greater than that of median this means the high weight models project more prominent change compared to the others as indicated by hy int the key of hydrological cycle change lies in the changes in precipitation features thus an in depth analysis in the probability distribution changes of daily precipitation amount is conducted below for this analysis data from all grid cells are taken into account fig 8 shows the change of daily precipitation amount for the three future periods across various rainfall intervals in nwc nc and nec fig 8a 8e and 8f the change pattern is similar that is most of the models yield a decreased number of non rainy days below 1 mm day and an increased number of rainy days above 1 mm day in spite of an in between difference the increased intensity in all rainfall intervals is responsible for the increased int while the decreased non rainy days accounts for decreased dsl however such similar pattern reveals different hy int changes decrease in nwc but increase in nc and nec which may because the increase of light rainy days and the decrease of dry days in nwc are the most prominent another similar change pattern appears in sc and yr cases which is an increase in higher intensity rainfall above 10 mm day and a reduction in weaker intensity rainfall 1 10 mm day the increase of dsl is attributed to the reduced light moderate precipitation along with intensified heavy precipitation leading to an increased hy int in swc models yield a large disagreement in the changes of dry days and light rainy days which results in no obvious change in dsl while the enhanced moderate heavy precipitation above 5 mm day increases the int which can explain the growth of hy int 5 conclusions and discussions the changing climate is significantly influencing the hydrological cycle and consequently affecting behavior of climate extremes however different hydrological indices lead to obvious disagreements in the changes of hydrological cycle in china because various indices emphasis mainly on either wet or dry feature of the hydrological cycle to reconcile these disagreements this study has utilized a hydroclimatic intensity index hy int which integrates two hydroclimatic wet int and dry dsl metrics it can provide a more specific signal for hydrological cycle and give a new perspective in understanding the response of the hydrological extremes due to global warming using a daily gauged precipitation dataset hy int change in china over the past decades has been assessed next based on cmip5 6 model outputs the future projection is carried out using a weighted mme strategy specifically we quantitatively assess the 57 cmip5 6 models based on their abilities in reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed precipitation and rank the models based on their integrated skills the weight is calculated according to above model ranks when building weighted mme ensemble main conclusions are as follows 1 the high hy int centers observed by the gauges are located in the northeastern and southwestern china exhibiting a southwest northeast orientated distribution the hy int in the southeastern china is moderate while the low values are observed in the arid and semi arid regions of the northwestern china as for the trend in the past decades by and large the observed hy int records are characterized by increase over center south china which indicates the hydrological cycle has accelerated and more extreme hydrological events have occurred while hy int shows a decrease in northwestern china implying the reduction of hydrological cycle based on the historical simulation it is found that weighted mme strategy can well reproduce the spatial distribution and the trend of observed hy int this lay a basis for the credibility of future projection based on weighted mme 2 during the twenty first century 2018 2100 hy int shows a change pattern like the high get higher and the low get lower in china it is project to increase over the most area of china which is in agreement with the overwhelming of the increased int moreover weighted mme shows that the regions like southeastern china with moderate hy int would increase profoundly these regions will become more vulnerable to hydrological extremes in future an exception is in northwestern china where the hy int exhibits a decline which is attributed to the dominance of the decreased dsl over the increased int the present study provides a clear change signal of hydrological cycle in china by hy int index in east china such as an intensified likelihood of regional hydrological cycle is attributed to the shift of asian monsoon and the increase of atmospheric instability several studies have indicated that the summer monsoon is projected to stronger in the twenty first century bao 2012 jiang et al 2020 the northward moisture transport is greatly enhanced thus leading to more moisture supply for the occurrence of precipitation coupled with increased atmospheric instability due to surface warming li et al 2016 the extreme precipitation would also increase the associated potential risks of wet dry extreme are deserved to pay more attention and provide support mitigation strategies by the public and decision makers in northwest china the decline of hy int is associated with the increased rainfall intensity and increased rainy days which is consistent with the consensus in previous studies that climate is transiting from dry to wet therein yang et al 2021 the increased rainfall is caused by the obvious increase in moisture flux convergence peng and zhou 2017 despite the horizontal moisture advection appears to reduced and the enhanced evaporation increases the occurrence of rainy cloudiness and further decreases the dry spell days shen et al 2022 these corresponding changes of precipitation can all be seen in the variation of probability in fig 8 it is worth noting that the change of hydrological cycle in northwest china has always been a controversial issue the studies based on different periods and indices often yield disagreements in the current study hy int suggests an alleviation of climatologic hydrological cycle the observed increases of rainfall and vegetation cover dai et al 2011 as well as decreased drought frequency ma et al 2022 yu et al 2019 seem support the results it is good to find that the better consensus among the models in their projected trend of hy int however there still exist some uncertainties in the present study the weighted mme strategy is a challenge because the weight can amplify the deficiencies of the model li et al 2016 wanders and wood 2016 therefore studies suggested that the projection based on simple mme is also essential jiang et al 2020 xin et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 here a statistical downscaling strategy the quantile mapping bias correction simple mme biascorrect mme is applied to achieve the same projection objective the strategy matches the distribution function of the model s raw rainfall series to the observed through adjusting mean variance and quantile distribution and thus preserves the extremes intrinsic to the model themeβl et al 2012 grillakis et al 2013 fang et al 2015 which is an effective strategy to improve the confidence of projection generally the trends of this strategy the red lines in fig 6 are consistent with weighted mme despite with different change magnitude this similar change supports the analysis of weighted mme and thus indicates a robust projection of hy int in the present study in our future work since cmip5 6 models generally have coarse horizontal resolution and thus yield low credibility in projecting regional extreme climate the application of dynamical downscaling methods of regional models nested within global models fang et al 2015 im et al 2016 specifically for precipitation will be certainly needed to refine the climate information with coarse resolution and to support further assessment of hy int credit authorship contribution

reviewers for their comments and constructive suggestions appendix the weights used in the present study are obtained by the performances for reproducing both spatial distribution and inter annual variability of observed variables referring to li et al 2016 and chen et al 2011 to assess models overall ability in reproducing spatial distribution the taylor diagram taylor 2001 is employed which can provide a statistical summary of comparison between simulations and observation in terms of their spatial correlation coefficient cc root mean square difference rms and standard deviations difference sd the rms and the sd are normalized by the corresponding observed a perfect spatial simulation is characterized by both the rms and sd are equal to 0 and the cc is close to 1 in terms of temporal variation because of no initialization for the oceanic model component in cmip5 6 models one should not expect that their historical runs have the ability to reproduce the observed evolution jiang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 but we can expect that models can reproduce the temporal standard deviation which is evaluated by a measure of skill score inter annual variability skill ivs described by chen et al 2011 as follows a1 ivs std m std o std o std m 2 where stdm and stdo denote the inter annual standard deviation of model simulations and observation respectively a better agreement between the simulations and observation would be that the ivs value is close to 0 then we can rank models ranka based on their taylor diagram indices and ivs respectively the rank of the best performing model is 1st and the worst model is 57st for its rank and an overall rank considering spatial and temporal indices can be obtained with a comprehensive rating index mr respectively which is defined as a2 mr 1 1 mn i 1 n rank a i where the m is the number of models and n is the number of indices n 3 in spatial n 1 in temporal the value of mr which is closer to 1 means the higher skill after we got the sum of mr rank rankb in spatial and temporal the weight wi of each model is obtained as described by chen et al 2011 jiang et al 2016 a3 r i i 1 m rankb i rankb i and a4 w i r i i 1 m r i ri can be considered as combined performance indicator for an individual model i higher value indicates a better model skill the evaluation of models and the calculation of the weights in the present study are as follows considering the hy int is a diagnostic variable which is difficult to reproduce just its component int and dsl are used fig a1 a shows the rank for three spatial indices cc rms and sd in 1961 2005 as shading column 1 3 for int column 5 7 for dsl for int kace 1 0 g 0 90 exhibits best performance in cc followed by ec earth3 veg lr 0 88 mri esm2 0 0 87 and access

based on mr for spatial performance column 1 kace 1 0 g is the best with mr of 0 86 followed by access cm2 0 84 cmcc cm 0 80 mri cgcm3 0 74 and csiro mk3 6 0 0 71 generally the models from the same institution perform with similar skills to each other and the models with higher rank generally have a higher resolution for example the horizontal resolution of the first fourteen spatial ranked models is less than 2 2 except for noresm2 lm but that of the last four models is greater than 2 table 1 this validates that the insufficient spatial resolution is one major source of uncertainty for the spatial simulation jiang et al 2020 sillmann et al 2013 also the models with higher skills in reproducing spatial pattern in whole china generally perform better in the subregions not shown column 2 of fig a1b shows the models ranks based on their ivs access cm2 shows the highest rank with mr of 0 96 followed by kace 1 0 g 0 89 mri esm2 0 0 88 noresm2 lm 0 84 and cmcc cm2 sr5 0 83 next we use the former ranks to calculate the weight for each model before building weighted mme first we integrate the mr ranks of taylor diagram indices and ivs into one i e the sum of column 1 and 2 in fig a1b from table a1 column of sum of mr rank access cm2 and kace 1 0 g are the most perfect models followed by mri esm2 0 then by cmcc cms and cmcc esm2 interestingly the ranks of cmip6 models are general higher than those of cmip5 for example the best three models all belong to cmip6 eight of the top ten models are members of cmip6 the average rank of cmip6 models is 24 9 while that of cmip5 models is 32 5 these suggest that cmip6 models show overall improvement in simulating precipitation features in china compared with cmip5 the correspondent weight column of weight in table a1 for each model can be calculated using the eq a4 the model with a weight greater than the mean weight 0 018 or 1 57 is marked with boldface indicating a larger than mean ratio when building the weighted mme consequently based on the weight assigned to all 57 models the models are combined to calculate the weighted mme ensemble using eq a5 a5 weighted mme i 1 57 w i v i where vi is the variables int dsl hy iny value of the corresponding model
