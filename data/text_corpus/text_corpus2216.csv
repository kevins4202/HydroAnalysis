11080,water scarcity is considered one of the biggest global risks worldwide not only because affects every continent but mostly because it can have dramatic impact in a long term deficit irrigation strategies can help in coping with this water scarcity and optimizing the water efficiency both regulated deficit irrigation rdi in moderate and severe levels and sustained deficit irrigation sdi were applied in almond nut crop within this study and quality parameters of obtained fruits were analyzed almost all morphological and physicochemical parameters were not affected by the water stress however statistically significant differences among treatments were observed for the fat content the highest value being reached by moderate rdi treatment besides differences were also found for total organic acids content calcium potassium manganese and for six fatty acids myristic palmitic margaric cis heptadecenoic cis vaccenic and arachidic acids content according to experimental findings it can be concluded that irrigation strategies do not affect almond fruit quality being possible to increase the final quality of nuts when moderate rdi is applied keywords bioactive compounds deficit

same as other mediterranean regions must consider to implement different strategies in order to achieve a higher resilience in terms of water scarcity garcía tejero and duran zuazo 2018 moreover around 70 of all fresh water withdrawals are consumed by agriculture sector and used for the food production which more than 40 comes from irrigated fields du et al 2015 the mediterranean agriculture must be involved in projects on how to manage the water productivity because of being a great example for arid and semiarid farming fields egea et al 2013 spain is a country with high levels of water stress particularly in the southern side due to the low rainfall and the high evaporative claim during the almond growing season despite the relative tolerance of almond to water stress there are

xlstat premium 2016 addinsoft new york usa and statgraphics plus version 3 1 statistical graphics corp rockville ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation table 1 shows the amount of water received for each treatment significant differences among control irrigation t1 and deficit treatments were found minimum values of swp of each treatment presented statistically significant differences with t2 and t3 samples having the lowest values and t4 similar to the control stress integral showed significant differences among the control t1 rdi t2 t3 and sdi t4 in all deficit treatments the level of water stress was severe however no significant differences were found among treatments in yield t1 2 2 t ha 1 t2 1 9 t ha 1 t3 1 9 t ha 1 t4 1 9 t ha 1 with stress levels achieving a reduction of 10 20 the targeted levels for t3 and t4 trees these levels of stress may influence the yield of the next harvest because the post harvest period is especially sensitive to the deficit garcía tejero et al 2018 3 2 effect of deficit irrigation on the morphological and physico chemical parameters the different deficit irrigation strategies evaluated in the present study did not have a significant effect on most of the almond quality parameters only a color coordinate this finding agreed with other studies on deficit irrigation not only in almonds but also with pistachio and olives in which many quality parameters were not affected by deficit irrigation strategies if applied at moderate levels cano lamadrid et al 2015 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 egea et al 2009 sanchez rodriguez et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 as said above just the a coordinate the green red and the hue angle were significantly different for treatments when analyzing morphology instrumental color and texture table 2 the a color coordinate gives information about whether a sample is redder when positive values are obtained or greener for the negative ones table 2 indicates that almonds from the t2 treatment were more reddish when compared to the other treatments under study especially those from the control treatment t1 hue coordinate was lower in t2 treatment indicating an intensification on the typical brown color of the almond skin martínez esplá et al 2017 for the texture parameters no significant differences were observed among the applied treatments this finding agreed with results on almonds by cornacchia et al 2010 in almond trees growing under rdi and partial root zone drying prd but also in i orange trees in the study by stagno et al 2015 and ii apples under deficit irrigation and sustainable strategies in the study by du et al 2015 on the contrary harder texture was found in studies about pistachio and softest texture in olives under severe water stress conditions cano lamadrid et al 2015 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 both color and texture are important parameters which the best described the raw almond quality contador et al 2015 textural properties specially crunchiness are of utmost importance for the consumer acceptability cheely et al 2018 kernel ratio was not affected by the irrigation treatments neither the dry weight of the samples table 3 this finding agreed with stewart et al 2011 who concluded that both crop consumptive water use and irrigation could be decreased without having a significant effect on the almond yield on the contrary egea et al 2013 showed in their study about long term deficit irrigation in almond trees that water stress had a negative impact on the kernel yield during 2002 and 2005 but no differences were observed during 2006 last year of study with moderate strategies regarding kernel dry weight egea et al 2009 concluded that water stress applied at severe levels had a negative impact not reducing the almond yield with the deficit irrigation under study signify important gains for almond growers which can produce the same amount of almonds reducing the water consumption the average value of moisture content was around 3 9 39 g kg 1 and no statistically significant differences among treatments were observed this finding agreed with cornacchia et al 2010 who observed no differences on moisture content among treatments moisture content is the total quantity of water contained in a product because the almond is a low moisture food the industry standards for the raw almonds range between 3 6 moisture content these values are considered as the optimal ones for minimum biological reactions and essential to preserve the almond quality increasing the shelf life huang 2014 the optimal aw values for almonds stored in cool and dry conditions range from 0 3 to 0 6 gama et al 2018 huang 2014 all 4 treatments under study reached values between these limits but t2 t3 and t4 showed significantly higher aw chemical composition of the almonds is presented in table 4 neither protein nor ash content were statistically significant different among treatments this result was similar to those reported by egea et al 2009 but did not agree with those reported by sanchez bel et al 2008 who observed higher protein content for non irrigated almond farming when compared to the drip irrigated ones almonds from t2 showed significantly higher fat content and the opposite phenomenon was observed for t4 previous studies proved an increase in the lipid content of almonds and pistachio under moderate rdi carbonell barrachina et al 2015 egea et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 stated that almond fat content was constant under moderate di and it did not increase when an excess of irrigation water was applied and started to decrease under severe water stress conditions both nanos et al 2002 and sanchez bel et al 2008 showed a constant fat content when irrigated with non irrigated samples were compared many authors have observed a negative correlation between protein and fat content when studying almonds growing under water stress a higher fat content was associated with a lower protein content however this phenomenon was not observed in the current study egea et al 2009 regarding the carbohydrates the highest mean value was observed for the t4 samples and the opposite for almonds t2 the almond carbohydrates include polysaccharides frequently linked to dietary fiber and a relatively low amount of soluble sugars which are responsible for the sweet taste to the almond total sugar content was not influenced by the treatments studied table 4 and agreed with other studies about the same topic egea et al 2009 nanos et al 2002 statistically significant differences were observed in total organic acids content among treatments with t4 recording the highest values of all treatments table 4 this finding disagreed with the results obtained by other authors who observed no significant differences in organic acids among treatments egea et al 2009 sanchez bel et al 2008 from a commercial and industrial point of view the chemical composition of almonds it is very important and depends on the almond production destiny food industry such as almond oil production or turron typical spanish desert might be interested in almonds with high fat content rabadán et al 2017 verdú et al 2007 from a nutritional perspective many studies suggest that the almond lipid fraction might be the principal factor to influence alteration in insulin sensitivity and satiety mori et al 2011 almond protein content for instance can supply the recommended daily intake of protein for children 23 0 36 0 g and is also a good source for adults 44 56 g of protein recommended daily intake sobowale 2015 the present study suggested that deficit irrigation did not reduce the protein content with a mean value of 247 5 g kg 1 eating 30 g of almonds 20 almonds vairo cultivar would represents 17 of the total protein daily recommended intake for adults 3 3 mineral content both the soil and also the irrigation water have an influence in the mineral content of almonds the main almond minerals include ca cu fe zn k p se and na saura et al 1988 yada et al 2011 the elements studied in the current experiment were ca mg k macro nutrients and fe cu mn and zn micro nutrients the contents of mg fe cu and zn were not statistically significantly affected by irrigation treatments table 5 in fact the main minerals affected were ca and k with t3 treatment leading to the lowest ca content while t2 led to the highest content of k all treatments reached a high content of k which can lead to the conclusion that almonds might be a good source of this element mean values of all treatments 7 2 g kg 1 alimohammadi et al 2012 in their research about the effect of deficit irrigation in different phenological stages of almond fruit growth and development found no significant differences for both leaf and fruit mineral contents similar results were obtained by carbonell barrachina et al 2015 who stated that mineral content of pistachio nuts was only slightly affected by the irrigation treatments they found only two elements cu and zn which increased with water stress other studies in different fruits such as grapes olive tomatoes and apple also concluded that deficit irrigation strategies can be used without a negative impact on mineral nutrition both in leaves and fruit nakajima et al 2004 the only element which showed a decrease in deficit irrigation strategies in leaves of olive and grapes was k but no significant differences were obtained in fruits in the present study k increased for the treatment with moderate rdi t2 and the opposite was shown for fully irrigated almonds t1 as well as in severe rdi and sdi strategies fig 1 showed the applied k content through irrigation a and the amount of k found in soil and fruit b a strongly negative correlation 0 992 was observed between the amount of k administrated through irrigation treatments and the k measured at the topsoil 0 20 cm r2 0 98 p 0 01 a decrease in k content of fruit from fully irrigated treatment t1 as well as for treatments which presented higher levels of stress in plant t3 and t4 could occur due to the close relationship which exists between water availability e g leaching of minerals with excess water and minerals absorption the soluble mineral absorption depends on the water flow in the soil path to the plant roots which means that deficit irrigation applied in right levels could reduce the minerals leaching but also the saturation of minerals and biocides in the root zone alikhani koupaei et al 2018 mineral elements measured in other fruits such as apples tomatoes olives and grapes were not affected by deficit irrigation strategies when compared to the same fruits cultivated in better soil and irrigation conditions alikhani koupaei et al 2018 nakajima et al 2004 3 4 fatty acids almond lipid content is manly composed by monounsaturated mufa and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa as reported by literature the main fatty acids in almonds are oleic c18 1 linoleic c18 2 palmitic c16 0 stearic c18 0 and palmitoleic c16 1 acids in a decreasing order yada et al 2011 in the present study eighteen fatty acids were identified and quantified in all four treatments and they are all presented in table 6 in agreement with prior studies oleic acid was the most abundant fatty acid found within this study followed by linoleic palmitic stearic cis vaccenic and palmitoleic the fatty acid composition predominantly contained mufa and pufa although there were no statistically significant differences among treatments for the oleic acid the important finding is that mild water stress did not reduce the content and in fact a small increment could be observed oleic acid is a mufa with a great interest for human s health because it can reduce the low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and it is demonstrated that a higher content of oleic acid in almonds can avoid the fatty acids rancidification during storage transport and processing zamany et al 2017 the mean oleic acid content of all treatments was 65 and similar results 62 in nonpareil almonds variety was previously reported zhu et al 2015 to compare the level of oleic acid its contents in extra virgin olive oil peanut landrace oils sunflower seed oil tomato seed oil were 60 48 33 and from 17 to 26 depending on the tomato variety giuffrè and capocasale 2016 giuffrè et al 2017 giuffre et al 2017 2016 besides it was observed that if a thermal stress was applied to extra virgin olive oil the oleic acid increased from 60 to 63 giuffrè et al 2017 the current study revealed statistically significant differences among treatments for six fatty acids and those were myristic c14 0 palmitic c16 0 margaric c17 0 cis heptadecenoic c17 1 cis vaccenic c18 1n7 and arachidic c20 0 acids an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids gives a higher functionality to hydrosos almonds due to many studies in which authors state that products rich in mufa and pufa could contribute to cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases as well as obesity diabetes and cancers bitok and sabaté 2018 cis vaccenic which is an omega 7 fatty acid synthetized from palmitoleic acid by way of stearoyl coa desaturase 1 although the studies are very scarce cis vaccenic acid it was associated with a lower risk of heart failure from ischemic origin with antecedent coronary heart disease djoussé et al 2014 the present study revealed that a significant negative correlation was found between the stress integral and cis vaccenic fatty acid r2 0 70 p 0 0001 and showed that the higher the level of water stress in the plant the lower content of this unsaturated fatty acid fig 2 the mufa content 66 was higher in vayro almonds than in nonpareil ones 64 extra virgin olive oil 49 peanut landrace oils 49 sunflower seed oil 33 and tomatoes seed oil 18 giuffrè and capocasale 2016 giuffrè et al 2017 giuffre et al 2017 2016 zhu et al 2015 in addition pufa was also higher 23 than those of extra virgin olive oil 19 but lower than in nonpareil almonds 26 peanut landrace oils 33 sunflower seed oil 56 and tomato seed oil 49 63 table 6 shows that t2 treatment scored the highest values of those statistically significant different fatty acids even though differences were small fatty acids content increased when rdi was applied at moderate levels while the contrary was observed for the sdi treatment this finding assented with different authors who concluded that using a moderate deficit irrigation in almond pistachio or olives the fatty acid content was increased and the opposite was observed when a severe water stress was applied cano lamadrid et al 2015 2017 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 on the other hand disagreed with sanchez bel et al 2008 and nanos et al 2002 which found that using irrigation lead to a superior almond oil quality than a non irrigation treatment yada et al 2011 affirmed that both quantity and quality of the lipid content is highly dependent on the genotype geographical area climatic conditions of the growing season and water applied irrigation usually was found to have limited effects on the lipid quantity and quality these affirmations are actually stated by this study because no differences among treatments were observed neither for oleic linoleic pufa sfa pufa mufa ratio nor for total sfa saturated fatty acids mufa and pufa a high oleic linoleic ratio is an important benchmark to assess the storage stability of almond kernel and oil due to its preventive effect on lipid oxidation during processing storage and transport as explained above colic et al 2017 pufa sfa ratio is usually calculated because provides information about weather a diet is atherogenic or could promote coronary heart diseases this ratio has been calculated using only hypercholesterolemic acids lauric myristic and palmitic as required by several authors ulbricht and southgate 1991 on the other hand thrombogenic index offer information about formation of clots in the blood vessels and is defined as the ratio between pro thrombogenic represented by sfa and anti thrombogenic mufas pufas n6 and pufas n3 batista et al 2017 in this context analyzing the present study results can be concluded that irrigation treatments did not influence in the atherogenic and thrombogenic index maintaining in this way the health properties of almonds in addition if compared to other products it can be said that almonds have a reduced atherogenic and thrombogenic index batista et al 2017 4 conclusions this study is one of the first simultaneously evaluating quality parameters morphological physico chemical and functional of hydrosos almonds under regulated rdi and sustained sdi deficit irrigation as a general conclusion it can be highlighted that almost all of the measured parameters were not affected by none of the applied deficit irrigations strategies after one year long experiment kernel ratio was not influenced by di treatments however there were some statistically significant differences among treatments and almonds from t2 observing an improvement in relation to different compounds thus almonds from moderated rdi t2 were characterized by a redder color a higher fat and potassium content as well as a greater unsaturated fatty acid cis heptadecenoic cis vaccenic for all this reason moderate rdi t2 could be recommended as a suitable strategy when water availability is below to crop irrigation requirements without committing the final yield and fruit quality acknowledgments the

xlstat premium 2016 addinsoft new york usa and statgraphics plus version 3 1 statistical graphics corp rockville ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation table 1 shows the amount of water received for each treatment significant differences among control irrigation t1 and deficit treatments were found minimum values of swp of each treatment presented statistically significant differences with t2 and t3 samples having the lowest values and t4 similar to the control stress integral showed significant differences among the control t1 rdi t2 t3 and sdi t4 in all deficit treatments the level of water stress was severe however no significant differences were found among treatments in yield t1 2 2 t ha 1 t2 1 9 t ha 1 t3 1 9 t ha 1 t4 1 9 t ha 1 with stress levels achieving a reduction of 10 20 the targeted levels for t3 and t4 trees these levels of stress may influence the yield of the next harvest because the post harvest period is especially sensitive to the deficit garcía tejero et al 2018 3 2 effect of deficit irrigation on the morphological and physico chemical parameters the different deficit irrigation strategies evaluated in the present study did not have a significant effect on most of the almond quality parameters only a color coordinate this finding agreed with other studies on deficit irrigation not only in almonds but also with pistachio and olives in which many quality parameters were not affected by deficit irrigation strategies if applied at moderate levels cano lamadrid et al 2015 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 egea et al 2009 sanchez rodriguez et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 as said above just the a coordinate the green red and the hue angle were significantly different for treatments when analyzing morphology instrumental color and texture table 2 the a color coordinate gives information about whether a sample is redder when positive values are obtained or greener for the negative ones table 2 indicates that almonds from the t2 treatment were more reddish when compared to the other treatments under study especially those from the control treatment t1 hue coordinate was lower in t2 treatment indicating an intensification on the typical brown color of the almond skin martínez esplá et al 2017 for the texture parameters no significant differences were observed among the applied treatments this finding agreed with results on almonds by cornacchia et al 2010 in almond trees growing under rdi and partial root zone drying prd but also in i orange trees in the study by stagno et al 2015 and ii apples under deficit irrigation and sustainable strategies in the study by du et al 2015 on the contrary harder texture was found in studies about pistachio and softest texture in olives under severe water stress conditions cano lamadrid et al 2015 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 both color and texture are important parameters which the best described the raw almond quality contador et al 2015 textural properties specially crunchiness are of utmost importance for the consumer acceptability cheely et al 2018 kernel ratio was not affected by the irrigation treatments neither the dry weight of the samples table 3 this finding agreed with stewart et al 2011 who concluded that both crop consumptive water use and irrigation could be decreased without having a significant effect on the almond yield on the contrary egea et al 2013 showed in their study about long term deficit irrigation in almond trees that water stress had a negative impact on the kernel yield during 2002 and 2005 but no differences were observed during 2006 last year of study with moderate strategies regarding kernel dry weight egea et al 2009 concluded that water stress applied at severe levels had a negative impact not reducing the almond yield with the deficit irrigation under study signify important gains for almond growers which can produce the same amount of almonds reducing the water consumption the average value of moisture content was around 3 9 39 g kg 1 and no statistically significant differences among treatments were observed this finding agreed with cornacchia et al 2010 who observed no differences on moisture content among treatments moisture content is the total quantity of water contained in a product because the almond is a low moisture food the industry standards for the raw almonds range between 3 6 moisture content these values are considered as the optimal ones for minimum biological reactions and essential to preserve the almond quality increasing the shelf life huang 2014 the optimal aw values for almonds stored in cool and dry conditions range from 0 3 to 0 6 gama et al 2018 huang 2014 all 4 treatments under study reached values between these limits but t2 t3 and t4 showed significantly higher aw chemical composition of the almonds is presented in table 4 neither protein nor ash content were statistically significant different among treatments this result was similar to those reported by egea et al 2009 but did not agree with those reported by sanchez bel et al 2008 who observed higher protein content for non irrigated almond farming when compared to the drip irrigated ones almonds from t2 showed significantly higher fat content and the opposite phenomenon was observed for t4 previous studies proved an increase in the lipid content of almonds and pistachio under moderate rdi carbonell barrachina et al 2015 egea et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 stated that almond fat content was constant under moderate di and it did not increase when an excess of irrigation water was applied and started to decrease under severe water stress conditions both nanos et al 2002 and sanchez bel et al 2008 showed a constant fat content when irrigated with non irrigated samples were compared many authors have observed a negative correlation between protein and fat content when studying almonds growing under water stress a higher fat content was associated with a lower protein content however this phenomenon was not observed in the current study egea et al 2009 regarding the carbohydrates the highest mean value was observed for the t4 samples and the opposite for almonds t2 the almond carbohydrates include polysaccharides frequently linked to dietary fiber and a relatively low amount of soluble sugars which are responsible for the sweet taste to the almond total sugar content was not influenced by the treatments studied table 4 and agreed with other studies about the same topic egea et al 2009 nanos et al 2002 statistically significant differences were observed in total organic acids content among treatments with t4 recording the highest values of all treatments table 4 this finding disagreed with the results obtained by other authors who observed no significant differences in organic acids among treatments egea et al 2009 sanchez bel et al 2008 from a commercial and industrial point of view the chemical composition of almonds it is very important and depends on the almond production destiny food industry such as almond oil production or turron typical spanish desert might be interested in almonds with high fat content rabadán et al 2017 verdú et al 2007 from a nutritional perspective many studies suggest that the almond lipid fraction might be the principal factor to influence alteration in insulin sensitivity and satiety mori et al 2011 almond protein content for instance can supply the recommended daily intake of protein for children 23 0 36 0 g and is also a good source for adults 44 56 g of protein recommended daily intake sobowale 2015 the present study suggested that deficit irrigation did not reduce the protein content with a mean value of 247 5 g kg 1 eating 30 g of almonds 20 almonds vairo cultivar would represents 17 of the total protein daily recommended intake for adults 3 3 mineral content both the soil and also the irrigation water have an influence in the mineral content of almonds the main almond minerals include ca cu fe zn k p se and na saura et al 1988 yada et al 2011 the elements studied in the current experiment were ca mg k macro nutrients and fe cu mn and zn micro nutrients the contents of mg fe cu and zn were not statistically significantly affected by irrigation treatments table 5 in fact the main minerals affected were ca and k with t3 treatment leading to the lowest ca content while t2 led to the highest content of k all treatments reached a high content of k which can lead to the conclusion that almonds might be a good source of this element mean values of all treatments 7 2 g kg 1 alimohammadi et al 2012 in their research about the effect of deficit irrigation in different phenological stages of almond fruit growth and development found no significant differences for both leaf and fruit mineral contents similar results were obtained by carbonell barrachina et al 2015 who stated that mineral content of pistachio nuts was only slightly affected by the irrigation treatments they found only two elements cu and zn which increased with water stress other studies in different fruits such as grapes olive tomatoes and apple also concluded that deficit irrigation strategies can be used without a negative impact on mineral nutrition both in leaves and fruit nakajima et al 2004 the only element which showed a decrease in deficit irrigation strategies in leaves of olive and grapes was k but no significant differences were obtained in fruits in the present study k increased for the treatment with moderate rdi t2 and the opposite was shown for fully irrigated almonds t1 as well as in severe rdi and sdi strategies fig 1 showed the applied k content through irrigation a and the amount of k found in soil and fruit b a strongly negative correlation 0 992 was observed between the amount of k administrated through irrigation treatments and the k measured at the topsoil 0 20 cm r2 0 98 p 0 01 a decrease in k content of fruit from fully irrigated treatment t1 as well as for treatments which presented higher levels of stress in plant t3 and t4 could occur due to the close relationship which exists between water availability e g leaching of minerals with excess water and minerals absorption the soluble mineral absorption depends on the water flow in the soil path to the plant roots which means that deficit irrigation applied in right levels could reduce the minerals leaching but also the saturation of minerals and biocides in the root zone alikhani koupaei et al 2018 mineral elements measured in other fruits such as apples tomatoes olives and grapes were not affected by deficit irrigation strategies when compared to the same fruits cultivated in better soil and irrigation conditions alikhani koupaei et al 2018 nakajima et al 2004 3 4 fatty acids almond lipid content is manly composed by monounsaturated mufa and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa as reported by literature the main fatty acids in almonds are oleic c18 1 linoleic c18 2 palmitic c16 0 stearic c18 0 and palmitoleic c16 1 acids in a decreasing order yada et al 2011 in the present study eighteen fatty acids were identified and quantified in all four treatments and they are all presented in table 6 in agreement with prior studies oleic acid was the most abundant fatty acid found within this study followed by linoleic palmitic stearic cis vaccenic and palmitoleic the fatty acid composition predominantly contained mufa and pufa although there were no statistically significant differences among treatments for the oleic acid the important finding is that mild water stress did not reduce the content and in fact a small increment could be observed oleic acid is a mufa with a great interest for human s health because it can reduce the low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol and it is demonstrated that a higher content of oleic acid in almonds can avoid the fatty acids rancidification during storage transport and processing zamany et al 2017 the mean oleic acid content of all treatments was 65 and similar results 62 in nonpareil almonds variety was previously reported zhu et al 2015 to compare the level of oleic acid its contents in extra virgin olive oil peanut landrace oils sunflower seed oil tomato seed oil were 60 48 33 and from 17 to 26 depending on the tomato variety giuffrè and capocasale 2016 giuffrè et al 2017 giuffre et al 2017 2016 besides it was observed that if a thermal stress was applied to extra virgin olive oil the oleic acid increased from 60 to 63 giuffrè et al 2017 the current study revealed statistically significant differences among treatments for six fatty acids and those were myristic c14 0 palmitic c16 0 margaric c17 0 cis heptadecenoic c17 1 cis vaccenic c18 1n7 and arachidic c20 0 acids an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids gives a higher functionality to hydrosos almonds due to many studies in which authors state that products rich in mufa and pufa could contribute to cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases as well as obesity diabetes and cancers bitok and sabaté 2018 cis vaccenic which is an omega 7 fatty acid synthetized from palmitoleic acid by way of stearoyl coa desaturase 1 although the studies are very scarce cis vaccenic acid it was associated with a lower risk of heart failure from ischemic origin with antecedent coronary heart disease djoussé et al 2014 the present study revealed that a significant negative correlation was found between the stress integral and cis vaccenic fatty acid r2 0 70 p 0 0001 and showed that the higher the level of water stress in the plant the lower content of this unsaturated fatty acid fig 2 the mufa content 66 was higher in vayro almonds than in nonpareil ones 64 extra virgin olive oil 49 peanut landrace oils 49 sunflower seed oil 33 and tomatoes seed oil 18 giuffrè and capocasale 2016 giuffrè et al 2017 giuffre et al 2017 2016 zhu et al 2015 in addition pufa was also higher 23 than those of extra virgin olive oil 19 but lower than in nonpareil almonds 26 peanut landrace oils 33 sunflower seed oil 56 and tomato seed oil 49 63 table 6 shows that t2 treatment scored the highest values of those statistically significant different fatty acids even though differences were small fatty acids content increased when rdi was applied at moderate levels while the contrary was observed for the sdi treatment this finding assented with different authors who concluded that using a moderate deficit irrigation in almond pistachio or olives the fatty acid content was increased and the opposite was observed when a severe water stress was applied cano lamadrid et al 2015 2017 carbonell barrachina et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 on the other hand disagreed with sanchez bel et al 2008 and nanos et al 2002 which found that using irrigation lead to a superior almond oil quality than a non irrigation treatment yada et al 2011 affirmed that both quantity and quality of the lipid content is highly dependent on the genotype geographical area climatic conditions of the growing season and water applied irrigation usually was found to have limited effects on the lipid quantity and quality these affirmations are actually stated by this study because no differences among treatments were observed neither for oleic linoleic pufa sfa pufa mufa ratio nor for total sfa saturated fatty acids mufa and pufa a high oleic linoleic ratio is an important benchmark to assess the storage stability of almond kernel and oil due to its preventive effect on lipid oxidation during processing storage and transport as explained above colic et al 2017 pufa sfa ratio is usually calculated because provides information about weather a diet is atherogenic or could promote coronary heart diseases this ratio has been calculated using only hypercholesterolemic acids lauric myristic and palmitic as required by several authors ulbricht and southgate 1991 on the other hand thrombogenic index offer information about formation of clots in the blood vessels and is defined as the ratio between pro thrombogenic represented by sfa and anti thrombogenic mufas pufas n6 and pufas n3 batista et al 2017 in this context analyzing the present study results can be concluded that irrigation treatments did not influence in the atherogenic and thrombogenic index maintaining in this way the health properties of almonds in addition if compared to other products it can be said that almonds have a reduced atherogenic and thrombogenic index batista et al 2017 4 conclusions this study is one of the first simultaneously evaluating quality parameters morphological physico chemical and functional of hydrosos almonds under regulated rdi and sustained sdi deficit irrigation as a general conclusion it can be highlighted that almost all of the measured parameters were not affected by none of the applied deficit irrigations strategies after one year long experiment kernel ratio was not influenced by di treatments however there were some statistically significant differences among treatments and almonds from t2 observing an improvement in relation to different compounds thus almonds from moderated rdi t2 were characterized by a redder color a higher fat and potassium content as well as a greater unsaturated fatty acid cis heptadecenoic cis vaccenic for all this reason moderate rdi t2 could be recommended as a suitable strategy when water availability is below to crop irrigation requirements without committing the final yield and fruit quality acknowledgments the

11081,the performance of prime giant sweet cherry trees under three different irrigation regimes was examined during two consecutive seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the irrigation treatments evaluated were i a control treatment ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etcd to maintain non limiting soil water conditions ii rdm a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a mild water stress during preharvest 90 of etcd and a medium stress during postharvest 65 of etcd and iii rds a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a severe water stress 55 of etcd during postharvest there were significant differences during postharvest in soil and plant water indicators such as soil matric potential midday stem water potential and maximum daily branch shrinkage between ctl and regulated deficit irrigation treatments rd however only midday stem water potential was able to distinguish between rdm and ctl during preharvest fruit quality parameters such as fruit size color soluble solids concentration ssc were periodically measured during fruit developing as well as fruit water potential and osmotic fruit water potential in 2016 there were no differences in any parameter between treatments however in 2017 both deficit treatments led to fruits with a higher ssc and darker color than ctl there were no differences in fruit yield or number of fruits per tree among treatments in either year of the study when fruit quality was assessed in 2016 the color of the pedicels of fruits from the deficit irrigation treatments were greener than those from ctl after 20 days of cold storage at 2 c and 90 relative humidity rh but and after 5 days of shelf life simulation 15 c and 65 rh the differences between treatments disappeared keywords fruit and stem water potential fruit growth pattern osmotic fruit water potential pedicel postharvest fruit quality 1 introduction sweet cherry prunus avium l is a high valuable cash fruit crop widely appreciated by consumers its cultivation requires lower amounts of water than other fruit trees garcía montiel et al 2010 which is important in areas where water is often a limiting factor for production according to ciheam 2010 the mediterranean basin is a highly productive region very susceptible to climate change and the loss of water resources mediterranean agriculture which is the biggest water consuming activity of the whole area needs to face up to this situation and adopt not only suitable technological tools but also water saving strategies to increase crop water use efficiency costa et al 2007 martínez ferri et al 2013 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a water saving strategy based on supplying reduced irrigation doses in specific periods depending on the phenology of the crop which will not negatively affect final yield or fruit quality and should decrease excessive vegetative growth chalmers et al 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 rdi has been studied with positive results in different deciduous tree crops behboudian and mills 1997 and although rdi strategies have also been applied in sweet cherry dehghanisanij et al 2007 marsal et al 2009 2010 nieto et al 2017 there is little information available on the effect of deficit irrigation on sweet cherry water relationships growth and quality not only at harvest but also after a simulated cold storage period and a complementary shelf life sweet cherry is one of the most popular temperate fruits of the genus prunus and quality parameters such as size and color visual appearance and its sugar acid flavor play an important role in its wide acceptance crisosto et al 2003 this study was conducted on sweet cherry prime giant known to be a highly appreciated cultivar by consumers for its size mahogany color high firmness and balanced flavor díaz mula et al 2009 however sweet cherry is reported to be a non climacteric fruit is very perishable so there is a need of adequate postharvest techniques like temperature and relative humidity management habib et al 2015 serrano et al 2005 fruit decay softening off flavors and particularly pedicel browning due to water loss are typical quality disorders suffered by sweet cherries during cold storage and subsequent shelf life which may lead to rejection on the part of consumers bernalte et al 2003 thus an evaluation of such quality attributes during fruit growth at harvest and during retail conditions will provide information to assess whether the irrigation strategy applied could have influenced fruit development yield or quality at any time from farm to fork spain is the fifth sweet cherry producer in the world faostat 2015 and although its production is mainly sold for domestic consumption and for export to nearby european countries they are also sent by sea to more distant countries a journey that may take 20 30 days sweet cherry has been reported to suffer rapid quality deterioration and decay during storage and their subsequent shelf life habib et al 2015 as a result of multiple factors such as harvest time storage conditions cultivar etc there is little on how irrigation management could affect the evolution of prime giant quality therefore the aim of this work was to assess the effects of deficit irrigation on the plant and fruit water relations fruit growth yield and physicochemical characteristics at harvest and after cold storage and during subsequent retail conditions in prime giant sweet cherries for this the physiology and quality of prime giant sweet cherries grown under two different regulated deficit irrigation strategies and one well watered control were compared in order to improve water productivity and recommend the best irrigation strategy in areas where water is a limited resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site plant material and treatments the study was conducted in a 0 5 ha commercial orchard located in jumilla murcia spain 38 8 n 1 22 w during two

distributed in autumn and spring hot dry summers and mild winters average annual reference evapotranspiration was about 1250 mm and average rainfall varied from 250 to 360 mm the plant material consisted of fifteen year old sweet cherry trees prunus avium l prime giant grafted on sl64 rootstock and early lory and brooks as pollinizers and spaced at 5 m 3 m at the beginning of the experiment the vase shaped trees had an average trunk diameter of 16 3 0 2 cm a canopy volume of 10 5 0 4 m3 and ground cover of around 55 trees were drip irrigated using a single drip line for each tree row with three pressure compensated emitters per tree each with a discharge rate of 4 l h 1 full bloom was in late march early april day of year doy 99 and 80 in 2016 and 2017 respectively and fruit was harvested 70 and 73 days after full bloom dafb on june 17th in 2016 and on june 2nd in 2017 the different irrigation treatments were initiated each season before flowering and suspended at the end of november horticultural practices e g fertilization weed control and pruning were the same for the trees of all treatments and were carried out by the technical department of the commercial orchard fertilization was applied through the irrigation system with the water and was the same in all treatments despite the amount of the water applied the fertilization program consisted of 63 30 107 and 8 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and cao respectively three irrigation treatments were applied a control ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etcd to maintain non limiting soil water conditions and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments rd i rdm irrigated at 90 of etcd during preharvest mild water stress critical period 100 of etcd during flower differentiation 15 20 days after harvest

during preharvest and flower differentiation and 55 of etcd during postharvest crop water requirements under drip irrigation etcd were calculated using the following equation etcd et0 x kc x kr where et0 is reference evapotranspiration kc is a crop specific coefficient for sweet cherry reported by marsal 2012 and kr is a localization factor fereres et al 1982 related to the percentage of ground covered by the crop the average annual amount of irrigation water applied was 694 447 and 414 mm for ctl rdm and rds respectively table 1 treatments were distributed according to a completely randomized block design with four replicates each replicate consisted of seven trees the central five trees were used for experimental measurements with the other served as guard trees sensors were installed in the two central trees or within their area of influence 2 2 water status measurements the plant water status was measured every seven ten days by measuring midday stem water potential

installations from where they could be downloaded anytime daily agrometeorological data were recorded by a weather station near the experimental orchard owned by the spanish agroclimatic information service siar http crea uclm es siar datmeteo 2 3 fruit growth characterization in order to evaluate the irrigation effects on fruit growth and quality ten representative sweet cherries were periodically picked per replicate forty per treatment every seven ten days during preharvest fruit development non destructive measurements such as size and color were made on all fruits forty fruits per treatment destructive measurements were made on half of the fruits twenty fruits per treatment were used in the determinations of fruit unitary dry weight and the other twenty fruits per treatment were used in the chemical analysis fruit size equatorial and polar diameters mm were measured with a digital caliper model 17 262 acha eibar spain and from the data obtained fruit volume cm3 was calculated equating prime giant cherry shape as an ellipsoid oblate fruit and pedicel color was recorded on fruits and pedicels using a colorimeter cr 400 minolta tokyo japan and illuminant d65 lightness and hue angle hueº were obtained from the l a and b values of the cie lab scale system used fresh unitary weight g was weighed on an electronic balance model ax623 sartorius gottingen germany similarly to the fresh unitary weight dry weight g was measured from the same fruits which were dried at 60 c until constant weight in a ventilated oven model digitheat jp selecta barcelona spain growth rate gr g d 1 was calculated according to grossman and dejong 1995 in the chemical analysis fruit was squeezed as previously described conesa et al 2015 to determine from the juice of the

diameter cylindrical stainless probe which travelled until the skin broke at a test speed of 10 mm s 1 pulp firmness was similarly measured in the same cherries in a region of the fruit from which the skin had previously been removed the juice of ten cherries per replicate was extracted by a hand press squeezer and from this sample ssc titratable acidity ta g malic acid 100 m l 1 and maturity index mi calculated as the rate between ssc and ta were assessed ta was measured with a titration model 716 dms titrino metrohm herisau switzerland and calculated from the volume of naoh 0 1 m needed to reach a ph of 8 1 from a diluted juice sample of 5 ml of cherry juice and 45 ml of distilled water 2 5 fruit quality after cold storage and shelf life for the postharvest trial in 2016 200 g of sweet cherries with similar ripening stage size and color per replicate and three replicates per treatment were selected from the first picking june 17th the cherries were stored in a rectangular plastic bowl of 0 75 l volume samples were maintained at 2 c and 90 relative humidity rh for 20 days and a subsequent retail period of 5 days at 15 c and 65 rh shelf life conditions fruit quality was evaluated at harvest day 0 after cold storage day 20 and after shelf life simulation day 20 5 at these times equatorial and longitudinal diameters fruit volume fruit and pulp firmness fruit and pedicel color ssc ta and mi were measured in twenty cherries per replicate and three replicates 3 results 3 1 water applied the climatic conditions over the study period were characteristic of mediterranean semi arid areas reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was similar in 2015 2016 and 2017 annually this amounted to 1250 mm of which 1087 mm corresponded to the irrigation season april november however seasonal precipitation varied from 206 mm in 2015 2016 to 348 mm in 2016 2017 the mean water amounts applied in the seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were 694 ctl 447 rdm and 414 mm rds table 1 during preharvest rdm provided the least water approximately 20 less than ctl while during postharvest rds provided the least 59 less than ctl while the water saved in rdm was 48 table 1 3 2 water stress indicators and water relations the soil matric potential mean values were reflected the irrigation regimes table 2 the ctl treatment gave mean values above 30 kpa for all periods during both seasons both deficit treatments led to statistical differences with ctl during the 2015 and 2016 postharvest rds and rdm reached postharvest mean values below 200 and 300 kpa respectively the rdm treatment showed the lowest values preharvest especially during the 2017 preharvest however due to its high variability ψm was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between treatments during preharvest plant water stress indicators showed values reflected those of ψm tree s mds resulted in significant differences between ctl and both rd treatments during postharvest but as in the case of ψm the preharvest stress in rdm was not reflected in the results table 2 mds increased by 11 and 23 in rdm with respect to ctl in 2016 and 2017 preharvests respectively midday stem water potential reflected differences among treatments as shown in fig 1 during postharvest there were significant differences between ctl and rds at every measuring point while in the measurements corresponding to late july and august ψstem reflected the differences between rdm and rds the minimum ψstem values were reached both seasons by trees of the rds treatment during postharvest when they were close to 1 5 mpa during preharvest ψstem was sensitive enough to identify the mild deficit imposed by rdm and significant differences between rdm and ctl appeared moreover in 2017 preharvest ψstem was able to distinguish among all treatments rdm led to ψstem values that were 0 06 and 0 12 mpa lower than in ctl prior to harvest in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 ψstem was the only water stress indicator that showed significant differences during preharvest fruit water potential did not show significant differences among treatments fig 1 and was strongly related to ψstem fig 2 a ψfruit showed a similar trend to negative values during both preharvest periods however in 2016 the mean values in all treatments were 30 lower than in 2017 fig 1 as was to be expected ψfruit was seen to be highly dependent on ψᴫfruit fig 2b which in turn was closely related with the fruit soluble solids content fig 2c on the other hand ψρfruit showed a lower linear relationship with ψfruit and explained 53 6 of the changes in ψfruit furthermore a linear relationship between ψρfruit and fruit growth rate gr was obtained r2 0 56 fig 2d 3 3 fruit development dynamic fruit development and ripening had finished by 70 and 73 dafb in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 3 shows the increases in fruit size during the fruit development period the fruit physical parameters volume and fresh unitary weight were characterized by a sigmoidal growth pattern which could be divided into three distinct parts the first part showed an exponential increase up to 18 and 20 dafb 117 doy in 2016 and 100 doy in 2017 which could be attributed to stage i and ii of fruit development the second part of similar length had a linear trend early mid stage iii of fruit development fruit growth slowed down in the third part late stage iii until the final fruit size was reached commercial harvest there was no clear evidence of the exponential part in the fruit dry weight and in the equatorial diameter growth pattern compared with fruit volume or ssc fruit were larger in 2017 than in 2016 a year in which no treatment produced fruit weighing more than 9 g and measuring more than 8 4 cm3 while in 2017 all treatments produced fruit of 11 g and 10 7 cm3 in neither year there were differences among treatments as regards fruit size yield and number of fruit per tree whereas all these measurements differed between years equatorial diameter was the fruit size parameter measured in which the different fruit growth stages were hardest to identify the fruit fresh weight exhibited a similar trend to that of the fruit volume each year in 2016 fresh and dry unitary weight showed rapid increase from 30 days before harvest less pronounced during the last 10 days in 2017 the fruit and dry unitary weight did not show a slower increase in the previous days to harvest fig 3c and d ssc evolution showed a similar pattern to fruit volume and fresh weight fig 3e and f the greatest ssc increase was seen in all treatments when fruit volume had already reached half of the final size 148 and 132 doy in 2016 and 2017 respectively both years ssc reached values above 17 in 2016 ssc values at harvest did not result in significant differences among treatments however in 2017 ssc of fruits from rdm was statistically higher than that from ctl fruits during the last part of the ripening process fruit color changed throughout the ripening stage the hueº showed an inverse sigmoid pattern with a sharp drop when fruit changed from a green straw colour to red mahogany this change started approximately 45 dafb and although the ripening process continued until harvest to reach a full red color fruit 15 days were necessary both years fig 3g and h in 2016 neither hueº nor l was significantly different among treatments however in 2017 although there were no significant differences in l among treatments rdm and rds produced darker cherries compared with ctl fruit lower values of hueº once fruit started to change color rdm led to redder colors than ctl and rds but at harvest trees from both deficit irrigation treatments bore darker cherries than ctl 3 4 fruit quality and yield at harvest the quality parameters analyzed did not show differences among treatments in 2016 however in 2017 rdm fruit were sweeter and darker compared to the fruit from ctl when the quality parameters of both years were compared all of them showed significant differences the fruit from 2016 was more prone to crack 30 smaller 40 firmer less dark red less sweet and less acid than the fruit from the same irrigation treatments in 2017 table 3 these results are consistent with the yield measured each year 2016 was a high cropping year and trees produced 43 more kg per tree 42 vs 29 kg fruit tree 1 and a 91 more fruits per tree 5027 vs 2634 than 2017 fig 4 consequently fruits from 2016 were significantly smaller furthermore when the interaction of both irrigation treatment and year conditions was considered parameters such as fruit color and ssc showed a significant interaction table 3 3 5 cold storage and shelf life extension performance during cold storage the physical parameters related with fruit size equatorial and polar diameters and volume remained stable throughout the experiment table 4 fruit and pulp firmness increased significantly with time in cold storage for all treatments and sharply declined during the shelf life simulation although there were no statistical differences among treatments ctl produced firmer fruit than the deficit treatments especially pulp firmness fig 5 at the 2016 harvest sweet cherry showed hueº values close to 24 for all treatments which is associated with bright red colors however during cold storage and during shelf life simulation a reduction in this parameter was observed particularly in the fruits from ctl similarly pedicel color also decreased as time passed at harvest all pedicels had a bright green color up to 110 hueº regardless of the irrigation treatment applied however after cold storage the pedicels from ctl fruit were significantly more greenish to straw colored than those from rds and rdm which remained bright green during shelf life simulation the pedicels from ctl turned a light brownish color while the others maintained greener colors especially rdm but due to high variability within each treatment no significant differences were observed fig 5 regarding ssc and ta there were no significant differences among treatments however both parameters tended to slightly lower mean values than those measured at harvest fig 5 ssc and ta values after the experiment decreased 5 and 9 respectively compared to the values measured at harvest as a result of the greater decrease of ta than ssc the mi increased rdm led to higher values of mi with no significant differences among treatments 4 discussion the results showed that ψm as well as plant water stress indicators such as mds and ψstem in ctl showed the typical water status of well watered trees throughout the experiment the differences among treatments in all the water indicators during postharvest reflected the irrigation changes in the deficit treatments table 2 since the plant response to soil water deficit depended on the time duration and intensity of water stress it is supposed that the soil water deficit reached was enough to induce plant water stress particularly under drip irrigation conditions furthermore sweet cherry has been described as a highly sensitive crop to soil water deficits and water evaporative demand molina et al 2016 during preharvest mds in rdm trees was higher than in ctl in 2016 and 2017 although as the variability among trees was high these increases in branch fluctuations were not sufficient to lead to statistical differences table 2 however when the water reductions applied in postharvest were high irrigation amount equivalent to 65 and 55 of etc in rdm and rds respectively the mds of the trees sharply increased and significant differences appeared making mds a reliable indicator of tree water status abdelfatah et al 2013 which could be of interest for irrigation scheduling in sweet cherry trees although all indicators were able to identify a water deficit situation only ψstem in trees from rdm identified mild water stress and provided significant differences during preharvest fig 1 thus our results confirm ψstem as a reference indicator in deficit irrigation management in sweet cherry as previously reported by blanco et al 2018 marsal et al 2009 and oyarzun et al 2010 ψfruit showed a high linear relationship with ψstem fig 2a although slightly lower than that reported in peach by gelly et al 2004 ψfruit showed a similar trend to negative values as ψstem fig 1 however ψfruit tended to decrease more sharply as the fruit developed regardless of irrigation treatment similar results have been described in different crops such as apple mills et al 1997 jujube galindo et al 2016 olive fernandes et al 2018 pomegranate galindo et al 2017 and others a substantial decrease in ψfruit was observed 27 and 31 days before fruit harvest in 2016 and 2017 that 0 46 and 0 44 mpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 this decrease coincided with the early stage iii of fruit development the phase with the highest growth ssc increase and fruit color change fig 3 the high linear relationship between ψstem and ψfruit especially during stage iii of sweet cherry development is consistent with the remarks of bertin and génard 2018 who reported that cell enlargement is a result of water flows following a stem to fruit gradient of water potential the recorded decreases in ψfruit coincided with the decrease in ψᴫfruit and the increases in fruit size and ssc this increase in ssc was strongly related to ψᴫfruit decreases fig 2c this linear relationship obtained between ssc and ψᴫfruit being similar to the one reported by yakushiji et al 1996 in satsuma mandarin these observations were also consistent with the ψᴫfruit and ψfruit evolution described by schumann et al 2014 in sweet cherry regina therefore a high linear relationship between ψᴫfruit and ψfruit was obtained fig 2b the rapid and high decreases in ψᴫfruit were balanced by corresponding increases in ψρfruit ψρfruit values were always maintained above zero in all treatments throughout the experiment fig 2d the maintenance of ψρfruit values above zero is fundamental during fruit growth and it is known that fruit growth as cell growth requires cell turgor matthews and shackel 2005 thus a linear relationship between sweet cherry growth rate and ψρfruit was found moreover in apple archbold 1992 stated that carbohydrates partition between the starch and fruit soluble sugars maintained fruit turgor so fruit growth rate from an osmoregulatory point of view also depends on ψᴫfruit from this relationship it was hypothesized that although ψρfruit remained positive throughout fruit development factors other than turgor would also have determined the fruit growth rate fruit absolute growth increased continuously throughout fruit development fig 3a and b as did ψρfruit on the other hand ψfruit and ψᴫfruit rapidly decreased as ssc rose matthews and shackel 2005 described that fruit growth is highly dependent on changes in the structure of the cell wall and the variations in cell turgor and ψᴫfruit according to andrews and li 1995 the changes in the cell walls weakening during sweet cherry ripening and the accumulation of biochemical substance in the fruit lower ψᴫfruit and play a major role in promoting fruit growth thus sweet cherry growth was conditioned by an increase in ψρfruit values caused by solute accumulation and the cell wall weakening which diminished ψᴫfruit thus source and sink ψᴫfruit gradients increase ψρfruit values due to water entering through the fruit phloem which has a significant effect on fruit growth and ψfruit bertin and génard 2018 consequently when the relationship between ψfruit and its two components were compared ψfruit was seen to be much more influenced by ψᴫfruit than by ψρfruit as ψfruit and ψᴫfruit declined so fruit size weight and ssc increased as prime giant is an early cultivar growth dynamics did not display the typical double sigmoid pattern of the stone fruits described by coombe 1976 in which three developmental stages are clearly identified however different fruit growth rates could be distinguished fig 3a and b our results were consistent with those of grossman and dejong 1995 and papenfuss and black 2010 who stated that in early cultivars of peach and tart cherry stage ii of fruit development pit hardening overlaps stages i and iii cell division and cell enlargement respectively the greatest increase in fresh fruit unitary weight the initial rise in dry fruit unitary weight fig 3c and d and increase in ssc fig 3g and h coincided with the beginning of stage iii approximately 20 days before harvest when the rapid decrease of ψᴫfruit occurred knoche et al 2001 during these days the growth rate of both years reached their respective maxima fig 3c and d which coincided with the highest increases of ψρfruit furthermore during these days fruit started their color change from green to straw fig 3g and h in 2017 rdm led to significant darker mahogany colors than ctl darker colors are associated by the consumer with sweeter fruit so darker fruit are more appreciated crisosto et al 2003 in this study these results were corroborated thus the darker fruit from rdm were also significantly sweeter than those from ctl at harvest fruit quality was evaluated every year in 2016 the different irrigation strategies did not prompt significant differences in the quality parameters measured however in 2017 differences among treatments appeared rdm produced significantly darker and sweeter fruit table 3 deficit irrigation has been used to improve fruit color in several fruit crops such as peach sotiropoulos et al 2010 falagán et al 2015b nectarine falagán et al 2015a pomegranate peña et al 2013 table grapes conesa et al 2015 2016 it being hypothesized that deficit irrigation improves fruit coloration by increasing accumulation of the bioactive compounds involved in the fruit ripening process and diminishes vegetative growth thus allowing fruit to be more exposed to sunlight the results for other parameters such as cracking incidence equatorial and polar diameters volume firmness pedicel color ta and fruit dry unitary weight were not statistically influenced by the irrigation management which is consistent with the data reported in summit sweet cherries under rdi strategies by marsal et al 2010 the quality parameters studied were significantly different each year table 3 in general fruit harvested in 2016 were smaller in all treatments than the values expected for this cultivar while the mean values obtained in 2017 were similar in color size and ssc and slightly higher for fruit firmness and ta than those reported in the same cultivar by serrano et al 2009 these differences between years could be explained by the differences in yield and number of fruits produced each year the yield and the number of fruits per tree were 43 and 91 higher in 2016 than in 2017 without differences among treatments within the same year fig 4 ayala and lang 2004 and neilsen et al 2007 stated that in sweet cherry in high cropping years such as 2016 quality parameters and especially fruit size are influenced by a low leaf area fruit ratio and consequently mean fruit unitary weight is lower than in those years with normal yield and higher leaf area fruit ratio olmstead et al 2007 reported that sweet cherry size was more influenced by cell length than by number of cells so consequently environmental conditions and sink limitations affected more final cherry size during stage iii of fruit development cell enlargement than during stage i cell division smaller fruit in 2016 induced higher firmness brighter red color and lower concentration of ta when the physicochemical parameters of sweet cherries at harvest for both years were compared the interaction treatment year was only significant for hueº and ssc confirming that these are the parameters more sensitive to irrigation management irrigation treatments did not affect cracking incidence nor did it penalize fruit yield and number of fruits per tree table 3 fig 4a and b however although rdm did not show significant differences in fruit unitary weight compared to ctl ctl had larger fruits both years in 2017 fruit unitary weight was almost 1 g higher in the fruits produced by ctl than those of rdm fig 3c and d lower mean unitary weights in deficit treatments although without significant differences have been reported by goldhamer et al 1999 in peach it is well known that the crop profitability of sweet cherry is highly dependent on commercial size categories nieto et al 2017 so the decreases obtained by rdm treatment could have a negative impact on economic returns other studies on regulated deficit irrigation related the stress integral myers 1988 with the number of fruits per tree however the present study showed low correlation between stress integral and number of fruits per tree when both years are considered due to the similar amount of water applied to each specific treatment each year table 1 and the different yield obtained fig 4a thus the low correlation between those stress integral and number of fruits per tree when both years are considered could be due to other factors and or a combined effect of the same such as the preharvest mild water stress on rdm trees as soil water deficits have been related to smaller fruit in sweet cherry neilsen et al 2014 a postharvest deficit that could provoke effects on the fruit quality of the following season temperature and evaporative demand during bloom fruit set and cherry run off different crop loads vegetative growth sink source relations ayala and lang 2015 fruit quality from the first pick of 2016 was evaluated at harvest after cold storage 20 days at 2 c and a subsequent shelf life simulation period 5 days at 15 c to assess the effect of deficit irrigation on the storage performance of sweet cherry size parameters seemed to remain stable during storage in all treatments table 4 fruit and pulp firmness after cold storage increased as an effect of low temperatures during storage similar to the results obtained in bing cherries after 6 weeks at 1 67 c by patterson and kupferman 1983 however fruit and pulp firmness dropped during commercial life conditions table 4 and fig 5a and b fruit color remained almost constant throughout the cold storage but it turned into darker colors during shelf life fig 5c the greatest changes were to pedicel color the only factor that was influenced by deficit irrigation rdm led to a greener color at the end of the cold storage than ctl ctl pedicels showed significantly more discoloration browning after 20 days at 2 c however at the end of the experiment after 5 days at shelf life conditions 15 c the color of the pedicels from all treatments was degraded pedicel shriveling in sweet cherry is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity knoche et al 2015 and although the pedicels from the fruit of the rdm treatment were greener than those from ctl differences among treatments were not detectable at the end of the experiment fig 5d sweet cherry pedicel has been described as one of the best indicators of its freshness and greener pedicels are related to higher consumer acceptance knoche et al 2015 the greener colour of the pedicel from the deficit treatments was related with lower dehydration as lower dehydration losses in fruits from trees under regulated deficit irrigation have been explained as a result of the thicker cuticle in these fruits which reduces water losses gómez del campo et al 2014 pérez pastor et al 2007 romero trigueros et al 2017 ssc and ta did not show differences among irrigation treatments or times at harvest after cold storage or after shelf life table 4 with mean values above 18 and 1 1 g 100 ml 1 in all measurements according to the results obtained deficit irrigation treatments did not penalize any of the physicochemical quality parameters studied nevertheless as could be expected parameters such as fruit and pulp firmness and skin and pedicel color presented significant differences between the values obtained at harvest and after cold storage and shelf life table 4 this is indicative of the loss in sweet cherry fruit quality as storage progresses although no interaction with the irrigation treatment was observed sweet cherry has been described as a highly perishable fruit which deteriorates rapidly after harvest however in our experiment the mean values of the quality parameters obtained after 20 days at 2 c and 5 days at 15 c such as mahogany fruit color 23 hueº green pedicels 92 hueº good firmness 8 n ssc values above 15 and ta between 0 4 and 1 5 g 100 ml 1 can be considered acceptable in the fruit from all the irrigation treatments habib et al 2015 prime giant sweet cherry then can be safely marketed after cold storage as the fruit will still be found acceptable by consumers 5 conclusion the application of rdm and rds produced water savings of 36 and 40 of the water applied in the ctl treatment without significantly penalizing fruit yield or quality ψstem was the water deficit indicator that best identified and quantified the plant water status in sweet cherry the biggest changes in ψfruit took place in the period from the onset of rapid cherry growth first part of stage iii which was accompanied by a rapid increase in the fruit turgor potential and a decrease in fruit osmotic potential these results indicate the need to maintain a positive pressure potential inside the cell and a continuous supply of biochemical substances for the proper growth of the fruit regulated deficit irrigation treatments did not produce differences in the quality parameters measured at the 2016 harvest compared with ctl however after 20 days of cold storage rd led to greener pedicels than ctl this difference among treatments could be a key factor in leading consumers to prefer rd sweet cherries over those from ctl due to their visual appearance after storage in the 2017 harvest rd particularly rdm led to darker and sweeter fruit than ctl when both deficit treatments were compared rdm did not improve rds fruit quality furthermore fruits from rds did not show any size reduction compared to ctl either year of study based on these results rds can be recommended over the other irrigation strategies to improve water use in semiarid areas

11081,the performance of prime giant sweet cherry trees under three different irrigation regimes was examined during two consecutive seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the irrigation treatments evaluated were i a control treatment ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etcd to maintain non limiting soil water conditions ii rdm a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a mild water stress during preharvest 90 of etcd and a medium stress during postharvest 65 of etcd and iii rds a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a severe water stress 55 of etcd during postharvest there were significant differences during postharvest in soil and plant water indicators such as soil matric potential midday stem water potential and maximum daily branch shrinkage between ctl and regulated deficit irrigation treatments rd however only midday stem water potential was able to distinguish between rdm and ctl during preharvest fruit quality parameters such as fruit size color soluble solids concentration ssc were periodically measured during fruit developing as well as fruit water potential and osmotic fruit water potential in 2016 there were no differences in any parameter between treatments however in 2017 both deficit treatments led to fruits with a higher ssc and darker color than ctl there were no differences in fruit yield or number of fruits per tree among treatments in either year of the study when fruit quality was assessed in 2016 the color of the pedicels of fruits from the deficit irrigation treatments were greener than those from ctl after 20 days of cold storage at 2 c and 90 relative humidity rh but and after 5 days of shelf life simulation 15 c and 65 rh the differences between treatments disappeared keywords fruit and stem water potential fruit growth pattern osmotic fruit water potential pedicel postharvest fruit quality 1 introduction sweet cherry prunus avium l is a high valuable cash fruit crop widely appreciated by consumers its cultivation requires lower amounts of water than other fruit trees garcía montiel et al 2010 which is important in areas where water is often a limiting factor for production according to ciheam 2010 the mediterranean basin is a highly productive region very susceptible to climate change and the loss of water resources mediterranean agriculture which is the biggest water consuming activity of the whole area needs to face up to this situation and adopt not only suitable technological tools but also water saving strategies to increase crop water use efficiency costa et al 2007 martínez ferri et al 2013 regulated deficit irrigation rdi is a water saving strategy based on supplying reduced irrigation doses in specific periods depending on the phenology of the crop which will not negatively affect final yield or fruit quality and should decrease excessive vegetative growth chalmers et al 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 rdi has been studied with positive results in different deciduous tree crops behboudian and mills 1997 and although rdi strategies have also been applied in sweet cherry dehghanisanij et al 2007 marsal et al 2009 2010 nieto et al 2017 there is little information available on the effect of deficit irrigation on sweet cherry water relationships growth and quality not only at harvest but also after a simulated cold storage period and a complementary shelf life sweet cherry is one of the most popular temperate fruits of the genus prunus and quality parameters such as size and color visual appearance and its sugar acid flavor play an important role in its wide acceptance crisosto et al 2003 this study was conducted on sweet cherry prime giant known to be a highly appreciated cultivar by consumers for its size mahogany color high firmness and balanced flavor díaz mula et al 2009 however sweet cherry is reported to be a non climacteric fruit is very perishable so there is a need of adequate postharvest techniques like temperature and relative humidity management habib et al 2015 serrano et al 2005 fruit decay softening off flavors and particularly pedicel browning due to water loss are typical quality disorders suffered by sweet cherries during cold storage and subsequent shelf life which may lead to rejection on the part of consumers bernalte et al 2003 thus an evaluation of such quality attributes during fruit growth at harvest and during retail conditions will provide information to assess whether the irrigation strategy applied could have influenced fruit development yield or quality at any time from farm to fork spain is the fifth sweet cherry producer in the world faostat 2015 and although its production is mainly sold for domestic consumption and for export to nearby european countries they are also sent by sea to more distant countries a journey that may take 20 30 days sweet cherry has been reported to suffer rapid quality deterioration and decay during storage and their subsequent shelf life habib et al 2015 as a result of multiple factors such as harvest time storage conditions cultivar etc there is little on how irrigation management could affect the evolution of prime giant quality therefore the aim of this work was to assess the effects of deficit irrigation on the plant and fruit water relations fruit growth yield and physicochemical characteristics at harvest and after cold storage and during subsequent retail conditions in prime giant sweet cherries for this the physiology and quality of prime giant sweet cherries grown under two different regulated deficit irrigation strategies and one well watered control were compared in order to improve water productivity and recommend the best irrigation strategy in areas where water is a limited resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site plant material and treatments the study was conducted in a 0 5 ha commercial orchard located in jumilla murcia spain 38 8 n 1 22 w during two consecutive growing seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the soil has a sandy loam texture is moderately stony with a normal active limestone 2 7 low potassium 0 32 meq 100 g 1 and high available phosphorus 108 67 mg kg 1 content the irrigation water drawn from a well was of low salinity electrical conductivity ec25 ºc 0 8 ds m 1 the climate is typically mediterranean with low rainfall distributed in autumn and spring hot dry summers and mild winters average annual reference evapotranspiration was about 1250 mm and average rainfall varied from 250 to 360 mm the plant material consisted of fifteen year old sweet cherry trees prunus avium l prime giant grafted on sl64 rootstock and early lory and brooks as pollinizers and spaced at 5 m 3 m at the beginning of the experiment the vase shaped trees had an average trunk diameter of 16 3 0 2 cm a canopy volume of 10 5 0 4 m3 and ground cover of around 55 trees were drip irrigated using a single drip line for each tree row with three pressure compensated emitters per tree each with a discharge rate of 4 l h 1 full bloom was in late march early april day of year doy 99 and 80 in 2016 and 2017 respectively and fruit was harvested 70 and 73 days after full bloom dafb on june 17th in 2016 and on june 2nd in 2017 the different irrigation treatments were initiated each season before flowering and suspended at the end of november horticultural practices e g fertilization weed control and pruning were the same for the trees of all treatments and were carried out by the technical department of the commercial orchard fertilization was applied through the irrigation system with the water and was the same in all treatments despite the amount of the water applied the fertilization program consisted of 63 30 107 and 8 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 k2o and cao respectively three irrigation treatments were applied a control ctl irrigated at 110 of crop evapotranspiration etcd to maintain non limiting soil water conditions and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments rd i rdm irrigated at 90 of etcd during preharvest mild water stress critical period 100 of etcd during flower differentiation 15 20 days after harvest critical period and 65 of etcd during postharvest non critical period ii rds a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a severe water stress during postharvest irrigated at 100 of etcd during preharvest and flower differentiation and 55 of etcd during postharvest crop water requirements under drip irrigation etcd were calculated using the following equation etcd et0 x kc x kr where et0 is reference evapotranspiration kc is a crop specific coefficient for sweet cherry reported by marsal 2012 and kr is a localization factor fereres et al 1982 related to the percentage of ground covered by the crop the average annual amount of irrigation water applied was 694 447 and 414 mm for ctl rdm and rds respectively table 1 treatments were distributed according to a completely randomized block design with four replicates each replicate consisted of seven trees the central five trees were used for experimental measurements with the other served as guard trees sensors were installed in the two central trees or within their area of influence 2 2 water status measurements the plant water status was measured every seven ten days by measuring midday stem water potential ψstem at noon under field conditions according to the methodology proposed by mccutchan and shackel 1992 with a scholander pressure chamber model 3000 soil moisture equipment ca usa in six sunny healthy and mature leaves located close to the trunk per irrigation treatment two leaves per replicate in three replicates on the same days fruit water potential ψfruit was measured in six fruits per treatment fruit osmotic potential ψᴫfruit was measured in the same picked fruit as used to measure ψfruit after measuring ψfruit in the field these fruits were covered with aluminum foil labeled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c subsequently in the laboratory ψᴫfruit was measured using a vapour pressure osmometer wescor 5600 logan ut usa estimated fruit turgor potential ψρfruit was obtained as the difference between osmotic and fruit water potential according to milad and shackel 1992 branch diameter variations were recorded by two dendrometers lvdt sensors model df

coverage improvement and one coordinator device that manages the network and records all the data all the devices were connected using a star topological configuration data communication was performed using a point to point radio link provided by a local internet supplier the data registered in the datalogger and zigbee coordinator were stored in a cloud server placed in the university installations from where they could be downloaded anytime daily agrometeorological data were recorded by a weather station near the experimental orchard owned by the spanish agroclimatic information service siar http crea uclm es siar datmeteo 2 3 fruit growth characterization in order to evaluate the irrigation effects on fruit growth and quality ten representative sweet cherries were periodically picked per replicate forty per treatment every seven ten days during preharvest fruit development non destructive measurements such as size and color were made on all fruits forty fruits per treatment destructive measurements were made on half of the fruits twenty fruits per treatment were used in the determinations of fruit unitary dry weight and the other twenty fruits per treatment were used in the chemical analysis fruit size equatorial and polar diameters mm were measured with a digital caliper model 17 262 acha eibar spain and from the data obtained fruit volume cm3 was calculated equating prime giant cherry shape as an ellipsoid oblate fruit and pedicel color was recorded on fruits and pedicels using a colorimeter cr 400 minolta tokyo japan and illuminant d65 lightness and hue angle hueº were obtained from the l a and b values of the cie lab scale system used fresh unitary weight g was weighed on an electronic balance model ax623 sartorius gottingen germany similarly to the fresh unitary weight dry weight g was measured from the same fruits which were dried at 60 c until constant weight in a ventilated oven model digitheat jp selecta barcelona spain growth rate gr g d 1 was calculated according to grossman and dejong 1995 in the chemical analysis fruit was squeezed as previously described conesa et al 2015 to determine from the juice of the fruit the soluble solids concentration ssc with a digital hand held refractometer n1 atago tokyo japan at 20 c 2 4 fruit quality analysis at harvest at both 2016 and 2017 harvests all the fruit produced per tree were harvested from the 5 central trees of each replicate and weighed in order to obtain fruit yield to estimate fruit load the number of fruits in 5 kg lots was counted in 3 trees per replicate 12 trees per treatment to determinate fruit unitary weight the number of cracked cherries in the sample was recorded to estimate cracking incidence per treatment fruit load number of fruits per tree was calculated from yield kg tree 1 and fruit unitary weight g measured in the field from the harvested fruit twenty fruits from four replicates eighty fruits per treatment were collected to evaluate their quality the same quality determinations periodically measured in the fruit during fruit development such as size color and ssc determination were repeated at harvest in the twenty fruits selected apart from the above measurements fruit and pulp firmness and titratable acidity were also evaluated fruit and pulp firmness n were measured using a texture analyzer ct3 texture analyzer ametek brookfield engineering laboratories ma usa in twenty fruits per replicate fruit firmness was the peak force measured during a puncture test in the equatorial region made by a 2 mm diameter cylindrical stainless probe which travelled until the skin broke at a test speed of 10 mm s 1 pulp firmness was similarly measured in the same cherries in a region of the fruit from which the skin had previously been removed the juice of ten cherries per replicate was extracted by a hand press squeezer and from this sample ssc titratable acidity ta g malic acid 100 m l 1 and maturity index mi calculated as the rate between ssc and ta were assessed ta was measured with a titration model 716 dms titrino metrohm herisau switzerland and calculated from the volume of naoh 0 1 m needed to reach a ph of 8 1 from a diluted juice sample of 5 ml of cherry juice and 45 ml of distilled water 2 5 fruit quality after cold storage and shelf life for the postharvest trial in 2016 200 g of sweet cherries with similar ripening stage size and color per replicate and three replicates per treatment were selected from the first picking june 17th the cherries were stored in a rectangular plastic bowl of 0 75 l volume samples were maintained at 2 c and 90 relative humidity rh for 20 days and a subsequent retail period of 5 days at 15 c and 65 rh shelf life conditions fruit quality was evaluated at harvest day 0 after cold storage day 20 and after shelf life simulation day 20 5 at these times equatorial and longitudinal diameters fruit volume fruit and pulp firmness fruit and pedicel color ssc ta and mi were measured in twenty cherries per replicate and three replicates 3 results 3 1 water applied the climatic conditions over the study period were characteristic of mediterranean semi arid areas reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was similar in 2015 2016 and 2017 annually this amounted to 1250 mm of which 1087 mm corresponded to the irrigation season april november however seasonal precipitation varied from 206 mm in 2015 2016 to 348 mm in 2016 2017 the mean water amounts applied in the seasons 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 were 694 ctl 447 rdm and 414 mm rds table 1 during preharvest rdm provided the least water approximately 20 less than ctl while during postharvest rds provided the least 59 less than ctl while the water saved in rdm was 48 table 1 3 2 water stress indicators and water relations the soil matric potential mean values were reflected the irrigation regimes table 2 the ctl treatment gave mean values above 30 kpa for all periods during both seasons both deficit treatments led to statistical differences with ctl during the 2015 and 2016 postharvest rds and rdm reached postharvest mean values below 200 and 300 kpa respectively the rdm treatment showed the lowest values preharvest especially during the 2017 preharvest however due to its high variability ψm was not sensitive enough to detect significant differences between treatments during preharvest plant water stress indicators showed values reflected those of ψm tree s mds resulted in significant differences between ctl and both rd treatments during postharvest but as in the case of ψm the preharvest stress in rdm was not reflected in the results table 2 mds increased by 11 and 23 in rdm with respect to ctl in 2016 and 2017 preharvests respectively midday stem water potential reflected differences among treatments as shown in fig 1 during postharvest there were significant differences between ctl and rds at every measuring point while in the measurements corresponding to late july and august ψstem reflected the differences between rdm and rds the minimum ψstem values were reached both seasons by trees of the rds treatment during postharvest when they were close to 1 5 mpa during preharvest ψstem was sensitive enough to identify the mild deficit imposed by rdm and significant differences between rdm and ctl appeared moreover in 2017 preharvest ψstem was able to distinguish among all treatments rdm led to ψstem values that were 0 06 and 0 12 mpa lower than in ctl prior to harvest in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 ψstem was the only water stress indicator that showed significant differences during preharvest fruit water potential did not show significant differences among treatments fig 1 and was strongly related to ψstem fig 2 a ψfruit showed a similar trend to negative values during both preharvest periods however in 2016 the mean values in all treatments were 30 lower than in 2017 fig 1 as was to be expected ψfruit was seen to be highly dependent on ψᴫfruit fig 2b which in turn was closely related with the fruit soluble solids content fig 2c on the other hand ψρfruit showed a lower linear relationship with ψfruit and explained 53 6 of the changes in ψfruit furthermore a linear relationship between ψρfruit and fruit growth rate gr was obtained r2 0 56 fig 2d 3 3 fruit development dynamic fruit development and ripening had finished by 70 and 73 dafb in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 3 shows the increases in fruit size during the fruit development period the fruit physical parameters volume and fresh unitary weight were characterized by a sigmoidal growth pattern which could be divided into three distinct parts the first part showed an exponential increase up to 18 and 20 dafb 117 doy in 2016 and 100 doy in 2017 which could be attributed to stage i and ii of fruit development the second part of similar length had a linear trend early mid stage iii of fruit development fruit growth slowed down in the third part late stage iii until the final fruit size was reached commercial harvest there was no clear evidence of the exponential part in the fruit dry weight and in the equatorial diameter growth pattern compared with fruit volume or ssc fruit were larger in 2017 than in 2016 a year in which no treatment produced fruit weighing more than 9 g and measuring more than 8 4 cm3 while in 2017 all treatments produced fruit of 11 g and 10 7 cm3 in neither year there were differences among treatments as regards fruit size yield and number of fruit per tree whereas all these measurements differed between years equatorial diameter was the fruit size parameter measured in which the different fruit growth stages were hardest to identify the fruit fresh weight exhibited a similar trend to that of the fruit volume each year in 2016 fresh and dry unitary weight showed rapid increase from 30 days before harvest less pronounced during the last 10 days in 2017 the fruit and dry unitary weight did not show a slower increase in the previous days to harvest fig 3c and d ssc evolution showed a similar pattern to fruit volume and fresh weight fig 3e and f the greatest ssc increase was seen in all treatments when fruit volume had already reached half of the final size 148 and 132 doy in 2016 and 2017 respectively both years ssc reached values above 17 in 2016 ssc values at harvest did not result in significant differences among treatments however in 2017 ssc of fruits from rdm was statistically higher than that from ctl fruits during the last part of the ripening process fruit color changed throughout the ripening stage the hueº showed an inverse sigmoid pattern with a sharp drop when fruit changed from a green straw colour to red mahogany this change started approximately 45 dafb and although the ripening process continued until harvest to reach a full red color fruit 15 days were necessary both years fig 3g and h in 2016 neither hueº nor l was significantly different among treatments however in 2017 although there were no significant differences in l among treatments rdm and rds produced darker cherries compared with ctl fruit lower values of hueº once fruit started to change color rdm led to redder colors than ctl and rds but at harvest trees from both deficit irrigation treatments bore darker cherries than ctl 3 4 fruit quality and yield at harvest the quality parameters analyzed did not show differences among treatments in 2016 however in 2017 rdm fruit were sweeter and darker compared to the fruit from ctl when the quality parameters of both years were compared all of them showed significant differences the fruit from 2016 was more prone to crack 30 smaller 40 firmer less dark red less sweet and less acid than the fruit from the same irrigation treatments in 2017 table 3 these results are consistent with the yield measured each year 2016 was a high cropping year and trees produced 43 more kg per tree 42 vs 29 kg fruit tree 1 and a 91 more fruits per tree 5027 vs 2634 than 2017 fig 4 consequently fruits from 2016 were significantly smaller furthermore when the interaction of both irrigation treatment and year conditions was considered parameters such as fruit color and ssc showed a significant interaction table 3 3 5 cold storage and shelf life extension performance during cold storage the physical parameters related with fruit size equatorial and polar diameters and volume remained stable throughout the experiment table 4 fruit and pulp firmness increased significantly with time in cold storage for all treatments and sharply declined during the shelf life simulation although there were no statistical differences among treatments ctl produced firmer fruit than the deficit treatments especially pulp firmness fig 5 at the 2016 harvest sweet cherry showed hueº values close to 24 for all treatments which is associated with bright red colors however during cold storage and during shelf life simulation a reduction in this parameter was observed particularly in the fruits from ctl similarly pedicel color also decreased as time passed at harvest all pedicels had a bright green color up to 110 hueº regardless of the irrigation treatment applied however after cold storage the pedicels from ctl fruit were significantly more greenish to straw colored than those from rds and rdm which remained bright green during shelf life simulation the pedicels from ctl turned a light brownish color while the others maintained greener colors especially rdm but due to high variability within each treatment no significant differences were observed fig 5 regarding ssc and ta there were no significant differences among treatments however both parameters tended to slightly lower mean values than those measured at harvest fig 5 ssc and ta values after the experiment decreased 5 and 9 respectively compared to the values measured at harvest as a result of the greater decrease of ta than ssc the mi increased rdm led to higher values of mi with no significant differences among treatments 4 discussion the results showed that ψm as well as plant water stress indicators such as mds and ψstem in ctl showed the typical water status of well watered trees throughout the experiment the differences among treatments in all the water indicators during postharvest reflected the irrigation changes in the deficit treatments table 2 since the plant response to soil water deficit depended on the time duration and intensity of water stress it is supposed that the soil water deficit reached was enough to induce plant water stress particularly under drip irrigation conditions furthermore sweet cherry has been described as a highly sensitive crop to soil water deficits and water evaporative demand molina et al 2016 during preharvest mds in rdm trees was higher than in ctl in 2016 and 2017 although as the variability among trees was high these increases in branch fluctuations were not sufficient to lead to statistical differences table 2 however when the water reductions applied in postharvest were high irrigation amount equivalent to 65 and 55 of etc in rdm and rds respectively the mds of the trees sharply increased and significant differences appeared making mds a reliable indicator of tree water status abdelfatah et al 2013 which could be of interest for irrigation scheduling in sweet cherry trees although all indicators were able to identify a water deficit situation only ψstem in trees from rdm identified mild water stress and provided significant differences during preharvest fig 1 thus our results confirm ψstem as a reference indicator in deficit irrigation management in sweet cherry as previously reported by blanco et al 2018 marsal et al 2009 and oyarzun et al 2010 ψfruit showed a high linear relationship with ψstem fig 2a although slightly lower than that reported in peach by gelly et al 2004 ψfruit showed a similar trend to negative values as ψstem fig 1 however ψfruit tended to decrease more sharply as the fruit developed regardless of irrigation treatment similar results have been described in different crops such as apple mills et al 1997 jujube galindo et al 2016 olive fernandes et al 2018 pomegranate galindo et al 2017 and others a substantial decrease in ψfruit was observed 27 and 31 days before fruit harvest in 2016 and 2017 that 0 46 and 0 44 mpa in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 1 this decrease coincided with the early stage iii of fruit development the phase with the highest growth ssc increase and fruit color change fig 3 the high linear relationship between ψstem and ψfruit especially during stage iii of sweet cherry development is consistent with the remarks of bertin and génard 2018 who reported that cell enlargement is a result of water flows following a stem to fruit gradient of water potential the recorded decreases in ψfruit coincided with the decrease in ψᴫfruit and the increases in fruit size and ssc this increase in ssc was strongly related to ψᴫfruit decreases fig 2c this linear relationship obtained between ssc and ψᴫfruit being similar to the one reported by yakushiji et al 1996 in satsuma mandarin these observations were also consistent with the ψᴫfruit and ψfruit evolution described by schumann et al 2014 in sweet cherry regina therefore a high linear relationship between ψᴫfruit and ψfruit was obtained fig 2b the rapid and high decreases in ψᴫfruit were balanced by corresponding increases in ψρfruit ψρfruit values were always maintained above zero in all treatments throughout the experiment fig 2d the maintenance of ψρfruit values above zero is fundamental during fruit growth and it is known that fruit growth as cell growth requires cell turgor matthews and shackel 2005 thus a linear relationship between sweet cherry growth rate and ψρfruit was found moreover in apple archbold 1992 stated that carbohydrates partition between the starch and fruit soluble sugars maintained fruit turgor so fruit growth rate from an osmoregulatory point of view also depends on ψᴫfruit from this relationship it was hypothesized that although ψρfruit remained positive throughout fruit development factors other than turgor would also have determined the fruit growth rate fruit absolute growth increased continuously throughout fruit development fig 3a and b as did ψρfruit on the other hand ψfruit and ψᴫfruit rapidly decreased as ssc rose matthews and shackel 2005 described that fruit growth is highly dependent on changes in the structure of the cell wall and the variations in cell turgor and ψᴫfruit according to andrews and li 1995 the changes in the cell walls weakening during sweet cherry ripening and the accumulation of biochemical substance in the fruit lower ψᴫfruit and play a major role in promoting fruit growth thus sweet cherry growth was conditioned by an increase in ψρfruit values caused by solute accumulation and the cell wall weakening which diminished ψᴫfruit thus source and sink ψᴫfruit gradients increase ψρfruit values due to water entering through the fruit phloem which has a significant effect on fruit growth and ψfruit bertin and génard 2018 consequently when the relationship between ψfruit and its two components were compared ψfruit was seen to be much more influenced by ψᴫfruit than by ψρfruit as ψfruit and ψᴫfruit declined so fruit size weight and ssc increased as prime giant is an early cultivar growth dynamics did not display the typical double sigmoid pattern of the stone fruits described by coombe 1976 in which three developmental stages are clearly identified however different fruit growth rates could be distinguished fig 3a and b our results were consistent with those of grossman and dejong 1995 and papenfuss and black 2010 who stated that in early cultivars of peach and tart cherry stage ii of fruit development pit hardening overlaps stages i and iii cell division and cell enlargement respectively the greatest increase in fresh fruit unitary weight the initial rise in dry fruit unitary weight fig 3c and d and increase in ssc fig 3g and h coincided with the beginning of stage iii approximately 20 days before harvest when the rapid decrease of ψᴫfruit occurred knoche et al 2001 during these days the growth rate of both years reached their respective maxima fig 3c and d which coincided with the highest increases of ψρfruit furthermore during these days fruit started their color change from green to straw fig 3g and h in 2017 rdm led to significant darker mahogany colors than ctl darker colors are associated by the consumer with sweeter fruit so darker fruit are more appreciated crisosto et al 2003 in this study these results were corroborated thus the darker fruit from rdm were also significantly sweeter than those from ctl at harvest fruit quality was evaluated every year in 2016 the different irrigation strategies did not prompt significant differences in the quality parameters measured however in 2017 differences among treatments appeared rdm produced significantly darker and sweeter fruit table 3 deficit irrigation has been used to improve fruit color in several fruit crops such as peach sotiropoulos et al 2010 falagán et al 2015b nectarine falagán et al 2015a pomegranate peña et al 2013 table grapes conesa et al 2015 2016 it being hypothesized that deficit irrigation improves fruit coloration by increasing accumulation of the bioactive compounds involved in the fruit ripening process and diminishes vegetative growth thus allowing fruit to be more exposed to sunlight the results for other parameters such as cracking incidence equatorial and polar diameters volume firmness pedicel color ta and fruit dry unitary weight were not statistically influenced by the irrigation management which is consistent with the data reported in summit sweet cherries under rdi strategies by marsal et al 2010 the quality parameters studied were significantly different each year table 3 in general fruit harvested in 2016 were smaller in all treatments than the values expected for this cultivar while the mean values obtained in 2017 were similar in color size and ssc and slightly higher for fruit firmness and ta than those reported in the same cultivar by serrano et al 2009 these differences between years could be explained by the differences in yield and number of fruits produced each year the yield and the number of fruits per tree were 43 and 91 higher in 2016 than in 2017 without differences among treatments within the same year fig 4 ayala and lang 2004 and neilsen et al 2007 stated that in sweet cherry in high cropping years such as 2016 quality parameters and especially fruit size are influenced by a low leaf area fruit ratio and consequently mean fruit unitary weight is lower than in those years with normal yield and higher leaf area fruit ratio olmstead et al 2007 reported that sweet cherry size was more influenced by cell length than by number of cells so consequently environmental conditions and sink limitations affected more final cherry size during stage iii of fruit development cell enlargement than during stage i cell division smaller fruit in 2016 induced higher firmness brighter red color and lower concentration of ta when the physicochemical parameters of sweet cherries at harvest for both years were compared the interaction treatment year was only significant for hueº and ssc confirming that these are the parameters more sensitive to irrigation management irrigation treatments did not affect cracking incidence nor did it penalize fruit yield and number of fruits per tree table 3 fig 4a and b however although rdm did not show significant differences in fruit unitary weight compared to ctl ctl had larger fruits both years in 2017 fruit unitary weight was almost 1 g higher in the fruits produced by ctl than those of rdm fig 3c and d lower mean unitary weights in deficit treatments although without significant differences have been reported by goldhamer et al 1999 in peach it is well known that the crop profitability of sweet cherry is highly dependent on commercial size categories nieto et al 2017 so the decreases obtained by rdm treatment could have a negative impact on economic returns other studies on regulated deficit irrigation related the stress integral myers 1988 with the number of fruits per tree however the present study showed low correlation between stress integral and number of fruits per tree when both years are considered due to the similar amount of water applied to each specific treatment each year table 1 and the different yield obtained fig 4a thus the low correlation between those stress integral and number of fruits per tree when both years are considered could be due to other factors and or a combined effect of the same such as the preharvest mild water stress on rdm trees as soil water deficits have been related to smaller fruit in sweet cherry neilsen et al 2014 a postharvest deficit that could provoke effects on the fruit quality of the following season temperature and evaporative demand during bloom fruit set and cherry run off different crop loads vegetative growth sink source relations ayala and lang 2015 fruit quality from the first pick of 2016 was evaluated at harvest after cold storage 20 days at 2 c and a subsequent shelf life simulation period 5 days at 15 c to assess the effect of deficit irrigation on the storage performance of sweet cherry size parameters seemed to remain stable during storage in all treatments table 4 fruit and pulp firmness after cold storage increased as an effect of low temperatures during storage similar to the results obtained in bing cherries after 6 weeks at 1 67 c by patterson and kupferman 1983 however fruit and pulp firmness dropped during commercial life conditions table 4 and fig 5a and b fruit color remained almost constant throughout the cold storage but it turned into darker colors during shelf life fig 5c the greatest changes were to pedicel color the only factor that was influenced by deficit irrigation rdm led to a greener color at the end of the cold storage than ctl ctl pedicels showed significantly more discoloration browning after 20 days at 2 c however at the end of the experiment after 5 days at shelf life conditions 15 c the color of the pedicels from all treatments was degraded pedicel shriveling in sweet cherry is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity knoche et al 2015 and although the pedicels from the fruit of the rdm treatment were greener than those from ctl differences among treatments were not detectable at the end of the experiment fig 5d sweet cherry pedicel has been described as one of the best indicators of its freshness and greener pedicels are related to higher consumer acceptance knoche et al 2015 the greener colour of the pedicel from the deficit treatments was related with lower dehydration as lower dehydration losses in fruits from trees under regulated deficit irrigation have been explained as a result of the thicker cuticle in these fruits which reduces water losses gómez del campo et al 2014 pérez pastor et al 2007 romero trigueros et al 2017 ssc and ta did not show differences among irrigation treatments or times at harvest after cold storage or after shelf life table 4 with mean values above 18 and 1 1 g 100 ml 1 in all measurements according to the results obtained deficit irrigation treatments did not penalize any of the physicochemical quality parameters studied nevertheless as could be expected parameters such as fruit and pulp firmness and skin and pedicel color presented significant differences between the values obtained at harvest and after cold storage and shelf life table 4 this is indicative of the loss in sweet cherry fruit quality as storage progresses although no interaction with the irrigation treatment was observed sweet cherry has been described as a highly perishable fruit which deteriorates rapidly after harvest however in our experiment the mean values of the quality parameters obtained after 20 days at 2 c and 5 days at 15 c such as mahogany fruit color 23 hueº green pedicels 92 hueº good firmness 8 n ssc values above 15 and ta between 0 4 and 1 5 g 100 ml 1 can be considered acceptable in the fruit from all the irrigation treatments habib et al 2015 prime giant sweet cherry then can be safely marketed after cold storage as the fruit will still be found acceptable by consumers 5 conclusion the application of rdm and rds produced water savings of 36 and 40 of the water applied in the ctl treatment without significantly penalizing fruit yield or quality ψstem was the water deficit indicator that best identified and quantified the plant water status in sweet cherry the biggest changes in ψfruit took place in the period from the onset of rapid cherry growth first part of stage iii which was accompanied by a rapid increase in the fruit turgor potential and a decrease in fruit osmotic potential these results indicate the need to maintain a positive pressure potential inside the cell and a continuous supply of biochemical substances for the proper growth of the fruit regulated deficit irrigation treatments did not produce differences in the quality parameters measured at the 2016 harvest compared with ctl however after 20 days of cold storage rd led to greener pedicels than ctl this difference among treatments could be a key factor in leading consumers to prefer rd sweet cherries over those from ctl due to their visual appearance after storage in the 2017 harvest rd particularly rdm led to darker and sweeter fruit than ctl when both deficit treatments were compared rdm did not improve rds fruit quality furthermore fruits from rds did not show any size reduction compared to ctl either year of study based on these results rds can be recommended over the other irrigation strategies to improve water use in semiarid areas

11082,this work is devoted to precision agriculture and more precisely to the spatial monitoring of water status in viticulture an empirical approach was introduced in 2008 based on the extrapolation across a domain vineyard block vineyard region of vine water status observations from a reference site using a simple statistical model called spider and proved efficient in many studies once the extrapolation model is calibrated this approach leads to a concentration of measurements for one site only reference site while providing an estimate of the grapevine water status at a larger spatial scale it is a promising hybrid approach based both on regular but targeted measurements and on modelling however so far only empirical guidelines for its practical use have been provided moreover the limits of validity spatial temporal etc of such an approach are not known this work intends to use a mechanistic model based on grapevine water balance modelling to study to what extent a simulated water status can be spatially extrapolated at the field scale the water balance model was calibrated on two datasets different cultivars and weather data and used to analyse the performances of spider the results confirmed the relevance of the empirical approach spider based on water status spatial extrapolation with a low error level on the two datasets studied the use of the water balance model also helped define the validity domain of spider it confirmed the importance of having dominantly dry conditions and revealed the possibility of recovering good prediction quality after strong rainfall or irrigation this study globally demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model and provides new insights on the properties of the predictions for application in viticulture either at the within field level or at larger scale keywords precision viticulture crop model data extrapolation water status 1 introduction several studies have shown that changes in grapevine water status ψ have a direct effect on grape composition and quality by influencing vegetative growth fruit growth yield canopy microclimate and fruit metabolism see among others tregoat et al 2002 dry and loveys 1998 van leeuwen and seguin 1994 ojeda et al 2002 brillante et al 2018 characterizing the spatial variability of ψ is then a key issue for terroir study séguin 1983 van leeuwen et al 2009 the spatial monitoring of ψ therefore provides important information for managing and or assessing grape quality van leeuwen et al 2009 rezaei and reynolds 2010 in a review paper acevedo opazo et al 2008 discussed the importance of methods for spatial monitoring of vine water status furthermore the same authors proposed an empirical spatial model eq 1 to predict the vine water status estimated with the water potential ψ across a given domain vineyard block vineyard region etc 1 ψ s t a s ψ s r e f t the principle of the model is to extrapolate a reference value ψ sref t measured at a reference site sref and time t the extrapolation is based on a linear relationship defined by the coefficients as whose values are specific to site s the model provides an estimate ψ s t of ψ values at any site s where a coefficient as is available this spatial model has been successfully tested at the within field level acevedo opazo et al 2010 and at a vineyard level constituted of several blocks taylor et al 2010 more recently the model has been successfully tested at the whole denomination scale by baralon et al 2012 at this scale the approach was called spider spatial extrapolation of the vine water status at the whole denomination scale from a reference site although empirical the spider approach may present several practical advantages i it relies solely on direct ψ measurements i e leaf water potential which can be performed by vine growers therefore the calibration of the model can be implemented within a conventional monitoring of ψ the method does not require spatial estimates of other variables related to soil or other environmental factors that may be difficult and expensive to measure ii the model can also be calibrated from measurements that have already been taken therefore it makes it possible to use existing databases of ψ historical databases provided that the data are geo located and iii the principle of the method allows to consider asynchronous measurements when labor is the limiting factor provided that the measurement of ψ is systematically done on the reference site despite these practical advantages the results obtained have highlighted a number of limitations of spider that the empirical approach allows to observe but does not allow to quantify objectively two main limitations have been identified baralon et al 2012 the first one refers to the climatic context of the year used to calibrate the model indeed baralon et al 2012 stressed that the database used to calibrate the model must necessarily include data with a large magnitude of water restriction which requires a sufficiently long summer period without any rainfall to reach high ψ values over the domain under consideration the second limitation relates to conditions concerning the soil climate and cultural practices that the study area must present so that the linear relationship associating ψ from the reference site to ψ of any site remains relevant i e constant over the time for example taylor et al 2010 showed that ψ extrapolation appeared to be feasible between fields despite different soil types if the general soil moisture regimes were similar indeed the linear relationships considered in the model did break down when the soil moisture regimes or when rainfall amounts were variable between the reference site and the site of prediction similarly the linear relationship with the reference site may be altered by irrigation baralon et al 2012 because spider is based on a data based learning approach it provides a limited formal framework to explore these limitations more specifically it does not allow to study the effect of a differentiated water input i e rainfall irrigation on the quality of the estimates produced by extrapolation from a reference site for example it is impossible to know if there is a critical precipitation level beyond which extrapolation can no longer be applied in the same way it is difficult to know if the linear relationship is definitively lost for the season after a rainfall event or if it is again possible to apply the model after a sufficiently long dry period recent work gaudin et al 2017 has shown that a mechanistic approach based on a water balance model wbm can contribute to understanding within field variations of the vine water status these results suggest that such a modelling approach might be used to study the spatial extrapolation problem by simulating the water status ψ s i m s t for several sites within the same field and by analysing how these simulated dynamics relate to the one corresponding to a reference site the main objective of this paper is thus to use a vineyard dataset and a water balance model to perform these analyses and to provide a new angle for studying the validity of spider and its limitations the paper is organised in three parts i the first will present the calibration of the wbm with historical data and its validation ii the second will present implementation of the wbm to validate the spider approach based on extrapolation of simulated ψ values from a reference site and then iii the last part will use wbm properties to better understand the validity of spider especially in the case of water supply either by rainfall or irrigation 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset of predawn water potential observations in a mediterranean vineyard shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 over the last 20 years year 2004 and to a lesser extent 2005 were identified as the best summer periods for this work indeed in both these years languedoc experienced very long periods of dry conditions interrupted by significant rainfall events predawn leaf water potential data were collected in 2004 for one variety shiraz and in 2005 for the other variety mourvèdre by acevedo opazo et al 2010 in vineyards of pech rouge inra gruissan 43 08 47 n 03 07 19 e the 1 2 ha shiraz vineyard was planted in 1990 fig 1 the 1 7 ha mourvèdre vineyard was also planted in 1990 both are included in the la clape terroir which is classified as a designation of origin by the french authority the northern limits of this terroir follow the lower course of the river aude and the southern limits follow a former riverbed of the same river the corresponding geological terrain is cretaceous limestone mainly constituted of thick orbitolina deposits lespinasse 1982 over time this geological material has given rise to heterogeneity in the pedological material predawn leaf water potential measurements were carried out between 3 and 5 a m on vines located on 49 sites of the fields acevedo opazo et al 2010 these sites were defined following a regular grid as presented in fig 1 measurements were made with a pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 at six dates either in 2004 or in 2005 the pressure chamber was a plant water status console model 3000 soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara california one date site data corresponds to the average of three measurements on three representative vines at one site in order to perform measurements over the 49 sites in a short period of time the following organization was used three technicians and researchers collected the leaves and brought them to a researcher the same person for shiraz and mourvèdre fields in charge of measurements on the console climatic data fig 2 were monitored by the pech rouge weather station located 100 m away from the shiraz field 500 m away from the mourvèdre field these climatic data were used to record rainfall events and to compute the reference evapotranspiration et0 according to allen et al 1998 2 2 the spider approach for extrapolating the water status dynamics from reference sites the spider model was presented in eq 1 it was implemented on data collected in 2004 and 2005 its principle is based on the random choice of a reference site sre available ψ data were used to calibrate a linear model linking the ψ values of the reference site to ψ values of different sites in the domain once calibrated as shown in fig 3 spider can be used to extrapolate any measurements taken at the reference site to each site in the domain for which calibration was performed this extrapolation uses a collection of coefficients as1 as2 as3 asi specific to each site of

celette et al 2010 are used in many studies and particularly in mediterranean conditions i to provide a diagnosis tool on vineyard water stress pellegrino et al 2006 ii to analyse the effect of intercropping between vine rows celette et al 2010 ripoche et al 2010 or iii to study irrigation needs gaudin and gary 2012 roux et al 2014 the main model output is the dynamics of a normalized water stress index based on soil water content and called fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw the principle of this approach is to compute the daily change in soil water content from different water fluxes that occur inside the soil volume accessible to vine roots adopting the modelling hypotheses used in gaudin and gary 2012 the resulting update of daily ftsw noted ftswt can be written as 2 f t

water content the link between the ftsw modelling approach and measurements of the vine water status based on predawn leaf water potential has been done by lebon et al 2003 and pellegrino et al 2005 who proposed an empirical relationship which appeared robust for several mediterranean vineyard fields eq 3 3 ψ ψ f t s w f t s w max 1 5 1 b log f t s w a with a 1 0572 b 5 3452 using eqs 2 and 3 it is possible to simulate the dynamics of ftsw continuously and derive an estimation ψ s i m t of water potential ψ at time t by limiting the simulation period to the stage of vine growth corresponding to full canopy development only a few model inputs are required to implement eq 3 these inputs are presented in table 1 2 3 2 calibration of the model on shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 in order to apply

order to analyse the calibration performances of the wbm applied on the 49 sites of the two dataset shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 ψ s i m t was computed for each site the associated mean absolute error of calibration was then estimated using eq 4 for each field the distribution over all sites of the obtained mae was then analysed 2 4 2 choice of the reference sites spider requires the choice of a reference site in order to predict for any site i the value of the potential ψ i o b s t k from the value observed on a reference site ψ r e f o b s t k it has been shown in previous studies that spider prediction performances were not very sensitive to the choice of the reference site acevedo et al 2010 baralon et al 2012 it is however crucial for applying the wbm that the reference site is well adjusted by model simulations in order to take this constraint into account for each field the reference site was chosen by taking the site with best wbm calibration error among the best sites of reference for spider by applying this procedure to each field site 29 and site 26 were selected as reference sites respectively for shiraz and mourvèdre 2 4 3 validating the global performances of spider using wbm simulations the performance of spider is measured by the prediction error this latter as well as the linear model are defined on a small number of available observations and may therefore be biased by the limited number of measurements using the wbm the linear regression between the continuous dynamics of a reference site ψ r e f s i m t and the associated dynamics of a target site ψ i s i m t can be computed ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t it is therefore possible to test the prediction error of this model for each day within the measurement period this prediction error can be seen as a generalization of the spider prediction error as it also uses a linear regression model between ψ values based on the use of a single reference site this prediction is also more robust compared to the one based only on measurements in the sense that the number of samples is much higher simulations are carried out every day in the measurement period the spider approach may be considered validated if the prediction errors obtained using continuous predictions of the wbm are low for most sites in the rest of the document the use of the data derived by the wbm to simulate the spider approach as described in this section will be referred to as wbm based regression 2 4 4 theoretical analysis of spider performances using the wbm in dry conditions spider limitations were investigated using the wbm approach from gaudin et al 2017 it is known that under dry conditions the plant water potential decreased linearly in relation to the cumulated et0 moreover the slope of this relation can be expressed using model parameters it is equal to the ratio of kcb basal crop coefficient to ttsw total transpirable soil water it is therefore possible to understand how simulated ψ dynamics at different sites in a same field are related during a dry period more precisely regarding a dry period starting at time t0 eq 5 summarises changes in plant water potential for a reference site ref and a target site i 5 ψ i s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ r e f s i m t 0 k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s these equations will be combined to study the relationship between spatialized simulated water potentials in dry conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of wbm on historical ψ data the cumulated density of calibration error of wbm is presented in fig 4 the error defined as the mean absolute error between observations and simulations and expressed in mpa ranges from 0 03 mpa to 0 22 mpa and from 0 04 mpa to 0 25 mpa for mourvèdre2005 and shiraz2004 respectively 80 of the sites have an error lower than 0 15 mpa for mourvèdre2005 and lower than 0 18 mpa for shiraz2004 for each field two sites were highlighted in red in fig 4 sites 37 and 32 for shiraz and sites 23 and 25 for mourvèdre these sites were chosen to encompass the large range of calibration errors from mae 0 05 mpa site 37 and 23 to mae 0 15 mpa sites 32 and 25 they are used in fig 5 to illustrate the evolution dynamics of the estimated plant water potential estimated from the wbm in contrasting situations in terms of error for the two fields fig 5 shows a low error level of 0 05 mpa obtained on site 37 shiraz2004 and 23 mourvèdre 2005 very well adjusted curves on almost all measurements are associated to this low error level a moderate error level of 0 15 mpa is obtained on site 32 shiraz2004 and 25 mouvèdre2005 for such sites the model does not adjust properly to all measurement dates higher deviations between outputs of the model and observed values are noticed at the beginning of the measurement period for site 32 shiraz2004 while over and under estimations are observed over the whole experimentation period for site 25 mourvèdre2005 as seen in fig 4 the calibration is globally better on mourvèdre2005 than on shiraz2004 and overall these error levels are considered acceptable to use the model for the spatial extrapolation problem 3 2 validation of the spider model on historical ψ data fig 6 shows a comparison between errors observed with spider and wbm based regression for mourvèdre2005 the prediction error using the wbm based regression is low 0 15 mpa for 90 of sites and close to error values obtained with spider for shiraz2004 80 of the sites have a prediction error lower than 0 15 mpa note that the remaining 20 are also characterized by higher calibration errors the model does not adjust at its best and the wbm based regression results are thus less significant on these sites overall the prediction error of the wbm based regression appears low for both fields this means that the knowledge of the simulated ψ dynamics on a reference site allows to predict with relatively high precision the simulated ψ dynamics on a target site using the simple linear regression model ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t this result strengthens the validity of spider indeed it shows that the linear regression model based on several ψ measurements spider is also valid when considering simulated ψ dynamics at any day within the measurement period this is one significant result of the present paper fig 7 allows to analyse the results obtained with linear predictions from an observed or simulated reference site more precisely it shows the simulated ψ dynamics for two sites sites 37 shiraz2004 and 23 mourvèdre2005 both sites present a low calibration error see fig 4 and a low prediction error using the wbm based regression 0 11 mpa for site 37 and 0 03 mpa for site 23 the regression line in grey is therefore in both cases an accurate way to predict ψ i s i m t grey circles from ψ r e f s i m t it can be noted in fig 7 that while the linear model is a good approximation of the link between ψ dynamics this relationship may present some complex features for site 23 mourvèdr2005 non linearity is observed for low ψ values for site 37 shiraz2004 the relationship between ψ values is mostly piecewise linear different correlations seem to apply at different periods with the same slope but different intercepts these properties will be further analysed in the following section 3 3 theoretical analysis of spider performances in dry conditions the previous results have shown that the wbm approach was able to validate the spider results on the two year data set this section aims at using the wbm in order to gain more insights into the spider conditions of application to this aim both dry and wet conditions were considered 3 3 1 dry conditions piecewise linearity from eq 5 and using the simple trick that a x b a c c x d b a d c for any c 0 the following relationship eq 6 between simulated ψ values can be obtained under dry conditions 6 ψ i s i m t 0 t k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i ψ r e f s i m t 0 eq 6 can be written as follows 7 ψ i s i m t 0 t a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 t b i p a r a m t 0 with a i p a r a m k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i b i p a r a m t 0 ψ i s i m t 0 a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 eq 7 shows that every dry period starting at t t0 results for t t0 and under dry conditions in a linear relation between ψ i s i m t and ψ r e f s i m t the slope of this relation a i p a r a m is defined using basal crop coefficients and ttsw of each site and does not depend on the water status at t t0 unlike the intercept b i p a r a m t 0 this property explains the piecewise linearity that can be seen in fig 7a there are clearly two periods of piecewise linearity in this simulation 3 3 2 persistent dry conditions stable linearity when dry conditions last a long time under high evaporative demand high et0 the model can be simplified in such cases the water potential reaches very low values and it is possible to neglect the influence of the intercept in the relationships between ψ dynamics eq 8 8 ψ i s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ r e f s i m t 0 k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s in these specific conditions this implies that ψ i s i m t 0 t a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 t the linear relation is therefore mainly characterized by only basal crop coefficients and ttsw of each site which is likely to be stable over several years 3 3 3 link between the regression coefficient and model parameters based on the previous section a i p a r a m is known to drive the relationship between simulated ψ dynamics during persistent dry conditions in fig 8 a comparison between a i p a r a m and the regression coefficient a i s i m of the predictive model using simulations defined by ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t is performed to evaluate if a i p a r a m can be a good estimate of a i s i m even if the whole period does not correspond to dry conditions both coefficients have been computed for each site in each field a i p a r a m was computed from the calibrated model parameters a i s i m by linear regression on simulations remember that 49 sites are available in each field the site of reference being removed this approach results in a comparison of 48 values for each field a i p a r a m appears to be a good approximation of a i s i m for both data sets shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 even if the weather conditions were not persistently dry fig 8 on condition that kcb and ttsw are stable over several years which happens if the vine grower does not significantly change any management practices in the vineyard and that climatic conditions are globally the same dominantly dry this implies that the linear relationship between simulated ψ values should be globally stable over the years and related to model parameters kcb and ttsw 3 4 impact of rainfall events on prediction quality in historical ψ data the wbm approach allows to better study the limitation of spider especially during and after a rainfall event or in case of irrigation it should be noted that studying these situations is difficult with an empirical approach such as spider since it would require performing a large number of measurements over limited periods of time the implementation of an approach based on a validated wbm under the conditions of the study allows a more detailed study this analysis was made numerically on the two datasets using the methodology presented in fig 9 by focusing on the ratio of simulation ψ dynamics for every t in the measurement period ψ i s i m t ψ r e f s i m t and on the regression coefficient a i s i m derived from the wbm based regression ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t the normalized distance di t between this ratio of simulated ψ and the regression coefficient was computed for each site i as is eq 9 9 d i t 1 a i s i m ψ i s i m t ψ r e f s i m t a i s i m finally in order to aggregate the results for all sites quantiles 10 90 of the di t distribution were computed they are studied as a function of time to see how the local linearity between ψ dynamics is broken by rainfall or irrigation events indeed the periods where the linear approximation works well resp poorly correspond to low resp high di t values another point of interest is to look for recovery periods after a rainfall or irrigation event after which ψ dynamics are again linearly correlated the assessment of the robustness of the linear approximation between ψ dynamics is presented in fig 10 the prediction using a linear regression model has been shown to be globally acceptable in fig 6 but it can be seen in fig 10 that rainfall alters the linearity of the relationship locally and that the interference is linked to the amount of rainfall the impact of rainfall events is however not uniform even for a same amount of water the heaviest rainfalls for example the 20 mm rainfall on shiraz2004 may not change the relationship for some sites while altering it for others on the other hand many small rainfall events those 5 mm do not change the quality of the linear prediction probably because the corresponding incoming water is evaporated very quickly however the main property stressed by fig 10 is the presence of a recovery time before regaining the previous quality of the linear model approximation including after the heaviest rainfalls the prediction using the linear model becomes accurate again after a certain time see for example the 20 mm rainfall on shiraz2004 and the decreasing of the error after this event this result is particularly significant and provides practical information for using an empirical approach like spider it shows that spider could still be applied even after rainfall events or irrigation after such events there is transitory period during which any extrapolation of water status values observed on the site of reference would lead to biased estimations however spider becomes relevant again after a certain period of time for these experimentations a period of 5 days would have been sufficient for most sites after a small rainfall event 15 mm while a period of 15 days would have been required for heavier rainfall 15 mm naturally further experiments will be necessary to validate this recommendation for its use on a larger scale 4 conclusion this paper analyses why the vine water status as characterized by predawn water potential values can be extrapolated from measurements on a single reference site using a linear regression model known as the spider approach to perform this analysis a water balance model running on a daily basis was used to provide daily estimates of predawn water potential values the model was calibrated and used on two datasets different vineyards different years with 49 sites of predawn leaf water potential measurements the use of the water balance model confirmed that predawn water potential values at any site can be estimated from observations performed on a reference site using a linear regression model linking the two dynamics with a low error level for persistent dry conditions occurring frequently in mediterranean vineyards the ratio of simulated predawn water potential values was shown to be simply linked to model parameters basal crop coefficient and total transpirable soil water indicating that the linear relationship between simulated water potential dynamics is stable over several years provided persistent dry conditions are dominant finally the robustness of the relationship to rainfall or irrigation events was analysed using the water balance model this demonstrated that the relationship between the simulated water potential dynamics is less predictive around a rainfall event but that its quality is recovered after a period of time if no other rain event occurs this study demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model with new insights on the properties of the predictions this study confirms the interest of its application in viticulture either

11082,this work is devoted to precision agriculture and more precisely to the spatial monitoring of water status in viticulture an empirical approach was introduced in 2008 based on the extrapolation across a domain vineyard block vineyard region of vine water status observations from a reference site using a simple statistical model called spider and proved efficient in many studies once the extrapolation model is calibrated this approach leads to a concentration of measurements for one site only reference site while providing an estimate of the grapevine water status at a larger spatial scale it is a promising hybrid approach based both on regular but targeted measurements and on modelling however so far only empirical guidelines for its practical use have been provided moreover the limits of validity spatial temporal etc of such an approach are not known this work intends to use a mechanistic model based on grapevine water balance modelling to study to what extent a simulated water status can be spatially extrapolated at the field scale the water balance model was calibrated on two datasets different cultivars and weather data and used to analyse the performances of spider the results confirmed the relevance of the empirical approach spider based on water status spatial extrapolation with a low error level on the two datasets studied the use of the water balance model also helped define the validity domain of spider it confirmed the importance of having dominantly dry conditions and revealed the possibility of recovering good prediction quality after strong rainfall or irrigation this study globally demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model and provides new insights on the properties of the predictions for application in viticulture either at the within field level or at larger scale keywords precision viticulture crop model data extrapolation water status 1 introduction several studies have shown that changes in grapevine water status ψ have a direct effect on grape composition and quality by influencing vegetative growth fruit growth yield canopy microclimate and fruit metabolism see among others tregoat et al 2002 dry and loveys 1998 van leeuwen and seguin 1994 ojeda et al 2002 brillante et al 2018 characterizing the spatial variability of ψ is then a key issue for terroir study séguin 1983 van leeuwen et al 2009 the spatial monitoring of ψ therefore provides important information for managing and or assessing grape quality van leeuwen et al 2009 rezaei and reynolds 2010 in a review paper acevedo opazo et al 2008 discussed the importance of methods for spatial monitoring of vine water status furthermore the same authors proposed an empirical spatial model eq 1 to predict the vine water status estimated with the water potential ψ across a given domain vineyard block vineyard region etc 1 ψ s t a s ψ s r e f t the principle of the model is to extrapolate a reference value ψ sref t measured at a reference site sref and time t the extrapolation is based on a linear relationship defined by the coefficients as whose values are specific to site s the model provides an estimate ψ s t of ψ values at any site s where a coefficient as is available this spatial model has been successfully tested at the within field level acevedo opazo et al 2010 and at a vineyard level constituted of several blocks taylor et al 2010 more recently the model has been successfully tested at the whole denomination scale by baralon et al 2012 at this scale the approach was called spider spatial extrapolation of the vine water status at the whole denomination scale from a reference site although empirical the spider approach may present several practical advantages i it relies solely on direct ψ measurements i e leaf water potential which can be performed by vine growers therefore the calibration of the model can be implemented within a conventional monitoring of ψ the method does not require spatial estimates of other variables related to soil or other environmental factors that may be difficult and expensive to measure ii the model can also be calibrated from measurements that have already been taken therefore it makes it possible to use existing databases of ψ historical databases provided that the data are geo located and iii the principle of the method allows to consider asynchronous measurements when labor is the limiting factor provided that the measurement of ψ is systematically done on the reference site despite these practical advantages the results obtained have highlighted a number of limitations of spider that the empirical approach allows to observe but does not allow to quantify objectively two main limitations have been identified baralon et al 2012 the first one refers to the climatic context of the year used to calibrate the model indeed baralon et al 2012 stressed that the database used to calibrate the model must necessarily include data with a large magnitude of water restriction which requires a sufficiently long summer period without any rainfall to reach high ψ values over the domain under consideration the second limitation relates to conditions concerning the soil climate and cultural practices that the study area must present so that the linear relationship associating ψ from the reference site to ψ of any site remains relevant i e constant over the time for example taylor et al 2010 showed that ψ extrapolation appeared to be feasible between fields despite different soil types if the general soil moisture regimes were similar indeed the linear relationships considered in the model did break down when the soil moisture regimes or when rainfall amounts were variable between the reference site and the site of prediction similarly the linear relationship with the reference site may be altered by irrigation baralon et al 2012 because spider is based on a data based learning approach it provides a limited formal framework to explore these limitations more specifically it does not allow to study the effect of a differentiated water input i e rainfall irrigation on the quality of the estimates produced by extrapolation from a reference site for example it is impossible to know if there is a critical precipitation level beyond which extrapolation can no longer be applied in the same way it is difficult to know if the linear relationship is definitively lost for the season after a rainfall event or if it is again possible to apply the model after a sufficiently long dry period recent work gaudin et al 2017 has shown that a mechanistic approach based on a water balance model wbm can contribute to understanding within field variations of the vine water status these results suggest that such a modelling approach might be used to study the spatial extrapolation problem by simulating the water status ψ s i m s t for several sites within the same field and by analysing how these simulated dynamics relate to the one corresponding to a reference site the main objective of this paper is thus to use a vineyard dataset and a water balance model to perform these analyses and to provide a new angle for studying the validity of spider and its limitations the paper is organised in three parts i the first will present the calibration of the wbm with historical data and its validation ii the second will present implementation of the wbm to validate the spider approach based on extrapolation of simulated ψ values from a reference site and then iii the last part will use wbm properties to better understand the validity of spider especially in the case of water supply either by rainfall or irrigation 2 material and

best summer periods for this work indeed in both these years languedoc experienced very long periods of dry conditions interrupted by significant rainfall events predawn leaf water potential data were collected in 2004 for one variety shiraz and in 2005 for the other variety mourvèdre by acevedo opazo et al 2010 in vineyards of pech rouge inra gruissan 43 08 47 n 03 07 19 e the 1 2 ha shiraz vineyard was planted in 1990 fig 1 the 1 7 ha mourvèdre vineyard was also planted in 1990 both are included in the la clape terroir which is classified as a designation of origin by the french authority the northern limits of this terroir follow the lower course of the river aude and the southern limits follow a former riverbed of the same river the corresponding geological terrain is cretaceous limestone mainly constituted of thick orbitolina deposits lespinasse 1982 over time this geological material has given rise to heterogeneity in the pedological material predawn leaf water potential measurements were carried out between 3 and 5 a m on vines located on 49 sites of the fields acevedo opazo et al 2010 these sites were defined following a regular grid as presented in fig 1 measurements were made with a pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 at six dates either in 2004 or in 2005 the pressure chamber was a plant water status console model 3000 soil moisture equipment

short period of time the following organization was used three technicians and researchers collected the leaves and brought them to a researcher the same person for shiraz and mourvèdre fields in charge of measurements on the console climatic data fig 2 were monitored by the pech rouge weather station located 100 m away from the shiraz field 500 m away from the mourvèdre field these climatic data were used to record rainfall events and to compute the reference evapotranspiration et0 according to allen et al 1998 2 2 the spider approach for extrapolating the water status dynamics from reference sites the spider model was presented in eq 1 it was implemented on data collected in 2004 and 2005 its principle is based on the random choice of a reference site sre available ψ data were used to calibrate a linear model linking the ψ values of the reference site to ψ values of different sites in the domain once calibrated as shown in fig 3 spider can be used to extrapolate any measurements taken at the reference site to each site in the domain for which calibration was performed this extrapolation uses a collection of coefficients as1 as2 as3 asi specific to each site of

celette et al 2010 are used in many studies and particularly in mediterranean conditions i to provide a diagnosis tool on vineyard water stress pellegrino et al 2006 ii to analyse the effect of intercropping between vine rows celette et al 2010 ripoche et al 2010 or iii to study irrigation needs gaudin and gary 2012 roux et al 2014 the main model output is the dynamics of a normalized water stress index based on soil water content and called fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw the principle of this approach is to compute the daily change in soil water content from different water fluxes that occur inside the soil volume accessible to vine roots adopting the modelling hypotheses used in gaudin and gary 2012 the resulting update of daily ftsw noted ftswt can be written as 2 f t

water content the link between the ftsw modelling approach and measurements of the vine water status based on predawn leaf water potential has been done by lebon et al 2003 and pellegrino et al 2005 who proposed an empirical relationship which appeared robust for several mediterranean vineyard fields eq 3 3 ψ ψ f t s w f t s w max 1 5 1 b log f t s w a with a 1 0572 b 5 3452 using eqs 2 and 3 it is possible to simulate the dynamics of ftsw continuously and derive an estimation ψ s i m t of water potential ψ at time t by limiting the simulation period to the stage of vine growth corresponding to full canopy development only a few model inputs are required to implement eq 3 these inputs are presented in table 1 2 3 2 calibration of the model on shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 in order to apply

order to analyse the calibration performances of the wbm applied on the 49 sites of the two dataset shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 ψ s i m t was computed for each site the associated mean absolute error of calibration was then estimated using eq 4 for each field the distribution over all sites of the obtained mae was then analysed 2 4 2 choice of the reference sites spider requires the choice of a reference site in order to predict for any site i the value of the potential ψ i o b s t k from the value observed on a reference site ψ r e f o b s t k it has been shown in previous studies that spider prediction performances were not very sensitive to the choice of the reference site acevedo et al 2010 baralon et al 2012 it is however crucial for applying the wbm that the reference site is well adjusted by model simulations in order to take this constraint into account for each field the reference site was chosen by taking the site with best wbm calibration error among the best sites of reference for spider by applying this procedure to each field site 29 and site 26 were selected as reference sites respectively for shiraz and mourvèdre 2 4 3 validating the global performances of spider using wbm simulations the performance of spider is measured by the prediction error this latter as well as the linear model are defined on a small number of available observations and may therefore be biased by the limited number of measurements using the wbm the linear regression between the continuous dynamics of a reference site ψ r e f s i m t and the associated dynamics of a target site ψ i s i m t can be computed ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t it is therefore possible to test the prediction error of this model for each day within the measurement period this prediction error can be seen as a generalization of the spider prediction error as it also uses a linear regression model between ψ values based on the use of a single reference site this prediction is also more robust compared to the one based only on measurements in the sense that the number of samples is much higher simulations are carried out every day in the measurement period the spider approach may be considered validated if the prediction errors obtained using continuous predictions of the wbm are low for most sites in the rest of the document the use of the data derived by the wbm to simulate the spider approach as described in this section will be referred to as wbm based regression 2 4 4 theoretical analysis of spider performances using the wbm in dry conditions spider limitations were investigated using the wbm approach from gaudin et al 2017 it is known that under dry conditions the plant water potential decreased linearly in relation to the cumulated et0 moreover the slope of this relation can be expressed using model parameters it is equal to the ratio of kcb basal crop coefficient to ttsw total transpirable soil water it is therefore possible to understand how simulated ψ dynamics at different sites in a same field are related during a dry period more precisely regarding a dry period starting at time t0 eq 5 summarises changes in plant water potential for a reference site ref and a target site i 5 ψ i s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ r e f s i m t 0 k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s these equations will be combined to study the relationship between spatialized simulated water potentials in dry conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of wbm on historical ψ data the cumulated density of calibration error of wbm is presented in fig 4 the error defined as the mean absolute error between observations and simulations and expressed in mpa ranges from 0 03 mpa to 0 22 mpa and from 0 04 mpa to 0 25 mpa for mourvèdre2005 and shiraz2004 respectively 80 of the sites have an error lower than 0 15 mpa for mourvèdre2005 and lower than 0 18 mpa for shiraz2004 for each field two sites were highlighted in red in fig 4 sites 37 and 32 for shiraz and sites 23 and 25 for mourvèdre these sites were chosen to encompass the large range of calibration errors from mae 0 05 mpa site 37 and 23 to mae 0 15 mpa sites 32 and 25 they are used in fig 5 to illustrate the evolution dynamics of the estimated plant water potential estimated from the wbm in contrasting situations in terms of error for the two fields fig 5 shows a low error level of 0 05 mpa obtained on site 37 shiraz2004 and 23 mourvèdre 2005 very well adjusted curves on almost all measurements are associated to this low error level a moderate error level of 0 15 mpa is obtained on site 32 shiraz2004 and 25 mouvèdre2005 for such sites the model does not adjust properly to all measurement dates higher deviations between outputs of the model and observed values are noticed at the beginning of the measurement period for site 32 shiraz2004 while over and under estimations are observed over the whole experimentation period for site 25 mourvèdre2005 as seen in fig 4 the calibration is globally better on mourvèdre2005 than on shiraz2004 and overall these error levels are considered acceptable to use the model for the spatial extrapolation problem 3 2 validation of the spider model on historical ψ data fig 6 shows a comparison between errors observed with spider and wbm based regression for mourvèdre2005 the prediction error using the wbm based regression is low 0 15 mpa for 90 of sites and close to error values obtained with spider for shiraz2004 80 of the sites have a prediction error lower than 0 15 mpa note that the remaining 20 are also characterized by higher calibration errors the model does not adjust at its best and the wbm based regression results are thus less significant on these sites overall the prediction error of the wbm based regression appears low for both fields this means that the knowledge of the simulated ψ dynamics on a reference site allows to predict with relatively high precision the simulated ψ dynamics on a target site using the simple linear regression model ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t this result strengthens the validity of spider indeed it shows that the linear regression model based on several ψ measurements spider is also valid when considering simulated ψ dynamics at any day within the measurement period this is one significant result of the present paper fig 7 allows to analyse the results obtained with linear predictions from an observed or simulated reference site more precisely it shows the simulated ψ dynamics for two sites sites 37 shiraz2004 and 23 mourvèdre2005 both sites present a low calibration error see fig 4 and a low prediction error using the wbm based regression 0 11 mpa for site 37 and 0 03 mpa for site 23 the regression line in grey is therefore in both cases an accurate way to predict ψ i s i m t grey circles from ψ r e f s i m t it can be noted in fig 7 that while the linear model is a good approximation of the link between ψ dynamics this relationship may present some complex features for site 23 mourvèdr2005 non linearity is observed for low ψ values for site 37 shiraz2004 the relationship between ψ values is mostly piecewise linear different correlations seem to apply at different periods with the same slope but different intercepts these properties will be further analysed in the following section 3 3 theoretical analysis of spider performances in dry conditions the previous results have shown that the wbm approach was able to validate the spider results on the two year data set this section aims at using the wbm in order to gain more insights into the spider conditions of application to this aim both dry and wet conditions were considered 3 3 1 dry conditions piecewise linearity from eq 5 and using the simple trick that a x b a c c x d b a d c for any c 0 the following relationship eq 6 between simulated ψ values can be obtained under dry conditions 6 ψ i s i m t 0 t k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i ψ r e f s i m t 0 eq 6 can be written as follows 7 ψ i s i m t 0 t a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 t b i p a r a m t 0 with a i p a r a m k c b i t t s w r e f k c b r e f t t s w i b i p a r a m t 0 ψ i s i m t 0 a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 eq 7 shows that every dry period starting at t t0 results for t t0 and under dry conditions in a linear relation between ψ i s i m t and ψ r e f s i m t the slope of this relation a i p a r a m is defined using basal crop coefficients and ttsw of each site and does not depend on the water status at t t0 unlike the intercept b i p a r a m t 0 this property explains the piecewise linearity that can be seen in fig 7a there are clearly two periods of piecewise linearity in this simulation 3 3 2 persistent dry conditions stable linearity when dry conditions last a long time under high evaporative demand high et0 the model can be simplified in such cases the water potential reaches very low values and it is possible to neglect the influence of the intercept in the relationships between ψ dynamics eq 8 8 ψ i s i m t 0 t ψ i s i m t 0 k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s k c b i t t s w i s t 0 t e t 0 s ψ r e f s i m t 0 t ψ r e f s i m t 0 k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s k c b r e f t t s w r e f s t 0 t e t 0 s in these specific conditions this implies that ψ i s i m t 0 t a i p a r a m ψ r e f s i m t 0 t the linear relation is therefore mainly characterized by only basal crop coefficients and ttsw of each site which is likely to be stable over several years 3 3 3 link between the regression coefficient and model parameters based on the previous section a i p a r a m is known to drive the relationship between simulated ψ dynamics during persistent dry conditions in fig 8 a comparison between a i p a r a m and the regression coefficient a i s i m of the predictive model using simulations defined by ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t is performed to evaluate if a i p a r a m can be a good estimate of a i s i m even if the whole period does not correspond to dry conditions both coefficients have been computed for each site in each field a i p a r a m was computed from the calibrated model parameters a i s i m by linear regression on simulations remember that 49 sites are available in each field the site of reference being removed this approach results in a comparison of 48 values for each field a i p a r a m appears to be a good approximation of a i s i m for both data sets shiraz2004 and mourvèdre2005 even if the weather conditions were not persistently dry fig 8 on condition that kcb and ttsw are stable over several years which happens if the vine grower does not significantly change any management practices in the vineyard and that climatic conditions are globally the same dominantly dry this implies that the linear relationship between simulated ψ values should be globally stable over the years and related to model parameters kcb and ttsw 3 4 impact of rainfall events on prediction quality in historical ψ data the wbm approach allows to better study the limitation of spider especially during and after a rainfall event or in case of irrigation it should be noted that studying these situations is difficult with an empirical approach such as spider since it would require performing a large number of measurements over limited periods of time the implementation of an approach based on a validated wbm under the conditions of the study allows a more detailed study this analysis was made numerically on the two datasets using the methodology presented in fig 9 by focusing on the ratio of simulation ψ dynamics for every t in the measurement period ψ i s i m t ψ r e f s i m t and on the regression coefficient a i s i m derived from the wbm based regression ψ ˆ i s i m t a i s i m ψ r e f s i m t the normalized distance di t between this ratio of simulated ψ and the regression coefficient was computed for each site i as is eq 9 9 d i t 1 a i s i m ψ i s i m t ψ r e f s i m t a i s i m finally in order to aggregate the results for all sites quantiles 10 90 of the di t distribution were computed they are studied as a function of time to see how the local linearity between ψ dynamics is broken by rainfall or irrigation events indeed the periods where the linear approximation works well resp poorly correspond to low resp high di t values another point of interest is to look for recovery periods after a rainfall or irrigation event after which ψ dynamics are again linearly correlated the assessment of the robustness of the linear approximation between ψ dynamics is presented in fig 10 the prediction using a linear regression model has been shown to be globally acceptable in fig 6 but it can be seen in fig 10 that rainfall alters the linearity of the relationship locally and that the interference is linked to the amount of rainfall the impact of rainfall events is however not uniform even for a same amount of water the heaviest rainfalls for example the 20 mm rainfall on shiraz2004 may not change the relationship for some sites while altering it for others on the other hand many small rainfall events those 5 mm do not change the quality of the linear prediction probably because the corresponding incoming water is evaporated very quickly however the main property stressed by fig 10 is the presence of a recovery time before regaining the previous quality of the linear model approximation including after the heaviest rainfalls the prediction using the linear model becomes accurate again after a certain time see for example the 20 mm rainfall on shiraz2004 and the decreasing of the error after this event this result is particularly significant and provides practical information for using an empirical approach like spider it shows that spider could still be applied even after rainfall events or irrigation after such events there is transitory period during which any extrapolation of water status values observed on the site of reference would lead to biased estimations however spider becomes relevant again after a certain period of time for these experimentations a period of 5 days would have been sufficient for most sites after a small rainfall event 15 mm while a period of 15 days would have been required for heavier rainfall 15 mm naturally further experiments will be necessary to validate this recommendation for its use on a larger scale 4 conclusion this paper analyses why the vine water status as characterized by predawn water potential values can be extrapolated from measurements on a single reference site using a linear regression model known as the spider approach to perform this analysis a water balance model running on a daily basis was used to provide daily estimates of predawn water potential values the model was calibrated and used on two datasets different vineyards different years with 49 sites of predawn leaf water potential measurements the use of the water balance model confirmed that predawn water potential values at any site can be estimated from observations performed on a reference site using a linear regression model linking the two dynamics with a low error level for persistent dry conditions occurring frequently in mediterranean vineyards the ratio of simulated predawn water potential values was shown to be simply linked to model parameters basal crop coefficient and total transpirable soil water indicating that the linear relationship between simulated water potential dynamics is stable over several years provided persistent dry conditions are dominant finally the robustness of the relationship to rainfall or irrigation events was analysed using the water balance model this demonstrated that the relationship between the simulated water potential dynamics is less predictive around a rainfall event but that its quality is recovered after a period of time if no other rain event occurs this study demonstrates the relevance of spatial extrapolation of the vine water status from a reference site with a linear regression model with new insights on the properties of the predictions this study confirms the interest of its application in viticulture either

11083,studies focusing on time space scaling issues have not yet established guidelines for choosing a time space scale for water resources management this study attempts to develop a methodology to understand the deviations induced by the scaling framework on water resource variables the study addresses eight variables streamflow groundwater level precipitation air temperature soil moisture solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for each variable a 10 year 2001 to 2010 daily time series data were retrieved from weather and hydrologic stations selected across oklahoma the methodology entailed three phases including a variable rescaling a probability analysis and a divergence quantification hence daily time series of the selected variables were rescaled to weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly scales to derive the probability density function of each variable a kernel density estimator was applied to the rescaled time series the kullback leibler divergence was used to evaluate the deviations pertaining to the time space scaling results showed meaningful divergences that were a consequence of time space scale variations however the sensitivity of variables to the scaling framework differed for instance air temperature was less sensitive to time space scaling while wind speed soil moisture and precipitation were highly sensitive correlation analysis showed that correlations tended to gradually increase with the increase in scale even though the strength of the relation varied depending on the variable involved the methodology was tested via a case study where data obtained from a location outside of the study region were used to address the scaling effect on the normalized difference vegetation index s response to precipitation and soil moisture it was concluded that understanding the divergences associated with time space scales was critical for interpreting results in water resource studies keywords time space variability scaling kernel density modelling kullback leibler divergence water resources management 1 introduction in water resource studies fine scale data e g daily hourly are often needed because they can be used to rescale or to achieve multiscale water resource assessments maurer et al 2007 however such datasets generally involve substantial funding time equipment tedium and labor downscaling techniques are often used as inexpensive ways to generate finer scale data koutsouris et al 2017 even though a variable like air temperature often shows a high downscaling capability schoof and pryor 2001 most of the techniques used for spatio temporal downscaling are associated with biases malone et al 2017 hence prior to choosing a specific time space scale in a water resources study an evaluation of all the constraints and their potential impact on the inferences is needed however statistical approaches for choosing time space scales are not sufficiently developed for water resources variables this is perhaps due to the paucity of guidelines on scale choices but often multiscale data are unavailable yet various time scales are often used somewhat arbitrarily the decision to use a specific time space scale induces bias several authors used water resources related variables e g surface air temperature precipitation soil moisture as inputs to quantify complex phenomena such as evapotranspiration olivera guerra et al 2017 and plant growth sohoulande and singh 2015 in these cases it is crucial to understand the bias associated with the input variables as it may impact interpretation perrette et al 2013 clark et al 2004 especially for water resources management knowing the types of bias induced by time space scales is important for quantifying the degradation of freshwater quality and quantity because the global distribution of water quantity and quality are uneven oki and kanae 2006 vörösmarty et al 2000 various mitigation strategies have been proposed worldwide pires et al 2017 simonovic 2017 these strategies are often based on probabilistic inferences and their effectiveness is dependent on an understanding of water resources dynamics in time and space medvigy et al 2009 wiens 1989 to date in water resources management probabilistic tools are often used in decision making at both field and watershed levels prada et al 2017 therefore it is important to determine the influence of time space scales on the probability distributions of water resource related variables in order to better respond to water crises clark et al 2004 the present study presents a method for quantifying the probabilistic divergence related to time space scaling the developed method uses kernel density qin et al 2011 and kullback leibler divergence polani 2013 kullback and leibler 1951 to determine the effect of time space scaling on statistical inferences involving water resources variables the objectives of the study therefore are to i develop a methodology for choosing a time space scale for water resource management ii clarify the probabilistic divergence induced by time space scales in water resource related variables and iii pinpoint the potential effect of time space scales on statistical inferences and applications in water resources management 2 data and method 2 1 data and study region to quantify the probabilistic divergences pertaining to the time space scaling of water resources related variables the study analyzed data collected at different locations across the state of oklahoma see fig 1 the assessed variables included streamflow groundwater level precipitation soil moisture 5 cm depth surface air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed streamflow and groundwater data were retrieved from the usgs database while the soil moisture and weather data were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet database mcpherson et al 2007 which provides quality soil moisture and weather measurements over several decades scott et al 2013 over the decade 2001 to 2010 daily time series were obtained from nine different stations including two groundwater stations two streamflow stations and five weather stations fig 1 shows the locations of stations across oklahoma and table 1 provides additional details the stations were selected based on data consistency and their spatial distribution five weather stations i e w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 were considered within the oklahoma mesonet network the streamflow stations are located on two different streams namely the north canadian river station s1 and the north fork red river station s2 likewise the groundwater wells belong to two different aquifer systems which are the arbuckle simpson station g1 and the high plains station g2 the study period 2001 2010 was considered based on time space data consistency at all the selected stations for this period all the stations had continuous daily records with minor gaps as the missing values were on average below 1 the missing values were filled using either the closest daily value for variables displaying high temporal autocorrelations i e streamflow groundwater soil moisture or the inverse distance weighted averages di luzio et al 2008 for variables with high spatial correlations i e precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation note the oklahoma mesonet network counts 120 stations widely distributed across the state and each of the selected weather station has several neighboring stations which data are correlated the daily time series were used as a basis for a scaling framework where the data were rescaled to generate weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly time series the rescaling technique averaged daily observations as a result daily time series can be easily compared with weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly time series the rescaled data were analyzed separately and for each variable and location the divergences due to the scaling were quantified probabilistically 2 2 methodology this study used a non parametric kernel density function to derive probability distributions and deviations caused by different scales were estimated using the kullback leibler divergence 2 2 1 kernel density estimator the kernel density function silverman 1986 was used to derive probability distributions of the eight different variables botev et al 2010 the kernel density provides a smooth representation of the real data distribution qin et al 2011 applying a gaussian kernel to the variables jann 2007 seaman and powell 1996 silverman 1986 this study estimated the density functions given the time series of a random variable x with n elements the corresponding kernel density estimator f ˆ was defined as 1 f ˆ x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h 2 k u 1 2 π e x p u 2 2 w i t h u x x i h 3 k u d u 1 4 f ˆ x d x 1 where h represents the band width or smoothing parameter n is the size of the time series xi is any value of the variable x within the range of the variation of x x denotes the center of any bin with h width and k is the gaussian kernel in the kernel density approach the choice of band width h is critical because it determines the degree of smoothness of the distribution silverman 1986 proposed a simple formula to identify the optimum band width hopt in the case of a gaussian kernel the formula proposed by silverman 1986 is a function of the series size n and its standard deviation σ as given by 5 h o p t 1 06 σ n 1 5 using the estimated density function of each variable the discrete probability values were derived by multiplying the kernel estimator value by the incremental bin value 2 2 2 kullback leibler divergence the kullback leibler divergence dkl also known as kullback leibler distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two probability distributions polani 2013 kullback and leibler 1951 dkl does not require any parametric assumption on variables cover and thomas 2006 two types of divergence were quantified in this study including the temporal divergence dkl and the spatial divergence d k l the values of dkl were estimated by coupling daily probability distributions with distributions corresponding to rescaled data i e weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly probability distributions hence for each variable the temporal divergences were evaluated in comparison with daily time scale data at station s1 for streamflow station g1 for groundwater station w1 for soil moisture and weather variables the spatial divergences d k l were evaluated between stations using monthly time scale thus the d k l values were estimated for the couples s1 s2 g1 g2 w1 w2 w1 w3 w1 w4 and w1 w5 the dkl and d k l values were computed using the discrete probability values derived from the kernel density functions given p the daily discrete probability distribution of a target variable x and q an alternate probability distribution of the same variable i e weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly or trimonthly probability distributions the temporal kullback leibler divergence dkl estimate was given by 6 d k l p q i 1 m p i log p i q i 7 i 1 m p i 1 i 1 m q i 1 in eqs 6 and 7 m is the number of discrete intervals defined within the range of the variable x p i and q i are respectively the discrete probability values associated with an interval i within the range of x for consistency the same number of bins m 100 was considered but the ranges depend on the variable the spatial kullback leibler divergence d k l was defined as 8 d k l p p i 1 m p i log p i p i 9 i 1 m p i 1 i 1 m p i 1 the formulation of both dkl and d k l is based on the same d k l is defined to measure the divergence between the probability distributions p and p of two different stations given the same variable x at a monthly time scale thus p i and p i are respectively the discrete probability values of each of the two stations given a bin i within the range of x 3 results the methodology was applied to the target variables the effect of scaling on the probability distributions and the implication on inferences in water resources were analyzed 3 1 scaling and kernel density estimation using the kernel density method the probability distributions of streamflow data from station s1 groundwater data from station g1 soil moisture and weather data from station w1 were assessed using different time scales including daily weekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly scales it is to note that the initial 10 year daily time series size changed as the data was rescaled from daily 3652 daily observations to weekly 522 weekly observations biweekly 261 biweekly observations monthly 120 monthly observations bimonthly 60 bimonthly observations trimonthly 40 trimonthly observations for the kernel density method seaman et al 1999 recommend a minimum sample size of 30 thus the data size used in this study allowed modelling up to a trimonthly time scale figs 2 and 3 show the effect of scaling on the kernel density distribution of each variable the optimal band widths estimated based on eq 7 are reported in table 2 note the band widths have the same units as the variables for each of the variables the changes caused by time scales were noticeable from the kernel density curves and disparities were notable depending on the variable for instance the scaling effect on relative humidity fig 3a and wind speed fig 3b seemed comparable as the distribution s peak tended to increase with increasing time scale likewise similarities can be seen between air temperature fig 3c and solar radiation fig 3d for which the kernel density distributions appeared bimodal however these visual resemblances can hardly be defined among the other four variables including precipitation fig 2a streamflow fig 2b soil moisture fig 2c and groundwater fig 2d in summary the kernel density analysis brought out critical signals of scaling interference in the distribution shapes of the variables shifts were noticeable as one moved from a fine to a larger time scale for some variables e g relative humidity wind speed the change was apparently expressed as a shift of the kurtosis peak while for other variables the changes seemed more complex to define the discrete probability values obtained from the kernel density were employed to determine the divergence pertaining to the temporal scaling framework 3 2 temporal divergence analysis the actual probability distributions of variables were diversely affected by time scales even though some resemblances were noted the kullback leibler divergence was applied to quantify the divergences pertaining to time scale changes table 3 shows the temporal divergence estimations since the kullback leibler divergence is unitless the values are comparable among variables hence based on the dkl values the scaling appeared to have more effect on wind speed dkl daily trimonthly 0 88 relative humidity dkl daily trimonthly 0 88 precipitation dkl daily trimonthly 0 24 and soil moisture dkl daily trimonthly 0 20 in contrast the air temperature was less sensitive to temporal scaling dkl daily trimonthly 0 01 these observations are concordant with figs 2 and 3 as one compares daily kernel density curves with trimonthly curves the large values of kullback leibler divergence reported in table 3 correspond to larger deviations i e gap between the kernel density curves displayed by figs 2 and 3 this finding supports the consistency of the methodology developed from an analytical point of view it is normal to suspect that changes affecting the data probability distributions are likely to influence inferences based on these data in water resources management probabilistic tools are often involved in decision making therefore it is important to understand how the time scale changes may affect statistical inferences to illustrate this point correlation analysis was done to evaluate the effect of time scale change on statistical relationships between variables fig 4 shows examples of correlation changes due to the time scales variation the patterns illustrated are relevant as they pinpoint the scaling effect on statistical relationships subsequently inferences made on correlation analysis may mislead interpretations unless the time scales used are emphasized 3 3 spatial divergence analysis the spatial divergences d k l were evaluated using the same time scale i e monthly at individual stations and the kernel density estimator corresponding to each variable was considered to obtain the discrete probabilities using m intervals defined within the range of the variable coupling the discrete probability distributions between stations the spatial divergence d k l was quantified tables 4 and 5 summarize the spatial divergence for each variable the pictorial changes are also reported to ease comparison the ranges of the variables were unit normalized changes of probability distribution curves are noticeable among the compared locations but the extent of these changes seems to depend on the type of variable amongst all the variables groundwater showed the most important spatial divergence d k l 0 18 this is probably due to the nature of the groundwater wells g1 and g2 which belong to two different aquifer systems see table 1 and fig 1 for details however the most interesting aspect of the result is probably noticed with the curves presenting the pictorial changes of solar radiation and air temperature as they tend to display similar shapes regardless of the locations the d k l values corresponding to these two variables are very low suggesting a minor spatial interference in the probabilistic behavior of the variables hence for air temperature and solar radiation the site specific probability distributions could be likened using the same parent model for soil moisture precipitation and wind speed the spatial divergences are noticeable from the pictorial distribution curves based on the d k l values and the pictorial distributions it clearly appears that the spatial variability interferes diversely in the probability distributions of the variables among all the variables air temperature and solar radiation showed only minor sensitivity to space scaling 3 4 case study the purpose of this case study was to evaluate the methodology on a different set of data outside the study region note the concept of time space scaling is transversal for earth science disciplines as most biophysical phenomena are dynamic in time and space white et al 2018 clark et al 2004 to describe these phenomena different categories of variables are often used in a multiscale context a variable such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is considered practical for monitoring land cover and water stress bauer et al 2015 sohoulande and singh 2015 hence the case study employed the methodology developed to address ndvi responses to precipitation and soil moisture the ndvi soil moisture 5 cm depth and precipitation data have been described by sohoulande et al 2015 who used the same data to address the large scale vegetation response to precipitation across the southwestern united states the ndvi data is a biweekly generated time series corresponding to a landsat s scene spanning approximately 170 km north southward and 185 km east westward centered at the latitude 31 75 n and longitude 100 58 w the target is located in texas and corresponds to the worldwide reference system 2 s path 29 and row 38 the data are processed and released for different vegetation covers at a biweekly time scale by the united states geological survey https eros usgs gov the case study only focused on the ndvi of two types of vegetation covers which are deciduous forest and grassland along with the vegetation index data soil moisture and precipitation data were obtained from stations encompassed by the target landsat s scene sohoulande and singh 2015 twenty three year 1989 to 2011 biweekly time series were considered then rescaled to 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 and 6 months time scales the probability distributions of the variables were approached using the kernel density modelling the scaling effect on the data was analyzed using the kullback leibler formulation the implication of the scaling framework on statistical inferences was examined using a correlation analysis of ndvi response to precipitation and soil moisture given different time scales fig 5 presents the curves of kernel density estimates which also portray the changes of probability distributions a consequence of scaling the kullback leibler divergence estimates are summarized in table 6 which shows that precipitation and soil moisture are highly affected by scaling but the kullback leibler divergence is much higher for precipitation than soil moisture in contrast the ndvi of both vegetation types deciduous forest grassland is less affected by the scale changes and the kullback leibler divergence values are relatively negligible meanwhile analysis of the scaling effect on ndvi response to precipitation and soil moisture seems to bring out a relevant paradigm indeed fig 6 shows a gradual increase of the correlation between ndvi and precipitation while the correlation between ndvi and soil moisture is likely stable as the time scale changes this contrast is concordant with the result reported by fig 4 which also highlights different effects of time space scaling on statistical inferences 4 synthesis and discussion the results revealed critical discrepancies among the probability distributions of rescaled data however the magnitudes of divergences differed depending on the variable for instance the distributions of wind speed relative humidity precipitation and temperature changed remarkably as the time scale changed in contrast the changes observed with air temperature seemed negligible as the scale changed interestingly the spatial divergence analysis also indicated a negligible scaling effect on the probability distribution of air temperature which appeared less sensitive to time space scaling this observation is likely to have critical implications in water resources in view of the important role of air temperature in evapotranspiration olivera guerra et al 2017 trajkovic 2005 for instance the fact that the time space scaling has a minor effect on the probability distribution of air temperature in a given region e g oklahoma could leverage the accuracy of atmospheric water demand estimate in opposite to air temperature wind speed relative humidity precipitation and soil moisture were found highly sensitive to time space scales therefore the inferences made using these variables would require more perspicacity to achieve wise water resources management regardless of the regional considerations involved in the study the outcomes highlighted seem consistent with conclusions drawn from previous studies related to water resources for instance schoof and pryor 2001 downscaled temperature and precipitation and concluded a high predictability of temperature in comparison to precipitation indeed this conclusion may be sustained by the low impact of time space scaling on the probability distribution of temperature thus there is a possibility to anticipate the high downscaling capability of temperature by just referring to the probabilistic divergences pertaining to time space scaling from this standpoint the methodology reported in this paper may be considered as a supporting tool to evaluate the probabilistic divergences pertaining to time space scaling and indirectly help choose appropriate scales however the method can also be used to improve input quality in water resources modelling for example olivera guerra et al 2017 reported a method of quantifying actual evapotranspiration using surface air temperature likewise sohoulande and singh 2015 reported a method to quantify plant growth using precipitation soil moisture and temperature for each of these methods a prior understanding of the scaling effect on the input variables is desirable as it may improve the interpretation of outcomes from correlation analyses in fig 4 it appears that scaling has a noticeable effect on statistical inferences indeed large scales tend to provide stronger statistical relationships e g higher correlations however the statistics seem either moderate or substantial depending on the variables involved this tendency is confirmed by the case study which evaluated the ndvi response to precipitation and soil moisture at different time scales i e 0 5 1 1 5 2 3 6 months the analyses were summarized by fig 6 which showed a gradual increase of correlation between ndvi and precipitation as the time scale changed at the same time the correlation between ndvi and soil moisture seemed moderate and visually stable as the time scale changed from a statistical perspective rescaling a variable is often associated with a loss of variance peleg et al 2018 sohoulande and singh 2016 this loss of variance is likely to affect the statistics involving the variables this is probably the explanation of the paradigm of correlation changes observed with the analyses in both figs 4 and 6 nevertheless the magnitudes of time space scaling on the probabilistic divergences of the variables are signals of the potential biases in statistical inferences 5 conclusion the key findings of the study are as follows water resource related variables are diversely affected by time space scaling air temperature is less sensitive to time space scaling wind speed relative humidity soil moisture and precipitation are much sensitive to time space scaling statistical inferences are moderately or highly affected by time space scales depending on the variables involved however the correlation values tend to increase with larger scales inferences made in water resources must emphasize the time space scales since for certain variables statistical correlations gradually change with scaling the methodology employed helped to understand potential divergences caused by time space scales on water resources variables upon data availability the method can be conveniently considered as a data appraisal tool in a situation where the time space scaling effect on statistical

11083,studies focusing on time space scaling issues have not yet established guidelines for choosing a time space scale for water resources management this study attempts to develop a methodology to understand the deviations induced by the scaling framework on water resource variables the study addresses eight variables streamflow groundwater level precipitation air temperature soil moisture solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for each variable a 10 year 2001 to 2010 daily time series data were retrieved from weather and hydrologic stations selected across oklahoma the methodology entailed three phases including a variable rescaling a probability analysis and a divergence quantification hence daily time series of the selected variables were rescaled to weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly scales to derive the probability density function of each variable a kernel density estimator was applied to the rescaled time series the kullback leibler divergence was used to evaluate the deviations pertaining to the time space scaling results showed meaningful divergences that were a consequence of time space scale variations however the sensitivity of variables to the scaling framework differed for instance air temperature was less sensitive to time space scaling while wind speed soil moisture and precipitation were highly sensitive correlation analysis showed that correlations tended to gradually increase with the increase in scale even though the strength of the relation varied depending on the variable involved the methodology was tested via a case study where data obtained from a location outside of the study region were used to address the scaling effect on the normalized difference vegetation index s response to precipitation and soil moisture it was concluded that understanding the divergences associated with time space scales was critical for interpreting results in water resource studies keywords time space variability scaling kernel density modelling kullback leibler divergence water resources management 1 introduction in water resource studies fine scale data e g daily hourly are often needed because they can be used to rescale or to achieve multiscale water resource assessments maurer et al 2007 however such datasets generally involve substantial funding time equipment tedium and labor downscaling techniques are often used as inexpensive ways to generate finer scale data koutsouris et al 2017 even though a variable like air temperature often shows a high downscaling capability schoof and pryor 2001 most of the techniques used for spatio temporal downscaling are associated with biases malone et al 2017 hence prior to choosing a specific time space scale in a water resources study an evaluation of all the constraints and their potential impact on the inferences is needed however statistical approaches for choosing time space scales are not sufficiently developed for water resources variables this is perhaps due to the paucity of guidelines on scale choices but often multiscale data are unavailable yet various time scales are often used somewhat arbitrarily the decision to use a specific time space scale induces bias several authors used water resources related variables e g surface air temperature precipitation soil moisture as inputs to quantify complex phenomena such as evapotranspiration olivera guerra et al 2017 and plant growth sohoulande and singh 2015 in these cases it is crucial to understand the bias associated with the input variables as it may impact interpretation perrette et al 2013 clark et al 2004 especially for water resources management knowing the types of bias induced by time space scales is important for quantifying the degradation of freshwater quality and quantity because the global distribution of water quantity and quality are uneven oki and kanae 2006 vörösmarty et al 2000 various mitigation strategies have been proposed worldwide pires et al 2017 simonovic 2017 these strategies are often based on probabilistic inferences and their effectiveness is dependent on an understanding of water resources dynamics in time and space medvigy et al 2009 wiens 1989 to date in water resources management probabilistic tools are often used in decision making at both field and watershed levels prada et al 2017 therefore it is important to determine the influence of time space scales on the probability distributions of water resource related variables in order to better respond to water crises clark et al 2004 the present study presents a method for quantifying the probabilistic divergence related to time space scaling the developed method uses kernel density qin et al 2011 and kullback leibler divergence polani 2013 kullback and leibler 1951 to determine the effect of time space scaling on statistical inferences involving water resources variables the objectives of the study therefore are to i develop a methodology for choosing a time space scale for water resource management ii clarify the probabilistic divergence induced by time space scales in water resource related variables and iii pinpoint the potential effect of time space scales on statistical inferences and applications in water resources management 2 data and method 2 1 data and study region to quantify the probabilistic divergences pertaining to the time space scaling of water resources related variables the study analyzed data collected at different locations across the state of oklahoma see fig 1 the assessed variables included streamflow groundwater level precipitation soil moisture 5 cm depth surface air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed streamflow and groundwater data were retrieved from the usgs database while the soil moisture and weather data were obtained from the oklahoma mesonet database mcpherson et al 2007 which provides quality soil moisture and weather measurements over several decades scott et al 2013 over the decade 2001 to 2010 daily time series were obtained from nine different stations including two groundwater stations two streamflow stations and five weather stations fig 1 shows the locations of stations across oklahoma and table 1 provides additional details the stations were selected based on data consistency and their spatial distribution five weather stations i e w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 were considered within the oklahoma mesonet network the streamflow stations are located on two different streams namely the north canadian river station s1 and the north fork red river station s2 likewise the groundwater wells belong to two different aquifer systems which are the arbuckle simpson station g1 and the high plains station g2 the study period 2001 2010 was considered based on time space data consistency at all the selected stations for this period all the stations had continuous daily records with minor gaps as the missing values were on average below 1 the missing values were filled using either the closest daily value for variables displaying high temporal autocorrelations i e streamflow groundwater soil moisture or the inverse distance weighted averages di luzio et al 2008 for variables with high spatial correlations i e precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation note the oklahoma mesonet network counts 120 stations widely distributed across the state and each of the selected weather station has several neighboring stations which data are correlated the daily time series were used as a basis for a scaling framework where the data were rescaled to generate weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly time series the rescaling technique averaged daily observations as a result daily time series can be easily compared with weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly time series the rescaled data were analyzed separately and for each variable and location the divergences due to the scaling were quantified probabilistically 2 2 methodology this study used a non parametric kernel density function to derive probability distributions and deviations caused by different scales were estimated using the kullback leibler divergence 2 2 1 kernel density estimator the kernel density function silverman 1986 was used to derive probability distributions of the eight different variables botev et al 2010 the kernel density provides a smooth representation of the real data distribution qin et al 2011 applying a gaussian kernel to the variables jann 2007 seaman and powell 1996 silverman 1986 this study estimated the density functions given the time series of a random variable x with n elements the corresponding kernel density estimator f ˆ was defined as 1 f ˆ x 1 n h i 1 n k x x i h 2 k u 1 2 π e x p u 2 2 w i t h u x x i h 3 k u d u 1 4 f ˆ x d x 1 where h represents the band width or smoothing parameter n is the size of the time series xi is any value of the variable x within the range of the variation of x x denotes the center of any bin with h width and k is the gaussian kernel in the kernel density approach the choice of band width h is critical because it determines the degree of smoothness of the distribution silverman 1986 proposed a simple formula to identify the optimum band width hopt in the case of a gaussian kernel the formula proposed by silverman 1986 is a function of the series size n and its standard deviation σ as given by 5 h o p t 1 06 σ n 1 5 using the estimated density function of each variable the discrete probability values were derived by multiplying the kernel estimator value by the incremental bin value 2 2 2 kullback leibler divergence the kullback leibler divergence dkl also known as kullback leibler distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two probability distributions polani 2013 kullback and leibler 1951 dkl does not require any parametric assumption on variables cover and thomas 2006 two types of divergence were quantified in this study including the temporal divergence dkl and the spatial divergence d k l the values of dkl were estimated by coupling daily probability distributions with distributions corresponding to rescaled data i e weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly probability distributions hence for each variable the temporal divergences were evaluated in comparison with daily time scale data at station s1 for streamflow station g1 for groundwater station w1 for soil moisture and weather variables the spatial divergences d k l were evaluated between stations using monthly time scale thus the d k l values were estimated for the couples s1 s2 g1 g2 w1 w2 w1 w3 w1 w4 and w1 w5 the dkl and d k l values were computed using the discrete probability values derived from the kernel density functions given p the daily discrete probability distribution of a target variable x and q an alternate probability distribution of the same variable i e weekly biweekly monthly bimonthly or trimonthly probability distributions the temporal kullback leibler divergence dkl estimate was given by 6 d k l p q i 1 m p i log p i q i 7 i 1 m p i 1 i 1 m q i 1 in eqs 6 and 7 m is the number of discrete intervals defined within the range of the variable x p i and q i are respectively the discrete probability values associated with an interval i within the range of x for consistency the same number of bins m 100 was considered but the ranges depend on the variable the spatial kullback leibler divergence d k l was defined as 8 d k l p p i 1 m p i log p i p i 9 i 1 m p i 1 i 1 m p i 1 the formulation of both dkl and d k l is based on the same d k l is defined to measure the divergence between the probability distributions p and p of two different stations given the same variable x at a monthly time scale thus p i and p i are respectively the discrete probability values of each of the two stations given a bin i within the range of x 3 results the methodology was applied to the target variables the effect of scaling on the probability distributions and the implication on inferences in water resources were analyzed 3 1 scaling and kernel density estimation using the kernel density method the probability distributions of streamflow data from station s1 groundwater data from station g1 soil moisture and weather data from station w1 were assessed using different time scales including daily weekly monthly bimonthly and trimonthly scales it is to note that the initial 10 year daily time series size changed as the data was rescaled from daily 3652 daily observations to weekly 522 weekly observations biweekly 261 biweekly observations monthly 120 monthly observations bimonthly 60 bimonthly observations trimonthly 40 trimonthly observations for the kernel density method seaman et al 1999 recommend a minimum sample size of 30 thus the data size used in this study allowed modelling up to a trimonthly time scale figs 2 and 3 show the effect of scaling on the kernel density distribution of each variable the optimal band widths estimated based on eq 7 are reported in table 2 note the band widths have the same units as the variables for each of the variables the changes caused by time scales were noticeable from the kernel density curves and disparities were notable depending on the variable for instance the scaling effect on relative

the efficiency of three irrigation methods sprinkler irrigation si surface drip irrigation sdi and flood irrigation fi under three irrigation schedules by irrigating while soil moisture decreased to 70 60 and 50 of the field capacity respectively it was found that irrigation methods with suitable irrigation scheduling indeed have the potential to balance the optimal yield and water use efficiency the results showed that irrigating 180 3 mm and 175 2 mm of water in the two studied seasons respectively was optimal to achieve the highest grain yield for sdi and si this could be achieved by irrigating six times each with 30 mm of water while for fi irrigating three times each with 60 mm of water gave comparable results our studies suggested that irrigating while soil moisture reduced to

ncp consuming most of irrigation water which is affected strongly by weather especially the amount and distribution of rainfall during wheat growth season for example xinxiang city located in the northern henan province and being a top producer of winter wheat in the ncp nbsc 2015 has a continental semi humid climate with average annual temperature of 14 6 and uneven seasonal precipitation with an annual average 1951 2014 of 582 mm studies by li et al 2005 and zhang et al 2003 found that 70 of total rainfall occurs from july to september and the average rainfall during winter wheat growth season from middle october to early june over the last 60 years was only 161 mm far less than the evapotranspiration demand of the wheat estimated to be about 450 mm liu et al 2002 to safeguard grain yield supplemental irrigation is thus required zhang et al 2003 2002 farmers in xinxiang usually irrigate winter wheat three to five times with an irrigation amount of 180 300 mm to meet its water requirement of 450 500 mm zhang et al 2002 however frequent irrigation could facilitate soil evaporation lv et al 2013 and excessive drainage from root zone chen et al 2014 wang et al 2012 found that drip irrigation di gave the highest crop water productivity by keeping soil water at 50 60 of the field capacity fc sprinkler irrigation has been widely studied for winter wheat using soil water balance and meteorological method schneider and howell 2001 but there is limited study on its comparison with other irrigations such as surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation a proper scheduling of sprinkler irrigation is critical for efficient water management particularly under water deficit condition pereira et al 2002 crops respond in various ways to soil water stress depending on timing duration and severity of its occurrence hsiao and bradford 1983 water use efficiency wue can be improved either by increasing the grain yield or reducing the evapotranspiration liu and kang 2006 showed that the wide use of sprinkler irrigation in ncp is due to its potential to improve wue and grain yield over the past decade however micro irrigation including surface drip irrigation has been adopted in field experiments for food crops as water shortage in ncp has been becoming increasingly severe wang et al 2008b drip irrigation is known to be the most efficient irrigation method saving water and reducing deep percolation compare to surface flood irrigation bucks and nakayama 1986 according to nbsc 2015 and fao 2015 agricultural land using new irrigation technologies and practices in china has been increasing gradually despite total irrigation areas having remained unchanged or even decreased slightly since 2006 the national irrigation area estimated by aquastat 2005 in china was approximately 16 less than the total area equipped with irrigation facilities because of inefficient irrigation management practices in this context both irrigation frequency and irrigation amount have important economic implications english 1990 most previous research focused on a single or two irrigation methods with or without considering irrigation scheduling for fruits or sparsely cultivated crops al qinna and abu awwad 1998 couto et al 2013 kharrou et al 2011 xue et al 2003 yu et al 2009 there is limited study on comparison of the three irrigation methods sprinkler surface drip and flood irrigation coupled with different irrigation scheduling for densely planted winter wheat to offer farmers in ncp a complete irrigation package the objectives of this study are to i study the growth and development of winter wheat under surface drip sprinkler and surface flood irrigation coupled with irrigation scheduling by irrigating while soil moisture decreased to 50 60 and 70 of fc ii evaluate the efficacy of the three irrigation methods based on their associated plant growth yield wue and iwue and iii identify feasible irrigation scheduling for winter wheat in the ncp the results will be helpful for both researchers and farmers in designing and implementing effective and environment friendly irrigation system improving agricultural water use efficiency and relieving the severe competition for limited agricultural water resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site the two season field experiment was conducted during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016

respectively and the ph and electrical conductivity of the same soil was 8 50 and 242 10 μs cm 1 respectively 2 2 cultivation the soil was plowed to 20 cm deep using tractor drawn disc plough and large soil clods were smoothen by a harrow to make a flatten seed bed prior to sowing basal fertilizers consisting of n 120 kg ha 1 50 of total n required in urea p 90 kg ha 1 in calcium superphosphate and k 30 kg ha 1 in potassium sulfate was applied to all treatments gao et al 2014 the remaining 50 of the 120 kg ha 1 n in urea was applied by spreading manually in sprinkler and surface flooding irrigation just before the first irrigation and by fertigation in the drip irrigation local winter wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar aikang 58 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 in a 20 cm row space by a tractor drawn seed cum fertilizer drill on 18th october in 2014 and on 15th october in 2015 all experimental plots were harvested on 6th june in 2015 and on 3rd june in 2016 2 3 experimental design the experiment consisted of two factors irrigation method and irrigation scheduling each factor having three levels all treatments were arranged based on the split plot design method the irrigation scheduling treatments were arranged in the main plots and the irrigation methods in the subplots each treatment having three replications experimental conditions in the two seasons were kept the same and all measurements were taken from the turn green early march stage to the harvest stage the detailed experimental design was main plots the three levels of the irrigation scheduling i irrigating when soil water content swc reduced to 50 of fc ii irrigating when swc reduced to 60 of fc iii irrigating when swc reduced to 70 of fc sub plots the three levels of the irrigation method i sprinkler irrigation si ii surface drip irrigation sdi iii flooding irrigation fi we will use shorthand s1 s2 and s3 for si d1 d2 and d3 for sdi and f1 f2 and f3 for fi method to start irrigation when swc decreased to 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively the irrigation amount of each irrigation in si and sdi was fixed at 30 mm and in fi was fixed at 60 mm minimal required to submerge the field not to result in deep percolation jha et al 2017 2 4 irrigation scheduling soil moisture content was measured weekly in situ using trime pico t3 iph44 imko germany to depth of 100 cm at 20 cm interval by inserting moisture measurement access tubes in each sub plot of all three replications additional swc was measured just before and after an irrigation or heavy rainfall event the irrigation scheduling was decided based on daily swc when the measured swc in each treatment was lower than the designed swc limit the plots were irrigated with the designed amount of water if the measured swc was still higher than the designed swc limit the next day s swc was predicted prior to the next measurement using the following method i estimation of crop water consumption 1 e t c e t o i k c i where etc is the accumulative water consumption by the crop in the ith day mm after the previous measurement etoi is the reference evapotranspiration in the ith day mm and estimated using the penman monteith equation as recommended by allen et al 1998 the weather data used in eq 1 were collected by an automatic weather station close to the experimental area kci is the crop coefficient in the ith day and determined from the relationship given in gao et al 2009 soil water balance equation was used to determine the daily swc for each treatment between two measurements as follows 2 swci swco pi ui dwi ri etc wsf 100 where swci is the mean soil water content in 0 100 cm soil profile on the ith day after previous measurement swco is the swc on the measuring day pi is the accumulative precipitation from the measuring day to the ith day mm u i is the accumulative upward movement of water from soil below 100 cm due to capillary rise mm dw i is the downward movement of water into soil deeper than 100 cm and r i is the surface runoff there were no runoff and no capillary rise occurred in all treatments and their associated values in the above equations were therefore neglected the downward movement of water into deep soil was estimated from the darcy s law gao et al 2010 kar et al 2007 wsf in the above equation is the water stored in 0 100 cm soil at field capacity irrigation was applied with designed amount when the predicted swc was lower than the designed swc limit the irrigation treatments were from the beginning of the re green stage to the end of harvest the irrigation schedule was determined according to the design by maintaining the swc at 70 of fc for s3 d3 and f3 at 60 of fc for s2 d2 and f2 and at 50 of fc for s1 d1 and f1 the irrigation scheduling and total irrigation amount in all treatments are given in table 2 precise water meter was connected to the inlet of each subplot to control the pre determined irrigation amount 30 mm for si and sdi and 60 mm for fi 2 5 sampling and measurement 2 5 1 root sampling the roots in each treatment ware measured from soil samples taken from the root zone each consisting of 10 cores taken from 100 cm soil profile from the surface at 10 cm intervals the samples were taken with a root auger internal ø 6 91 cm and outer ø 7 cm at the center line of rows at the flowering stage in both seasons the root length density rld was determined using the method described in lv et al 2010 and jha et al 2017 2 5 2 plant sampling the locations of plant sampling in each treatment were determined at the seeding stage and all successive samples were taken from these locations samples for grain yield straw yield and post harvest analysis were taken from 1 1 m2 area covering five rows and samples for tillers plant density plant height and leaf area index were taken from a rows of 1 m in length all sampling sites were chosen randomly bell and fischer 1994 and the two edge rows on each side of the plot border were excluded for destructive and non destructive sampling successive destructive sampling began at one end of the subplot after the first irrigation and moved toward to opposite end as the time elapsed an adequate buffer of 40 60 cm long was left between adjacent sampling points 2 5 3 plant growth and development the numbers of tillers were counted when they become visible above the ligules of the leaf where they formed the number of tillers along a row 1 m long was measured weekly from predetermined points and it was then converted to plant density using eq 3 plant height was measured from five randomly selected plants from the same plants for the above tillers measurement the plant height was measured from the ground surface to natural top of leaf at early stages and from the ground surface to the top of terminal spikelet excluding the awns at late stage above ground biomass and leaf area index lai were measured from 15 randomly selected destructive plant samples the sampled plants were then dried at 70 c for 24 h prior to weighting bell and fischer 1994 tavakoli et al 2014 to calculate the biomass using eq 5 leaf length l and the widest width w of each leaf of all 15 sampled plants were measured with a ruler and the lai was calculated using the method described in gao et al 2010 as given in eqs 5 and 6 3 p l a n t d e n s i t y p l a n t s m 2 t i l l e r s

6 l a i a n s where n n 15 is the number of plant sample used for calculating the leaf area a i is the leaf area of the ith plant m is the number of leaf in the ith plant lj and wj are the length and widest width of the jth leaf in the ith plant both measured in cm a was measured in m2 n is the number of plants tillers in a 1 m of row and s s 0 2 m is the row spacing 2 5 4 harvest and post harvest analysis the 1 m2 as described in section 2 5 3 for plant sampling was kept undisturbed until harvest and the harvested plants from it were carefully collected into a netted bag to study the post harvest parameters as shown in tables 4 and 5 the grain yield in non irrigated plot yck nearby the treatment plots was measured as 2 9 t ha and 2 26 t ha in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 crop seasons to estimate the irrigation water use efficiency iwue described in section 2 6 1 the non irrigated plot was not considered as the treatment plots because the parameters defined in this research were not studied except grain yield threshing and winnowing the harvested plants were done manually and the clean grains were dried under sunshine until the grain moisture reached 12 gao et al 2014 the harvest index hi was calculated as follows described in ali et al 2007 7 h i g r a i n y i e l d t h a g r a i n y i e l d t h a s t r a w y i e l d t h a 2 6 irrigation methods and their evaluation 2 6 1 irrigation water usage the irrigation methods were evaluated based on the use of the irrigation water by crop which was estimated as crop water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue following li et al 2005 likewise the crop water uptake and input ratio wuir was estimated to check how efficiently root water uptake was responded to input water irrigation plus precipitation 8 w u e y e t 9 i w u e δ y i y i r y c k i 10 w u i r c r o p w a t e r u s e i p 100 where wue and iwue were measured in kg m 3 and wuir in percentage y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et measured in m3 ha 1 is the evapotranspiration during a growing season δy is the grain yield increment due to irrigation measured by yir yck in which yir and yck are the grain yield measured in irrigated and non irrigated treatment respectively and both expressed in kg ha 1 p is the total precipitation from showing to harvest and i is the total irrigation amount in each treatments both measured in m3 ha 1 the crop water use was estimated as described in section 2 7 and the estimated value is presented in table 3 2 6 2 marginal productivity of irrigation water the term marginal productivity is useful in agricultural economics to determine the economic contribution of each input in producing farm products and provides an idea to offer the farmer the economically right dose of input use for obtaining optimum output ali et al 2007 chandrakanth 2015 it is defined as the ratio of return of every input to the output when other inputs were kept the same technically the marginal productivity of irrigation water m p i r is a useful indicator when water resources become limited and is calculated as follows 10 m p i r δ y δ i r where m p i r was in kg ha 1 cm 1 δy was the relative change in crop yield kg ha 1 and δir was the difference in irrigation amount cm 2 7 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova for two factors with replication in spss was used to determine the statistical significance of irrigation methods and irrigation schedulings all treatments were compared based on statistical significance using the least significant difference lsd test and the duncan s multiple new range test dmrt at 5 α 0 05 significance level the root length density was measured using the winrhizo reg 2007d regent instrument inc software and was then used as an input parameter in hydrus 1d version 4 17 software to calculate the water use by crop 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation amount and water consumption by crop the first irrigation was at the re greening stage starting at the same date for all plots with the soil moisture in each treatment controlled at the designed level table 2 it was found that maintaining swc at 50 to 70 of fc needed to increase the irrigation amount by 133 and 167 in si for the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 season respectively whereas by 100 in sdi and fi for the two seasons crop water consumption table 3 showed that the maximum irrigation amount of 288 mm and 293 mm in f3 with total irrigation amount of 240 mm and the minimum amount of 190 mm and 196 mm in the s1 treatment with total irrigation amount of 90 mm in 2015 and 2016 season respectively the ratio of water uptake by roots to water input i e wuir in d1 d2 and d3 compare to f3 increased by 20 9 13 and 9 4 in 2014 2015 and by 24 8 31 8 and 17 9 in 2015 2016 respectively similarly wuir in s1 s2 and s3 compare to f3 increased by 9 4 3 0 and 3 4 in 2014 2015 and by 14 7 12 9 and 4 5 in 2015 2016 in f1 and f2 wuir increased by 21 1 and 5 7 in 2014 2015 and by 13 9 and 10 2 in 2015 2016 respectively as compared to f3 these results showed that prolonging irrigation duration with slow irrigation rate can boost irrigation water uptake by the crop irrigation method also played a vital role in root water uptake the shallow wetting soil zone associated in si and sdi due to their low irrigation rate was beneficial to root uptake of the irrigation water compared to surface flooding because roots are denser in the top soil thereby extracting more water from the upper root zone as reported in gaiser et al 2012 al qinna and abu awwad 1998 alluded that slow irrigation rate increased soil water storage which could be one of reason for the increased root water uptake in low irrigation treatment 3 2 crop growth and development the number of tillers under fi increased rapidly after the first irrigation fig 2 a but did not continue longer because of the prolonged irrigation interval compared to si and sdi whereas a steady increase in tiller number was found in si and sdi under the same irrigation level the number of tillers increased with irrigation frequency plant height reached maximum at the flowering stages and then remained approximately unchanged thereafter fig 2b the plant grew at 70 of fc was faster than at 60 and 50 of fc a uniform growth rate in plant height was observed for irrigation at 60 of fc in all irrigation methods especially in sdi because of an improved water availability and aeration in the soil bhunia et al 2015 the weekly measured leaf area index lai from the first irrigation to the grain filling stage in the two seasons is shown in fig 3 a and 3 b respectively high irrigation level 70 of fc under fi attained the highest lai in both seasons however the temporal change in lai was similar in all nine treatments in the two seasons low irrigation frequency reduced lai due to water stress experienced by the plant as described in kharrou et al 2011 liu et al 2011 also found that the lai was negatively responded to irrigation less than 50 of et under sprinkler irrigation 3 3 crop yield 3 3 1 effective and non effective tillers the effective tillers are when the panicle contains filled spikes the number of effective tillers per square meter differed significantly α 0 01 between irrigation scheduling in both seasons the differences between irrigation methods was significant α 0 05 in 2015 2016 and insignificant in 2014 2015 table 4 the maximum effective tillers number in d2 was 774 tillers m 2 and 726 tillers m 2 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the minimum effective tiller number in 2014 2015 was 681tillers m 2 under f1 and in 2015 2016 was460 tillers m 2 under s1 the number of non effective tillers was found significantly lower at 60 of fc this corroborates with previous research which showed that the effective tillers number increased with irrigation frequency ali et al 2007 low effective tiller number and high non effective tiller number under low irrigation level 50 of fc were caused by long irrigation interval making plant suffer from water stress in contrast high level irrigation made the crop produce tillers for a longer period delaying the time it reaches the maturity level and thereby failing to compete for nutrient in soil at flowering stage resulting in a reduction in grain filling 3 3 2 spikes and kernels filling filled spikelet unfilled spikelet and the number of kernels per panicle all varied significantly at 1 level between irrigation scheduling except for the unfilled spikelet in 2014 2015 table 4 the irrigation methods also had significant differences at 5 level on these yield components except for the unfilled spikelet per panicle in 2014 2015 the filled spikelet and kernels per panicle showed highest under d3 17 27 spikes and d2 36 13 kernels respectively in 2014 2015 and under d2 20 2 for spikes and 45 23 for kernels in 2015 2016 the f1 yielded the lowest spikes and kernels 15 9 spikes and 31 13 kernels in 2014 2015 while s1 gave the lowest spikes and kernels 16 37 spikes and 32 17 kernels in 2015 2016 similar results were found in bhunia et al 2015 where they alluded that the yield attributes such as ear length effective tillers grain per panicle and test weight increased with an increase in the limit soil moisture for irrigation thus the increases in number of filled spikelet and the number of grains per panicle with lower number of unfilled spikelet per panicle ranked in order of d2 s2 d3 f2 s3 etc showed that irrigating at 60 of fc may create a good soil environment to improve yield traits those components did not decrease drastically when starting irrigation at 70 of fc but the associated components decreased under water stress especially water stress occurring between flowering stage and maturity stage occurrence of a water stress at milking stage made plants more susceptible to diseases attack and weaker in grain filling increasing the number of unfilled spikelet at 50 of fc in all irrigation methods 3 3 3 kernel weight the kernel weight test weight was taken from 1000 kernels there was no significant difference in the kernel weight between different irrigation methods table 4 but significant difference between at α 0 01 irrigation scheduling was found in both seasons the maximum kernel weight in 2014 2015 was under d2 49 89 g followed by d3 49 55 g and in 2015 2016 it was under d3 47 87 g followed by s3 47 65 g the lowest test weight in 2014 2015 and 015 2016 was 43 54 g and 41 81 g respectively under s1 in 2015 2016 for all irrigation methods the test weight was found to increase with irrigation level showed significant difference between 50 and 70 but no difference between 50 and 60 or 60 and 70 irrigation level the kernel weight increased if the irrigation frequency increased from heading to grain maturity stages 3 4 grain yield the most important objective of this study was to determine the appropriate irrigation method and scheduling to increase grain yield y per unit of irrigated water the grain yield calculated at harvest from each treatment is given in table 5 statistical analysis shows that irrigation methods had significant effect on y in both 2014 2015 α 0 05 and 2015 2016 α 0 01 whereas the irrigation scheduling influenced the wheat production significantly in both seasons at α 0 01 the mean variation of y was 1 27 t ha 1 and 1 53 t ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the maximum y in 2014 2015 was 9 53 t ha 1 and it was 9 01 t ha 1 in 2015 2016 both found under d2 the minimum y in 2014 2015 was 8 26 t ha 1 under f1 and in 2015 2016 it was 7 48 t h 1 under s1 this yield gap supports the potential yield simulated by lu and fan 2013 where the potential yield of winter wheat was 9 1 t h 1 with a yield gap of 2 7 t h 1 for ncp the irrigation practices with sdi method found to be superior to si and fi methods irrigating as soon as the swc drop to 60 of fc has proven the best irrigation scheduling to achieve the maximum yield in all irrigation methods irrigating at 70 of fc significantly increased y compared to irrigating at 50 of fc but was less productive in yield than irrigating at 60 of fc this maybe because of excessive water stress occurred for irrigating at 50 of fc whereas irrigating at 70 of fc had shown the ill effects of irrigation showing that irrigation at 60 of fc is more favorable condition for irrigating winter wheat at ncp english and nakamura 1989 hendawy and hokam 2007 and kang et al 2002 had also mentioned that different irrigation levels significantly affected grain yield but did not produce the highest yield with high irrigation frequency nor mitigate the effects of water deficit regression analysis of the grain yield against seasonal irrigation amount i is well described by the following function and the comparative results are shown in fig 4 y15 0 00011 i2 0 0397 i 5 56 r2 0 70 define y for 2014 2015 y16 0 00012 i2 0 0421 i 4 92 r2 0 60 define y for 2015 2016 maximizing these functions y i 0 provides evidence that irrigating with 180 3 mm and 175 2 mm of water achieves the highest grain yield in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively liu et al 2011 also showed that irrigating 185 mm and 186 mm of water in first and second season in their experiment respectively obtained the optimal grain yield with sprinkler irrigation it can thus be concluded that irrigating six times each by 30 mm with sdi and si or three times each by 60 mm with fi achieves the maximum grain yield 3 5 straw yield straw yield sy measured from the harvested samples is given in table 5 the results show that both irrigation method and irrigation scheduling have significant effects on sy statistically no significant difference between sy was found for fi and si under the same swc both producing more sy than the sdi under the same irrigation level in 2015 2016 maximum sy in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 9 23 t ha 1 and 9 01 t ha 1 respectively both achieved under f3 sy under s3 in the two seasons was 8 68 t ha 1 and 8 61 t ha 1 respectively highest after f3 irrigating at 50 of fc drastically reduced sy to 7 26 t ha 1 and 5 69 t ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively under d1 the relationship between the straw yield and the irrigation amount can be described by the following equations and their comparisons are shown in fig 4 sy15 0 01 i 6 68 r2 0 89 define sy for 2014 2015 season sy16 0 019 i 4 27 r2 0 95 defined sy for 2015 2016 season the straw yield increased linearly with the irrigation amount comparing the straw yield data in table 5 with lai data in fig 3 revealed that the reduced vegetative growth at all crop development stages was the main reason of the decreased in straw yield for the treatments scheduled to irrigate at 50 of fc thus reducing irrigation frequency when plant was under water stress may reduce straw yield as compared to treatments with high irrigation frequency and high soil water content kang et al 2002 3 6 harvest index the harvest index hi is defined as the ratio of grain yield y to above ground biomass which varied from the highest 53 6 under d2 followed by d1 53 3 to the lowest 49 3 under f3 in 2014 2015 season in 2015 2016 hi varied from the highest 57 8 under d1 followed by d2 57 3 to the lowest 46 5 under f3 table 5 the hi obtained from si and sdi does not show significant difference in 2014 2015 but significant difference in hi was found between both irrigation method and irrigation scheduling in 2015 2016 overall higher hi under sdi was found for both seasons representing better crop development plant reproduction and yield in terms of crop reproductive functions blum 2009 the results in 2015 2016 show that the hi decreases consistently with increasing irrigation amount coinciding with the results of zhang et al 2010 who suggested that the hi of winter wheat under limited irrigation in ncp was 2 4 higher than that under non limited or less limited irrigation kang et al 2002 found that hi varied from 0 25 to 0 45 under different irrigation methods smaller to what we found in this study 3 7 irrigation water utilization 3 7 1 effectiveness of irrigation the maximum wue in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was estimated to be 2 08 kg m 3 and 1 91 kg m 3 under d2 followed by 2 05 kg m 3 and 1 81 kg m 3 under s2 respectively table 6 the statistical analysis shows that irrigating at 60 of fc give a significantly α 0 01 higher wue for all irrigation methods with sdi being the most effective followed by si under the same level of irrigation scheduling lv et al 2013 and wang et al 2015 found similar wue hanging from 1 70 to 4 20 kg m 3 and 1 91 to 2 06 kg m 3 respectively in their studies the relationship between wue and irrigation amount is shown in fig 5 and can be described by the following equations wue15 0 000018 i2 0 0056 i 1 58 r2 0 40 define wue for 2014 2015 wue16 0 000019 i2 0 0055 i 1 39 r2 0 53 define wue for 2015 2016 fig 5 shows that the wue increased with irrigation amount up to a certain level followed by a decline similar to that found in hendawy and hokam 2007 for drip irrigation maximizing the quadratic function w u e i 0 shows that irrigating 156 mm and 144 mm of water was optimal in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively to obtain the highest wue from table 6 it can be concluded that irrigating five times each by 30 mm under sdi and si or irrigating no more than three times each by 60 mm under fi gives the highest wue indicating that higher wue can be achieved by irrigation scheduling of 60 of fc in all three irrigation methods the results showed a negative linear relationship between irrigation water use efficiency iwue and irrigation amount fig 5 as described by the following equations iwue15 0 023 i 7 87 r2 0 94 for 2014 2015 iwue16 0 024 i 7 98 r2 0 93 for 2015 2016 these equations show that increasing irrigation amount leads to a linear decrease in iwue fig 5 consistent with the relationship found by li et al 2005 the maximum iwue in 2014 2015 was 6 16 kg m 3 under s1 followed by 5 98 kg m 3 under d1 whereas in 2015 2016 it was 6 17 kg m 3 under d1 followed by 5 8 kg m 3 under s1 the lowest iwue was 2 54 kg m 3 and 2 33 kg m 3 under f3 for the two seasons respectively table 6 these result showed that irrigation water can be utilized more efficiently under low irrigation levels ali et al 2007 found increased irrigation water productivity iwp under water deficit irrigation comparing to fi in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 and under irrigation level of 50 60 and 70 of fc sdi increased iwue by 33 9 and 67 7 29 and 79 9 and 41 6 and 51 8 whereas si increased iwue by 37 9 and 30 7 22 7 and 32 9 and 16 9 and 2 7 respectively thus in terms of iwue it could be concluded that irrigating with sdi could improve irrigation water used by crop efficiently compare to si and fi 3 7 2 marginal productivity of irrigation water mpir local farmers usually irrigate the winter wheat 3 5 times with a total irrigation amount of 180 300 mm using surface flood irrigation zhang et al 2002 tables 2 and 3 showed that f3 is irrigation practice using by the farmers to evaluate mpir of all irrigation methods f3 was thus taken as a conventional and we compared its mpir with other treatments as shown in table 6 low irrigation scheduling comparatively showed small mpir for example 24 11 kg ha 1 cm 1 under s1 4 28 kg ha 1 cm 1 under d1 and 25 82 kg ha 1 cm 1 under f1 in 2015 2016 and mpir found increasing with the application of more irrigation amount in both seasons increase in mpir with irrigation scheduling s3 and d3 implicates that increasing irrigation amount does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in grain yield 3 7 3 effects on water saving and grain yield increase the effects of fi sdi and si in water conservation and increasing grain yield are shown in table 6 compare with the locally used irrigation method fi sdi saved 25 17 and 25 of irrigation water in 2014 2015 and 25 33 and 25 in 2015 2016 while increased grain yield by 0 3 5 1 and 4 2 in 2014 2015 and 16 7 14 2 and 9 8 in 2015 2016 at irrigation level of 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively similarly si saved 25 17 and 13 of irrigation water in 2014 2015 and 25 17 and 0 of irrigation water in 2015 2016 increasing grain yield by 2 2 1 5 and 1 5 in 2014 2015 and 1 3 7 7 and 1 9 in 2015 2016 at the swc level of 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively the results show that sdi not only saved irrigation water but also increased grain yield under the same irrigation level compared to fi and si a similar result was also found in kharrou et al 2011 that drip irrigation could save 20 irrigation water compared to surface irrigation irrigation frequency has important economic implications the cost of irrigation yield and the irrigation efficiencies were all affected by irrigation amount english and nakamura 1989 4 conclusion the total water used by winter wheat and the ratio of irrigation water to the total water consumed by the wheat under different irrigation methods and scheduling all increase with increasing irrigation water applied it was concluded that the optimal irrigation scheduling and irrigation method should assure irrigation to be 144 mm 180 3 mm so as to keep both grain yield and water use efficiency at high levels in ncp irrigating at moderate soil water content with low irrigation amount under surface drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation not only optimizes water use but also boosts the use of soil water and precipitation thereby increasing yield and water use efficiency this study recommends surface drip irrigation for winter wheat in the north china plain irrigating 30 mm of water whenever the soil water content reduces to 60 of the field capacity this is the best combination for achieving maximum yield and water use efficiency as well as giving satisfactory irrigation water use efficiency if surface drip irrigation is not available we suggest using sprinkler irrigation irrigating with 30 mm of water or with flood irrigation with 60 mm of water when soil water content drops to 60 of field capacity acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the

11084,the knowledge of suitable irrigation methods coupled with effective irrigation scheduling to improve agricultural water use efficiency has become increasingly necessary for farmers in the north china plain to ameliorate the severe water shortage that has threatened winter wheat triticum aestivum l production a two season field experiment was conducted in a winter wheat field amide to compare the efficiency of three irrigation methods sprinkler irrigation si surface drip irrigation sdi and flood irrigation fi under three irrigation schedules by irrigating while soil moisture decreased to 70 60 and 50 of the field capacity respectively it was found that irrigation methods with suitable irrigation scheduling indeed have the potential to balance the optimal yield and water use efficiency the results showed that irrigating 180 3 mm and 175 2 mm of water in the two studied seasons respectively was optimal to achieve the highest grain yield for sdi and si this could be achieved by irrigating six times each with 30 mm of water while for fi irrigating three times each with 60 mm of water gave comparable results our studies suggested that irrigating while soil moisture reduced to 60 of the field capacity by sdi was the best in all aspects compared with other irrigation methods and irrigation schedules keywords surface drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation flood irrigation plant growth grain yield water use efficiency 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is the most important agricultural region in china but severe water shortage in it has threatened both rural income growth and food security li 2005 wang 2017 the drought index projected by song and zhao 2012 showed that the drought is likely to deteriorate in the coming 10 30 years the extensive use of groundwater for irrigation has resulted in groundwater table dropping continuously over the past four decades compromising both hydrological balance and sustainable agricultural production kendy et al 2004 wang et al 2008a the study of li et al 2005 showed that more than 70 of agricultural water was used for irrigating winter wheat developing feasible irrigation method and efficient irrigation scheduling to improve irrigation water use efficiency is essential to secure physiological development of crop and their ultimate yields du et al 2015 winter wheat is one of the two most important staple crops in ncp consuming most of irrigation water which is affected strongly by weather especially the amount and distribution of rainfall during wheat growth season for example xinxiang city located in the northern henan province and being a top producer of winter wheat in the ncp nbsc 2015 has a continental semi humid climate with average annual temperature of 14 6 and uneven seasonal precipitation with an annual average 1951 2014 of 582 mm studies by li et al 2005 and zhang et al 2003 found that 70 of total rainfall occurs from july to september and the average rainfall during winter wheat growth season from middle october to early june over the last 60 years was only 161 mm far less than the evapotranspiration demand of the wheat estimated to be about 450 mm liu et al 2002 to safeguard grain yield supplemental irrigation is thus required zhang et al 2003 2002 farmers in xinxiang usually irrigate winter wheat three to five times with an irrigation amount of 180 300 mm to meet its water requirement of 450 500 mm zhang et al 2002 however frequent irrigation could facilitate soil evaporation lv et al 2013 and excessive drainage from root zone chen et al 2014 wang et al 2012 found that drip irrigation di gave the highest crop water productivity by keeping soil water at 50 60 of the field capacity fc sprinkler irrigation has been widely studied for winter wheat using soil water balance and meteorological method schneider and howell 2001 but there is limited study on its comparison with other irrigations such as surface drip irrigation and surface flood irrigation a proper scheduling of sprinkler irrigation is critical for efficient water management particularly under water deficit condition pereira et al 2002 crops respond in various ways to soil water stress depending on timing duration and severity of its occurrence hsiao and bradford 1983 water use efficiency wue can be improved either by increasing the grain yield or reducing the evapotranspiration liu and kang 2006 showed that the wide use of sprinkler irrigation in ncp is due to its potential to improve wue and grain yield over the past decade however micro irrigation including surface drip irrigation has been adopted in field experiments for food crops as water shortage in ncp has been becoming increasingly severe wang et al 2008b drip irrigation is known to be the most efficient irrigation method saving water and reducing deep percolation compare to surface flood irrigation bucks and nakayama 1986 according to nbsc 2015 and fao 2015 agricultural land using new irrigation technologies and practices in china has been increasing gradually despite total irrigation areas having remained unchanged or even decreased slightly since 2006 the national irrigation area estimated by aquastat 2005 in china was approximately 16 less than the total area equipped with irrigation facilities because of inefficient irrigation management practices in this context both irrigation frequency and irrigation amount have important economic implications english 1990 most previous research focused on a single or two irrigation methods with or without considering irrigation scheduling for fruits or sparsely cultivated crops al qinna and abu awwad 1998 couto et al 2013 kharrou et al 2011 xue et al 2003 yu et al 2009 there is limited study on comparison of the three irrigation methods sprinkler surface drip and flood irrigation coupled with different irrigation scheduling for densely planted winter wheat to offer farmers in ncp a complete irrigation package the objectives of this study are to i study the growth and development of winter wheat under surface drip sprinkler and surface flood irrigation coupled with irrigation scheduling by irrigating while soil moisture decreased to 50 60 and 70 of fc ii evaluate the efficacy of the three irrigation methods based on their associated plant growth yield wue and iwue and iii identify feasible irrigation scheduling for winter wheat in the ncp the results will be helpful for both researchers and farmers in designing and implementing effective and environment friendly irrigation system improving agricultural water use efficiency and relieving the severe competition for limited agricultural water resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 the experimental site the two season field experiment was conducted during 2014 2015 and 2015 2016

respectively and the ph and electrical conductivity of the same soil was 8 50 and 242 10 μs cm 1 respectively 2 2 cultivation the soil was plowed to 20 cm deep using tractor drawn disc plough and large soil clods were smoothen by a harrow to make a flatten seed bed prior to sowing basal fertilizers consisting of n 120 kg ha 1 50 of total n required in urea p 90 kg ha 1 in calcium superphosphate and k 30 kg ha 1 in potassium sulfate was applied to all treatments gao et al 2014 the remaining 50 of the 120 kg ha 1 n in urea was applied by spreading manually in sprinkler and surface flooding irrigation just before the first irrigation and by fertigation in the drip irrigation local winter wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar aikang 58 was sown at 180 kg ha 1 in a 20 cm row space by a tractor drawn seed cum fertilizer drill on 18th october in 2014 and on 15th october in 2015 all experimental plots were harvested on 6th june in 2015 and on 3rd june in 2016 2 3 experimental design the experiment consisted of two factors irrigation method and irrigation scheduling each factor having three levels all treatments were arranged based on the split plot design method the irrigation scheduling treatments were arranged in the main plots and the irrigation methods in the subplots each treatment having three replications experimental conditions in the two seasons were kept the same and all measurements were taken from the turn green early march stage to the harvest stage the detailed experimental design was main plots the three levels of the irrigation scheduling i irrigating when soil water content swc reduced to 50 of fc ii irrigating when swc reduced to 60 of fc iii irrigating when swc reduced to 70 of fc sub plots the three levels of the irrigation method i sprinkler irrigation si ii surface drip irrigation sdi iii flooding irrigation fi we will use shorthand s1 s2 and s3 for si d1 d2 and d3 for sdi and f1 f2 and f3 for fi method to start irrigation when swc decreased to 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively the irrigation amount of each irrigation in si and sdi was fixed at 30 mm and in fi was fixed at 60 mm minimal required to submerge the field not to result in deep percolation jha et al 2017 2 4 irrigation scheduling soil moisture content was measured weekly in situ using trime pico t3 iph44 imko germany to depth of 100 cm at 20 cm interval by inserting moisture measurement access tubes in each sub plot of all three replications additional swc was measured just before and after an irrigation or heavy rainfall event the irrigation scheduling was decided based on daily swc when the measured swc in each treatment was lower than the designed swc limit the plots were irrigated with the designed amount of water if the measured swc was still higher than the designed swc limit the next day s swc was predicted prior to the next measurement using the following method i estimation of crop water consumption 1 e t c e t o i k c i where etc is the accumulative water consumption by the crop in the ith day mm after the previous measurement etoi is the reference evapotranspiration in the ith day mm and estimated using the penman monteith equation as recommended by allen et al 1998 the weather data used in eq 1 were collected by an automatic weather station close to the experimental area kci is the crop coefficient in the ith day and determined from the relationship given in gao et al 2009 soil water balance equation was used to determine the daily swc for each treatment between two measurements as follows 2 swci

deeper than 100 cm and r i is the surface runoff there were no runoff and no capillary rise occurred in all treatments and their associated values in the above equations were therefore neglected the downward movement of water into deep soil was estimated from the darcy s law gao et al 2010 kar et al 2007 wsf in the above equation is the water stored in 0 100 cm soil at field capacity irrigation was applied with designed amount when the predicted swc was lower than the designed swc limit the irrigation treatments were from the beginning of the re green stage to the end of harvest the irrigation schedule was determined according to the design by maintaining the swc at 70 of fc for s3 d3 and f3 at 60 of fc for s2 d2 and f2 and at 50 of fc for s1 d1 and f1 the irrigation scheduling and total irrigation amount in all treatments are given in table 2 precise water meter was connected to the inlet of each subplot to control the pre determined irrigation amount 30 mm for si and sdi and 60 mm for fi 2 5 sampling and measurement 2 5 1 root sampling the roots in each treatment ware measured from soil samples taken from the root zone each consisting of 10 cores taken from 100 cm soil profile from the surface at 10 cm intervals the samples were taken with a root auger internal ø 6 91 cm and outer ø 7 cm at the center line of rows at the flowering stage in both seasons the root length density rld was determined using the method described in lv et al 2010 and jha et al 2017 2 5 2 plant sampling the locations of plant sampling in each treatment were determined at the seeding stage and all successive samples were taken from these locations samples for grain yield straw yield and post harvest analysis were taken from 1 1 m2 area covering five rows and samples for tillers plant density plant height and leaf area index were taken from a rows of 1 m in length all sampling sites were chosen randomly bell and fischer 1994 and the two edge rows on each side of the plot border were excluded for destructive and non destructive sampling successive destructive sampling began at one end of the subplot after the first irrigation and moved toward to opposite end as the time elapsed an adequate buffer of 40 60 cm long was left between adjacent sampling points 2 5 3 plant growth and development the numbers of tillers were counted when they become visible above the ligules of the leaf where they formed the number of tillers along a row 1 m long was measured weekly from predetermined points and it was then converted to plant density using eq 3 plant height was measured from five randomly selected plants from the same plants for the above tillers measurement the plant height was measured from the ground surface to natural top of leaf at early stages and from the ground surface to the top of terminal spikelet excluding the awns at late stage above ground biomass and leaf area index lai were measured from 15 randomly selected destructive plant samples the sampled plants were then dried at 70 c for 24 h prior to weighting bell and fischer 1994 tavakoli et al 2014 to calculate the biomass using eq 5 leaf length l and the widest width w of each leaf of all 15 sampled plants were measured with a ruler and the lai was calculated using the method described in gao et al 2010 as given in eqs 5 and 6 3 p l a n t d e n s i t y p l a n t s m 2 t i l l e r s

6 l a i a n s where n n 15 is the number of plant sample used for calculating the leaf area a i is the leaf area of the ith plant m is the number of leaf in the ith plant lj and wj are the length and widest width of the jth leaf in the ith plant both measured in cm a was measured in m2 n is the number of plants tillers in a 1 m of row and s s 0 2 m is the row spacing 2 5 4 harvest and post harvest analysis the 1 m2 as described in section 2 5 3 for plant sampling was kept undisturbed until harvest and the harvested plants from it were carefully collected into a netted bag to study the post harvest parameters as shown in tables 4 and 5 the grain yield in non irrigated plot yck nearby the treatment plots was measured as 2 9 t ha and 2 26 t ha in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 crop seasons to estimate the irrigation water use efficiency iwue described in section 2 6 1 the non irrigated plot was not considered as the treatment plots because the parameters defined in this research were not studied except grain yield threshing and winnowing the harvested plants were done manually and the clean grains were dried under sunshine until the grain moisture reached 12 gao et al 2014 the harvest index hi was calculated as follows described in ali et al 2007 7 h i g r a i n y i e l d t h a g r a i n y i e l d t h a s t r a w y i e l d t h a 2 6 irrigation methods and their evaluation 2 6 1 irrigation water usage the irrigation methods were evaluated based on the use of the irrigation water by crop which was estimated as crop water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue following li et al 2005 likewise the crop water uptake and input ratio wuir was estimated to check how efficiently root water uptake was responded to input water irrigation plus precipitation 8 w u e y e t 9 i w u e δ y i y i r y c k i 10 w u i r c r o p w a t e r u s e i p 100 where wue and iwue were measured in kg m 3 and wuir in percentage y is the grain yield kg ha 1 et measured in m3 ha 1 is the evapotranspiration during a growing season δy is the grain yield increment due to irrigation measured by yir yck in which yir and yck are the grain yield measured in irrigated and non irrigated treatment respectively and both expressed in kg ha 1 p is the total precipitation from showing to harvest and i is the total irrigation amount in each treatments both measured in m3 ha 1 the crop water use was estimated as described in section 2 7 and the estimated value is presented in table 3 2 6 2 marginal productivity of irrigation water the term marginal productivity is useful in agricultural economics to determine the economic contribution of each input in producing farm products and provides an idea to offer the farmer the economically right dose of input use for obtaining optimum output ali et al 2007 chandrakanth 2015 it is defined as the ratio of return of every input to the output when other inputs were kept the same technically the marginal productivity of irrigation water m p i r is a useful indicator when water resources become limited and is calculated as follows 10 m p i r δ y δ i r where m p i r was in kg ha 1 cm 1 δy was the relative change in crop yield kg ha 1 and δir was the difference in irrigation amount cm 2 7 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova for two factors with replication in spss was used to determine the statistical significance of irrigation methods and irrigation schedulings all treatments were compared based on statistical significance using the least significant difference lsd test and the duncan s multiple new range test dmrt at 5 α 0 05 significance level the root length density was measured using the winrhizo reg 2007d regent instrument inc software and was then used as an input parameter in hydrus 1d version 4 17 software to calculate the water use by crop 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation amount and water consumption by crop the first irrigation was at the re greening stage starting at the same date for all plots with the soil moisture in each treatment controlled at the designed level table 2 it was found that maintaining swc at 50 to 70 of fc needed to increase the irrigation amount by 133 and 167 in si for the 2014 2015 and the 2015 2016 season respectively whereas by 100 in sdi and fi for the two seasons crop water consumption table 3 showed that the maximum irrigation amount of 288 mm and 293 mm in f3 with total irrigation amount of 240 mm and the minimum amount of 190 mm and 196 mm in the s1 treatment with total irrigation amount of 90 mm in 2015 and 2016 season respectively the ratio of water uptake by roots to water input i e wuir in d1 d2 and d3 compare to f3 increased by 20 9 13 and 9 4 in 2014 2015 and by 24 8 31 8 and 17 9 in 2015 2016 respectively similarly wuir in s1 s2 and s3 compare to f3 increased by 9 4 3 0 and 3 4 in 2014 2015 and by 14 7 12 9 and 4 5 in 2015 2016 in f1 and f2 wuir increased by 21 1 and 5 7 in 2014 2015 and by 13 9 and 10 2 in 2015 2016 respectively as compared to f3 these results showed that prolonging irrigation duration with slow irrigation rate can boost irrigation water uptake by the crop irrigation method also played a vital role in root water uptake the shallow wetting soil zone associated in si and sdi due to their low irrigation rate was beneficial to root uptake of the irrigation water compared to surface flooding because roots are denser in the top soil thereby extracting more water from the upper root zone as reported in gaiser et al 2012 al qinna and abu awwad 1998 alluded that slow irrigation rate increased soil water storage which could be one of reason for the increased root water uptake in low irrigation treatment 3 2 crop growth and development the number of tillers under fi increased rapidly after the first irrigation fig 2 a but did not continue longer because of the prolonged irrigation interval compared to si and sdi whereas a steady increase in tiller number was found in si and sdi under the same irrigation level the number of tillers increased with irrigation frequency plant height reached maximum at the flowering stages and then remained approximately unchanged thereafter fig 2b the plant grew at 70 of fc was faster than at 60 and 50 of fc a uniform growth rate in plant height was observed for irrigation at 60 of fc in all irrigation methods especially in sdi because of an improved water availability and aeration in the soil bhunia et al 2015 the weekly measured leaf area index lai from the first irrigation to the grain filling stage in the two seasons is shown in fig 3 a and 3 b respectively high irrigation level 70 of fc under fi attained the highest lai in both seasons however the temporal change in lai was similar in all nine treatments in the two seasons low irrigation frequency reduced lai due to water stress experienced by the plant as described in kharrou et al 2011 liu et al 2011 also found that the lai was negatively responded to irrigation less than 50 of et under sprinkler irrigation 3 3 crop yield 3 3 1 effective and non effective tillers the effective tillers are when the panicle contains filled spikes the number of effective tillers per square meter differed significantly α 0 01 between irrigation scheduling in both seasons the differences between irrigation methods was significant α 0 05 in 2015 2016 and insignificant in 2014 2015 table 4 the maximum effective tillers number in d2 was 774 tillers m 2 and 726 tillers m 2 respectively in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the minimum effective tiller number in 2014 2015 was 681tillers m 2 under f1 and in 2015 2016 was460 tillers m 2 under s1 the number of non effective tillers was found significantly lower at 60 of fc this corroborates with previous research which showed that the effective tillers number increased with irrigation frequency ali et al 2007 low effective tiller number and high non effective tiller number under low irrigation level 50 of fc were caused by long irrigation interval making plant suffer from water stress in contrast high level irrigation made the crop produce tillers for a longer period delaying the time it reaches the maturity level and thereby failing to compete for nutrient in soil at flowering stage resulting in a reduction in grain filling 3 3 2 spikes and kernels filling filled spikelet unfilled spikelet and the number of kernels per panicle all varied significantly at 1 level between irrigation scheduling except for the unfilled spikelet in 2014 2015 table 4 the irrigation methods also had significant differences at 5 level on these yield components except for the unfilled spikelet per panicle in 2014 2015 the filled spikelet and kernels per panicle showed highest under d3 17 27 spikes and d2 36 13 kernels respectively in 2014 2015 and under d2 20 2 for spikes and 45 23 for kernels in 2015 2016 the f1 yielded the lowest spikes and kernels 15 9 spikes and 31 13 kernels in 2014 2015 while s1 gave the lowest spikes and kernels 16 37 spikes and 32 17 kernels in 2015 2016 similar results were found in bhunia et al 2015 where they alluded that the yield attributes such as ear length effective tillers grain per panicle and test weight increased with an increase in the limit soil moisture for irrigation thus the increases in number of filled spikelet and the number of grains per panicle with lower number of unfilled spikelet per panicle ranked in order of d2 s2 d3 f2 s3 etc showed that irrigating at 60 of fc may create a good soil environment to improve yield traits those components did not decrease drastically when starting irrigation at 70 of fc but the associated components decreased under water stress especially water stress occurring between flowering stage and maturity stage occurrence of a water stress at milking stage made plants more susceptible to diseases attack and weaker in grain filling increasing the number of unfilled spikelet at 50 of fc in all irrigation methods 3 3 3 kernel weight the kernel weight test weight was taken from 1000 kernels there was no significant difference in the kernel weight between different irrigation methods table 4 but significant difference between at α 0 01 irrigation scheduling was found in both seasons the maximum kernel weight in 2014 2015 was under d2 49 89 g followed by d3 49 55 g and in 2015 2016 it was under d3 47 87 g followed by s3 47 65 g the lowest test weight in 2014 2015 and 015 2016 was 43 54 g and 41 81 g respectively under s1 in 2015 2016 for all irrigation methods the test weight was found to increase with irrigation level showed significant difference between 50 and 70 but no difference between 50 and 60 or 60 and 70 irrigation level the kernel weight increased if the irrigation frequency increased from heading to grain maturity stages 3 4 grain yield the most important objective of this study was to determine the appropriate irrigation method and scheduling to increase grain yield y per unit of irrigated water the grain yield calculated at harvest from each treatment is given in table 5 statistical analysis shows that irrigation methods had significant effect on y in both 2014 2015 α 0 05 and 2015 2016 α 0 01 whereas the irrigation scheduling influenced the wheat production significantly in both seasons at α 0 01 the mean variation of y was 1 27 t ha 1 and 1 53 t ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively the maximum y in 2014 2015 was 9 53 t ha 1 and it was 9 01 t ha 1 in 2015 2016 both found under d2 the minimum y in 2014 2015 was 8 26 t ha 1 under f1 and in 2015 2016 it was 7 48 t h 1 under s1 this yield gap supports the potential yield simulated by lu and fan 2013 where the potential yield of winter wheat was 9 1 t h 1 with a yield gap of 2 7 t h 1 for ncp the irrigation practices with sdi method found to be superior to si and fi methods irrigating as soon as the swc drop to 60 of fc has proven the best irrigation scheduling to achieve the maximum yield in all irrigation methods irrigating at 70 of fc significantly increased y compared to irrigating at 50 of fc but was less productive in yield than irrigating at 60 of fc this maybe because of excessive water stress occurred for irrigating at 50 of fc whereas irrigating at 70 of fc had shown the ill effects of irrigation showing that irrigation at 60 of fc is more favorable condition for irrigating winter wheat at ncp english and nakamura 1989 hendawy and hokam 2007 and kang et al 2002 had also mentioned that different irrigation levels significantly affected grain yield but did not produce the highest yield with high irrigation frequency nor mitigate the effects of water deficit regression analysis of the grain yield against seasonal irrigation amount i is well described by the following function and the comparative results are shown in fig 4 y15 0 00011 i2 0 0397 i 5 56 r2 0 70 define y for 2014 2015 y16 0 00012 i2 0 0421 i 4 92 r2 0 60 define y for 2015 2016 maximizing these functions y i 0 provides evidence that irrigating with 180 3 mm and 175 2 mm of water achieves the highest grain yield in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively liu et al 2011 also showed that irrigating 185 mm and 186 mm of water in first and second season in their experiment respectively obtained the optimal grain yield with sprinkler irrigation it can thus be concluded that irrigating six times each by 30 mm with sdi and si or three times each by 60 mm with fi achieves the maximum grain yield 3 5 straw yield straw yield sy measured from the harvested samples is given in table 5 the results show that both irrigation method and irrigation scheduling have significant effects on sy statistically no significant difference between sy was found for fi and si under the same swc both producing more sy than the sdi under the same irrigation level in 2015 2016 maximum sy in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was 9 23 t ha 1 and 9 01 t ha 1 respectively both achieved under f3 sy under s3 in the two seasons was 8 68 t ha 1 and 8 61 t ha 1 respectively highest after f3 irrigating at 50 of fc drastically reduced sy to 7 26 t ha 1 and 5 69 t ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively under d1 the relationship between the straw yield and the irrigation amount can be described by the following equations and their comparisons are shown in fig 4 sy15 0 01 i 6 68 r2 0 89 define sy for 2014 2015 season sy16 0 019 i 4 27 r2 0 95 defined sy for 2015 2016 season the straw yield increased linearly with the irrigation amount comparing the straw yield data in table 5 with lai data in fig 3 revealed that the reduced vegetative growth at all crop development stages was the main reason of the decreased in straw yield for the treatments scheduled to irrigate at 50 of fc thus reducing irrigation frequency when plant was under water stress may reduce straw yield as compared to treatments with high irrigation frequency and high soil water content kang et al 2002 3 6 harvest index the harvest index hi is defined as the ratio of grain yield y to above ground biomass which varied from the highest 53 6 under d2 followed by d1 53 3 to the lowest 49 3 under f3 in 2014 2015 season in 2015 2016 hi varied from the highest 57 8 under d1 followed by d2 57 3 to the lowest 46 5 under f3 table 5 the hi obtained from si and sdi does not show significant difference in 2014 2015 but significant difference in hi was found between both irrigation method and irrigation scheduling in 2015 2016 overall higher hi under sdi was found for both seasons representing better crop development plant reproduction and yield in terms of crop reproductive functions blum 2009 the results in 2015 2016 show that the hi decreases consistently with increasing irrigation amount coinciding with the results of zhang et al 2010 who suggested that the hi of winter wheat under limited irrigation in ncp was 2 4 higher than that under non limited or less limited irrigation kang et al 2002 found that hi varied from 0 25 to 0 45 under different irrigation methods smaller to what we found in this study 3 7 irrigation water utilization 3 7 1 effectiveness of irrigation the maximum wue in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 was estimated to be 2 08 kg m 3 and 1 91 kg m 3 under d2 followed by 2 05 kg m 3 and 1 81 kg m 3 under s2 respectively table 6 the statistical analysis shows that irrigating at 60 of fc give a significantly α 0 01 higher wue for all irrigation methods with sdi being the most effective followed by si under the same level of irrigation scheduling lv et al 2013 and wang et al 2015 found similar wue hanging from 1 70 to 4 20 kg m 3 and 1 91 to 2 06 kg m 3 respectively in their studies the relationship between wue and irrigation amount is shown in fig 5 and can be described by the following equations wue15 0 000018 i2 0 0056 i 1 58 r2 0 40 define wue for 2014 2015 wue16 0 000019 i2 0 0055 i 1 39 r2 0 53 define wue for 2015 2016 fig 5 shows that the wue increased with irrigation amount up to a certain level followed by a decline similar to that found in hendawy and hokam 2007 for drip irrigation maximizing the quadratic function w u e i 0 shows that irrigating 156 mm and 144 mm of water was optimal in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 respectively to obtain the highest wue from table 6 it can be concluded that irrigating five times each by 30 mm under sdi and si or irrigating no more than three times each by 60 mm under fi gives the highest wue indicating that higher wue can be achieved by irrigation scheduling of 60 of fc in all three irrigation methods the results showed a negative linear relationship between irrigation water use efficiency iwue and irrigation amount fig 5 as described by the following equations iwue15 0 023 i 7 87 r2 0 94 for 2014 2015 iwue16 0 024 i 7 98 r2 0 93 for 2015 2016 these equations show that increasing irrigation amount leads to a linear decrease in iwue fig 5 consistent with the relationship found by li et al 2005 the maximum iwue in 2014 2015 was 6 16 kg m 3 under s1 followed by 5 98 kg m 3 under d1 whereas in 2015 2016 it was 6 17 kg m 3 under d1 followed by 5 8 kg m 3 under s1 the lowest iwue was 2 54 kg m 3 and 2 33 kg m 3 under f3 for the two seasons respectively table 6 these result showed that irrigation water can be utilized more efficiently under low irrigation levels ali et al 2007 found increased irrigation water productivity iwp under water deficit irrigation comparing to fi in 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 and under irrigation level of 50 60 and 70 of fc sdi increased iwue by 33 9 and 67 7 29 and 79 9 and 41 6 and 51 8 whereas si increased iwue by 37 9 and 30 7 22 7 and 32 9 and 16 9 and 2 7 respectively thus in terms of iwue it could be concluded that irrigating with sdi could improve irrigation water used by crop efficiently compare to si and fi 3 7 2 marginal productivity of irrigation water mpir local farmers usually irrigate the winter wheat 3 5 times with a total irrigation amount of 180 300 mm using surface flood irrigation zhang et al 2002 tables 2 and 3 showed that f3 is irrigation practice using by the farmers to evaluate mpir of all irrigation methods f3 was thus taken as a conventional and we compared its mpir with other treatments as shown in table 6 low irrigation scheduling comparatively showed small mpir for example 24 11 kg ha 1 cm 1 under s1 4 28 kg ha 1 cm 1 under d1 and 25 82 kg ha 1 cm 1 under f1 in 2015 2016 and mpir found increasing with the application of more irrigation amount in both seasons increase in mpir with irrigation scheduling s3 and d3 implicates that increasing irrigation amount does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase in grain yield 3 7 3 effects on water saving and grain yield increase the effects of fi sdi and si in water conservation and increasing grain yield are shown in table 6 compare with the locally used irrigation method fi sdi saved 25 17 and 25 of irrigation water in 2014 2015 and 25 33 and 25 in 2015 2016 while increased grain yield by 0 3 5 1 and 4 2 in 2014 2015 and 16 7 14 2 and 9 8 in 2015 2016 at irrigation level of 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively similarly si saved 25 17 and 13 of irrigation water in 2014 2015 and 25 17 and 0 of irrigation water in 2015 2016 increasing grain yield by 2 2 1 5 and 1 5 in 2014 2015 and 1 3 7 7 and 1 9 in 2015 2016 at the swc level of 50 60 and 70 of fc respectively the results show that sdi not only saved irrigation water but also increased grain yield under the same irrigation level compared to fi and si a similar result was also found in kharrou et al 2011 that drip irrigation could save 20 irrigation water compared to surface irrigation irrigation frequency has important economic implications the cost of irrigation yield and the irrigation efficiencies were all affected by irrigation amount english and nakamura 1989 4 conclusion the total water used by winter wheat and the ratio of irrigation water to the total water consumed by the wheat under different irrigation methods and scheduling all increase with increasing irrigation water applied it was concluded that the optimal irrigation scheduling and irrigation method should assure irrigation to be 144 mm 180 3 mm so as to keep both grain yield and water use efficiency at high levels in ncp irrigating at moderate soil water content with low irrigation amount under surface drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation not only optimizes water use but also boosts the use of soil water and precipitation thereby increasing yield and water use efficiency this study recommends surface drip irrigation for winter wheat in the north china plain irrigating 30 mm of water whenever the soil water content reduces to 60 of the field capacity this is the best combination for achieving maximum yield and water use efficiency as well as giving satisfactory irrigation water use efficiency if surface drip irrigation is not available we suggest using sprinkler irrigation irrigating with 30 mm of water or with flood irrigation with 60 mm of water when soil water content drops to 60 of field capacity acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the
