16755,mycorrhizae can improve plant growth and drought tolerance by enhancing plant uptake of nutrients and water which are important targets for biofilters a common stormwater treatment system this study evaluated the role of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant growth photosynthetic efficiency and pollutant removal in two australian plant species grown in stormwater biofilters during the establishment period and column study ficinia nodosa showed over 80 mycorrhizal colonization leading to a doubling of shoot and root biomass compared to the control while carex appressa showed less than 26 mycorrhizal colonization and no effect on shoot and root biomass columns planted with mycorrhizal inoculated f nodosa had 5 higher removal of total phosphorus and 10 higher removal of total nitrogen figure 5 phosphate figure 6 and cadmium table 3 mycorrhizal colonization did not appear to affect plant stress during drought as indicated by similar photosynthetic efficiencies within species our results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculation can be highly successful in biofilters while increasing plant growth and nutrient removal opening opportunities to further study the role of mycorrhizae in enhancing plant drought tolerance and pollutant removal in existing biofiltration systems keywords mycorrhizal inoculation plant biomass photosynthetic efficiency pollutant removal introduction since first adopted in 1999 there has been increasing research on stormwater biofiltration systems as a tool for urban runoff management biofilters can remove pollutants from stormwater that otherwise could end up in natural water bodies plants are particularly important in biofilters for nutrient and heavy metal removal payne et al 2018 rycewicz borecki et al 2016 as well as for hydraulic conductivity hermawan et al 2019 tirpak et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2011 observed a 93 decrease in total nitrogen in wastewater treated with vegetated biofilters compared with 63 for non vegetated biofilters also it has been observed that plants with more extensive and deeper root penetration in the media can improve stormwater retention capacity and infiltration rate hermawan et al 2019 biofilter performance relies on healthy vegetation however biofilter plants are frequently exposed to environmental stress szota et al 2015 which can affect plant growth and their subsequent capacity to retain water and remove pollutants in previous column studies for example plants subjected to prolonged dry periods and showing evidence of stress e g extensive browning of leaves were associated with lower removal of nitrogen after the dry period winfrey et al 2020 zinger et al 2007 2021 microorganisms present in the rhizosphere such as mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in nutrient cycles as well as plant establishment especially under environmental stress mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants and colonize more than 80 of vascular plants ectomycorrhizae which develop fungal structures outside plant roots and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae vam which develop intraradical fungal structures are the most common type mycorrhizal fungi in both types of plant mycorrhizal associations fungal structures are directly involved in transporting phosphate ammonium nitrate and amino acids to plant roots parniske 2008 li et al 2019 found that mycorrhizal inoculation of a pine forest with pisolithus tinctorius was able to recover soil nutrient content archaeal amoa gene abundance and the activity of denitrification enzymes following acid rain stress in another study when tetraclinis articulate a cypress growing in a heavy metal polluted soil was inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae vam shoot and root biomass increased by 96 and 60 respectively curaqueo et al 2014 it has been proposed that in biofilters mycorrhizae may help plants establish in low nutrient soils tolerate prolonged dry periods and take up more nutrients as a result of higher biomass production and or organic matter content palacios and winfrey 2021 but more research is needed to understand the best approach to utilizing mycorrhizae and other soil microbes to enhance biofilter performance augé 2001 in a review of more than 100 studies found that mycorrhizae can decrease leaf water potential during drought stress as well as increase photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance consistent with overall improved water status also it has been found that mycorrhizal hyphae can act as an extension of plant roots by penetrating micropores that are unreachable for roots smith et al 2010 this can increase water and nutrient supply for plant roots which have been proven to increase the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of photosystem ii fv fm fv and fm definition is explained in method section an indicator of plant photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth in several mycorrhizal plants mathur et al 2019 sheng et al 2008 for example mathur et al 2019 observed an increase in fv fm from 0 825 to 0 845 in mycorrhizal plants of wheat triticum aestivum under water normal conditions and an increase from 0 544 to 0 798 in wheat colonised by mycorrhizal when grown under drought stress successful mycorrhizal inoculation has also been observed in plants for horticultural purposes such as soybean glycine max resulting in increases in the p concentration of nodules and the n concentration of leaves as well as a positive effect on carboxylase activity of rubisco growth and plant nodulation bulgarelli et al 2017 awareness of the benefits of mycorrhizae in biofilters began in 2018 when it was reported that phosphorus and phosphate export from mesocosms decreased between 13 and 48 and 14 60 respectively in columns with mycorrhizal inoculant added poor et al 2018 similar observations previously noticed in soil cavagnaro et al 2015 poor et al 2018 study also pointed to higher copper and nitrate uptake in the mesocosms inoculated with mycorrhizae a follow up study by poor and kube 2019 showed that these nutrient retention improvements became less pronounced following a dry period between testing indicating that mycorrhizae may not have conferred the benefit to p removal following a period of environmental stress in the only other study we found evaluating mycorrhizal inoculation on biofilter pollutant removal there was no effect of mycorrhizae on pollutant removal lange et al 2020 although these studies did not find a sustained improvement in biofilter pollutant removal by using mycorrhizae the inoculation of these plants by mycorrhizae was either not confirmed lange et al 2020 or the extent of colonization was not measured poor et al 2018 poor and kube 2019 winfrey et al 2017 studied the extent of vam in 32 australian biofilters founding mycorrhizal colonization in carex appressa ficinia nodosa and two species of juncus however no evaluation of the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plants growth and or nutrient removal was evaluated this demonstrates that more research is needed to compare mycorrhizal inoculants and evaluate inoculation strategies the effectiveness of mycorrhizal colonization in biofilter plants and the effect on heavy metal and nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters based on previous research described above our study had three aims the first aim was to evaluate inoculation techniques on three common australian biofilter plant species carex appressa juncus australis and ficinia nodosa the second aim was to determine whether mycorrhizal inoculation of biofilter plants could increase growth in biofilter conditions the third aim was to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plant growth fv fm and pollutant removal in biofilters exposed to wet and dry periods material and methods plant growing conditions this experiment was carried out in two stages first a colonization period where the success of mycorrhizal colonization and its effects on plant growth were evaluated second a biofilter column study to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth fv fm and nutrient and heavy metal removal a graphical summary of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 the two stages of this experiment were carried out in a covered open air greenhouse at monash university where temperatures fluctuated between 18 and 25 c and photosynthetic active radiation peaked between 300 and 600 µmol photons m 2 s 1 during the day seeds of three australian plant species carex appressa cyperaceae juncus australis juncaceae and ficinia nodosa cyperaceae were germinated for 12 weeks in trays containing sterile seed raising mix a total of 48 seedlings per species one per pot were selected and transferred to 100 140 mm pots containing triple washed sand daisy s garden supplies melbourne australia a common filter media used in melbourne biofilters payne et al 2015 the sand was autoclaved 0 11 mpa 121 c 1 5 h before planting plants were watered daily for 90 days after two weeks of acclimation in the filter media two different mycorrhizal inoculant treatments were applied to the pots as follow 16 pots per species received a treatment 1 see below 16 pots per species received a treatment 2 see below and control groups of 16 pots per species were left without inoculation for the first stage of the experiment a total of six pots per species per treatment were randomly selected while the rest of the pots continued being watered daily for six months for the biofilter column study mycorrhizal inoculation treatment 1 t1 and treatment 2 t2 in this research two different mycorrhizal inoculants were selected mycorrhizal spores from existing australian biofilters were isolated from soil surrounded by c appressa f nodosa and j australis plants and used as t2 to ensure mycorrhizal inoculation in seedlings of the same plant species found to be effectively infected by mycorrhizae winfrey et al 2017 besides t2 a commercially available mycorrhizal inoculant was selected as t1 because of its effectiveness to infect the roots of australian plants and for its easy access for future studies and possible use in australian biofilters the commercial mycorrhizal inoculant was applied to 16 pots per species and a natural mycorrhizal inoculant to another 16 pots per species while 16 pots per species were maintained without inoculation as control the commercially available mycorrhizal inoculant mycogold from biostim pty ltd queensland australia containing multiple ectomycorrhizae vam bacillus and trichoderma species according to the manufacturer was selected as its practical application in biofilter systems the second mycorrhizal treatment t2 was prepared by isolating spores from soil of existing biofilters located in mount evelyn victoria australia 37 46 18 7 s 145 23 08 3 e one hundred and fifty g of soil was washed three times with 1 l of deionized di water and sequentially passed through 750 250 100 and 50 µm sieves sieving obtained from the 250 100 and 50 µm sieves were mixed with 200 ml of di water and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm pellets obtained from centrifuging were resuspended in 50 sucrose and centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 rpm the supernatant was washed on a 50 µm sieve with di water to remove sucrose and spores were collected in filter paper 25 µm pore size by vacuum filtration to be used as inoculant as this is one of the first research evaluating the use of mychorrizae in plants growing in biofilters t2 was selected to compare the effectiveness of using mycorrhizal species that grow in existing biofilters against using a commercial and more generic inoculant t1 however at this stage of the research the mycorrhizal species used in t2 remain as not identified species five ml of the inoculant t1 and t2 at a concentration of 100 mg ml were added to their corresponding 16 pots per species plants were watered daily and left for 4 weeks for inoculation to occur experimental analysis during colonization period for the study during the colonization period six pots from each of the two treatment groups and control per species were randomly selected plants were watered daily and plant heights were measured twice per week for 45 days finally plants were sacrificially harvested for shoot and root analysis and detailed mycorrhizal analysis setting up of column study and measurements the effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth and biofilter performance was evaluated over a 1 year experiment based upon the results obtained from the colonization period plants of c appressa and f nodosa and t1 treatment were selected for the column study a total of 10 plants per species previously inoculated with t1 and 10 non inoculated plants per species were each transferred to an independent testing column biofilter columns were constructed using 102 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride plastic of 600 mm height containing 50 mm of fine gravel 7 10 mm at the base followed by 300 mm of sand daisy s garden supplies melbourne australia a ponding zone of 150 mm depth was left at the top of the columns a 150 mm deep saturated zone was created at the base of the columns using a 13 mm diameter irrigation pipe black poly tube holman australia attached to the base of the columns with an outlet raised 150 mm above the base the saturated zone consisted of a 50 mm gravel layer underlying a 100 mm layer of autoclaved coarse sand and sugar cane mulch mixture 5 v v the sand and sugar cane mulch mixture were confined to the saturated zone a total of five weeks was allocated as an establishment period with columns watered daily with 2 3 l of tap water during the experiment columns were exposed to a sequential 5 week wet period 2 week dry period 3 week wet period 6 week dry period and 4 week wet period during wet periods columns were dosed twice a week with 2 3 l of semi synthetic stormwater following a stormwater dose volume representative of a biofilter designed to be 2 of its catchment area bratieres et al 2008 this dosing volume corresponds to the annual average rainfall for melbourne victoria of 577 mm ambrose and winfrey 2015 distributed evenly into twice weekly events these doses were equivalent to the runoff from a 5 5 mm rain event during dry periods columns remained unwatered plant height and fv fm of plants were monitored once a week during the study two harvesting periods were performed during the experiment in which four and six columns per treatment per species were harvested after the first dry period and at the end of the experiment respectively in both harvesting periods plant height was measured and shoots and roots were harvested for biomass analysis a total of 10 of roots were also separated from the root mass and stored at 5 c for further determination of mycorrhizal colonization stormwater dosing and water quality analysis semi synthetic stormwater runoff contained slurry collected from a local stormwater wetland sieved 1 mm particle size and mixed with de chlorinated tap water to reach a total suspended solids tss concentration of 150 mg l which is under the standard of a global analysis of urban stormwater composition duncan 1999 a typical urban stormwater nutrient concentration duncan 1999 was reached by adding potassium nitrate ammonium chloride nicotinic acid potassium phosphate and sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate for de chlorination based upon the water analysis of three influent samples collected during the sampling periods semi synthetic stormwater runoff contained total nitrogen tn at 2 23 0 11 mg l total phosphorus tp at 0 32 0 02 mg l nitrate nitrite nox at 1 1 0 0 mg l ammonium nh4 at 0 32 0 06 mg l and filterable reactive phosphorus frp at 0 24 0 01 mg l three sampling events for water analysis were performed during the experiment sampling 1 after the first wet period sampling 2 after the first dry period and sampling 3 after the second dry period samples for determination of inflow and effluent concentration of tn tp nh4 nox and filterable reactive phosphorus frp were analyzed in a national association of testing authorities accredited lab in the school of chemistry at monash university australia using flow injection analysis water samples collected for metals cd cu and zn analysis were first digested fifty milliliters of water samples were digested by adding 10 ml of trace metal grade 65 hno3 to 50 ml of sample and heating in a digestion block to 100 c for approximately 6 h once the sample was reduced to about 5 ml an additional 5 ml of hno3 was added this addition of 5 ml of hno3 was repeated until no brown fumes could be seen following this the solution was reduced again to near dryness 1 ml remaining finally 1 ml of hno3 was added to the digested sample and it was diluted to 50 ml with purified water merck milli q iq 7000 digested samples were analyzed on a thermo fisher icap rq inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in the living laboratory for water technologies at monash university dry biomass analysis plants were harvested by washing the roots gently with water shoots were separated from roots and dried in an oven at 60 c and weighed for dry biomass determination after 24 h and reweighed every 24 h until they reached a constant weight which was always within 72 h photosynthetic analysis fv fm which represents the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of psii was determined by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence of dark adapted leaves using a photosynthesis yield analyzer mini pam heinz walz effeltrich germany the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence is frequently used as a measure of plant stress values of over 0 76 are indicative of healthy plants values of 0 6 0 76 are indicative of stress lu and zhang 1999 vargas ortiz et al 2021 during the night a total of 3 leaves per plant were selected randomly for measurement leaves were exposed to a measuring light of minimum light intensity to obtain a stable f0 minimum fluorescence value the maximum quantum yield of psii was estimated by measuring the maximum fluorescence fm after exposing the leaves to a saturating flash of red light eq 1 1 f v f m f m f 0 f m mycorrhizal colonization of roots plant roots were stained using the ink and vinegar method to determine the presence of vam structures vierheilig et al 1998 subsamples of washed roots were taken from each replicate around 10 by volume and placed in 20 ml scintillation vials containing 10 w v koh solution samples were left for 72 h at room temperature until roots were transparent cleared roots were boiled for 3 min in a 5 ink vinegar solution 5 sheaffer fountain blue pen ink and 95 distilled white vinegar 5 acetic acid 95 distilled water then rinsed with distilled water to remove the excess ink vinegar solution roots were de stained by placing them for 1 hour in distilled water containing 3 4 drops of vinegar in 20 ml scintillation vials de stained root samples were stored in a 50 v v lactic acid glycerol solution in 20 ml scintillation vials mycorrhizal colonization in root samples was analyzed using the gridline intersect method giovannetti and mosse 1980 arbuscules vesicles hyphae and spores were observed under an olympus ch 2 light microscope 40x magnification successful mycorrhizal colonization was considered when arbuscules and or vesicles were found in the intersection additional fungal structures indicating the presence of dark septate endophytes were identified and noted as these fungi may also facilitate plant growth in some conditions he et al 2019 data analysis all data analyses were performed using the software graph pad prism 8 0 2 la jolla california usa significant differences between treatments and plant species were analyzed by two way anova significance level p 0 05 and tukey test as a posterior multiple comparison test between treatments and control significance level p 0 05 after confirming normality and homogeneity of variances shapiro wilk and spearman test respectively when the normality and homogeneity of variances test were rejected data were log transformed to satisfy these assumptions before performing parametric analysis of variances results and discussion colonization period a successful mycorrhizal inoculation was achieved in the australian biofilter plant species f nodosa and j australis while growing in biofilter media the dependence of the degree of mycorrhizal colonization in grassland like plants has been shown to depend on both species and the family to which the plant belongs miller et al 2012 here we detected different levels of mycorrhizal colonization in the three species during the colonization period with 91 and 50 colonization in f nodosa and j australis roots but only 17 in c appressa table 1 the degree of colonization that was observed did not depend on the family with both highest and lowest rates in plants belonging to cyperaceae prior field investigation showed relatively low mycorrhizal colonization in the same biofilter plant species winfrey et al 2017 finding less than 19 mycorrhizal colonization in roots of f nodosa in four out of 20 australian biofilters where this species was present and 25 of roots of c appressa colonized with mycorrhizae in only one out of seven biofilters studied where this species was present another species was also found to be mycorrhizal in australian stormwater biofilters j flavidus which is morphologically similar to j australis members of cyperaceae generally considered nonmycorrhizal or rarely mycorrhizal have been observed to be colonized by vam in other ecosystems miller et al 1999 observed 16 species of carex colonized by vam after performing a survey of 23 species of this genus present in uplands and wetlands in the midwest of the united states miller et al 1999 also observed the presence of endophyte fungi in some species in the genus carex different levels of arbuscule and vesicle abundance are thought to reflect differences in host preferences fungal strategies and or plant fungal interaction munkvold et al 2004 we observed differences between plant species for example c appressa one of the most commonly used plants in australian biofilters showed a low percentage of vesicles 3 2 in t1 and 7 4 in t2 and a high percentage of dark septate endophytic fungal structure compared with control plants table 1 while f nodosa presented the highest percentage of arbuscules in t1 76 9 and t2 84 4 mycorrhizal colonization can increase shoot and root growth of plants in our experiment plants of f nodosa and j australis treated with t1 doubled their shoot and roots biomass during this period while plants of c appressa where mycorrhizal colonization was minimal presented no differences in growth between control and treated plants fig 2 successful mycorrhizal colonization and positive impact on plant growth at the seedling stage of f nodosa and j australis indicate that mycorrhizae can contribute to the establishment and survival of seedlings grown in biofilter media as it has been previously observed in other systems for example davidson et al 2016 observed that seedlings of artemisia tridentata inoculated with vam increased survival by 27 compared to non inoculated seedlings which was positively correlated with increases in water use efficiency by plants for the second stage of this research only plants of c appressa and f nodosa were transferred to the columns as clear differences in mycorrhizal colonization and growth responses between these two species would provide a better chance to detect the effects of mycorrhizae on biofilter plants and pollutant removal t1 was selected as a mycorrhizal inoculant for the column study because f nodosa plants presented the highest percentage of arbuscules colonization and growth responses under this treatment additionally the t1 inoculant is commercially available providing practical advantages over the field collected spores in t2 column study the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth during the column study the differences in mycorrhizal colonization between c appressa and f nodosa remained the same as in the colonization period table 2 a mycorrhizal association can improve plant growth and allow plants to tolerate better stress conditions especially water stress augé 2001 gao et al 2020 song et al 2020 in our column study plants harvested after a two week dry period showed that mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa had twice the root and shoot biomass compared to control plants fig 3 as observed during the establishment period by contrast c appressa showed no differences in shoot and root biomass between treatment and control fig 3 increases in growth in mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa observed in this study could be associated with an increase of water and nutrient supply to the plant by mycorrhizae which has been observed in other studies govindarajulu et al 2005 van der heijden et al 1998 this did not occur in c appressa or the effect was not large enough to be detected photosynthetic efficiency results showed that after a two week dry period all plants decreased their photosynthetic activity slightly from 0 77 0 01 to 0 73 0 02 in c appressa and from 0 84 0 01 to 0 81 0 01 in f nodosa in both control and treated plants after the six week dry period all plants were dead evidenced by average fv fm values below 0 2 in all plants fig 4 which indicates plants suffered severe stress due to water limitation during this period still the mycorrhizal colonization was high in inoculated plants of f nodosa following this six week dry period which was measured in the remaining columns the deprivation of water affected the benefit of mycorrhizal colonization on plant growth fig 2 however it is promising that plant growth remained improved in inoculated plants after a 2 week dry period in melbourne only about 5 of storms have a 14 day or longer antecedent dry period ambrose and winfrey 2015 from a practical standpoint the improvement of plant growth during most dry periods is a positive outcome for managing plant health in these systems the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on nutrient and heavy metal removal mycorrhizal studies on natural ecosystems indicate that this fungus could have an indirect and or a direct effect on nutrient and heavy metal removal in biofilters payne et al 2015 found a positive correlation between plant root length and tn removal from stormwater biofilter in our column study the first sampling of the outflow showed that biofilters with mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa which had double root biomass increased tn removal by 10 compared to biofilters planted with non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 during the second harvest sampling 3 where no difference in shoot and root biomass was observed between control and treated plants of f nodosa no differences in tn removal were observed between biofilters planted with mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 these results indicate that during a two week dry period an increase in root growth in mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa could have led to an increase in nitrogen removal from stormwater mycorrhizal plants could have improved nutrient removal in our biofilter columns by the direct absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus by mycorrhizal structures govindarajulu et al 2005 observed that extraradical hyphae of vam can take up inorganic nitrogen from soil and incorporate it into plants by intraradical hyphal structures the mycorrhizal structure known as arbuscule is directly involved in the translocation of nutrients from soil to plant roots parniske et al 2008 in our research after the two week dry period the percent colonization of inoculated f nodosa was 71 8 overall with 54 5 of root sites containing arbuscules table 2 only 25 8 of root sites were colonized by mycorrhizae in c appressa with only 9 5 of these sites containing arbuscules the water quality analysis performed after two weeks of dry period sampling 2 showed higher removal of tn tp and phosphate from synthetic stormwater runoff in biofilters with mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa compared to the biofilters planted with non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 and 6 in contrast biofilters planted with treated plants of c appressa did not show differences in any of these nutrient removals compared to the control fig 5 and 6 after six weeks of dry period sampling 3 no differences in nutrient removal were observed between biofilters with treated and control plants of both f nodosa and c appressa fig 5 and 6 this is most likely due to the death of vegetation by exposure to extreme drought stress at this stage treated plants of f nodosa still had a high percentage of vesicles 77 and arbuscules 45 5 colonizing their roots which indicates that under less than 6 weeks of a dry period these plants could still be benefited by a mycorrhizal treatment recovering faster from water stress a study comparing a variety of dry period lengths in biofilters with mycorrhizal inoculated plants would be needed to confirm this the concentrations of heavy metals in stormwater and column effluent were analyzed during the three sampling periods table 3 in biofilters heavy metals are mainly removed by sorption to filter media davis et al 2003 which in turn depends on filter media properties such as organic matter content and saturation level uptake of metals from soil by vegetation can also occur especially by hyperaccumulators lu et al 2020 however few hyperaccumulators have been tested in biofilters lange et al 2020 mycorrhizae can increase plant tolerance to heavy metal by improving metal translocation and accumulation aloui et al 2011 lu et al 2020 raklami et al 2021 for example a colonization of sphagneticola calendulaceae with the arbuscular mycorrhizae funneliformis mosseae increased plant biomass and the concentration of cd in plant tissues substantially lu et al 2020 at 25 50 and 100 mg cd kg 1 level in the soil phenomena also observed in other plant species hu et al 2013 our experiment showed 10 higher cd removal from stormwater runoff in biofilters planted with mycorrhizae inoculated f nodosa after the first dry period which indicates that mycorrhizal fungi could contribute to cd sorption processes and translocation of cd from stormwater to plant tissues previously lange et al 2020 studied the effect of dryopteris filix mass plants inoculated with mycorrhizae on cd removal in biofilters exposed to wet and dry periods finding no differences between treated plants and control in any of the periods although mycorrhizal colonization was not confirmed in the lange et al 2020 study we expect different plant species will react differently to mycorrhizal inoculation palacios and winfrey 2020 so more species and mycorrhizal inoculation strategies should be tested in our experiment the high percentage of mycorrhizal colonization above 80 achieved in plants of f nodosa including 54 5 of arbuscules colonizing the roots could be the reason that a positive cd removal was observed in biofilters with treated plants a benefit of mycorrhizae in the absorption of other heavy metals such as zn and cu have been observed in other mycorrhizal plants raklami et al 2021 however this was not observed in our experiment the positive effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth of f nodosa as well as on nutrient and cd removal from stormwater at the scale of our column study indicate the importance of scaling up this research to a larger laboratory scale study and or to existing biofilters where more biofilter plants and vam species could be tested at a larger scale van der heijden et al 1998 studied the effect of 1 2 4 8 and 14 vam species on 11 plant species in 70 microcosms observing that the increasing number of vam in the soil was associated with a decreasing soil p and increasing plant p similarly experiments at a larger scale are needed to prove that a similar level of mycorrhizal percentage observed in our study can be achieved in plants growing in existing biofilters and improve nutrient and metal removal from stormwater conclusions a high percentage of mycorrhizal inoculation can be achieved in some biofilter plants such as f nodosa and j australis improving their shoot and root growth in other species such as c appressa a mycorrhizal inoculation could be less successful without affecting plant growth our column study revealed that mycorrhizae can increase shoot and root biomass of f nodosa during wet periods and continue after a two week dry period both increases in root biomass and levels of arbuscule abundance observed in f nodosa could directly improve tn tp phosphate and cd removal from stormwater external mycelium in the soil of biofilters planted with mycorrhizal plants could also act as an extension of plant roots providing more water to increase plant drought tolerance palacios and winfrey 2021 by demonstrating high mycorrhizal inoculation and presence of arbuscules in plants growing in biofilters and subsequent increases in shoot and root growth as well as nutrient and heavy metal removal the results of this study suggest that inoculating biofilter plants could lead to better outcomes for managing stormwater with biofiltration and maintaining healthy biofilter plants during dry periods funding this work was supported by monash university faculty of engineering

16755,mycorrhizae can improve plant growth and drought tolerance by enhancing plant uptake of nutrients and water which are important targets for biofilters a common stormwater treatment system this study evaluated the role of mycorrhizal inoculation on plant growth photosynthetic efficiency and pollutant removal in two australian plant species grown in stormwater biofilters during the establishment period and column study ficinia nodosa showed over 80 mycorrhizal colonization leading to a doubling of shoot and root biomass compared to the control while carex appressa showed less than 26 mycorrhizal colonization and no effect on shoot and root biomass columns planted with mycorrhizal inoculated f nodosa had 5 higher removal of total phosphorus and 10 higher removal of total nitrogen figure 5 phosphate figure 6 and cadmium table 3 mycorrhizal colonization did not appear to affect plant stress during drought as indicated by similar photosynthetic efficiencies within species our results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculation can be highly successful in biofilters while increasing plant growth and nutrient removal opening opportunities to further study the role of mycorrhizae in enhancing plant drought tolerance and pollutant removal in existing biofiltration systems keywords mycorrhizal inoculation plant biomass photosynthetic efficiency pollutant removal introduction since first adopted in 1999 there has been increasing research on stormwater biofiltration systems as a tool for urban runoff management biofilters can remove pollutants from stormwater that otherwise could end up in natural water bodies plants are particularly important in biofilters for nutrient and heavy metal removal payne et al 2018 rycewicz borecki et al 2016 as well as for hydraulic conductivity hermawan et al 2019 tirpak et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2011 observed a 93 decrease in total nitrogen in wastewater treated with vegetated biofilters compared with 63 for non vegetated biofilters also it has been observed that plants with more extensive and deeper root penetration in the media can improve stormwater retention capacity and infiltration rate hermawan et al 2019 biofilter performance relies on healthy vegetation however biofilter plants are frequently exposed to environmental stress szota et al 2015 which can affect plant growth and their subsequent capacity to retain water and remove pollutants in previous column studies for example plants subjected to prolonged dry periods and showing evidence of stress e g extensive browning of leaves were associated with lower removal of nitrogen after the dry period winfrey et al 2020 zinger et al 2007 2021 microorganisms present in the rhizosphere such as mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in nutrient cycles as well as plant establishment especially under environmental stress mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants and colonize more than 80 of vascular plants ectomycorrhizae which develop fungal structures outside plant roots and vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae vam which develop intraradical fungal structures are the most common type mycorrhizal fungi in both types of plant mycorrhizal associations fungal structures are directly involved in transporting phosphate ammonium nitrate and amino acids to plant roots parniske 2008 li et al 2019 found that mycorrhizal inoculation of a pine forest with pisolithus tinctorius was able to recover soil nutrient content archaeal amoa gene abundance and the activity of denitrification enzymes following acid rain stress in another study when tetraclinis articulate a cypress growing in a heavy metal polluted soil was inoculated with vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae vam shoot and root biomass increased by 96 and 60 respectively curaqueo et al 2014 it has been proposed that in biofilters mycorrhizae may help plants establish in low nutrient soils tolerate prolonged dry periods and take up more nutrients as a result of higher biomass production and or organic matter content palacios and winfrey 2021 but more research is needed to understand the best approach to utilizing mycorrhizae and other soil microbes to enhance biofilter performance augé 2001 in a review of more than 100 studies found that mycorrhizae can decrease leaf water potential during drought stress as well as increase photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance consistent with overall improved water status also it has been found that mycorrhizal hyphae can act as an extension of plant roots by penetrating micropores that are unreachable for roots smith et al 2010 this can increase water and nutrient supply for plant roots which have been proven to increase the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of photosystem ii fv fm fv and fm definition is explained in method section an indicator of plant photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth in several mycorrhizal plants mathur et al 2019 sheng et al 2008 for example mathur et al 2019 observed an increase in fv fm from 0 825 to 0 845 in mycorrhizal plants of wheat triticum aestivum under water normal conditions and an increase from 0 544 to 0 798 in wheat colonised by mycorrhizal when grown under drought stress successful mycorrhizal inoculation has also been observed in plants for horticultural purposes such as soybean glycine max resulting in increases in the p concentration of nodules and the n concentration of leaves as well as a positive effect on carboxylase activity of rubisco growth and plant nodulation bulgarelli et al 2017 awareness of the benefits of mycorrhizae in biofilters began in 2018 when it was reported that phosphorus and phosphate export from mesocosms decreased between 13 and 48 and 14 60 respectively in columns with mycorrhizal inoculant added poor et al 2018 similar observations previously noticed in soil cavagnaro et al 2015 poor et al 2018 study also pointed to higher copper and nitrate uptake in the mesocosms inoculated with mycorrhizae a follow up study by poor and kube 2019 showed that these nutrient retention improvements became less pronounced following a dry period between testing indicating that mycorrhizae may not have conferred the benefit to p removal following a period of environmental stress in the only other study we found evaluating mycorrhizal inoculation on biofilter pollutant removal there was no effect of mycorrhizae on pollutant removal lange et al 2020 although these studies did not find a sustained improvement in biofilter pollutant removal by using mycorrhizae the inoculation of these plants by mycorrhizae was either not confirmed lange et al 2020 or the extent of colonization was not measured poor et al 2018 poor and kube 2019 winfrey et al 2017 studied the extent of vam in 32 australian biofilters founding mycorrhizal colonization in carex appressa ficinia nodosa and two species of juncus however no evaluation of the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plants growth and or nutrient removal was evaluated this demonstrates that more research is needed to compare mycorrhizal inoculants and evaluate inoculation strategies the effectiveness of mycorrhizal colonization in biofilter plants and the effect on heavy metal and nutrient removal in stormwater biofilters based on previous research described above our study had three aims the first aim was to evaluate inoculation techniques on three common australian biofilter plant species carex appressa juncus australis and ficinia nodosa the second aim was to determine whether mycorrhizal inoculation of biofilter plants could increase growth in biofilter conditions the third aim was to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on plant growth fv fm and pollutant removal in biofilters exposed to wet and dry periods material and methods plant growing conditions this experiment was carried out in two stages first a colonization period where the success of mycorrhizal colonization and its effects on plant growth were evaluated second a biofilter column study to evaluate the effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth fv fm and nutrient and heavy metal removal a graphical summary of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 the two stages of this experiment were carried out in a covered open air greenhouse at monash university where temperatures fluctuated between 18 and 25 c and photosynthetic active radiation peaked between 300 and 600 µmol photons m 2 s 1 during the day seeds of three australian plant species carex appressa cyperaceae juncus australis juncaceae and ficinia nodosa cyperaceae were germinated for 12 weeks in trays containing sterile seed raising mix a total of 48 seedlings per species one per pot were selected and transferred to 100 140 mm pots containing triple washed sand daisy s garden supplies melbourne australia a common filter media used in melbourne biofilters payne et al 2015 the sand was autoclaved 0 11 mpa 121 c 1 5 h before planting plants were watered daily for 90 days after two weeks of acclimation in the filter media two different mycorrhizal inoculant treatments were applied to the pots as follow 16 pots per species received a treatment 1 see below 16 pots per species received a treatment 2 see below and control groups of 16 pots per species were left without inoculation for the first stage of the experiment a total of six pots per species per treatment were randomly selected while the rest of the pots continued being watered daily for six months for the biofilter column study mycorrhizal inoculation treatment 1 t1 and treatment 2 t2 in this research two different mycorrhizal inoculants were selected mycorrhizal spores from existing australian biofilters were isolated from soil surrounded by c appressa f nodosa and j australis plants and used as t2 to ensure mycorrhizal inoculation in seedlings of the same plant species found to be effectively infected by mycorrhizae winfrey et al 2017 besides t2 a commercially available mycorrhizal inoculant was selected as t1 because of its effectiveness to infect the roots of australian plants and for its easy access for future studies and possible use in australian biofilters the commercial mycorrhizal inoculant was applied to 16 pots per species and a natural mycorrhizal inoculant to another 16 pots per species while 16 pots per species were maintained without inoculation as control the commercially available mycorrhizal inoculant mycogold from biostim pty ltd queensland australia containing multiple ectomycorrhizae vam bacillus and trichoderma species according to the manufacturer was selected as its practical application in biofilter systems the second mycorrhizal treatment t2 was prepared by isolating spores from soil of existing biofilters located in mount evelyn victoria australia 37 46 18 7 s 145 23 08 3 e one hundred and fifty g of soil was washed three times with 1 l of deionized di water and sequentially passed through 750 250 100 and 50 µm sieves sieving obtained from the 250 100 and 50 µm sieves were mixed with 200 ml of di water and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm pellets obtained from centrifuging were resuspended in 50 sucrose and centrifuged for 1 min at 2000 rpm the supernatant was washed on a 50 µm sieve with di water to remove sucrose and spores were collected in filter paper 25 µm pore size by vacuum filtration to be used as inoculant as this is one of the first research evaluating the use of mychorrizae in plants growing in biofilters t2 was selected to compare the effectiveness of using mycorrhizal species that grow in existing biofilters against using a commercial and more generic inoculant t1 however at this stage of the research the mycorrhizal species used in t2 remain as not identified species five ml of the inoculant t1 and t2 at a concentration of 100 mg ml were added to their corresponding 16 pots per species plants were watered daily and left for 4 weeks for inoculation to occur experimental analysis during colonization period for the study during the colonization period six pots from each of the two treatment groups and control per species were randomly selected plants were watered daily and plant heights were measured twice per week for 45 days finally plants were sacrificially harvested for shoot and root analysis and detailed mycorrhizal analysis setting up of column study and measurements the effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth and biofilter performance was evaluated over a 1 year experiment based upon the results obtained from the colonization period plants of c appressa and f nodosa and t1 treatment were selected for the column study a total of 10 plants per species previously inoculated with t1 and 10 non inoculated plants per species were each transferred to an independent testing column biofilter columns were constructed using 102 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride plastic of 600 mm height containing 50 mm of fine gravel 7 10 mm at the base followed by 300 mm of sand daisy s garden supplies melbourne australia a ponding zone of 150 mm depth was left at the top of the columns a 150 mm deep saturated zone was created at the base of the columns using a 13 mm diameter irrigation pipe black poly tube holman australia attached to the base of the columns with an outlet raised 150 mm above the base the saturated zone consisted of a 50 mm gravel layer underlying a 100 mm layer of autoclaved coarse sand and sugar cane mulch mixture 5 v v the sand and sugar cane mulch mixture were confined to the saturated zone a total of five weeks was allocated as an establishment period with columns watered daily with 2 3 l of tap water during the experiment columns were exposed to a sequential 5 week wet period 2 week dry period 3 week wet period 6 week dry period and 4 week wet period during wet periods columns were dosed twice a week with 2 3 l of semi synthetic stormwater following a stormwater dose volume representative of a biofilter designed to be 2 of its catchment area bratieres et al 2008 this dosing volume corresponds to the annual average rainfall for melbourne victoria of 577 mm ambrose and winfrey 2015 distributed evenly into twice weekly events these doses were equivalent to the runoff from a 5 5 mm rain event during dry periods columns remained unwatered plant height and fv fm of plants were monitored once a week during the study two harvesting periods were performed during the experiment in which four and six columns per treatment per species were harvested after the first dry period and at the end of the experiment respectively in both harvesting periods plant height was measured and shoots and roots were harvested for biomass analysis a total of 10 of roots were also separated from the root mass and stored at 5 c for further determination of mycorrhizal colonization stormwater dosing and water quality analysis semi synthetic stormwater runoff contained slurry collected from a local stormwater wetland sieved 1 mm particle size and mixed with de chlorinated tap water to reach a total suspended solids tss concentration of 150 mg l which is under the standard of a global analysis of urban stormwater composition duncan 1999 a typical urban stormwater nutrient concentration duncan 1999 was reached by adding potassium nitrate ammonium chloride nicotinic acid potassium phosphate and sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate for de chlorination based upon the water analysis of three influent samples collected during the sampling periods semi synthetic stormwater runoff contained total nitrogen tn at 2 23 0 11 mg l total phosphorus tp at 0 32 0 02 mg l nitrate nitrite nox at 1 1 0 0 mg l ammonium nh4 at 0 32 0 06 mg l and filterable reactive phosphorus frp at 0 24 0 01 mg l three sampling events for water analysis were performed during the experiment sampling 1 after the first wet period sampling 2 after the first dry period and sampling 3 after the second dry period samples for determination of inflow and effluent concentration of tn tp nh4 nox and filterable reactive phosphorus frp were analyzed in a national association of testing authorities accredited lab in the school of chemistry at monash university australia using flow injection analysis water samples collected for metals cd cu and zn analysis were first digested fifty milliliters of water samples were digested by adding 10 ml of trace metal grade 65 hno3 to 50 ml of sample and heating in a digestion block to 100 c for approximately 6 h once the sample was reduced to about 5 ml an additional 5 ml of hno3 was added this addition of 5 ml of hno3 was repeated until no brown fumes could be seen following this the solution was reduced again to near dryness 1 ml remaining finally 1 ml of hno3 was added to the digested sample and it was diluted to 50 ml with purified water merck milli q iq 7000 digested samples were analyzed on a thermo fisher icap rq inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer in the living laboratory for water technologies at monash university dry biomass analysis plants were harvested by washing the roots gently with water shoots were separated from roots and dried in an oven at 60 c and weighed for dry biomass determination after 24 h and reweighed every 24 h until they reached a constant weight which was always within 72 h photosynthetic analysis fv fm which represents the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield of psii was determined by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence of dark adapted leaves using a photosynthesis yield analyzer mini pam heinz walz effeltrich germany the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence is frequently used as a measure of plant stress values of over 0 76 are indicative of healthy plants values of 0 6 0 76 are indicative of stress lu and zhang 1999 vargas ortiz et al 2021 during the night a total of 3 leaves per plant were selected randomly for measurement leaves were exposed to a measuring light of minimum light intensity to obtain a stable f0 minimum fluorescence value the maximum quantum yield of psii was estimated by measuring the maximum fluorescence fm after exposing the leaves to a saturating flash of red light eq 1 1 f v f m f m f 0 f m mycorrhizal colonization of roots plant roots were stained using the ink and vinegar method to determine the presence of vam structures vierheilig et al 1998 subsamples of washed roots were taken from each replicate around 10 by volume and placed in 20 ml scintillation vials containing 10 w v koh solution samples were left for 72 h at room temperature until roots were transparent cleared roots were boiled for 3 min in a 5 ink vinegar solution 5 sheaffer fountain blue pen ink and 95 distilled white vinegar 5 acetic acid 95 distilled water then rinsed with distilled water to remove the excess ink vinegar solution roots were de stained by placing them for 1 hour in distilled water containing 3 4 drops of vinegar in 20 ml scintillation vials de stained root samples were stored in a 50 v v lactic acid glycerol solution in 20 ml scintillation vials mycorrhizal colonization in root samples was analyzed using the gridline intersect method giovannetti and mosse 1980 arbuscules vesicles hyphae and spores were observed under an olympus ch 2 light microscope 40x magnification successful mycorrhizal colonization was considered when arbuscules and or vesicles were found in the intersection additional fungal structures indicating the presence of dark septate endophytes were identified and noted as these fungi may also facilitate plant growth in some conditions he et al 2019 data analysis all data analyses were performed using the software graph pad prism 8 0 2 la jolla california usa significant differences between treatments and plant species were analyzed by two way anova significance level p 0 05 and tukey test as a posterior multiple comparison test between treatments and control significance level p 0 05 after confirming normality and homogeneity of variances shapiro wilk and spearman test respectively when the normality and homogeneity of variances test were rejected data were log transformed to satisfy these assumptions before performing parametric analysis of variances results and discussion colonization period a successful mycorrhizal inoculation was achieved in the australian biofilter plant species f nodosa and j australis while growing in biofilter media the dependence of the degree of mycorrhizal colonization in grassland like plants has been shown to depend on both species and the family to which the plant belongs miller et al 2012 here we detected different levels of mycorrhizal colonization in the three species during the colonization period with 91 and 50 colonization in f nodosa and j australis roots but only 17 in c appressa table 1 the degree of colonization that was observed did not depend on the family with both highest and lowest rates in plants belonging to cyperaceae prior field investigation showed relatively low mycorrhizal colonization in the same biofilter plant species winfrey et al 2017 finding less than 19 mycorrhizal colonization in roots of f nodosa in four out of 20 australian biofilters where this species was present and 25 of roots of c appressa colonized with mycorrhizae in only one out of seven biofilters studied where this species was present another species was also found to be mycorrhizal in australian stormwater biofilters j flavidus which is morphologically similar to j australis members of cyperaceae generally considered nonmycorrhizal or rarely mycorrhizal have been observed to be colonized by vam in other ecosystems miller et al 1999 observed 16 species of carex colonized by vam after performing a survey of 23 species of this genus present in uplands and wetlands in the midwest of the united states miller et al 1999 also observed the presence of endophyte fungi in some species in the genus carex different levels of arbuscule and vesicle abundance are thought to reflect differences in host preferences fungal strategies and or plant fungal interaction munkvold et al 2004 we observed differences between plant species for example c appressa one of the most commonly used plants in australian biofilters showed a low percentage of vesicles 3 2 in t1 and 7 4 in t2 and a high percentage of dark septate endophytic fungal structure compared with control plants table 1 while f nodosa presented the highest percentage of arbuscules in t1 76 9 and t2 84 4 mycorrhizal colonization can increase shoot and root growth of plants in our experiment plants of f nodosa and j australis treated with t1 doubled their shoot and roots biomass during this period while plants of c appressa where mycorrhizal colonization was minimal presented no differences in growth between control and treated plants fig 2 successful mycorrhizal colonization and positive impact on plant growth at the seedling stage of f nodosa and j australis indicate that mycorrhizae can contribute to the establishment and survival of seedlings grown in biofilter media as it has been previously observed in other systems for example davidson et al 2016 observed that seedlings of artemisia tridentata inoculated with vam increased survival by 27 compared to non inoculated seedlings which was positively correlated with increases in water use efficiency by plants for the second stage of this research only plants of c appressa and f nodosa were transferred to the columns as clear differences in mycorrhizal colonization and growth responses between these two species would provide a better chance to detect the effects of mycorrhizae on biofilter plants and pollutant removal t1 was selected as a mycorrhizal inoculant for the column study because f nodosa plants presented the highest percentage of arbuscules colonization and growth responses under this treatment additionally the t1 inoculant is commercially available providing practical advantages over the field collected spores in t2 column study the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth during the column study the differences in mycorrhizal colonization between c appressa and f nodosa remained the same as in the colonization period table 2 a mycorrhizal association can improve plant growth and allow plants to tolerate better stress conditions especially water stress augé 2001 gao et al 2020 song et al 2020 in our column study plants harvested after a two week dry period showed that mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa had twice the root and shoot biomass compared to control plants fig 3 as observed during the establishment period by contrast c appressa showed no differences in shoot and root biomass between treatment and control fig 3 increases in growth in mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa observed in this study could be associated with an increase of water and nutrient supply to the plant by mycorrhizae which has been observed in other studies govindarajulu et al 2005 van der heijden et al 1998 this did not occur in c appressa or the effect was not large enough to be detected photosynthetic efficiency results showed that after a two week dry period all plants decreased their photosynthetic activity slightly from 0 77 0 01 to 0 73 0 02 in c appressa and from 0 84 0 01 to 0 81 0 01 in f nodosa in both control and treated plants after the six week dry period all plants were dead evidenced by average fv fm values below 0 2 in all plants fig 4 which indicates plants suffered severe stress due to water limitation during this period still the mycorrhizal colonization was high in inoculated plants of f nodosa following this six week dry period which was measured in the remaining columns the deprivation of water affected the benefit of mycorrhizal colonization on plant growth fig 2 however it is promising that plant growth remained improved in inoculated plants after a 2 week dry period in melbourne only about 5 of storms have a 14 day or longer antecedent dry period ambrose and winfrey 2015 from a practical standpoint the improvement of plant growth during most dry periods is a positive outcome for managing plant health in these systems the effect of mycorrhizal colonization on nutrient and heavy metal removal mycorrhizal studies on natural ecosystems indicate that this fungus could have an indirect and or a direct effect on nutrient and heavy metal removal in biofilters payne et al 2015 found a positive correlation between plant root length and tn removal from stormwater biofilter in our column study the first sampling of the outflow showed that biofilters with mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa which had double root biomass increased tn removal by 10 compared to biofilters planted with non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 during the second harvest sampling 3 where no difference in shoot and root biomass was observed between control and treated plants of f nodosa no differences in tn removal were observed between biofilters planted with mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 these results indicate that during a two week dry period an increase in root growth in mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa could have led to an increase in nitrogen removal from stormwater mycorrhizal plants could have improved nutrient removal in our biofilter columns by the direct absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus by mycorrhizal structures govindarajulu et al 2005 observed that extraradical hyphae of vam can take up inorganic nitrogen from soil and incorporate it into plants by intraradical hyphal structures the mycorrhizal structure known as arbuscule is directly involved in the translocation of nutrients from soil to plant roots parniske et al 2008 in our research after the two week dry period the percent colonization of inoculated f nodosa was 71 8 overall with 54 5 of root sites containing arbuscules table 2 only 25 8 of root sites were colonized by mycorrhizae in c appressa with only 9 5 of these sites containing arbuscules the water quality analysis performed after two weeks of dry period sampling 2 showed higher removal of tn tp and phosphate from synthetic stormwater runoff in biofilters with mycorrhizal plants of f nodosa compared to the biofilters planted with non mycorrhizal plants fig 5 and 6 in contrast biofilters planted with treated plants of c appressa did not show differences in any of these nutrient removals compared to the control fig 5 and 6 after six weeks of dry period sampling 3 no differences in nutrient removal were observed between biofilters with treated and control plants of both f nodosa and c appressa fig 5 and 6 this is most likely due to the death of vegetation by exposure to extreme drought stress at this stage treated plants of f nodosa still had a high percentage of vesicles 77 and arbuscules 45 5 colonizing their roots which indicates that under less than 6 weeks of a dry period these plants could still be benefited by a mycorrhizal treatment recovering faster from water stress a study comparing a variety of dry period lengths in biofilters with mycorrhizal inoculated plants would be needed to confirm this the concentrations of heavy metals in stormwater and column effluent were analyzed during the three sampling periods table 3 in biofilters heavy metals are mainly removed by sorption to filter media davis et al 2003 which in turn depends on filter media properties such as organic matter content and saturation level uptake of metals from soil by vegetation can also occur especially by hyperaccumulators lu et al 2020 however few hyperaccumulators have been tested in biofilters lange et al 2020 mycorrhizae can increase plant tolerance to heavy metal by improving metal translocation and accumulation aloui et al 2011 lu et al 2020 raklami et al 2021 for example a colonization of sphagneticola calendulaceae with the arbuscular mycorrhizae funneliformis mosseae increased plant biomass and the concentration of cd in plant tissues substantially lu et al 2020 at 25 50 and 100 mg cd kg 1 level in the soil phenomena also observed in other plant species hu et al 2013 our experiment showed 10 higher cd removal from stormwater runoff in biofilters planted with mycorrhizae inoculated f nodosa after the first dry period which indicates that mycorrhizal fungi could contribute to cd sorption processes and translocation of cd from stormwater to plant tissues previously lange et al 2020 studied the effect of dryopteris filix mass plants inoculated with mycorrhizae on cd removal in biofilters exposed to wet and dry periods finding no differences between treated plants and control in any of the periods although mycorrhizal colonization was not confirmed in the lange et al 2020 study we expect different plant species will react differently to mycorrhizal inoculation palacios and winfrey 2020 so more species and mycorrhizal inoculation strategies should be tested in our experiment the high percentage of mycorrhizal colonization above 80 achieved in plants of f nodosa including 54 5 of arbuscules colonizing the roots could be the reason that a positive cd removal was observed in biofilters with treated plants a benefit of mycorrhizae in the absorption of other heavy metals such as zn and cu have been observed in other mycorrhizal plants raklami et al 2021 however this was not observed in our experiment the positive effect of mycorrhizae on plant growth of f nodosa as well as on nutrient and cd removal from stormwater at the scale of our column study indicate the importance of scaling up this research to a larger laboratory scale study and or to existing biofilters where more biofilter plants and vam species could be tested at a larger scale van der heijden et al 1998 studied the effect of 1 2 4 8 and 14 vam species on 11 plant species in 70 microcosms observing that the increasing number of vam in the soil was associated with a decreasing soil p and increasing plant p similarly experiments at a larger scale are needed to prove that a similar level of mycorrhizal percentage observed in our study can be achieved in plants growing in existing biofilters and improve nutrient and metal removal from stormwater conclusions a high percentage of mycorrhizal inoculation can be achieved in some biofilter plants such as f nodosa and j australis improving their shoot and root growth in other species such as c appressa a mycorrhizal inoculation could be less successful without affecting plant growth our column study revealed that mycorrhizae can increase shoot and root biomass of f nodosa during wet periods and continue after a two week dry period both increases in root biomass and levels of arbuscule abundance observed in f nodosa could directly improve tn tp phosphate and cd removal from stormwater external mycelium in the soil of biofilters planted with mycorrhizal plants could also act as an extension of plant roots providing more water to increase plant drought tolerance palacios and winfrey 2021 by demonstrating high mycorrhizal inoculation and presence of arbuscules in plants growing in biofilters and subsequent increases in shoot and root growth as well as nutrient and heavy metal removal the results of this study suggest that inoculating biofilter plants could lead to better outcomes for managing stormwater with biofiltration and maintaining healthy biofilter plants during dry periods funding this work was supported by monash university faculty of engineering

16756,monochloramine nh2cl is increasingly used as alternative disinfectant to free chlorine in industrial plants after use in cooling systems the waters are released to the environment and residual nh2cl may be discharged into the receiving waters as nh2cl is suspected to exhibit toxicity towards aquatic organisms a proper risk assessment of its occurrence in environmental waters is needed to prevent adverse effects on wildlife for this purpose a comprehensive model simulating monochloramine loss in natural riverine waters was developed this model incorporates the following processes i autodecomposition ii reaction with nitrite and bromide iii oxidation with dissolved organic carbon doc iv oxidation with organic fraction of suspended particulate matter spm v reactions in bottom sediments and vi volatilization the model was also designed to conduct uncertainty and sensitivity analysis it was tested on several french rivers submitted to discharges of monochloraminated effluents and on several seasonal conditions uncertainty analysis allowed evaluation of confidence intervals related to nh2cl half lives in natural waters it was shown that simulation intervals are in good agreement with experimental data obtained on the same rivers sensitivity analysis using an efast variance decomposition approach allowed identification of the most influential parameters on half life determination it was shown that the kinetic rate describing rapid reaction of nh2cl with doc is by far the most sensitive parameter demonstrating the predominance of such reactions in the loss process variables or parameters involved in temperature dependence temperature and activation energy can also significantly influence model results to a lesser extent wind velocity is the most sensitive parameter explaining uncertainty in the prediction of volatilization with a high level of interactions with other parameters showing that loss through volatilization can be essential in some specific conditions only this study then identified the most important research priorities for improving the prediction of nh2cl half lives in natural rivers keywords monochloramine degradation probability density functions uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis efast 1 introduction chloramination is widely used for drinking water secondary disinfection but also as a biocide process in some industrial systems for example some french nuclear power plants npps use the chloramination process to produce monochloramine nh2cl able to prevent the development of pathogenic organisms in cooling water systems like naegleria fowleri or legionella pneumophila coniglio et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 goudot et al 2014 kahler et al 2011 compared to free chlorine nh2cl is a weaker disinfectant wolfe et al 1984 but it is also less reactive with organic matter present in cooling waters it is then supposed to provide a longer lasting disinfection effect and to produce less disinfection by products dbps like haloacetics acids haa or eventually trihalomethanes thm vikesland 2001 nh2cl is then increasingly used as alternative disinfectant to free chlorine in industrial plants after use in cooling systems the waters are released to the environment and residual nh2cl may be discharged into the receiving waters since nh2cl is suspected to exhibit toxicity towards aquatic organisms environment canada 2001 trofe et al 1980 a proper risk assessment of its occurrence in environmental waters is needed to prevent adverse effects on wildlife in order to fully assess the environmental impact of nh2cl more information about its stability under environmental conditions is needed in addition to ecotoxicological data even if it is less reactive than free chlorine nh2cl remains inherently unstable at neutral ph values first even without the presence of reactive inorganic or organic substances nh2cl is submitted to auto decomposition through a complex set of reactions that ultimately result in the oxidation of ammonia and the reduction of active chlorine jafvert and valentine 1992 ozekin et al 1996 vikesland 2001 zhang et al 2017 secondly in natural waters nh2cl loss can be enhanced by oxidation reactions with natural organic matter nom bromide and nitrite margerum et al 1994 trofe et al 1980 vikesland et al 1998 nom oxidation by monochloramine is particularly important because it results in dbps formation cowman and singer 1996 diehl et al 2000 richardson and postigo 2011 nh2cl loss can also occur in presence of riverine bottom sediments sacher et al 2019 finally nh2cl can exchange at the water atmosphere interface and volatilize garcia and anderson 2018 a model describing nh2cl autodecomposition was developed by vikesland et al 2001 the model combines the complex set of reactions that ammonia and chlorine undergo in aqueous solution and it can predict chloramine auto decomposition for a wide range of reaction conditions reactions involving bromide and nitrite two inorganic species that can catalyze nh2cl loss in waters were also added in more recent models wahman and speitel 2012 duirk et al 2005 2002 modelled nh2cl loss in the presence of organic matter i e aldrich humic acids or organic extracts from rivers it was observed that nh2cl loss was accelerated in the presence of organic matter om via two kinetic stages i e biphasic kinetics i e a fast nh2cl demand and a slow long term loss duirk et al 2005 2002 assumed that nh2cl directly reacted with both the fast and slow reactive fractions in the om structure and calculated kinetic rates for each of the oxidation reactions with om more recently garcia 2018 also incorporated nh2cl volatilization as well as reaction into sediments in a loss model garcia 2018 garcia and anderson 2018 all these works form the fundamentals for creating a comprehensive model describing the loss kinetics of nh2cl in natural waters it remains however difficult to estimate the confidence level one can place in model results since many parameters and environmental physico chemical variables used for simulating nh2cl fate in natural surface waters show large uncertainty or variability yet most codes dealing with environmental chemistry are not designed for conducting multi parametric global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis parameter values and environmental variables are instead set at best estimate or default values without clear definition of what is a best estimate or default value then simulations performed with best estimate or default parameter values do not provide alone a good idea of the confidence level one can place in model results a model can indeed provide results on average but the confidence interval can be large even over several orders of magnitude uncertainty associated to parameters and forcing variables involved in the loss model can be schematically classified in natural variability nh2cl loss in waters depends on natural conditions like e g ph temperature alkalinity ammonia and nitrite no2 concentrations bromide br concentration natural organic matter nom concentration and quality organic content in suspended particulate matter spm and bottom sediments etc yet such conditions may show high variations within and among aquatic systems and may show significant variations over time e g seasonal variations parametric uncertainty i e incompleteness of knowledge nh2cl loss in aquatic systems is largely governed by the kinetic rates that describe each of the autodecomposition or oxidation reactions for some of these reactions where robust experimental data are lacking kinetic rates may be highly uncertain thus the concepts of natural variability and knowledge uncertainty are different variability is an inherent property of the system being modelled while knowledge uncertainty is dependent of the current state of knowledge regarding the system in the present paper variability and knowledge uncertainty were combined and will be termed thereafter by the global term uncertainty evaluating uncertainty in the estimation of nh2cl loss for a specific river through the integration of both natural variability and lack of knowledge can improve tools dedicated to risk assessment of nh2cl and its dbps in aquatic systems sensitivity analysis can complement such uncertainty analysis to identify which input parameters contribute most to the output variation sensitivity analysis is the study of how the variation in the output of a model in our case predicted nh2cl loss can be apportioned qualitatively or quantitatively to different sources of variation in our case variability in natural conditions and uncertainty in parameters involved in the comprehensive loss model sensitivity analysis highlights the inputs that have the greatest influence on the modeling results it therefore provides useful insights for model builders and users insights from sensitivity analysis can be used for i identification of key sources of uncertainty ii identification of key controllable sources of variability and iii model refinement and identification of research priorities taking into account this background the main objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate global uncertainty in the prediction of nh2cl loss in several french rivers through the probabilistic use of a comprehensive model incorporating i autodecomposition ii reaction with nitrite and bromide iii oxidation with dissolved organic carbon doc iv oxidation with organic fraction of spm v reactions in bottom sediments and vi volatilization the rivers that were selected for this study were chosen because they are used as cooling source of npps and may thus receive monochloraminated effluents besides they can cover different situations in terms of hydraulic conditions and associated dilution sediment formation processes suspended particulate matter concentrations etc and physico chemical characteristics temperatures ph organic matter etc 2 to conduct sensitivity analysis able to identify the main sources of uncertainty in nh2cl loss prediction 2 material and methods 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model for auto decomposition the model describing nh2cl auto decomposition is described in detail in jafvert and valentine 1992 ozekin et al 1996 and is refined in vikesland et al 2001 the main reactions are briefly summarized here with their kinetic rates for forward and reverse directions respectively the effect of temperature is also indicated for some of these reactions according to the arrhenius relationship table 1 the model includes several kinds of reaction two substitution hydrolysis reactions involving hocl and ammonia or the chlorinated ammonia derivatives reactions 1 and 2 disproportionation reactions of the chloramine species reaction 3 these reactions are acid catalysed and several proton donating species can thus accelerate monochloramine decay the main catalysts that were identified so far are proton h and carbonate species this explains that the forward kinetic rate for reaction 3 depends on h hco3 and h2co3 concentrations identically the reverse kinetic rate for reaction 3 is expressed in mol 2 l2 h 1 and depends on the reaction products nhcl2 and nh3 as well as on the cumulative concentration of proton donating species i e here h hco3 and h2co3 disproportionation reactions are limited by the rate of formation of dichloramine nhcl2 which thus depends on factors like ph temperature alkalinity and ionic strength once dichloramine forms it decomposes via a series of rapid redox reactions involving an unidentified intermediate and producing unidentified products reactions 4 to 7 since the previous reactions are influenced by ammonia and carbonate species the equilibrium constants of the acid base couples h2co3 hco3 pka 6 4 hco3 co3 2 pka 10 3 nh4 nh3 pka 9 3 and hocl ocl pka 7 5 are taken into account in the model vikesland et al 2001 2 1 2 model for reactions with nitrites and bromides some inorganic compounds in particular nitrite hao et al 1994 margerum et al 1994 valentine 1985 wahman and speitel 2012 and bromide bousher et al 1989 trofe et al 1980 were shown to enhance nh2cl loss in theory monochloramine reacts with nitrite according to the stoichiometric reaction reaction 8 margerum et al 1994 proposed a reaction mechanism involving the formation of a reactive intermediate nitryl chloride no2cl and its degradation by two parallel pathways a reaction with no2 to form n2o4 and a dissociation reaction producing no2 and cl these intermediates ultimately lead to the production of nitrate consistent with this mechanism margerum et al 1994 proposed the following kinetic relationship to describe nh2cl loss due to reactions with nitrite 1 d n h 2 cl dt k 8 1 h n h 2 cl no 2 1 k 8 2 k 8 4 no 2 k 8 1 k 8 4 n h 3 1 k 8 2 k 8 4 no 2 similarly hocl also reacts with nitrites according to the stoichiometric reaction wahman and speitel 2012 reaction 9 according to margerum et al 1994 the kinetic rate k 9 f can be expressed as 2 k 9 f k 9 1 no 2 1 k 9 2 k 9 4 no 2 k 9 1 k 9 4 o h 1 k 9 2 k 9 4 no 2 trofe et al 1980 proposed the following pathway for bromochloramine formation from nh2cl involving the oxidation of bromide by the monochlorammonium ion nh3cl produced by the nh2cl ionization reactions 10 consistent with this pathway the overall kinetic relationship was proposed to describe nh2cl loss due to reactions with bromide oxidation 3 d n h 2 cl dt 2 k 10 f n h 2 cl b r h to account for nh2cl loss due to reactions with nitrite and bromide the expression given by eq 1 2 and 3 were included as nh2cl loss pathways in the comprehensive model 2 1 3 model for reactions with dissolved organic matter the model describing the reaction of nh2cl with om was first developed by duirk et al 2005 2002 and then completed by zhang et al 2018 considering that nh2cl loss in presence of om shows two kinetic stages with a significant loss occurring within the first few minutes of contact time and a more extended loss duirk et al 2002 proposed to consider two fractions of om the first one corresponding to an immediate nh2cl demand and the second one corresponding to a prolonged demand over time they however observed that kinetic constants of the long term reaction decreased with increases of nh2cl and ammonia concentrations they suggested that free chlorine hocl competitively reacts with om explaining such experimental observations to overcome this limitation zhu and zhang 2016 and zhang et al 2018 incorporated in the comprehensive model reactions between om and free chlorine released from nh2cl auto decomposition therefore the duirk s model for nh2cl loss accounting for two pathways was considered i the reaction between nh2cl and the doc fraction involved in rapid demand reaction 11 ii the reaction between nh2cl and the doc fraction involved in long lasting demand reaction 12 duirk et al 2002 2005 as well as zhang et al 2018 thus predict that only a portion of the total doc is reactive towards nh2cl and thus define d o c f a s t s f a s t d o c and d o c s l o w s s l o w d o c reactions 11 and 12 thus depend on four parameters i e the fast and slow fractions in doc s f a s t and s s l o w and the kinetic rates k 11 f and k 12 f for limiting the number of parameters that have to be managed we merge these parameters defining 4 k 11 f s fast k 11 f and 5 k 12 f s slow k 12 f our approach is thus in agreement with the previous approaches since the kinetic rates k11 f and k12 f that we used in the present paper were corrected to correspond to those calibrated by duirk et al 2002 2005 and zhang et al 2018 the reaction of free chlorine hocl with om was represented as reaction 13 rivers investigated in the present paper may show a wide range of temperatures leading to different degradation kinetics it was then assumed that the kinetic rates k 11 f k 12 f and k 13 f follow the arrhenius relationship 6 k i f k i f 25 e e a doc r 1 t 1 298 where k i f 25 represent the kinetic rates k 11 f k 12 f or k 13 f at 25 c l mol 1 h 1 e a d o c is the activation energy for reactions 11 12 and 13 j mol 1 r the ideal gas constant 8 3 j mol 1 k 1 and t the temperature k 2 1 4 model for reaction with bottom sediments garcia 2018 experimentally studied the loss of nh2cl in sediment remaining at the bottom or well mixed in the reaction chamber from four different surface waters collected in california usa and they calculated the kinetic rate of the loss reaction as 7 d n h 2 cl dt k sed n h 2 cl the loss of nh2cl was attributed predominantly to the organic matter and other reduced species such as reduced iron manganese and sulfide present in sediment garcia 2018 observed that the loss rate k s e d in h 1 can be correlated to the organic content in sediment or to the total oxidant demand the relationship they fitted on six experimental data can be written as 8 ln k sed a kpoc f oc sed sediment b kpoc where f o c s e d is the organic matter content in sediments unitless s e d i m e n t is the sediment concentration in the river system g l 1 a k p o c and b k p o c are regression coefficients such a relationship was however fitted for specific experimental conditions i e for specific sediment concentrations i e high sediment concentrations up to about 230 g l 1 considering that the k s e d value is proportional to the sediment concentration is a reasonable assumption the more sediment there is the faster the nh2cl decay therefore the equation described above must proportionate with the concentration in sediment present in the investigated river therefore a model able to calculate the average bottom sediment concentration was required for each targeted river considering its specific hydraulic conditions since this model is described in detail in e g ciffroy 2018 and is available in the merlin expo tool ciffroy et al 2016 2011 its mathematic basis are not described here briefly speaking modeling of the deposition and resuspension of fine particles allows to simulate the time dependent concentration of sediments in a river characterized by its geometry water depth flow rate and spm concentration we used these simulated time dependent sediment concentrations to calculate the average bottom sediment concentration in the investigated rivers which was used to estimate a relevant k s e d value assumed to be proportional to the value estimated by garcia 2018 under his specific experimental conditions 2 1 5 model for reaction with poc as indicated above garcia 2018 experimentally studied the loss of nh2cl in bottom sediments but also in well mixed sediment in the reaction chamber these latter experimental conditions are representative of loss reaction with suspended particulate organic carbon assimilated to the well mixed sediments studied by garcia 2018 a similar model as those defined for bottom sediment can then be assumed i e 9 ln k poc τ suspension a kpoc f oc spm spm b kpoc where f o c s p m is the organic matter content in spm unitless s p m is the suspended particulate matter concentration in the river system g l 1 a k p o c and b k p o c are regression coefficients the factor τ s u s p e n s i o n unitless was introduced by garcia 2018 to represent the higher reactivity of organic matter in suspended particles than in bottom sediments where accessibility to reactive sites is limited 2 1 6 model for volatilization since models simulating the fate of nh2cl in waters were generally dedicated to closed water distribution systems they never took into consideration volatilization however garcia and anderson 2018 studied the fate of nh2cl in open systems and observed that the nh2cl loss in open or aerated vessels in contact to atmosphere may be significantly higher than loss in vessels without headspace they thus estimated the adimensional henry s constant to be about 1 7 10 2 at 20 c this value being representative of a semi volatile compound volatilisation of semi volatile substances at the air water interface is generally modelled using the stagnant boundary theory two film model the chemical being assumed to diffuse across two layers stagnant water layer and stagnant air layer characterized by two resistances in series ciffroy 2018 loizeau et al 2018 according to this approach the net flux from water to the atmosphere fwater atm in mol m 2 s 1 is driven by the difference in gaseous concentration between air and surface water according to the fick s law the gaseous concentration of nh2cl in river water is assumed to be in equilibrium with the dissolved concentration n h 2 c l w a t e r this equilibrium is simulated by the adimensional henry s law constant h rt thus the flux of chemical from water to atmosphere is given by 10 d n h 2 cl water dt mt c water atm h rt n h 2 cl water n h 2 cl atm where r the ideal gas constant 8 3 j mol 1 k 1 t the temperature k h pa m3 mol 1 or j mol 1 is the dimensional henry s law constant n h 2 c l w a t e r is the concentration of nh2cl in river water in mol l 1 n h 2 c l a t m is the concentration of nh2cl in the atmosphere in mol l 1 assumed to be zero m t c w a t e r a t m is the mass transfer coefficient at the water atmosphere interface in h 1 the first resistance represents the resistance to diffusion on the upper part of the interface i e in above atmosphere a gas film mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm g in m h 1 can be calculated according to the approach proposed by schwarzenbach et al 2016 that relates mtcwater atm g to wind velocity uwind at height 10 m in m s 1 mtcwater atm g is also assumed to depend on the chemical molar mass according to the following relationship 11 mt c water atm g 36 0 2 u wind 0 3 m h 2 o m molar 0 3 the second resistance represents the resistance to diffusion on the lower part of the interface i e in water a water film mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm w in m h 1 can be calculated according to the approach proposed by wanninkhof et al 1991 and hornbuckle et al 1994 that also relates mtcwater atm w to wind velocity at height 10 m bidleman and mcconnell 1995 mtcwater atm w is also assumed to depend on the schmidt number of the chemical which is linearly related to the squared root of its molar mass according to these assumptions the water film mass transfer coefficient can be calculated as follows 12 mt c water atm w 0 0045 u wind 1 64 m c o 2 m molar 0 25 where m co2 g mol 1 is the molar mass of carbon dioxide the total mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm is then given by 13 mt c water atm 1 depth r t river mt c water atm w mt c water atm g r t river mt c water atm w h mt c water atm g 2 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis ua and sa the comprehensive loss model described above was coded under ecolego and the merlin expo platform ciffroy et al 2016 the capability of merlin expo for performing uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of complex models with a wide variety of approaches was demonstrated for other scenarios ciffroy 2020a b ciffroy and benedetti 2018 fierens et al 2016 radomyski et al 2016 ciffroy et al 2011 van holderbeke et al 2016 and guided this choice the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed according to the following steps 2 2 1 determination of probability density functions for physico chemical variables for running the model it is first necessary to assign representative values to the following physico chemical variables initial nh2cl concentration ph hco3 nh4 no2 br doc organic matter content in spm and sediments temperature for each of the targeted rivers where npps use nh2cl as disinfection product i e the loire garonne rhône moselle seine vienne and meuse rivers initial nh2cl concentrations in rivers were chosen from simulations presented in sacher et al 2019 most experimental studies found in the literature and dealing with nh2cl loss were undertaken with nh2cl concentrations around some mg l for example duirk et al 2005 2006 and zhang et al 2018 studied nh2cl loss in presence of natural organic matter at concentrations of 1 3 and 10 3 mg l 1 and 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 mg l 1 respectively at such concentrations saturation effects can be observed since fast reacting sites of organic matter are not in excess compared to nh2cl such concentrations are however not those expected in natural media also downstream of industrial plants according to the simulation presented in sacher et al 2019 nh2cl concentrations in natural rivers are rather some μg l 1 and not mg l 1 to be as close as possible to natural conditions we therefore simulate nh2cl concentrations of 1 to 10 μg l in this concentration range considering the concentration of fast reacting sites calibrated from previous papers duirk et al 2005 2006 zhang et al 2018 we do not observe any effect of the nh2cl initial concentration as previously indicated the other physico chemical variables may show significant temporal natural variability for integrating such variability in the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis each variable is represented by a probability density functions pdfs these pdfs and the methods used for building them are presented in supporting information si all the pdfs determined according to the procedures described in si are representative of the variability all over the year discharges of nh2cl in rivers by npps occur however essentially in summer yet differences in among seasons can be considered for some variables seasonal pdfs were then tested for the physico chemical variables required by the model significant differences were observed for temperature only specific pdfs were then derived for temperature under summer conditions restricting the datasets for the period june september simulation were then run using respectively the whole year conditions and the summer conditions respectively 2 2 2 determination of probability density functions for model parameters similarly pdfs for model parameters were derived from literature review table 2 ranges for the kinetic rates describing the reaction of nh2cl and hocl with nitrites reactions 8 and 9 were taken from wahman and speitel 2012 they reported previous published data from johnson and margerum 1991 and margerum et al 1994 and re analysed them they also derived parameter values for some of the involved reactions from their own experimental data for each kinetic rate uniform pdfs were built considering the extreme values reported in wahman and speitel 2012 from previous data and their own data luh and marinas 2014 studied the effect of ph bromide and nh2cl concentrations phosphate and ammonia concentrations on bromochloramine formation from nh2cl they thus conducted 65 experiments under various conditions and determined for each of them the value of the k 10 f kinetic parameter describing reaction with bromide a statistical analysis of these values allowed to determine a normal pdf for k 10 f to our knowledge no activation energy related to the reaction of nh2cl with doc is available in the literature to obtain expected orders of magnitude for the e a d o c parameter eq 6 data related to specific organic reactants or others were then collected kimura et al 2015 studied the reaction of nh2cl and acetaldehyde ch3cho a common ozone and free chlorine disinfection by product between 2 and 30 c activation energy of the forward and reverse reactions were determined to be 3 04 and 45 2 kj mol 1 respectively qiang et al 2014 studied the degradation of methiocarb a commonly used carbamate pesticide by nh2cl between 6 and 33 c the apparent activation energy of the reaction was determined to be 34 kj mol 1 mckay et al 2013 investigated the temperature dependent kinetics of the reaction between nh2cl and h2o2 between 11 and 38 c the activation energy of the reaction was determined to be 51 5 kj mol 1 gleason et al 2017 studied the temperature dependant reaction between hydroxyl radicals and nh2cl over the range 10 40 c and determined the activation energy of the reaction to be 8 6 kj mol 1 cimetiere et al 2009 determined activation energy for the reaction of nh2cl with resorcinol of 40 kj mol 1 similar activation energy can be expected for the reaction of monochloramine with phenolic structures within nom from this background it may then be expected that the activation energy for reactions 11 12 and 13 e a d o c ranges between 1 and 100 kj mol 1 we then used log uniform pdfs for describing the e d o c 11 uncertainty with minimum and maximum at 1 and 100 kj mol 1 duirk et al 2005 2002 zhu and zhang 2016 garcia 2018 and zhang et al 2018 fitted the k 11 f r e f k 12 f r e f and k 13 f r e f parameters for several natural organic matters nom originated from different aquatic media including nom extracted from the loire river in duirk et al 2005 all the collected data were used to build pdfs garcia and anderson 2018 experimentally determined the dimensionless henry s law constant h of nh2cl at five different temperatures 11 16 21 27 and 32 c experiments were conducted in sealed vials with zero headspace and in solutions open to the atmosphere with and without aeration values ranged from 19 to 111 pa m3 mol 1 corresponding to 8 10 3 to 4 4 10 2 for the adimensional henry s law constant such values are consistent with qsar predictions 49 6 pa m3 mol 1 the five experimental values found by garcia and anderson 2018 as well as the qsar prediction were used to build a log normal distribution since the number of values is limited standard deviations were maximized according to the chi square estimation described in supporting information si garcia 2018 fitted a relationship between k s e d and the organic carbon content in sediments from experimental data obtained with sediments originated from four different rivers these data were used to estimate pdfs for the intercept and slope of the relationship i e the a k p o c and b k p o c parameters with required unit corrections to be consistent with our model 2 2 3 uncertainty analysis once all the parameters were assigned pdfs that describe the knowledge the user has about each parameter or its natural variability merlin expo provides the user with a pdf editor and allows to use a monte carlo random generator merlin expo then runs simulations with all the parameter samples that were previously generated and provides summary statistics for describing the uncertainty of each selected endpoint 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis through the efast approach the sensitivity analysis was performed by the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 which is a variance based global sensitivity analysis method independent of any assumptions regarding the relationship linear or monotonic between input parameters and outputs if v denotes the total variance of output y in our case the nh2cl half life the following decomposition can be written v i 1 n v i 1 i j n v i j v 1 n where n is the number of parameters vi the variance due to parameter xi vij the variance due to the interaction between parameters xi and xj etc efast computes both first order si and total sensitivity indices tsi as s i v i v var e y x i var y and t s i k i s k where i represents all of the sets containing index i for example in a model with three parameters we would have ts1 s1 s12 s13 s123 the si measures the main first order effect of each individual parameter xi on the model output while total sensitivity index tsi measures all higher order effects i e considering interactions that can be attributed to that parameter the efast method is based on monodimensional decomposition of the model along a sinusoidal search curve in the n dimensional parameter space the search curve is defined by a set of parametric equations the range of variation in efast is explored for all parameters simultaneously efast is independent of any assumptions regarding the relationship between input parameters and outputs it provides the fraction of the output variance due to each input parameter uncertain input parameters with small first order indices but high total sensitivity indices affect the model output mainly through interactions 2 2 6 experimental data simulations were compared to experimental data presented in sacher et al 2019 with personal communication for raw experimental data 190 experiments were performed to study the loss kinetics of nh2cl in surface water samples from the same rivers as those targeted by the present study excepting the vienne river batch experiments were conducted in open reactors with natural waters originating from the investigated rivers under relevant controlled environmental conditions at three different temperatures 14 20 and 30 c nh2cl residual concentrations were measured at t0 t0 5 min t0 30 min t0 2 h t0 4 h t0 6 h t0 20 h t0 22 h t0 24 h and t0 28 h allowing to evaluate the nh2cl half life in the system the nh2cl initial concentrations tested by sacher et al 2019 are in the range 0 5 100 μg l 1 for experiments performed without sediment most of them around 1 μg l 1 such concentrations are close to what expected in natural systems downstream of industrial plants initial concentrations experimentally tested by sacher et al 2019 and simulated in our model are then consistent and they are also relevant with expected concentrations in natural systems experimental procedure is described in detail in sacher et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 deterministic simulations deterministic simulations were first performed i e using the best estimate values for each physico chemical variable and parameter table in si for physico chemical variables and table 2 for model parameters the loss of nh2cl under such parametric conditions for all the rivers is shown in fig 1 the results thus obtained showed that nh2cl loss in water is log linearly related to time describing an overall first order loss kinetics loss half life defined as the time required for eliminating half of the initial concentration can then be further used as a summary indicator of the loss kinetics 3 2 uncertainty analysis 10 000 runs of the complete model described above were conducted with 10 000 random combinations of variables and parameters to evaluate the uncertainty of half life of nh2cl in water for all the simulations that were performed half lives follow log normal pdfs as checked through qq plots results not shown the main summary statistics of such log normal distributions are presented in fig 2 through boxplots where the central line represents the median the limits of the boxes represent the first and third quartiles q1 and q3 and the ends of the whiskers represent the 10th and 90th percentiles of the 10 000 simulated half lives in the same figure we also indicated the experimental data provided by sacher et al 2019 for comparison data obtained under the without sediment label for each targeted river first it was observed that simulated half lives are in good agreement with experimental data all the experimental data are indeed included within the 80th confidence interval ranging from the 10th and 90th percentiles excepting some unexpected very low half lives observed in the rhône river with a majority of data included within the interquartile range from q1 and q3 except for some data of the rhône river a more refined comparison between experimental and simulated data can also be undertaken by discriminating the conditions under which experimental data were obtained in particular sacher et al 2019 generated data at three different temperatures 14 20 and 30 c and they observed that nh2cl decay is considerably accelerated by temperature in fig 2 we then distinguished experimental data according to experimental temperature conditions temperature ranges reported in supporting information for each river showed that the most representative experiments were those performed at 14 c and to a lesser extentat 20 c if we then restrict the comparison between experimental data and simulated results only for the most representative experimental conditions i e 14 and 20 c i e excluding the triangle orange points in fig 2 it can be concluded that uncertainty derived from simulations is in good agreement with variability in experimental half lives second significant differences were observed among rivers by comparing simulation results with the median ranging from about 2 8 hfor the vienne river to about 7 9 for the rhône river the rhône river may show a slower loss kinetics for different reasons i when analysing the physico chemical variables presented in the table available in supporting information it may be observed that the rhône river shows the lowest mean doc concentrations 1 8 10 3 g l 1 and one of the lowest mean poc content mean value 3 4 while the vienne river shows the highest mean doc concentrations 5 1 10 3 g l 1 given the main contribution of the reaction with doc see sensitivity analysis below and to a lesser extent with poc in nh2cl loss such differences may explain the ranking in simulated half lives among rivers ii the quantity of sediments expressed in g l 1 is estimated to be lower in the rhône river than in other rivers in particular the vienne river showing one of the highest accumulation of bottom sediments see table in si line quantity of sediments iii volatilization is potentially more important in small rivers where the depth is low like in the vienne river than in large rivers like the rhône river since the total mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm is inversely proportional to the river depth all the simulations analyzed above were generated by considering variability in physico chemical conditions all over the year as indicated in 2 2 1 simulations were also performed considering summer conditions june to september as it is expected to be the time period the most favorable for pathogenic organism development river temperature rises and consequently for disinfection treatment application compared to predictions performed when the all seasons variability is taken into account predicted half lives under summer conditions are significantly lowered fig 2 besides since natural variability is lower when only one season is considered and as a consequence since pdf standard deviations are smaller uncertainty range also significantly decreases with lower extreme values in general the half life median is lowered by about 1 0 h when only summer conditions are considered it may be explained by a highest temperatures observed in summer accelerating the kinetic rate constants when nh2cl is preferentially used as a disinfectant in summer like in npps pdfs derived from summer conditions can then be used instead of all seasons simulations 3 3 sensitivity analysis the efast method was performed to generate a quantitative ranking of variables and parameters involved in the model first and total order efast sensitivity index noted respectively si and tsi are presented in fig 3 parameters are ranked according to their total order index the most sensitive parameter is by far the kinetic rate k 11 f 25 describing the rapid reaction of nh2cl with doc this result confirms the predominance of reactions with doc as reported in the literature duirk et al 2005 2002 zhang et al 2018 the high sensitivity index of the parameter k 11 f 25 also results from its high intrinsic uncertainty as shown by its log normal pdf showing a high geometric standard deviation gsd 4 71 this high gsd can be explained by two factors first the natural variability in organic matter quality in rivers leads to contrasted k 11 f 25 reported in the literature only 10 values from two papers ranging over one order of magnitude secondly the limited number of available data it must be reminded here that when the number of data is limited the chi square method described in si is used for estimating the maximum expected value of the gsd yet the lower the number of data the higher the gsd one priority for limiting the uncertainty in the estimation of the nh2cl half life in river water would be then to generate new data for the k 11 f 25 parameter describing reaction with doc even if k 11 f 25 is the most sensitive parameter for all the rivers its sensitivity index depends on the river both the first order and total order index are very high for the rhône and loire rivers showing that this parameter explains alone a great part of the uncertainty in half life prediction while it is significantly lower for e g the garonne and the seine rivers such differences revealed that reaction with doc remains the most important pathway for nh2cl loss in all the rivers but that its relative contribution may vary among rivers among the most influential parameters identified by the efast method two other parameters are directly involved in reactions with doc i e the doc concentration d o c and the activation energy for reaction between nh2cl and doc e a d o c confirming that reaction with doc predominantly drives nh2cl loss in natural waters uncertainty in nh2cl loss prediction is also driven by variability in temperatures since the temperature variable is classified among the four most sensitive parameters for all the rivers for this variable it may be noted that a significant difference was observed between first order and total order sensitivity index showing that the effect of temperature greatly acts in interaction with other parameters e g the kinetic rate k 11 f 25 or the activation energy e a d o c wind velocity is generally ranked as the 5th most sensitive parameter the total order index generally approximates 0 1 signifying that about 10 of the uncertainty in nh2cl half life could be explained by wind velocity variability this suggests that volatilization may play a significant role in nh2cl loss under some conditions especially for low doc concentrations even if volatilization may play a second order role the henry constant is poorly sensitive this shows that improving the knowledge on the henry s law constant is not necessarily a priority if it is not completed by reliable measurements of wind velocity at the station where nh2cl discharge occurs parameters related to loss in sediments were shown to be poorly sensitive suggesting that these pathway do not significantly contribute to nh2cl loss in the investigated natural waters this result is not in accordance with some experimental observations showing that sediments can play a significant role thus sacher et al 2019 and garcia 2018 observed a significant increase in nh2cl loss when sediment are added in the systems under laboratory controlled conditions it must however be highlighted that they used very high concentrations in sediments e g sacher et al 2019 used a 1 4 sediment to water ratio that do not fit with our sediment quantity and thickness estimations conversely liu et al 2019 evaluated the penetration of nh2cl into a 2 cm drinking water storage tank sediment and observed that nh2cl penetration was not complete suggesting that diffusion is a limiting pathway for nh2cl in sediments it must also be noted that our model does not take into account nh2cl biodegradation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and can then underestimate nh2cl loss in sediments besides when analysing the results of the efast simulation it was observed that first order parametric effects may explain only a limited fraction of the half life variance except for the k 11 f 25 parameter this observation demonstrates the existence of many parametric interactions in the modeling system i e the effect of a given parameter is highly dependent on the level of the others this justifies the use of global sensitivity analysis as done in the present paper able to overcome local sensitivity approaches i e local one at a time approaches as commonly used in many papers it must be reminded here that the sum of tsi for the different parameters may exceed 100 because some higher order effects are counted several times sij is counted for both parameter xi and parameter xj high tsi values demonstrate also the importance of parametric interactions in uncertainty propagation within the model 4 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting a parametric sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the determination of nh2cl half life in river water by a chemical model this methodology is based on reliable global sensitivity methods able to cover the entire range over which the parameters may vary and to detect direct and interaction effects the uncertainty analysis allowed to evaluate confidence intervals of the nh2cl half lives in natural waters it was shown that simulation intervals are in good agreement with experimental data obtained on the same rivers sensitivity analysis through an efast variance decomposition allowed to identify the most influential parameters on half life determination it was shown that the kinetic

16756,monochloramine nh2cl is increasingly used as alternative disinfectant to free chlorine in industrial plants after use in cooling systems the waters are released to the environment and residual nh2cl may be discharged into the receiving waters as nh2cl is suspected to exhibit toxicity towards aquatic organisms a proper risk assessment of its occurrence in environmental waters is needed to prevent adverse effects on wildlife for this purpose a comprehensive model simulating monochloramine loss in natural riverine waters was developed this model incorporates the following processes i autodecomposition ii reaction with nitrite and bromide iii oxidation with dissolved organic carbon doc iv oxidation with organic fraction of suspended particulate matter spm v reactions in bottom sediments and vi volatilization the model was also designed to conduct uncertainty and sensitivity analysis it was tested on several french rivers submitted to discharges of monochloraminated effluents and on several seasonal conditions uncertainty analysis allowed evaluation of confidence intervals related to nh2cl half lives in natural waters it was shown that simulation intervals are in good agreement with experimental data obtained on the same rivers sensitivity analysis using an efast variance decomposition approach allowed identification of the most influential parameters on half life determination it was shown that the kinetic rate describing rapid reaction of nh2cl with doc is by far the most sensitive parameter demonstrating the predominance of such reactions in the loss process variables or parameters involved in temperature dependence temperature and activation energy can also significantly influence model results to a lesser extent wind velocity is the most sensitive parameter explaining uncertainty in the prediction of volatilization with a high level of interactions with other parameters showing that loss through volatilization can be essential in some specific conditions only this study then identified the most important research priorities for improving the prediction of nh2cl half lives in natural rivers keywords monochloramine degradation probability density functions uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis efast 1 introduction chloramination is widely used for drinking water secondary disinfection but also as a biocide process in some industrial systems for example some french nuclear power plants npps use the chloramination process to produce monochloramine nh2cl able to prevent the development of pathogenic organisms in cooling water systems like naegleria fowleri or legionella pneumophila coniglio et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 goudot et al 2014 kahler et al 2011 compared to free chlorine nh2cl is a weaker disinfectant wolfe et al 1984 but it is also less reactive with organic matter present in cooling waters it is then supposed to provide a longer lasting disinfection effect and to produce less disinfection by products dbps like haloacetics acids haa or eventually trihalomethanes thm vikesland 2001 nh2cl is then increasingly used as alternative disinfectant to free chlorine in industrial plants after use in cooling systems the waters are released to the environment and residual nh2cl may be discharged into the receiving waters since nh2cl is suspected to exhibit toxicity towards aquatic organisms environment canada 2001 trofe et al 1980 a proper risk assessment of its occurrence in environmental waters is needed to prevent adverse effects on wildlife in order to fully assess the environmental impact of nh2cl more information about its stability under environmental conditions is needed in addition to ecotoxicological data even if it is less reactive than free chlorine nh2cl remains inherently unstable at neutral ph values first even without the presence of reactive inorganic or organic substances nh2cl is submitted to auto decomposition through a complex set of reactions that ultimately result in the oxidation of ammonia and the reduction of active chlorine jafvert and valentine 1992 ozekin et al 1996 vikesland 2001 zhang et al 2017 secondly in natural waters nh2cl loss can be enhanced by oxidation reactions with natural organic matter nom bromide and nitrite margerum et al 1994 trofe et al 1980 vikesland et al 1998 nom oxidation by monochloramine is particularly important because it results in dbps formation cowman and singer 1996 diehl et al 2000 richardson and postigo 2011 nh2cl loss can also occur in presence of riverine bottom sediments sacher et al 2019 finally nh2cl can exchange at the water atmosphere interface and volatilize garcia and anderson 2018 a model describing nh2cl autodecomposition was developed by vikesland et al 2001 the model combines the complex set of reactions that ammonia and chlorine undergo in aqueous solution and it can predict chloramine auto decomposition for a wide range of reaction conditions reactions involving bromide and nitrite two inorganic species that can catalyze nh2cl loss in waters were also added in more recent models wahman and speitel 2012 duirk et al 2005 2002 modelled nh2cl loss in the presence of organic matter i e aldrich humic acids or organic extracts from rivers it was observed that nh2cl loss was accelerated in the presence of organic matter om via two kinetic stages i e biphasic kinetics i e a fast nh2cl demand and a slow long term loss duirk et al 2005 2002 assumed that nh2cl directly reacted with both the fast and slow reactive fractions in the om structure and calculated kinetic rates for each of the oxidation reactions with om more recently garcia 2018 also incorporated nh2cl volatilization as well as reaction into sediments in a loss model garcia 2018 garcia and anderson 2018 all these works form the fundamentals for creating a comprehensive model describing the loss kinetics of nh2cl in natural waters it remains however difficult to estimate the confidence level one can place in model results since many parameters and environmental physico chemical variables used for simulating nh2cl fate in natural surface waters show large uncertainty or variability yet most codes dealing with environmental chemistry are not designed for conducting multi parametric global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis parameter values and environmental variables are instead set at best estimate or default values without clear definition of what is a best estimate or default value then simulations performed with best estimate or default parameter values do not provide alone a good idea of the confidence level one can place in model results a model can indeed provide results on average but the confidence interval can be large even over several orders of magnitude uncertainty associated to parameters and forcing variables involved in the loss model can be schematically classified in natural variability nh2cl loss in waters depends on natural conditions like e g ph temperature alkalinity ammonia and nitrite no2 concentrations bromide br concentration natural organic matter nom concentration and quality organic content in suspended particulate matter spm and bottom sediments etc yet such conditions may show high variations within and among aquatic systems and may show significant variations over time e g seasonal variations parametric uncertainty i e incompleteness of knowledge nh2cl loss in aquatic systems is largely governed by the kinetic rates that describe each of the autodecomposition or oxidation reactions for some of these reactions where robust experimental data are lacking kinetic rates may be highly uncertain thus the concepts of natural variability and knowledge uncertainty are different variability is an inherent property of the system being modelled while knowledge uncertainty is dependent of the current state of knowledge regarding the system in the present paper variability and knowledge uncertainty were combined and will be termed thereafter by the global term uncertainty evaluating uncertainty in the estimation of nh2cl loss for a specific river through the integration of both natural variability and lack of knowledge can improve tools dedicated to risk assessment of nh2cl and its dbps in aquatic systems sensitivity analysis can complement such uncertainty analysis to identify which input parameters contribute most to the output variation sensitivity analysis is the study of how the variation in the output of a model in our case predicted nh2cl loss can be apportioned qualitatively or quantitatively to different sources of variation in our case variability in natural conditions and uncertainty in parameters involved in the comprehensive loss model sensitivity analysis highlights the inputs that have the greatest influence on the modeling results it therefore provides useful insights for model builders and users insights from sensitivity analysis can be used for i identification of key sources of uncertainty ii identification of key controllable sources of variability and iii model refinement and identification of research priorities taking into account this background the main objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate global uncertainty in the prediction of nh2cl loss in several french rivers through the probabilistic use of a comprehensive model incorporating i autodecomposition ii reaction with nitrite and bromide iii oxidation with dissolved organic carbon doc iv oxidation with organic fraction of spm v reactions in bottom sediments and vi volatilization the rivers that were selected for this study were chosen because they are used as cooling source of npps and may thus receive monochloraminated effluents besides they can cover different situations in terms of hydraulic conditions and associated dilution sediment formation processes suspended particulate matter concentrations etc and physico chemical characteristics temperatures ph organic matter etc 2 to conduct sensitivity analysis able to identify the main sources of uncertainty in nh2cl loss prediction 2 material and methods 2 1 model description 2 1 1 model for auto decomposition the model describing nh2cl auto decomposition is described in detail in jafvert and valentine 1992 ozekin et al 1996 and is refined in vikesland et al 2001 the main reactions are briefly summarized here with their kinetic rates for forward and reverse directions respectively the effect of temperature is also indicated for some of these reactions according to the arrhenius relationship table 1 the model includes several kinds of reaction two substitution hydrolysis reactions involving hocl and ammonia or the chlorinated ammonia derivatives reactions 1 and 2 disproportionation reactions of the chloramine species reaction 3 these reactions are acid catalysed and several proton donating species can thus accelerate monochloramine decay the main catalysts that were identified so far are proton h and carbonate species this explains that the forward kinetic rate for reaction 3 depends on h hco3 and h2co3 concentrations identically the reverse kinetic rate for reaction 3 is expressed in mol 2 l2 h 1 and depends on the reaction products nhcl2 and nh3 as well as on the cumulative concentration of proton donating species i e here h hco3 and h2co3 disproportionation reactions are limited by the rate of formation of dichloramine nhcl2 which thus depends on factors like ph temperature alkalinity and ionic strength once dichloramine forms it decomposes via a series of rapid redox reactions involving an unidentified intermediate and producing unidentified products reactions 4 to 7 since the previous reactions are influenced by ammonia and carbonate species the equilibrium constants of the acid base couples h2co3 hco3 pka 6 4 hco3 co3 2 pka 10 3 nh4 nh3 pka 9 3 and hocl ocl pka 7 5 are taken into account in the model vikesland et al 2001 2 1 2 model for reactions with nitrites and bromides some inorganic compounds in particular nitrite hao et al 1994 margerum et al 1994 valentine 1985 wahman and speitel 2012 and bromide bousher et al 1989 trofe et al 1980 were shown to enhance nh2cl loss in theory monochloramine reacts with nitrite according to the stoichiometric reaction reaction 8 margerum et al 1994 proposed a reaction mechanism involving the formation of a reactive intermediate nitryl chloride no2cl and its degradation by two parallel pathways a reaction with no2 to form n2o4 and a dissociation reaction producing no2 and cl these intermediates ultimately lead to the production of nitrate consistent with this mechanism margerum et al 1994 proposed the following kinetic relationship to describe nh2cl loss due to reactions with nitrite 1 d n h 2 cl dt k 8 1 h n h 2 cl no 2 1 k 8 2 k 8 4 no 2 k 8 1 k 8 4 n h 3 1 k 8 2 k 8 4 no 2 similarly hocl also reacts with nitrites according to the stoichiometric reaction wahman and speitel 2012 reaction 9 according to margerum et al 1994 the kinetic rate k 9 f can be expressed as 2 k 9 f k 9 1 no 2 1 k 9 2 k 9 4 no 2 k 9 1 k 9 4 o h 1 k 9 2 k 9 4 no 2 trofe et al 1980 proposed the following pathway for bromochloramine formation from nh2cl involving the oxidation of bromide by the monochlorammonium ion nh3cl produced by the nh2cl ionization reactions 10 consistent with this pathway the overall kinetic relationship was proposed to describe nh2cl loss due to reactions with bromide oxidation 3 d n h 2 cl dt 2 k 10 f n h 2 cl b r h to account for nh2cl loss due to reactions with nitrite and bromide the expression given by eq 1 2 and 3 were included as nh2cl loss pathways in the comprehensive model 2 1 3 model for reactions with dissolved organic matter the model describing the reaction of nh2cl with om was first developed by duirk et al 2005 2002 and then completed by zhang et al 2018 considering that nh2cl loss in presence of om shows two kinetic stages with a significant loss occurring within the first few minutes of contact time and a more extended loss duirk et al 2002 proposed to consider two fractions of om the first one corresponding to an immediate nh2cl demand and the second one corresponding to a prolonged demand over time they however observed that kinetic constants of the long term reaction decreased with increases of nh2cl and ammonia concentrations they suggested that free chlorine hocl competitively reacts with om explaining such experimental observations to overcome this limitation zhu and zhang 2016 and zhang et al 2018 incorporated in the comprehensive model reactions between om and free chlorine released from nh2cl auto decomposition therefore the duirk s model for nh2cl loss accounting for two pathways was considered i the reaction between nh2cl and the doc fraction involved in rapid demand reaction 11 ii the reaction between nh2cl and the doc fraction involved in long lasting demand reaction 12 duirk et al 2002 2005 as well as zhang et al 2018 thus predict that only a portion of the total doc is reactive towards nh2cl and thus define d o c f a s t s f a s t d o c and d o c s l o w s s l o w d o c reactions 11 and 12 thus depend on four parameters i e the fast and slow fractions in doc s f a s t and s s l o w and the kinetic rates k 11 f and k 12 f for limiting the number of parameters that have to be managed we merge these parameters defining 4 k 11 f s fast k 11 f and 5 k 12 f s slow k 12 f our approach is thus in agreement with the previous approaches since the kinetic rates k11 f and k12 f that we used in the present paper were corrected to correspond to those calibrated by duirk et al 2002 2005 and zhang et al 2018 the reaction of free chlorine hocl with om was represented as reaction 13 rivers investigated in the present paper may show a wide range of temperatures leading to different degradation kinetics it was then assumed that the kinetic rates k 11 f k 12 f and k 13 f follow the arrhenius relationship 6 k i f k i f 25 e e a doc r 1 t 1 298 where k i f 25 represent the kinetic rates k 11 f k 12 f or k 13 f at 25 c l mol 1 h 1 e a d o c is the activation energy for reactions 11 12 and 13 j mol 1 r the ideal gas constant 8 3 j mol 1 k 1 and t the temperature k 2 1 4 model for reaction with bottom sediments garcia 2018 experimentally studied the loss of nh2cl in sediment remaining at the bottom or well mixed in the reaction chamber from four different surface waters collected in california usa and they calculated the kinetic rate of the loss reaction as 7 d n h 2 cl dt k sed n h 2 cl the loss of nh2cl was attributed predominantly to the organic matter and other reduced species such as reduced iron manganese and sulfide present in sediment garcia 2018 observed that the loss rate k s e d in h 1 can be correlated to the organic content in sediment or to the total oxidant demand the relationship they fitted on six experimental data can be written as 8 ln k sed a kpoc f oc sed sediment b kpoc where f o c s e d is the organic matter content in sediments unitless s e d i m e n t is the sediment concentration in the river system g l 1 a k p o c and b k p o c are regression coefficients such a relationship was however fitted for specific experimental conditions i e for specific sediment concentrations i e high sediment concentrations up to about 230 g l 1 considering that the k s e d value is proportional to the sediment concentration is a reasonable assumption the more sediment there is the faster the nh2cl decay therefore the equation described above must proportionate with the concentration in sediment present in the investigated river therefore a model able to calculate the average bottom sediment concentration was required for each targeted river considering its specific hydraulic conditions since this model is described in detail in e g ciffroy 2018 and is available in the merlin expo tool ciffroy et al 2016 2011 its mathematic basis are not described here briefly speaking modeling of the deposition and resuspension of fine particles allows to simulate the time dependent concentration of sediments in a river characterized by its geometry water depth flow rate and spm concentration we used these simulated time dependent sediment concentrations to calculate the average bottom sediment concentration in the investigated rivers which was used to estimate a relevant k s e d value assumed to be proportional to the value estimated by garcia 2018 under his specific experimental conditions 2 1 5 model for reaction with poc as indicated above garcia 2018 experimentally studied the loss of nh2cl in bottom sediments but also in well mixed sediment in the reaction chamber these latter experimental conditions are representative of loss reaction with suspended particulate organic carbon assimilated to the well mixed sediments studied by garcia 2018 a similar model as those defined for bottom sediment can then be assumed i e 9 ln k poc τ suspension a kpoc f oc spm spm b kpoc where f o c s p m is the organic matter content in spm unitless s p m is the suspended particulate matter concentration in the river system g l 1 a k p o c and b k p o c are regression coefficients the factor τ s u s p e n s i o n unitless was introduced by garcia 2018 to represent the higher reactivity of organic matter in suspended particles than in bottom sediments where accessibility to reactive sites is limited 2 1 6 model for volatilization since models simulating the fate of nh2cl in waters were generally dedicated to closed water distribution systems they never took into consideration volatilization however garcia and anderson 2018 studied the fate of nh2cl in open systems and observed that the nh2cl loss in open or aerated vessels in contact to atmosphere may be significantly higher than loss in vessels without headspace they thus estimated the adimensional henry s constant to be about 1 7 10 2 at 20 c this value being representative of a semi volatile compound volatilisation of semi volatile substances at the air water interface is generally modelled using the stagnant boundary theory two film model the chemical being assumed to diffuse across two layers stagnant water layer and stagnant air layer characterized by two resistances in series ciffroy 2018 loizeau et al 2018 according to this approach the net flux from water to the atmosphere fwater atm in mol m 2 s 1 is driven by the difference in gaseous concentration between air and surface water according to the fick s law the gaseous concentration of nh2cl in river water is assumed to be in equilibrium with the dissolved concentration n h 2 c l w a t e r this equilibrium is simulated by the adimensional henry s law constant h rt thus the flux of chemical from water to atmosphere is given by 10 d n h 2 cl water dt mt c water atm h rt n h 2 cl water n h 2 cl atm where r the ideal gas constant 8 3 j mol 1 k 1 t the temperature k h pa m3 mol 1 or j mol 1 is the dimensional henry s law constant n h 2 c l w a t e r is the concentration of nh2cl in river water in mol l 1 n h 2 c l a t m is the concentration of nh2cl in the atmosphere in mol l 1 assumed to be zero m t c w a t e r a t m is the mass transfer coefficient at the water atmosphere interface in h 1 the first resistance represents the resistance to diffusion on the upper part of the interface i e in above atmosphere a gas film mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm g in m h 1 can be calculated according to the approach proposed by schwarzenbach et al 2016 that relates mtcwater atm g to wind velocity uwind at height 10 m in m s 1 mtcwater atm g is also assumed to depend on the chemical molar mass according to the following relationship 11 mt c water atm g 36 0 2 u wind 0 3 m h 2 o m molar 0 3 the second resistance represents the resistance to diffusion on the lower part of the interface i e in water a water film mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm w in m h 1 can be calculated according to the approach proposed by wanninkhof et al 1991 and hornbuckle et al 1994 that also relates mtcwater atm w to wind velocity at height 10 m bidleman and mcconnell 1995 mtcwater atm w is also assumed to depend on the schmidt number of the chemical which is linearly related to the squared root of its molar mass according to these assumptions the water film mass transfer coefficient can be calculated as follows 12 mt c water atm w 0 0045 u wind 1 64 m c o 2 m molar 0 25 where m co2 g mol 1 is the molar mass of carbon dioxide the total mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm is then given by 13 mt c water atm 1 depth r t river mt c water atm w mt c water atm g r t river mt c water atm w h mt c water atm g 2 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis ua and sa the comprehensive loss model described above was coded under ecolego and the merlin expo platform ciffroy et al 2016 the capability of merlin expo for performing uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of complex models with a wide variety of approaches was demonstrated for other scenarios ciffroy 2020a b ciffroy and benedetti 2018 fierens et al 2016 radomyski et al 2016 ciffroy et al 2011 van holderbeke et al 2016 and guided this choice the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was performed according to the following steps 2 2 1 determination of probability density functions for physico chemical variables for running the model it is first necessary to assign representative values to the following physico chemical variables initial nh2cl concentration ph hco3 nh4 no2 br doc organic matter content in spm and sediments temperature for each of the targeted rivers where npps use nh2cl as disinfection product i e the loire garonne rhône moselle seine vienne and meuse rivers initial nh2cl concentrations in rivers were chosen from simulations presented in sacher et al 2019 most experimental studies found in the literature and dealing with nh2cl loss were undertaken with nh2cl concentrations around some mg l for example duirk et al 2005 2006 and zhang et al 2018 studied nh2cl loss in presence of natural organic matter at concentrations of 1 3 and 10 3 mg l 1 and 1 3 2 6 and 5 2 mg l 1 respectively at such concentrations saturation effects can be observed since fast reacting sites of organic matter are not in excess compared to nh2cl such concentrations are however not those expected in natural media also downstream of industrial plants according to the simulation presented in sacher et al 2019 nh2cl concentrations in natural rivers are rather some μg l 1 and not mg l 1 to be as close as possible to natural conditions we therefore simulate nh2cl concentrations of 1 to 10 μg l in this concentration range considering the concentration of fast reacting sites calibrated from previous papers duirk et al 2005 2006 zhang et al 2018 we do not observe any effect of the nh2cl initial concentration as previously indicated the other physico chemical variables may show significant temporal natural variability for integrating such variability in the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis each variable is represented by a probability density functions pdfs these pdfs and the methods used for building them are presented in supporting information si all the pdfs determined according to the procedures described in si are representative of the variability all over the year discharges of nh2cl in rivers by npps occur however essentially in summer yet differences in among seasons can be considered for some variables seasonal pdfs were then tested for the physico chemical variables required by the model significant differences were observed for temperature only specific pdfs were then derived for temperature under summer conditions restricting the datasets for the period june september simulation were then run using respectively the whole year conditions and the summer conditions respectively 2 2 2 determination of probability density functions for model parameters similarly pdfs for model parameters were derived from literature review table 2 ranges for the kinetic rates describing the reaction of nh2cl and hocl with nitrites reactions 8 and 9 were taken from wahman and speitel 2012 they reported previous published data from johnson and margerum 1991 and margerum et al 1994 and re analysed them they also derived parameter values for some of the involved reactions from their own experimental data for each kinetic rate uniform pdfs were built considering the extreme values reported in wahman and speitel 2012 from previous data and their own data luh and marinas 2014 studied the effect of ph bromide and nh2cl concentrations phosphate and ammonia concentrations on bromochloramine formation from nh2cl they thus conducted 65 experiments under various conditions and determined for each of them the value of the k 10 f kinetic parameter describing reaction with bromide a statistical analysis of these values allowed to determine a normal pdf for k 10 f to our knowledge no activation energy related to the reaction of nh2cl with doc is available in the literature to obtain expected orders of magnitude for the e a d o c parameter eq 6 data related to specific organic reactants or others were then collected kimura et al 2015 studied the reaction of nh2cl and acetaldehyde ch3cho a common ozone and free chlorine disinfection by product between 2 and 30 c activation energy of the forward and reverse reactions were determined to be 3 04 and 45 2 kj mol 1 respectively qiang et al 2014 studied the degradation of methiocarb a commonly used carbamate pesticide by nh2cl between 6 and 33 c the apparent activation energy of the reaction was determined to be 34 kj mol 1 mckay et al 2013 investigated the temperature dependent kinetics of the reaction between nh2cl and h2o2 between 11 and 38 c the activation energy of the reaction was determined to be 51 5 kj mol 1 gleason et al 2017 studied the temperature dependant reaction between hydroxyl radicals and nh2cl over the range 10 40 c and determined the activation energy of the reaction to be 8 6 kj mol 1 cimetiere et al 2009 determined activation energy for the reaction of nh2cl with resorcinol of 40 kj mol 1 similar activation energy can be expected for the reaction of monochloramine with phenolic structures within nom from this background it may then be expected that the activation energy for reactions 11 12 and 13 e a d o c ranges between 1 and 100 kj mol 1 we then used log uniform pdfs for describing the e d o c 11 uncertainty with minimum and maximum at 1 and 100 kj mol 1 duirk et al 2005 2002 zhu and zhang 2016 garcia 2018 and zhang et al 2018 fitted the k 11 f r e f k 12 f r e f and k 13 f r e f parameters for several natural organic matters nom originated from different aquatic media including nom extracted from the loire river in duirk et al 2005 all the collected data were used to build pdfs garcia and anderson 2018 experimentally determined the dimensionless henry s law constant h of nh2cl at five different temperatures 11 16 21 27 and 32 c experiments were conducted in sealed vials with zero headspace and in solutions open to the atmosphere with and without aeration values ranged from 19 to 111 pa m3 mol 1 corresponding to 8 10 3 to 4 4 10 2 for the adimensional henry s law constant such values are consistent with qsar predictions 49 6 pa m3 mol 1 the five experimental values found by garcia and anderson 2018 as well as the qsar prediction were used to build a log normal distribution since the number of values is limited standard deviations were maximized according to the chi square estimation described in supporting information si garcia 2018 fitted a relationship between k s e d and the organic carbon content in sediments from experimental data obtained with sediments originated from four different rivers these data were used to estimate pdfs for the intercept and slope of the relationship i e the a k p o c and b k p o c parameters with required unit corrections to be consistent with our model 2 2 3 uncertainty analysis once all the parameters were assigned pdfs that describe the knowledge the user has about each parameter or its natural variability merlin expo provides the user with a pdf editor and allows to use a monte carlo random generator merlin expo then runs simulations with all the parameter samples that were previously generated and provides summary statistics for describing the uncertainty of each selected endpoint 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis through the efast approach the sensitivity analysis was performed by the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test efast saltelli et al 1999 which is a variance based global sensitivity analysis method independent of any assumptions regarding the relationship linear or monotonic between input parameters and outputs if v denotes the total variance of output y in our case the nh2cl half life the following decomposition can be written v i 1 n v i 1 i j n v i j v 1 n where n is the number of parameters vi the variance due to parameter xi vij the variance due to the interaction between parameters xi and xj etc efast computes both first order si and total sensitivity indices tsi as s i v i v var e y x i var y and t s i k i s k where i represents all of the sets containing index i for example in a model with three parameters we would have ts1 s1 s12 s13 s123 the si measures the main first order effect of each individual parameter xi on the model output while total sensitivity index tsi measures all higher order effects i e considering interactions that can be attributed to that parameter the efast method is based on monodimensional decomposition of the model along a sinusoidal search curve in the n dimensional parameter space the search curve is defined by a set of parametric equations the range of variation in efast is explored for all parameters simultaneously efast is independent of any assumptions regarding the relationship between input parameters and outputs it provides the fraction of the output variance due to each input parameter uncertain input parameters with small first order indices but high total sensitivity indices affect the model output mainly through interactions 2 2 6 experimental data simulations were compared to experimental data presented in sacher et al 2019 with personal communication for raw experimental data 190 experiments were performed to study the loss kinetics of nh2cl in surface water samples from the same rivers as those targeted by the present study excepting the vienne river batch experiments were conducted in open reactors with natural waters originating from the investigated rivers under relevant controlled environmental conditions at three different temperatures 14 20 and 30 c nh2cl residual concentrations were measured at t0 t0 5 min t0 30 min t0 2 h t0 4 h t0 6 h t0 20 h t0 22 h t0 24 h and t0 28 h allowing to evaluate the nh2cl half life in the system the nh2cl initial concentrations tested by sacher et al 2019 are in the range 0 5 100 μg l 1 for experiments performed without sediment most of them around 1 μg l 1 such concentrations are close to what expected in natural systems downstream of industrial plants initial concentrations experimentally tested by sacher et al 2019 and simulated in our model are then consistent and they are also relevant with expected concentrations in natural systems experimental procedure is described in detail in sacher et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 deterministic simulations deterministic simulations were first performed i e using the best estimate values for each physico chemical variable and parameter table in si for physico chemical variables and table 2 for model parameters the loss of nh2cl under such parametric conditions for all the rivers is shown in fig 1 the results thus obtained showed that nh2cl loss in water is log linearly related to time describing an overall first order loss kinetics loss half life defined as the time required for eliminating half of the initial concentration can then be further used as a summary indicator of the loss kinetics 3 2 uncertainty analysis 10 000 runs of the complete model described above were conducted with 10 000 random combinations of variables and parameters to evaluate the uncertainty of half life of nh2cl in water for all the simulations that were performed half lives follow log normal pdfs as checked through qq plots results not shown the main summary statistics of such log normal distributions are presented in fig 2 through boxplots where the central line represents the median the limits of the boxes represent the first and third quartiles q1 and q3 and the ends of the whiskers represent the 10th and 90th percentiles of the 10 000 simulated half lives in the same figure we also indicated the experimental data provided by sacher et al 2019 for comparison data obtained under the without sediment label for each targeted river first it was observed that simulated half lives are in good agreement with experimental data all the experimental data are indeed included within the 80th confidence interval ranging from the 10th and 90th percentiles excepting some unexpected very low half lives observed in the rhône river with a majority of data included within the interquartile range from q1 and q3 except for some data of the rhône river a more refined comparison between experimental and simulated data can also be undertaken by discriminating the conditions under which experimental data were obtained in particular sacher et al 2019 generated data at three different temperatures 14 20 and 30 c and they observed that nh2cl decay is considerably accelerated by temperature in fig 2 we then distinguished experimental data according to experimental temperature conditions temperature ranges reported in supporting information for each river showed that the most representative experiments were those performed at 14 c and to a lesser extentat 20 c if we then restrict the comparison between experimental data and simulated results only for the most representative experimental conditions i e 14 and 20 c i e excluding the triangle orange points in fig 2 it can be concluded that uncertainty derived from simulations is in good agreement with variability in experimental half lives second significant differences were observed among rivers by comparing simulation results with the median ranging from about 2 8 hfor the vienne river to about 7 9 for the rhône river the rhône river may show a slower loss kinetics for different reasons i when analysing the physico chemical variables presented in the table available in supporting information it may be observed that the rhône river shows the lowest mean doc concentrations 1 8 10 3 g l 1 and one of the lowest mean poc content mean value 3 4 while the vienne river shows the highest mean doc concentrations 5 1 10 3 g l 1 given the main contribution of the reaction with doc see sensitivity analysis below and to a lesser extent with poc in nh2cl loss such differences may explain the ranking in simulated half lives among rivers ii the quantity of sediments expressed in g l 1 is estimated to be lower in the rhône river than in other rivers in particular the vienne river showing one of the highest accumulation of bottom sediments see table in si line quantity of sediments iii volatilization is potentially more important in small rivers where the depth is low like in the vienne river than in large rivers like the rhône river since the total mass transfer coefficient mtcwater atm is inversely proportional to the river depth all the simulations analyzed above were generated by considering variability in physico chemical conditions all over the year as indicated in 2 2 1 simulations were also performed considering summer conditions june to september as it is expected to be the time period the most favorable for pathogenic organism development river temperature rises and consequently for disinfection treatment application compared to predictions performed when the all seasons variability is taken into account predicted half lives under summer conditions are significantly lowered fig 2 besides since natural variability is lower when only one season is considered and as a consequence since pdf standard deviations are smaller uncertainty range also significantly decreases with lower extreme values in general the half life median is lowered by about 1 0 h when only summer conditions are considered it may be explained by a highest temperatures observed in summer accelerating the kinetic rate constants when nh2cl is preferentially used as a disinfectant in summer like in npps pdfs derived from summer conditions can then be used instead of all seasons simulations 3 3 sensitivity analysis the efast method was performed to generate a quantitative ranking of variables and parameters involved in the model first and total order efast sensitivity index noted respectively si and tsi are presented in fig 3 parameters are ranked according to their total order index the most sensitive parameter is by far the kinetic rate k 11 f 25 describing the rapid reaction of nh2cl with doc this result confirms the predominance of reactions with doc as reported in the literature duirk et al 2005 2002 zhang et al 2018 the high sensitivity index of the parameter k 11 f 25 also results from its high intrinsic uncertainty as shown by its log normal pdf showing a high geometric standard deviation gsd 4 71 this high gsd can be explained by two factors first the natural variability in organic matter quality in rivers leads to contrasted k 11 f 25 reported in the literature only 10 values from two papers ranging over one order of magnitude secondly the limited number of available data it must be reminded here that when the number of data is limited the chi square method described in si is used for estimating the maximum expected value of the gsd yet the lower the number of data the higher the gsd one priority for limiting the uncertainty in the estimation of the nh2cl half life in river water would be then to generate new data for the k 11 f 25 parameter describing reaction with doc even if k 11 f 25 is the most sensitive parameter for all the rivers its sensitivity index depends on the river both the first order and total order index are very high for the rhône and loire rivers showing that this parameter explains alone a great part of the uncertainty in half life prediction while it is significantly lower for e g the garonne and the seine rivers such differences revealed that reaction with doc remains the most important pathway for nh2cl loss in all the rivers but that its relative contribution may vary among rivers among the most influential parameters identified by the efast method two other parameters are directly involved in reactions with doc i e the doc concentration d o c and the activation energy for reaction between nh2cl and doc e a d o c confirming that reaction with doc predominantly drives nh2cl loss in natural waters uncertainty in nh2cl loss prediction is also driven by variability in temperatures since the temperature variable is classified among the four most sensitive parameters for all the rivers for this variable it may be noted that a significant difference was observed between first order and total order sensitivity index showing that the effect of temperature greatly acts in interaction with other parameters e g the kinetic rate k 11 f 25 or the activation energy e a d o c wind velocity is generally ranked as the 5th most sensitive parameter the total order index generally approximates 0 1 signifying that about 10 of the uncertainty in nh2cl half life could be explained by wind velocity variability this suggests that volatilization may play a significant role in nh2cl loss under some conditions especially for low doc concentrations even if volatilization may play a second order role the henry constant is poorly sensitive this shows that improving the knowledge on the henry s law constant is not necessarily a priority if it is not completed by reliable measurements of wind velocity at the station where nh2cl discharge occurs parameters related to loss in sediments were shown to be poorly sensitive suggesting that these pathway do not significantly contribute to nh2cl loss in the investigated natural waters this result is not in accordance with some experimental observations showing that sediments can play a significant role thus sacher et al 2019 and garcia 2018 observed a significant increase in nh2cl loss when sediment are added in the systems under laboratory controlled conditions it must however be highlighted that they used very high concentrations in sediments e g sacher et al 2019 used a 1 4 sediment to water ratio that do not fit with our sediment quantity and thickness estimations conversely liu et al 2019 evaluated the penetration of nh2cl into a 2 cm drinking water storage tank sediment and observed that nh2cl penetration was not complete suggesting that diffusion is a limiting pathway for nh2cl in sediments it must also be noted that our model does not take into account nh2cl biodegradation by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and can then underestimate nh2cl loss in sediments besides when analysing the results of the efast simulation it was observed that first order parametric effects may explain only a limited fraction of the half life variance except for the k 11 f 25 parameter this observation demonstrates the existence of many parametric interactions in the modeling system i e the effect of a given parameter is highly dependent on the level of the others this justifies the use of global sensitivity analysis as done in the present paper able to overcome local sensitivity approaches i e local one at a time approaches as commonly used in many papers it must be reminded here that the sum of tsi for the different parameters may exceed 100 because some higher order effects are counted several times sij is counted for both parameter xi and parameter xj high tsi values demonstrate also the importance of parametric interactions in uncertainty propagation within the model 4 conclusions this paper presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting a parametric sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the determination of nh2cl half life in river water by a chemical model this methodology is based on reliable global sensitivity methods able to cover the entire range over which the parameters may vary and to detect direct and interaction effects the uncertainty analysis allowed to evaluate confidence intervals of the nh2cl half lives in natural waters it was shown that simulation intervals are in good agreement with experimental data obtained on the same rivers sensitivity analysis through an efast variance decomposition allowed to identify the most influential parameters on half life determination it was shown that the kinetic rate describing rapid reaction of nh2cl with doc is by far the most sensitive parameter demonstrating the predominance of such reactions in the loss process variables or parameters involved in temperature dependence temperature and activation energy can also significantly influence model results to a lesser extent wind velocity is the most sensitive parameter explaining uncertainty in the prediction of volatilization with a high level of interactions with other parameters showing that loss through volatilization can be essential in some specific conditions only therefore this study identified the most important research priorities for improving the prediction of nh2cl half lives in natural rivers declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest supplementary materials

16757,while the microbiome of activated sludge as in wastewater treatment plants wwtps plays a vital role in shaping the resistome identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes args in wwtps remains challenging the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach random forests rf s to identify the strength of associations between args and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of wwtps our results show that the abundance of select args can be predicted by rf s using abundant genera candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas pesudomonas and thauera etc opportunistic pathogens and indicators bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus etc and nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira etc as explanatory variables the correlations between predicted and observed abundance of args erm b tet o tet q etc ranged from medium 0 400 r2 0 600 to strong r2 0 600 when validated on testing datasets compared to those belonging to the other two groups individual genera in the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select args suggesting genera in this group e g bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus may be hosts of select args furthermore rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select args in a full scale wwtp successfully machine learning approaches such as rf s can potentially identify bacterial hosts of args and reveal possible functional relationships between the args and microbial community in the as of wwtps keywords activated sludge antibiotic resistance genes machine learning random forests wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health and the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment is believed to contribute to the problem martinez 2008 wastewater treatment plants wwtps receiving municipal wastewater have been regarded as a key reservoir of args bouki et al 2013 the discharge of treated wastewater and disposal of biosolids from wwtps can introduce args to water and soil jia et al 2017 altering the magnitude and composition of the resistomes in receiving environments xue et al 2019 the composition of the resistome in an environment can be strongly correlated to the composition of the microbiome forsberg et al 2014 yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 2018 the resistome in wwtps is correlated with the composition of the microbial community therein which is ultimately determined by the characteristics of the influent to wwtps and the design and operation of wwtps wu et al 2018 yin et al 2019 the composition of the microbial community can explain 68 2 of the arg variations among sewage sludge according to redundancy analyses zhang et al 2016 hence characterizing the composition of the microbial community may shed light on resistome composition in wwtps associating args to their bacterial hosts in complex environments is challenging efforts have been reported to identify potential bacterial hosts for args using network guo et al 2017 and binning analyses liu et al 2019 on metagenomic data network analysis can reveal taxa args associations by calculating their spearman s rank correlation coefficient for instance using network analyses guo and coworkers identified strong spearman s correlations between seven args and dechloromonas in wastewater guo et al 2017 however spurious correlations both false positive and false negative correlations between variables may result when the sample size is small guo et al 2017 rice et al 2020 by grouping contigs with similar abundance and sequence composition into the same bin binning analysis can reveal taxa args association by identifying the genome bins carrying both args and taxonomic marker genes liu et al 2019 ma et al 2016 using binning analysis liu et al 2019 speculated mycobacterium nitrospira and nitrosomonas as multi drug args hosts in wwtps treating landfill municipal and car washing wastewater for binning analyses annotation at the genus level may be difficult due to low coverage of draft genome and lack of reference sequences for taxonomy annotation liu et al 2019 besides the reconstructed genomes from metagenomics may not capture strain variation these genomes may miss low abundance species and introduce biases for quantitative analysis ju and zhang 2015 rice et al 2020 machine learning provides various alternative methods to search for potential associations between bacterial taxa and args in particular random forests rf s is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict resistome composition based on microbiome data the variable importance factors of rf s can indicate taxa with higher importance scores in predicting individual args rf s have been developed to identify the association between temperature and microbial composition in wwtps wu et al 2019 and the correlation of args in wastewater with socioeconomic health and environmental factors hendriksen et al 2019 consequently it is reasonable to apply the machine learning framework to search for the associations between args and taxa i e potential bacterial hosts indeed the increasing number of metagenomic datasets in public repository makes it possible to test the feasibility of this approach in the effort to associate microbiome and resistome in wwtps the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using rf s to identify the strength of associations between args and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of wwtps through systematic review 21 peer reviewed publications corresponding to 248 metagenomic datasets from wwtps in 10 countries were selected metagenomic datasets were trained using rf s to predict the abundance of select args with explanatory variables of 1 abundant genera 2 opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria and 3 nitrifying bacteria i e nitrifiers the computed rf s were then validated on testing datasets to assess their performance furthermore the rf s were used to predict args abundance in wwtps using bacterial taxa data the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of using a machine learning approach to identify potential bacterial hosts of args in complex environments such as the activated sludge in wwtps 2 material and methods 2 1 systematic review five databases namely compendex biological science research web of science pubmed and scopus were searched in august 2019 search strategies were developed using different keywords and syntax according to the search rules of each database table s1 only publications that met the following criteria were included applying the metagenomic approach to study wastewater focusing on full scale wastewater treatment systems and containing metagenomic sequences that are publically accessible through genbank or mg rast more details on search strategy and selection criteria are described in si figure s1 information about the selected papers can be found in table s2 2 2 bioinformatics analysis we focused on sequences from activated sludge as in this work because the highest amount of data was available for this sample type compared to other sample types i e influent effluent and digested sludge the as samples in the original studies were collected from 33 wwtps in 10 countries raw shotgun metagenomic sequence reads downloaded from public databases were trimmed using trim galore krueger 2012 cutadapt martin 2011 and fastqc andrews 2010 were used to remove low quality reads and adapter sequences trimmed reads were used to carry out taxonomy classification with kaiju menzel et al 2016 trimmed reads were also annotated for args using resistance gene identifier bwt rgi bwt based on reference data from the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 a sequence was annotated as an arg sequence if it shared 100 sequence identity with a sequence in the database and had an alignment length over 25 amino acids kristiansson et al 2011 the abundance of args was reported in the unit of ppm i e one arg like read in one million metagenomic sequencing reads according to yang et al 2013 abundance of a specific taxon in a sample was calculated using the ratio of the total number of reads matched to taxon by kaijiu and the total reads within a quality filtered library baral et al 2018 the abundances of genera and args were log transformed prior to generating rf s 2 3 resistance prediction 2 3 1 variable preparation the abundance of bacterial genera from three groups i e 1 abundant bacteria 2 opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria and 3 nitrifiers and that of select args were defined as explanatory variables and responses respectively for the rf s fig 1 based on the metagenomic datasets of as the most abundant genera in activated sludge were narrowed down to 11 genera group 1 bradyrhizobium candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas hyphomicrobium methyloversatilis mycolicibacterium nitrosomonas nitrospira pseudomonas streptomyces and thauera group 2 included 29 opportunistic pathogens commonly detected in wwtps cai and zhang 2013 li et al 2015b and 3 indicator bacteria i e clostridium enterococcus and escherichia group 3 contained 7 commonly occurring nitrifying bacterial genera in wwtps nitrosococcus nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira juretschko et al 1998 among the one hundred most abundant args conferring resistance to five major antibiotic families i e beta lactams glycopeptides macrolides lincosamides streptogramines mls sulfonamides and tetracyclines we selected the 22 most abundant dominant args based on their occurrence across all as samples 2 3 2 rf s development validation and application based on the metagenomic data on as samples rf s were developed using each of the three groups of genera and the 22 select args selected in 2 3 1 as variables and responses respectively fig 1 the computing was carried out using the caret package in r which contains techniques for data splitting pre processing model tuning a trial and error process to determine the best set of hyperparameters and variable importance evaluation kuhn 2008 rf s average was developed in following steps first the data were randomly split into 60 training and 40 testing subsets using the createdatapartion function next with the training dataset rf s were generated using the train function in caret the importance of the variables in each rf s was assessed using the varimp function on a 0 100 scale to flag problems of overfitting or selection bias a five fold cross validation step was set up using the traincontrol function for each rf s by randomly partitioning variables into five sub datasets of roughly equal sizes followed by estimation of accuracy based on remaining sub datasets third the rf s were validated on testing datasets finally results of validation on training and testing datasets were gathered by the gather function in the tidyr package and visualized using the ggplot function in the ggplot package linear regression was then used to assess the accuracy of the rf s specifically the r2 and root mean square error rmse values from regressing the predicted on the observed values were calculated to indicate the prediction accuracy of rf s in general high values of r2 a relative measure of model fit and low values of rmse an absolute measure of model fit indicate good fit of the rf s because the abundance of individual args i e responses of the rf s varied greatly within and across sequence libraries rmse is a less useful measure than r2 in assessing model fitness in this study hence while rmse values are reported the strength of associations between predicted and observed values in linear regression model context were defined as weak moderate and strong based on r2 values of 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 1 0 respectively hermans et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis and data visualization t tests were used to determine if the mean difference between two variables e g the abundance of arg families in various sample types was statistically significant the abundances of genera and args were visualized in heatmaps using the pheatmap package in r partial dependence plots were drawn using the partialplot function by in the randomforest package the nadaraya waston nw regression estimator was used to identify functional relationships between individual taxa and individual args using the npregfast package in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and abundance of args in wwtps following the systematic review table s1 and figure s1 21 publications indexed in the five citation databases met the selection criteria table s2 a total of 248 shotgun metagenomic datasets were downloaded from the genbank and mg rast databases as fastq files in october 2019 of the 248 datasets 141 datasets contained dna sequences on activated sludge as 24 datasets contained dna sequences on digested sludge ad 39 datasets contained dna sequences on influent and 44 datasets contained dna sequences on effluent the number of dna reads per sample ranged from 1166 697 to 499 150 364 averaged at 65 736 667 the number of mapped arg reads ranged from 82 to 168 956 per library averaged at 19 359 the average arg abundance in influent and effluent samples was 437 6 and 466 8 ppm respectively fig 2 a by contrast the average abundance of args in as and ad were 197 2 and 205 3 ppm respectively the arg abundance in influent was significantly higher than that in ad and as and was significantly lower than that in effluent p 0 05 given that there are significantly more metagenomic datasets available for as than for the other sample types we focused on the metagenomic datasets from as in this study the abundance of five commonly studied arg families i e those corresponding to beta lactams glycopeptides mls sulfonamides and tetracyclines in as is shown in fig 2 b tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes are the most abundant arg families with average abundances of 30 6 and 57 8 ppm respectively significant difference in abundance was observed between args conferring resistance to beta lactams vs glycopeptides beta lactams vs tetracyclines and glycopeptides vs mls p 0 05 etc according to metagenomic studies that were not used in this work the arg abundance in as ranges between 24 708 ppm christgen et al 2015 li et al 2015a tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the arg abundance obtained from this study fell within this range among the 100 most abundant args belonging to the five arg families in the datasets figure s2 22 args were selected for further analyses based on their abundance across all 141 metagenomic libraries on as fig 2 c 2 g 1 beta lactam resistance gene bla oxa 368 fig 2 c 1 glycopeptide resistance gene vanro fig 2 d 2 mls resistance genes erm b and erm f fig 2 e 2 sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 fig 2 f 16 tetracycline resistance genes i e tet 32 tet 36 tet 39 tet 44 tet a tet c tet e tet g tet m tet o tet q tet w tet w n w tet x tet x3 tet x4 fig 2 g the mean abundance of the tet genes ranged from 0 3 for tet w n w to 4 2 ppm for tet a the mean abundance of sul1 and sul2 were 36 2 and 24 1 ppm respectively while the mean abundance was 1 7 ppm for vanro 6 3 ppm for bla oxa 368 2 6 ppm for erm b and 4 8 ppm for erm f 3 2 association of args with abundant genera the relationship between args and abundant genera were investigated by rf s with the group of abundant genera as explanatory variables and individual args as responses the top 100 genera were identified according to their relative abundance across all metagenomic libraries figure s3 among them 17 genera had a mean relative abundance higher than 0 3 to avoid multicollinearity 6 of the 17 genera were excluded as they were highly correlated to each other with correlation coefficients higher than 0 6 the remaining 11 genera were used in rf s figure s4 our results show that for the training dataset the group of 11 abundant genera could explain over 88 of the variations in args abundance with r2 ranging 0 883 0 938 and rmse ranging 0 547 0 874 table s3 when applied to the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values ranging from 0 0216 to 0 637 table s3 for 8 of 22 args tested moderate to strong associations were shown between predicted to observed args abundance with r2 ranging 0 435 0 637 and rmse ranging 1 02 1 41 fig 3 particularly for the rf s developed for tet o tet q and tet w n w the associations between predicted and observed args abundance had r2 values higher than 0 600 and rmse lower than 1 41 indicating strong associations between these args and the abundant genera tested according to the importance score the most important genera within the explanatory variables were candidatus accumulibacter nitrosomonas nitrospira dechloromonas pseudomonas and thauera figure s4 which were previously reported as potential arg hosts table 1 guo et al 2017 sui et al 2018 xia et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 for genus arg pairs with importance factors higher than 90 in rf s figure s4 partial dependence plots were generated to show the functional relationship between an individual genus and the predicted arg abundance figure s5 for the genus arg pairs included in the partial dependence analysis most of the predicted arg abundance exhibited positive dependence on the individual genera tested except for candidatus accumulibacter vs tet 44 and tet m as well as dechloromonas vs tet 36 and tet x similarly for genus arg pairs with importance factors higher than 90 in rf s figure s4 the abundance of individual genus was regressed on the observed arg abundance using the nadaraya waston nw estimator figure s6 the nw plots show nonlinear functional relationships between observed args and individual abundant genera e g observed abundance of bla oxa 368 and tet a increased with pseudomonas and the observed abundance of bla oxa 368 tet x sul1 and sul2 increased with thauera nitrosomonas and nitrospira are nitrifying bacteria while candidatus accumulibacter wu et al 2019 dechloromonas wang et al 2020 pseudomonas scherson et al 2013 and thauera wang et al 2020 are denitrifying bacteria suggesting args may be linked to bacteria involved in nitrogen transformation in wwtps wang et al 2020 thauera can survive the pressure of tetracycline and kanamycin below the minimal inhibitory concentrations zhao et al 2019 and correlate with sul2 tet a tet o tet w du et al 2019 and tet x wang et al 2020 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas belong to the global core bacterial community in wwtps and play important roles in organics and nitrogen transformation wu et al 2019 these two genera could be enriched under long term exposure to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole in lab scale reactors treating wastewater and their abundance were correlated with sul1 tet a tet c tet l tet o and tet x at the end of enrichment du et al 2019 suggesting the ability to acquire args under selective pressure wang et al 2019 3 3 association of args with opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria rf s were developed using the group of opportunistic pathogens e g acinetobacter bacillus and bordetella etc and indicator bacteria i e clostridium enterococcus and escherichia as explanatory variables and individual args as responses our results show that for the training dataset the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicators explained over 91 of the variations in args abundance with r2 ranging 0 910 0 964 and rmse ranging 0 455 0 821 table s3 when applied to the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values ranging from 0 0123 to 0 654 between predicted and observed args table s3 the predicted arg abundance was strongly associated with the observed abundance of erm b tet 39 tet m and tet q with r2 higher than 0 600 fig 4 additionally moderate associations were observed between predicted to observed abundance for sul2 tet 32 tet 36 tet 44 tet a tet w and vanro with r2 ranging 0 400 0 600 fig 4 as shown in figure s7 bacteroides clostridium escherichia enterococcus eubacterium klebsiella and streptococcus were the genera with importance scores higher than 90 for multiple args e g tet 32 tet 44 tet m tet o tet w and tet w n w for the 7 genera and the args that they had high importance scores for partial dependence plots show that the predicted abundance of all the args included in this analysis exhibited positive dependence on the genera included figure s8 these genus arg pairs were further analyzed using the nw estimator fig 5 the functional relationships between observed arg abundance and the genera of opportunistic pathogens and indicators were obviously non linear the abundance of observed arg abundance exhibited generally positive relationships with the abundance of individual genera with the exception of enterococcus vs tet e fig 5 the nw curves are very steep in some cases possible threshold effects may be further investigated by fitting a single tree model using techniques such as those reported in chipman et al 1998 the functional relationship between args and genera identified in this section have also been reported in studies employing other approaches network analyses showed strong co occurrence between tet q and bacteroides as well as escherichia in fecal environmental samples li et al 2015c between clostridium and tet 32 li et al 2015c streptococcus and erm b in as samples ju et al 2016 using the mantel test and canonical correspondence analysis jia and co authors 2017 reported that tetracycline resistance genes were mainly carried by bacteroides streptococcus and clostridium in livestock wastewater lee et al 2020 reported that the relative abundances of fecal bacteria including bacteroides and clostridium were linearly correlated with arg abundance r2 0 21 in river water our findings are also supported by studies that employed pure cultures bacteroides isolates from wwtps exhibited a high percentage of resistance to tetracyclines 80 and tested positive for tet q and tet m using pcr niestepski et al 2019 salyers et al 2004 args tet m and tet q were carried by integrative and conjugative elements from bacteroides and streptococcus respectively che et al 2019 in addition bacteroides species may acquire erm b tet q and tet m from streptococcus spp clostridium spp and entrococcus spp in human intestines salyers et al 2004 clinical bacteroides isolates from hospital were confirmed to possess erm b johnsen et al 2017 similarly some streptococcus strains isolated from wwtps and human fecal specimens were resistant to ampicillin tetracycline kanamycin penicillin and vancomycin limayem et al 2019 and the genome of streptococcus strains isolated from a throat swab of a child contained erm b and tet m huang et al 2020 moreover eubaeterium isolates from patients with periodontal disease harbored the tet m gene olsvik et al 1995 3 4 associations of args with the nitrifiers rf s were developed for a group of nitrifiers as explanatory variables and individual args as responses these nitrifiers includes nitrosococcus nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira as they have been consistently detected in the metagenomic libraries nitrifying bacteria that were not consistently detected in metagenomic libraries were not included in this analysis within the training dataset the rf s explained over 88 of the variations in arg abundance with r2 ranging 0 880 0 949 and rmse ranging 0 519 0 983 table s3 when validated using the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values from 0 0313 to 0 718 table s3 for example the rf s exhibited strong associations r2 0 600 between predicted and observed abundance for tet 32 tet w and tet w n w as well as moderate associations r2 ranging 0 400 0 600 for erm b tet 44 tet m tet o and tet q as shown in figure s9 nitrosomonas and nitrospira had importance scores higher than 90 with more args than did the other nitrifiers that is nitrosomonas was important in predicting the abundance of sul1 tet 32 tet 36 tet a tet o and tet x while nitrospira was important in predicting erm b tet c tet w tet w n w tet x3 and tet x4 for all genus arg pairs with importance score higher than 90 partial dependence plots show that most of the args included in this analysis exhibited positive dependence on the nitrifiers figure s10 our results also show nonlinear functional relationships between args and individual nitrifier genera figure s11 for instance abundance of bla oxa 368 and tet a increases with the abundance of nitrococcus studies using network or binning analyses suggest the associations between nitrifying bacteria and args table 1 nitrosomonas and nitrospira abundance was suggested to indicate the fluctuation of args abundances in as reactors zhao et al 2019 and partial nitritation biofilters gonzalez martinez et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 following antibiotic addition because there is a strong spearman correlation with class 1 integron integrase inti1 nitrosomonas spp may be involved in the horizontal gene transfer of args wu et al 2020 nitrosomonas and nitrospira could survive antibiotic treatment in the reactors and therefore were speculated to be arg hosts or antibiotic degraders zhao et al 2019 3 5 prediction of args using taxa for a wwtp given their superior performance in the testing dataset fig 4 vs 3 and 6 fig 5 vs s6 and s11 the rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria as explanatory variables were used to predict the concentrations of select args in a wwtp in hong kong china yin et al 2019 the shotgun metagenomic data of the wwtp were not included in the 141 datasets used to develop the rf s rf s were able to predict the args abundance in the as of this wwtp in hong kong reasonably well figure s12 the rf s predicted the abundance of tet m tet q and tet w with r2 ranging 0 421 0 472 and rmse ranging 0 486 0 564 the relatively good agreement based on the r2 value i e 0 4 r2 0 6 demonstrates the feasibility of the rf s developed in this study to predict arg concentrations in wwtps over time the predicted args abundance of the wwtp ranged from 0 04 0 7 ppm for tet m 0 01 0 17 ppm for tet q 0 01 0 07 ppm for tet w in present study was consistent with 0 02 0 60 ppm observed in yang et al 2014 3 6 implications and perspectives rf s were previously used to predict arg abundance in wastewater using socioeconomic health and environmental factors hendriksen et al 2019 in this work we linked the abundance of select args in as with the abundance of three bacterial populations and individual genera within the populations by employing rf s we have demonstrated that certain bacterial populations exhibit strong associations with select args in addition the nw estimator indicates that the abundance of select args increases with the abundance of certain taxa these functional relationships may be used to develop hypotheses about certain genera being the potential bacterial hosts of args and to estimate args abundance based on microbiome composition in wwtp as one major challenge in studying the environmental resistome is to identify the bacterial hosts of args in addition to identifying the associations between explanatory variables and responses rf s can rank the relative importance of individual variables in predicting responses cai et al 2019 chang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 yeo et al 2020 this capability of rf s has been used in applications including ranking variables e g nanoparticle loading membrane pore size and relative water contact angle in regulating water permeability of reverse osmosis membranes yeo et al 2020 identifying associations between the antibiotic resistance in wastewater and socioeconomic variables hendriksen et al 2019 linking feed substrate to the microbiome in microbial fuel cells cai et al 2019 and connecting environmental parameters to the nitrogen fixation related genes sun et al 2020 and microbial diversity sun et al 2018 in soil in this work we found that args abundance were predicted with higher accuracy using rf s with the group of opportunistic pathogen and indicator bacteria as explanatory variables than those with the groups of abundant genera and nitrifiers we also tested individual genera from three groups of bacteria and observed positive dependence with select args in particular the functional relationship between args and opportunistic pathogens and indicators warrants further investigation fig 5 any hypothesis about hosts derived from the rf s will still need to be validated using culture based methods as date from next generation sequencing becomes more available the amount of microbial taxa information is likely to expand quickly rf s like the ones developed in this study can be used to estimate the abundance of certain args based on microbial community composition hermans et al 2020 emphasized the association between bacterial taxa and soil physico chemical variables using rf s with r2 of 0 35 0 73 validated on the testing dataset wu et al 2019 demonstrated the performance of rf s to correlate taxa composition and temperature of wastewater treatment plant with r2 of 0 47 validated on the testing dataset rf s developed in this study explained over 40 of the variation in the abundance of 8 11 10 args in testing datasets for abundant genera opportunistic pathogens and indicators and nitrifiers respectively several factors can affect the performance of rf s such as outliers in datasets size and number of trees and folds and times of cross validation rf s can yield bias in regression problems when extreme observations are estimated using the averages of response values large values may be underestimated and small values may be overestimated zhang and lu 2012 more work is needed to corroborate the accuracy of the rf s and further correct any biases rf s can be improved by supplementing metagenomic data with other explanatory variables such as wastewater characteristics e g ph temperature wastewater types and nutrient concentrations and operational parameters e g hydraulic retention time sludge retention time dissolved oxygen and organic loading rate any associations identified between arg abundance and individual operational parameters can be used to guide the optimization of operation to minimize arg spreading 4 conclusions in this work rf s were used to estimate the relationships between the abundance of select args and three groups of bacteria abundant genera opportunistic pathogens and indicators and nitrifiers for rf s with abundant genera as variables pesudomonas and thauera showed strong associations with multiple args bla oxa 368 sul1 tet x etc for rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicators as variables bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus exhibited strong associations with tet and erm genes rf s with nitrifiers as variables suggest that nitrifiers associate with args abundance particularly nitrosomonas and nitrospira among the three groups of explanatory variables the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicators exhibited more positive functional relationships between individual genera and args than did the other two groups suggesting members of taxa within this group as potential hosts of these args finally rf s developed based on the opportunistic pathogens and indicators could predict args

16757,while the microbiome of activated sludge as in wastewater treatment plants wwtps plays a vital role in shaping the resistome identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes args in wwtps remains challenging the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach random forests rf s to identify the strength of associations between args and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of wwtps our results show that the abundance of select args can be predicted by rf s using abundant genera candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas pesudomonas and thauera etc opportunistic pathogens and indicators bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus etc and nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira etc as explanatory variables the correlations between predicted and observed abundance of args erm b tet o tet q etc ranged from medium 0 400 r2 0 600 to strong r2 0 600 when validated on testing datasets compared to those belonging to the other two groups individual genera in the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select args suggesting genera in this group e g bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus may be hosts of select args furthermore rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select args in a full scale wwtp successfully machine learning approaches such as rf s can potentially identify bacterial hosts of args and reveal possible functional relationships between the args and microbial community in the as of wwtps keywords activated sludge antibiotic resistance genes machine learning random forests wastewater treatment plants 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health and the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment is believed to contribute to the problem martinez 2008 wastewater treatment plants wwtps receiving municipal wastewater have been regarded as a key reservoir of args bouki et al 2013 the discharge of treated wastewater and disposal of biosolids from wwtps can introduce args to water and soil jia et al 2017 altering the magnitude and composition of the resistomes in receiving environments xue et al 2019 the composition of the resistome in an environment can be strongly correlated to the composition of the microbiome forsberg et al 2014 yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 2018 the resistome in wwtps is correlated with the composition of the microbial community therein which is ultimately determined by the characteristics of the influent to wwtps and the design and operation of wwtps wu et al 2018 yin et al 2019 the composition of the microbial community can explain 68 2 of the arg variations among sewage sludge according to redundancy analyses zhang et al 2016 hence characterizing the composition of the microbial community may shed light on resistome composition in wwtps associating args to their bacterial hosts in complex environments is challenging efforts have been reported to identify potential bacterial hosts for args using network guo et al 2017 and binning analyses liu et al 2019 on metagenomic data network analysis can reveal taxa args associations by calculating their spearman s rank correlation coefficient for instance using network analyses guo and coworkers identified strong spearman s correlations between seven args and dechloromonas in wastewater guo et al 2017 however spurious correlations both false positive and false negative correlations between variables may result when the sample size is small guo et al 2017 rice et al 2020 by grouping contigs with similar abundance and sequence composition into the same bin binning analysis can reveal taxa args association by identifying the genome bins carrying both args and taxonomic marker genes liu et al 2019 ma et al 2016 using binning analysis liu et al 2019 speculated mycobacterium nitrospira and nitrosomonas as multi drug args hosts in wwtps treating landfill municipal and car washing wastewater for binning analyses annotation at the genus level may be difficult due to low coverage of draft genome and lack of reference sequences for taxonomy annotation liu et al 2019 besides the reconstructed genomes from metagenomics may not capture strain variation these genomes may miss low abundance species and introduce biases for quantitative analysis ju and zhang 2015 rice et al 2020 machine learning provides various alternative methods to search for potential associations between bacterial taxa and args in particular random forests rf s is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict resistome composition based on microbiome data the variable importance factors of rf s can indicate taxa with higher importance scores in predicting individual args rf s have been developed to identify the association between temperature and microbial composition in wwtps wu et al 2019 and the correlation of args in wastewater with socioeconomic health and environmental factors hendriksen et al 2019 consequently it is reasonable to apply the machine learning framework to search for the associations between args and taxa i e potential bacterial hosts indeed the increasing number of metagenomic datasets in public repository makes it possible to test the feasibility of this approach in the effort to associate microbiome and resistome in wwtps the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using rf s to identify the strength of associations between args and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of wwtps through systematic review 21 peer reviewed publications corresponding to 248 metagenomic datasets from wwtps in 10 countries were selected metagenomic datasets were trained using rf s to predict the abundance of select args with explanatory variables of 1 abundant genera 2 opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria and 3 nitrifying bacteria i e nitrifiers the computed rf s were then validated on testing datasets to assess their performance furthermore the rf s were used to predict args abundance in wwtps using bacterial taxa data the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of using a machine learning approach to identify potential bacterial hosts of args in complex environments such as the activated sludge in wwtps 2 material and methods 2 1 systematic review five databases namely compendex biological science research web of science pubmed and scopus were searched in august 2019 search strategies were developed using different keywords and syntax according to the search rules of each database table s1 only publications that met the following criteria were included applying the metagenomic approach to study wastewater focusing on full scale wastewater treatment systems and containing metagenomic sequences that are publically accessible through genbank or mg rast more details on search strategy and selection criteria are described in si figure s1 information about the selected papers can be found in table s2 2 2 bioinformatics analysis we focused on sequences from activated sludge as in this work because the highest amount of data was available for this sample type compared to other sample types i e influent effluent and digested sludge the as samples in the original studies were collected from 33 wwtps in 10 countries raw shotgun metagenomic sequence reads downloaded from public databases were trimmed using trim galore krueger 2012 cutadapt martin 2011 and fastqc andrews 2010 were used to remove low quality reads and adapter sequences trimmed reads were used to carry out taxonomy classification with kaiju menzel et al 2016 trimmed reads were also annotated for args using resistance gene identifier bwt rgi bwt based on reference data from the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card alcock et al 2020 a sequence was annotated as an arg sequence if it shared 100 sequence identity with a sequence in the database and had an alignment length over 25 amino acids kristiansson et al 2011 the abundance of args was reported in the unit of ppm i e one arg like read in one million metagenomic sequencing reads according to yang et al 2013 abundance of a specific taxon in a sample was calculated using the ratio of the total number of reads matched to taxon by kaijiu and the total reads within a quality filtered library baral et al 2018 the abundances of genera and args were log transformed prior to generating rf s 2 3 resistance prediction 2 3 1 variable preparation the abundance of bacterial genera from three groups i e 1 abundant bacteria 2 opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria and 3 nitrifiers and that of select args were defined as explanatory variables and responses respectively for the rf s fig 1 based on the metagenomic datasets of as the most abundant genera in activated sludge were narrowed down to 11 genera group 1 bradyrhizobium candidatus accumulibacter dechloromonas hyphomicrobium methyloversatilis mycolicibacterium nitrosomonas nitrospira pseudomonas streptomyces and thauera group 2 included 29 opportunistic pathogens commonly detected in wwtps cai and zhang 2013 li et al 2015b and 3 indicator bacteria i e clostridium enterococcus and escherichia group 3 contained 7 commonly occurring nitrifying bacterial genera in wwtps nitrosococcus nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira juretschko et al 1998 among the one hundred most abundant args conferring resistance to five major antibiotic families i e beta lactams glycopeptides macrolides lincosamides streptogramines mls sulfonamides and tetracyclines we selected the 22 most abundant dominant args based on their occurrence across all as samples 2 3 2 rf s development validation and application based on the metagenomic data on as samples rf s were developed using each of the three groups of genera and the 22 select args selected in 2 3 1 as variables and responses respectively fig 1 the computing was carried out using the caret package in r which contains techniques for data splitting pre processing model tuning a trial and error process to determine the best set of hyperparameters and variable importance evaluation kuhn 2008 rf s average was developed in following steps first the data were randomly split into 60 training and 40 testing subsets using the createdatapartion function next with the training dataset rf s were generated using the train function in caret the importance of the variables in each rf s was assessed using the varimp function on a 0 100 scale to flag problems of overfitting or selection bias a five fold cross validation step was set up using the traincontrol function for each rf s by randomly partitioning variables into five sub datasets of roughly equal sizes followed by estimation of accuracy based on remaining sub datasets third the rf s were validated on testing datasets finally results of validation on training and testing datasets were gathered by the gather function in the tidyr package and visualized using the ggplot function in the ggplot package linear regression was then used to assess the accuracy of the rf s specifically the r2 and root mean square error rmse values from regressing the predicted on the observed values were calculated to indicate the prediction accuracy of rf s in general high values of r2 a relative measure of model fit and low values of rmse an absolute measure of model fit indicate good fit of the rf s because the abundance of individual args i e responses of the rf s varied greatly within and across sequence libraries rmse is a less useful measure than r2 in assessing model fitness in this study hence while rmse values are reported the strength of associations between predicted and observed values in linear regression model context were defined as weak moderate and strong based on r2 values of 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 1 0 respectively hermans et al 2020 2 4 statistical analysis and data visualization t tests were used to determine if the mean difference between two variables e g the abundance of arg families in various sample types was statistically significant the abundances of genera and args were visualized in heatmaps using the pheatmap package in r partial dependence plots were drawn using the partialplot function by in the randomforest package the nadaraya waston nw regression estimator was used to identify functional relationships between individual taxa and individual args using the npregfast package in r 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and abundance of args in wwtps following the systematic review table s1 and figure s1 21 publications indexed in the five citation databases met the selection criteria table s2 a total of 248 shotgun metagenomic datasets were downloaded from the genbank and mg rast databases as fastq files in october 2019 of the 248 datasets 141 datasets contained dna sequences on activated sludge as 24 datasets contained dna sequences on digested sludge ad 39 datasets contained dna sequences on influent and 44 datasets contained dna sequences on effluent the number of dna reads per sample ranged from 1166 697 to 499 150 364 averaged at 65 736 667 the number of mapped arg reads ranged from 82 to 168 956 per library averaged at 19 359 the average arg abundance in influent and effluent samples was 437 6 and 466 8 ppm respectively fig 2 a by contrast the average abundance of args in as and ad were 197 2 and 205 3 ppm respectively the arg abundance in influent was significantly higher than that in ad and as and was significantly lower than that in effluent p 0 05 given that there are significantly more metagenomic datasets available for as than for the other sample types we focused on the metagenomic datasets from as in this study the abundance of five commonly studied arg families i e those corresponding to beta lactams glycopeptides mls sulfonamides and tetracyclines in as is shown in fig 2 b tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes are the most abundant arg families with average abundances of 30 6 and 57 8 ppm respectively significant difference in abundance was observed between args conferring resistance to beta lactams vs glycopeptides beta lactams vs tetracyclines and glycopeptides vs mls p 0 05 etc according to metagenomic studies that were not used in this work the arg abundance in as ranges between 24 708 ppm christgen et al 2015 li et al 2015a tang et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the arg abundance obtained from this study fell within this range among the 100 most abundant args belonging to the five arg families in the datasets figure s2 22 args were selected for further analyses based on their abundance across all 141 metagenomic libraries on as fig 2 c 2 g 1 beta lactam resistance gene bla oxa 368 fig 2 c 1 glycopeptide resistance gene vanro fig 2 d 2 mls resistance genes erm b and erm f fig 2 e 2 sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 fig 2 f 16 tetracycline resistance genes i e tet 32 tet 36 tet 39 tet 44 tet a tet c tet e tet g tet m tet o tet q tet w tet w n w tet x tet x3 tet x4 fig 2 g the mean abundance of the tet genes ranged from 0 3 for tet w n w to 4 2 ppm for tet a the mean abundance of sul1 and sul2 were 36 2 and 24 1 ppm respectively while the mean abundance was 1 7 ppm for vanro 6 3 ppm for bla oxa 368 2 6 ppm for erm b and 4 8 ppm for erm f 3 2 association of args with abundant genera the relationship between args and abundant genera were investigated by rf s with the group of abundant genera as explanatory variables and individual args as responses the top 100 genera were identified according to their relative abundance across all metagenomic libraries figure s3 among them 17 genera had a mean relative abundance higher than 0 3 to avoid multicollinearity 6 of the 17 genera were excluded as they were highly correlated to each other with correlation coefficients higher than 0 6 the remaining 11 genera were used in rf s figure s4 our results show that for the training dataset the group of 11 abundant genera could explain over 88 of the variations in args abundance with r2 ranging 0 883 0 938 and rmse ranging 0 547 0 874 table s3 when applied to the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values ranging from 0 0216 to 0 637 table s3 for 8 of 22 args tested moderate to strong associations were shown between predicted to observed args abundance with r2 ranging 0 435 0 637 and rmse ranging 1 02 1 41 fig 3 particularly for the rf s developed for tet o tet q and tet w n w the associations between predicted and observed args abundance had r2 values higher than 0 600 and rmse lower than 1 41 indicating strong associations between these args and the abundant genera tested according to the importance score the most important genera within the explanatory variables were candidatus accumulibacter nitrosomonas nitrospira dechloromonas pseudomonas and thauera figure s4 which were previously reported as potential arg hosts table 1 guo et al 2017 sui et al 2018 xia et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 for genus arg pairs with importance factors higher than 90 in rf s figure s4 partial dependence plots were generated to show the functional relationship between an individual genus and the predicted arg abundance figure s5 for the genus arg pairs included in the partial dependence analysis most of the predicted arg abundance exhibited positive dependence on the individual genera tested except for candidatus accumulibacter vs tet 44 and tet m as well as dechloromonas vs tet 36 and tet x similarly for genus arg pairs with importance factors higher than 90 in rf s figure s4 the abundance of individual genus was regressed on the observed arg abundance using the nadaraya waston nw estimator figure s6 the nw plots show nonlinear functional relationships between observed args and individual abundant genera e g observed abundance of bla oxa 368 and tet a increased with pseudomonas and the observed abundance of bla oxa 368 tet x sul1 and sul2 increased with thauera nitrosomonas and nitrospira are nitrifying bacteria while candidatus accumulibacter wu et al 2019 dechloromonas wang et al 2020 pseudomonas scherson et al 2013 and thauera wang et al 2020 are denitrifying bacteria suggesting args may be linked to bacteria involved in nitrogen transformation in wwtps wang et al 2020 thauera can survive the pressure of tetracycline and kanamycin below the minimal inhibitory concentrations zhao et al 2019 and correlate with sul2 tet a tet o tet w du et al 2019 and tet x wang et al 2020 candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas belong to the global core bacterial community in wwtps and play important roles in organics and nitrogen transformation wu et al 2019 these two genera could be enriched under long term exposure to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole in lab scale reactors treating wastewater and their abundance were correlated with sul1 tet a tet c tet l tet o and tet x at the end of enrichment du et al 2019 suggesting the ability to acquire args under selective pressure wang et al 2019 3 3 association of args with opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria rf s were developed using the group of opportunistic pathogens e g acinetobacter bacillus and bordetella etc and indicator bacteria i e clostridium enterococcus and escherichia as explanatory variables and individual args as responses our results show that for the training dataset the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicators explained over 91 of the variations in args abundance with r2 ranging 0 910 0 964 and rmse ranging 0 455 0 821 table s3 when applied to the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values ranging from 0 0123 to 0 654 between predicted and observed args table s3 the predicted arg abundance was strongly associated with the observed abundance of erm b tet 39 tet m and tet q with r2 higher than 0 600 fig 4 additionally moderate associations were observed between predicted to observed abundance for sul2 tet 32 tet 36 tet 44 tet a tet w and vanro with r2 ranging 0 400 0 600 fig 4 as shown in figure s7 bacteroides clostridium escherichia enterococcus eubacterium klebsiella and streptococcus were the genera with importance scores higher than 90 for multiple args e g tet 32 tet 44 tet m tet o tet w and tet w n w for the 7 genera and the args that they had high importance scores for partial dependence plots show that the predicted abundance of all the args included in this analysis exhibited positive dependence on the genera included figure s8 these genus arg pairs were further analyzed using the nw estimator fig 5 the functional relationships between observed arg abundance and the genera of opportunistic pathogens and indicators were obviously non linear the abundance of observed arg abundance exhibited generally positive relationships with the abundance of individual genera with the exception of enterococcus vs tet e fig 5 the nw curves are very steep in some cases possible threshold effects may be further investigated by fitting a single tree model using techniques such as those reported in chipman et al 1998 the functional relationship between args and genera identified in this section have also been reported in studies employing other approaches network analyses showed strong co occurrence between tet q and bacteroides as well as escherichia in fecal environmental samples li et al 2015c between clostridium and tet 32 li et al 2015c streptococcus and erm b in as samples ju et al 2016 using the mantel test and canonical correspondence analysis jia and co authors 2017 reported that tetracycline resistance genes were mainly carried by bacteroides streptococcus and clostridium in livestock wastewater lee et al 2020 reported that the relative abundances of fecal bacteria including bacteroides and clostridium were linearly correlated with arg abundance r2 0 21 in river water our findings are also supported by studies that employed pure cultures bacteroides isolates from wwtps exhibited a high percentage of resistance to tetracyclines 80 and tested positive for tet q and tet m using pcr niestepski et al 2019 salyers et al 2004 args tet m and tet q were carried by integrative and conjugative elements from bacteroides and streptococcus respectively che et al 2019 in addition bacteroides species may acquire erm b tet q and tet m from streptococcus spp clostridium spp and entrococcus spp in human intestines salyers et al 2004 clinical bacteroides isolates from hospital were confirmed to possess erm b johnsen et al 2017 similarly some streptococcus strains isolated from wwtps and human fecal specimens were resistant to ampicillin tetracycline kanamycin penicillin and vancomycin limayem et al 2019 and the genome of streptococcus strains isolated from a throat swab of a child contained erm b and tet m huang et al 2020 moreover eubaeterium isolates from patients with periodontal disease harbored the tet m gene olsvik et al 1995 3 4 associations of args with the nitrifiers rf s were developed for a group of nitrifiers as explanatory variables and individual args as responses these nitrifiers includes nitrosococcus nitrosomonas nitrosospira nitrobacter nitrococcus nitrospina and nitrospira as they have been consistently detected in the metagenomic libraries nitrifying bacteria that were not consistently detected in metagenomic libraries were not included in this analysis within the training dataset the rf s explained over 88 of the variations in arg abundance with r2 ranging 0 880 0 949 and rmse ranging 0 519 0 983 table s3 when validated using the testing dataset the rf s exhibited a wider range of r2 values from 0 0313 to 0 718 table s3 for example the rf s exhibited strong associations r2 0 600 between predicted and observed abundance for tet 32 tet w and tet w n w as well as moderate associations r2 ranging 0 400 0 600 for erm b tet 44 tet m tet o and tet q as shown in figure s9 nitrosomonas and nitrospira had importance scores higher than 90 with more args than did the other nitrifiers that is nitrosomonas was important in predicting the abundance of sul1 tet 32 tet 36 tet a tet o and tet x while nitrospira was important in predicting erm b tet c tet w tet w n w tet x3 and tet x4 for all genus arg pairs with importance score higher than 90 partial dependence plots show that most of the args included in this analysis exhibited positive dependence on the nitrifiers figure s10 our results also show nonlinear functional relationships between args and individual nitrifier genera figure s11 for instance abundance of bla oxa 368 and tet a increases with the abundance of nitrococcus studies using network or binning analyses suggest the associations between nitrifying bacteria and args table 1 nitrosomonas and nitrospira abundance was suggested to indicate the fluctuation of args abundances in as reactors zhao et al 2019 and partial nitritation biofilters gonzalez martinez et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 following antibiotic addition because there is a strong spearman correlation with class 1 integron integrase inti1 nitrosomonas spp may be involved in the horizontal gene transfer of args wu et al 2020 nitrosomonas and nitrospira could survive antibiotic treatment in the reactors and therefore were speculated to be arg hosts or antibiotic degraders zhao et al 2019 3 5 prediction of args using taxa for a wwtp given their superior performance in the testing dataset fig 4 vs 3 and 6 fig 5 vs s6 and s11 the rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicator bacteria as explanatory variables were used to predict the concentrations of select args in a wwtp in hong kong china yin et al 2019 the shotgun metagenomic data of the wwtp were not included in the 141 datasets used to develop the rf s rf s were able to predict the args abundance in the as of this wwtp in hong kong reasonably well figure s12 the rf s predicted the abundance of tet m tet q and tet w with r2 ranging 0 421 0 472 and rmse ranging 0 486 0 564 the relatively good agreement based on the r2 value i e 0 4 r2 0 6 demonstrates the feasibility of the rf s developed in this study to predict arg concentrations in wwtps over time the predicted args abundance of the wwtp ranged from 0 04 0 7 ppm for tet m 0 01 0 17 ppm for tet q 0 01 0 07 ppm for tet w in present study was consistent with 0 02 0 60 ppm observed in yang et al 2014 3 6 implications and perspectives rf s were previously used to predict arg abundance in wastewater using socioeconomic health and environmental factors hendriksen et al 2019 in this work we linked the abundance of select args in as with the abundance of three bacterial populations and individual genera within the populations by employing rf s we have demonstrated that certain bacterial populations exhibit strong associations with select args in addition the nw estimator indicates that the abundance of select args increases with the abundance of certain taxa these functional relationships may be used to develop hypotheses about certain genera being the potential bacterial hosts of args and to estimate args abundance based on microbiome composition in wwtp as one major challenge in studying the environmental resistome is to identify the bacterial hosts of args in addition to identifying the associations between explanatory variables and responses rf s can rank the relative importance of individual variables in predicting responses cai et al 2019 chang et al 2017 sun et al 2018 yeo et al 2020 this capability of rf s has been used in applications including ranking variables e g nanoparticle loading membrane pore size and relative water contact angle in regulating water permeability of reverse osmosis membranes yeo et al 2020 identifying associations between the antibiotic resistance in wastewater and socioeconomic variables hendriksen et al 2019 linking feed substrate to the microbiome in microbial fuel cells cai et al 2019 and connecting environmental parameters to the nitrogen fixation related genes sun et al 2020 and microbial diversity sun et al 2018 in soil in this work we found that args abundance were predicted with higher accuracy using rf s with the group of opportunistic pathogen and indicator bacteria as explanatory variables than those with the groups of abundant genera and nitrifiers we also tested individual genera from three groups of bacteria and observed positive dependence with select args in particular the functional relationship between args and opportunistic pathogens and indicators warrants further investigation fig 5 any hypothesis about hosts derived from the rf s will still need to be validated using culture based methods as date from next generation sequencing becomes more available the amount of microbial taxa information is likely to expand quickly rf s like the ones developed in this study can be used to estimate the abundance of certain args based on microbial community composition hermans et al 2020 emphasized the association between bacterial taxa and soil physico chemical variables using rf s with r2 of 0 35 0 73 validated on the testing dataset wu et al 2019 demonstrated the performance of rf s to correlate taxa composition and temperature of wastewater treatment plant with r2 of 0 47 validated on the testing dataset rf s developed in this study explained over 40 of the variation in the abundance of 8 11 10 args in testing datasets for abundant genera opportunistic pathogens and indicators and nitrifiers respectively several factors can affect the performance of rf s such as outliers in datasets size and number of trees and folds and times of cross validation rf s can yield bias in regression problems when extreme observations are estimated using the averages of response values large values may be underestimated and small values may be overestimated zhang and lu 2012 more work is needed to corroborate the accuracy of the rf s and further correct any biases rf s can be improved by supplementing metagenomic data with other explanatory variables such as wastewater characteristics e g ph temperature wastewater types and nutrient concentrations and operational parameters e g hydraulic retention time sludge retention time dissolved oxygen and organic loading rate any associations identified between arg abundance and individual operational parameters can be used to guide the optimization of operation to minimize arg spreading 4 conclusions in this work rf s were used to estimate the relationships between the abundance of select args and three groups of bacteria abundant genera opportunistic pathogens and indicators and nitrifiers for rf s with abundant genera as variables pesudomonas and thauera showed strong associations with multiple args bla oxa 368 sul1 tet x etc for rf s with opportunistic pathogens and indicators as variables bacteroides clostridium and streptococcus exhibited strong associations with tet and erm genes rf s with nitrifiers as variables suggest that nitrifiers associate with args abundance particularly nitrosomonas and nitrospira among the three groups of explanatory variables the group of opportunistic pathogens and indicators exhibited more positive functional relationships between individual genera and args than did the other two groups suggesting members of taxa within this group as potential hosts of these args finally rf s developed based on the opportunistic pathogens and indicators could predict args

16758,increasing number of emerging pollutants in environments requires an effective approach which can facilitate the prediction of reactivity and provide insights into the reaction mechanisms computational chemistry is exactly the tool to fulfill this demand with its good performance in theoretical investigation of chemical reactions at molecular level in this study chlorination of sulfonamide antibiotics is used as an illustration to present a systematic strategy demonstrating how computational chemistry can be applied to investigate the reaction behavior of emerging pollutants sulfonamides is a class of micropollutants that contain the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonmaide while differ in their heterocycles based on the calculated conceptual dft indices the reactive sites of sulfonamide are successfully predicted which locate on their common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonmaide therefore all sulfonamides follow the similar reaction pathway product identification by ltq orbitrap ms further verifies the in silico prediction three critical pathways are discovered i e s n bond cleavage cl substitution onto aniline n and the following rearrangement to lose so2 group among which cl substitution is the key step due to its lowest free energy barrier heterocycles impact the reaction rate by affecting the electronic density of aniline group in general the more electron donating the heterocycle is the more readily sulfonamides to be chlorinated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords computational chemistry emerging pollutants fukui function free energy barrier eyring polanyi equation reaction pathway 1 introduction in comparison to heavy metals nutrients and other macropollutants of which the removal behavior are relatively well understood thousands of micropollutants in wastewater which may wreak havoc in the environment remain more or less mysterious investigation of a surging number of micropollutants calls for more effective tools fortunately micropollutants usually fall into several classes their structures are partially the same when they belong to the same class based on the intensive investigation of several typical compounds it is possible to speculate the physical and chemical properties and pollution behavior of a whole class of micropollutants if so the experimental cost could be greatly decreased and the investigation efficiency would largely increase furthermore due to the less experimental consumption of chemical reagents the way we explore the environmental problem will become more environmental friendly computational chemistry is thus the exact tool in fulfilling this goal modern computational chemistry is based on the quantum mechanics and computational techniques to interpret and predict the properties of chemical compounds the common approaches include wave functional theory hartree fock and post hartree fock methods density functional theory dft semi empirical and other computational methods jensen 2017 levine 2014 benefiting from the development of high performance computing complex calculations with tens of atoms can be accomplished within several hours nowadays accordingly computational chemistry calculations especially with the dft method can be applied to larger molecular systems with thousands of atoms koch and holthausen 2001 compared to the semi empirical methods dft calculation well describes geometries electronic structure and spectroscopic properties in addition rather than solving the hartree fock rothaan equation followed by post hartree fock treatments such as configuration interaction and møller plesset perturbation theory dft applies the widely observed fact that the ground state energy is only the function of the electron density which accordingly determines all the other electronic properties of the system hohenberg and kohn 1964 sholl and steckel 2009 this approach makes the computation of dft faster than ab initio post hartree fock methods furthermore the results of dft in most cases agree well with experiments arnold et al 2000 lejaeghere et al 2016 hence dft becomes the most popular computational chemistry method with the current computer architecture computational chemistry has been introduced in many disciplines and thus derives its corresponding new subjects such as computational materials and computational biology a similar trend occurs in the field of environmental science and engineering a number of environmental studies involved computational chemistry for example zhang et al investigated the automobile emission purification of no and co reduced to n2 and co2 dft calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanisms the results revealed that the local coordination environment of the bimetallic site rh1co3 helped to activate the two no molecules and generated the intermediate n2o in contrast to rh co bimetallic nanoparticles coo rh1co3 coo presented high selectivity at a relatively low temperature because of the stronger binding of n2o on rh1co3 site and the rather low activation barrier for dissociation of the intermediate n2o to n2 zhang et al 2015 dft calculation was also applied to investigate the transformation behavior of contaminants such as dioxins pesticides perfluorinated compounds and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps drout et al 2020 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2014 xu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 due to the extreme toxicity and the lack of efficient detection schemes researches on dioxin formation mechanism get into a difficult situation with the aid of dft calculation xu et al elucidated the dioxin formations from the cross condensation of phenoxy radicals with several chlorine substituted phenoxy radicals xu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 by comparing the barriers of possible elementary reactions the most thermodynamically favored pathways were determined rate constants for each elementary reaction were calculated based on the transition state theory drout et al launched an experimental and theoretical investigation on the possible adsorption mechanisms of glyphosate onto a zirconium based metal organic framework i e nu 1000 drout et al 2020 through geometry optimization they indicated that binding in the c pore of nu 1000 was more favorable due to the formation of hydrogen bond through the glyphosate carboxylic acid with the nu 100 terminal hydroxyl ligands ranitidine a histamine h2 receptor antagonist belonging to ppcps presents high n nitrosodimethylamine ndma yield during chloramination compared with other tertiary amines liu et al investigated the formation mechanisms of ndma from ranitidine and other tertiary amines during chloramination by dft calculation and proposed a new four step formation pathway i e nucleophilic substitution by chloramine oxidation dehydration and nitrosation liu et al 2014 they suggested that ranitidine was formidable ndma precursor because its reaction barrier of nitrosation was much lower clearly computational chemistry has shown its charm in a great deal of researches in the field of environmental science and engineering nevertheless the potential of utilizing computational chemistry in environmental science and engineering is yet to be fully explored through calculations a comprehensive understanding of molecular properties of pollutants can be obtained which allows the prediction of reaction behavior and discover the universal mechanism as well as individual difference of pollutants belonging to the same major category considering the situation mentioned above chlorination behaviors of eight sulfonamide antibiotics are investigated theoretically and experimentally as an example to show how we can fully take advantage of the potential and feasibility of computational chemistry to investigate the transformation behavior of emerging environmental pollutants chlorination by hocl ocl is the most common disinfection process used all over the world it is the last toll gate that pollutants go through to enter the aquatic environment sulfonamide antibiotic is a kind of micropollutants that are well known for their continually detection in surface waters ground waters and even drinking waters christian et al 2003 kolpin et al 2002 padhye et al 2014 investigation on the chlorination behavior of sulfonamide antibiotic is of great environmental significance in summary the aim of this study is to demonstrate a general computational chemistry strategy for unraveling the reactivity of emerging pollutants including 1 to predict possible reactive sites of eight chosen sulfonamides with the aid of computational chemistry 2 to experimentally investigate the

natural population analysis npa glendening et al al reed and weinhold 1985 multiwfn version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 was also applied to achieve further analyses of electron density ρ r with the hirshfeld population hirshfeld 1977 ritchie 1985 ritchie and bachrach 1987 and calculate the indices developed from conceptual dft geerlings et al 2003 glendening et al 2003 liu 2009 i e fukui function ayers and levy 2000 parr and yang 1984 and condensed fukui function yang and mortier 1986 to obtain the gibbs free energy of the reactions the entropy values at the standard condition 1 atm and 298 15 k were calculated by harmonic approach first the free energy values in the gas phase with vibrational rotational and translational contributions g g a s for the configurations including reactants transition states and products were calculated 1 g g a s h t s v i b s r o t s t r a n s where h is the enthalpy obtained from the calculation t represents reaction temperature s v i b s r o t and s t r a n s are the entropy contributed from the vibrational rotational and translational movements respectively however for real reactions in aqueous solution the rotational and translational movements of the solute molecules were largely suppressed by the solvent molecules besora et al 2018 according to previous studies the total entropy in solution should be around 70 of that in the gas phase plata and singleton 2015 yu and houk 2003 hence in this study the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution g was estimated by involving 50 of the rotational and translational contributions making the value 70 to 80 of the free energy in gas phase deubel 2008 deubel and lau 2006 2 g h t s v i b 0 5 s r o t 0 5 s t r a n s finally the reaction free energy δ g and the free energy barrier δ g were calculated following the equations 3 δ g g p g r 4 δ g g t s g r where g r g p and g t s are the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution of the reactant product and transition state respectively the free energy barrier δ g of cl substitution calculated from g and g g a s are listed in table s3 the values of δ g δ g g a s and δ g v i b are quite close with each other hence based on the previous studies and our further tests the free energy g calculated by eq 2 were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular properties and reactive site prediction of sulfonamides 3 1 1 geometry the fully optimized geometries of hocl molecule and the chosen sulfonamides are shown in fig 1 tables s4 and s5 the chlorine atom of hocl is different from the oxygen atom in electronegativity thus the cl o bond is polarized clδ ohδ chlorine atom is positively charged with a value of 0 175 npa charge e thus it is likely to attack electron rich sites and evoke the electrophilic reactions this is consistent with the general idea of reaction characteristic of hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 all sulfonamides contain the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide one hydrogen atom of the sulfonamide group is replaced by heterocycles table s2 to form different types of sulfonamides as shown in fig 1 b the aniline nitrogen numbered as 1n is almost coplanar with phenyl group according to the pyykkö covalent radii the single bond and double bond distances between c and n are 1 49 å and 1 27 å respectively pyykkö and atsumi 2009a b the calculated lengths of 1n 2c are 1 364 1 367 å for the eight chosen sulfonamides which are between the length of single and double cn bond indicating the electron delocalization at 1n and the phenyl group it is important to notice that the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide are almost negligible as shown in fig 1 b and table s5 the variations of bond lengths of 1n 2c 5c s and 6n s and the angle of 5c s 6n are 0 003 å 0 003 å 0 028 å and 3 5 respectively furthermore the distances between 5c and 6n lie in the range of 2 750 2 807 å for the eight chosen sas which are considerably shorter than the sum of the van der waals radii of c and n 3 25 å indicating a possible intramolecular interaction between these two atoms batsanov 2001 the bond lengths angles and vibrational frequencies of hocl molecule obtained at other theoretical levels alkorta et al 2008 blanco et al 2009 roohi et al 2010 yuan et al 2009 and by experiments anderson et al 1986 ashby 1971 junttila et al 1994 mirri et al 1971 are shown in table s4 geometry parameters of smz sdz smp scp and smx calculated at m06 2x 6 311 g d p level soriano correa et al 2018 sdz at b3lyp 6 31 g d p ogruc ildiz et al 2009 and b3lyp 6 311 g d p level nikoofard et al 2017 smp and scp at b3lyp 6 31 g d p level shah and hao 2017 shah et al 2015 as well as smp basak et al 1987 and scp tan et al 2005 obtained by x ray diffraction analysis are listed in table s5 the geometry parameters obtained in this study are consistent with those reported in previous studies tables s4 and s5 indicating the feasibility and reliability of our calculation methods 3 1 2 prediction of reactive sites the ideal way to predict reactive sites is to perform ab initio molecular dynamic simulations which is rather time consuming besides based on the transition state theory investigating all possible transition states and comparing their reaction energy barriers is another way to figure out the possible reactive sites compared with these two methods it is straightforward to predict reactive sites based on the properties of molecules e g the electrostatic potential atomic charge and indices proposed by conceptual dft including the frontier molecular orbitals fukui 1970 fukui et al 1952 hirshfeld 1977 and the electronic fukui functions ayers and levy 2000 parr and yang 1984 yang and mortier 1986 which are generally considered as complementary indicators the atomic charges obtain from the electron population analyses can provide a general understanding of the charge distribution over the whole molecule yin et al 2018 and thus can act as the preliminary criteria to predict reaction sites common computational methods for the determination of atomic charges include mulliken hirshfeld npa and so on hirshfeld 1977 mulliken 1955 reed and weinhold 1985 reed et al 1985 ritchie 1985 ritchie and bachrach 1987 the accordingly atomic charges are then named after their calculation methods as shown in fig 1 b tables s5 and s6 hirshfeld and npa atomic charges of 1n 5c 6n oxygen atoms of so2 and the other heteroatoms of the heterocycles are all negatively charged which can be the possible reactive sites of chlorine electrophilic substitution in addition to the atomic charge distribution of frontier molecular orbitals also gives some hints particularly the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo according to frontier molecular orbital theory fukui 1970 fukui et al 1952 electrons in homo are the most active and easy to be lost while lumo takes the least energy to accept electrons as mentioned chlorine atom of hocl is positively charged and likely to interact with the electron rich sites hence in this study homos of sulfonamides are vital to speculate the possible reaction sites as shown in table s7 the homos of all chosen sulfonamides are located on their common structure i e the aniline 1n 2 5c through further orbital composition analysis based on hirshfeld distribution hirshfeld 1977 the exact reactive atom can be determined as listed in table s8 the orbital composition of 2c 3c and 4c are about 11 while contribution of para c 5c is above 15 it is obvious that 1n contributes the most to the homo orbital about 28 thus it should be the preliminary reactive site of chlorine electrophilic reaction the electronic fukui functions f r and their condensed forms further confirmed the above prediction f r can be interpreted as the change of the electron density ρ r at each point r along with the change of the total number of electrons n geerlings et al 2003 5 f r ρ r n v where ν is external potential in general the finite different method is carried out to approximately obtain its right and left hand side derivatives 6 f r ρ n 1 r ρ n r 7 f r ρ n r ρ n 1 r where ρ n r ρ n 1 r ρ n 1 r represent the electron density of systems with n n 1 and n 1 electrons under the same geometry respectively from the above mentioned definition and expressions f r indicates that when a system is attacked by electrophilic reagents and loses an electron how the electron density changes at each point r that is the more intensive isosurface of f r in a particular region the more reactive it is to participate in electrophilic reactions similarly f r represents the activity of a particular region to react with nucleophilic reagents a condensed form of fukui function f a can be obtained 8 f a q a n 1 q a n 9 f a q a n q a n 1 10 f a 0 q a n 1 q a n 1 2 where q a n q a n 1 q a n 1 represent the atomic charge of atom a in systems with n n 1 and n 1 electrons under the same geometry respectively f a 0 represents the activity of a particular atom to participate radical attacking reactions different electron population schemes lead to different atomic charge and f a values the most common used one is hirshfeld charge derived bultinck et al 2007 kinkar roy et al 2001 kinkar roy et al 2000 roy et al 1999 as mentioned hocl attacks the electron rich site and evoke the electrophilic reactions thus f r and f a of sulfonamides should be considered take the contour plot of f r of sdt for example fig 2 f r distributes at the aniline n the para and ortho c the imino group and the heterocycle f 1 n is far larger than other atoms with a value of 0 176 based on the hirshfeld partitioning technique which clearly shows that when electrophilic attack occur the electron density greatly change at the aniline n 1n and this area is most potentially to provoke electrophilic reaction f a has been successfully applied in previous studies to elucidate the reaction ability of sdz towards hydroxyl radical teng et al 2020 and the reactivity of sdz smz and smx towards peroxymonosulfate pms yin et al 2018 and singlet oxygen 1o2 yin et al 2019 these results indicated that the aniline n and the heterocycle of sdz were the most likely reactive sites subject to hydroxyl radical attack while aniline n of sdz smz and smx was the most vulnerable site to be oxidized by pms and 1o2 teng et al 2020 yin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 based on the above calculation and analysis of the molecular properties of sulfonamides it can be predicted that the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and electronic properties of the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide in sulfonamides are more or less negligible furthermore the initial reaction sites of electrophilic reaction most probably locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide i e the common structure of sulfonamides hence all the sulfonamides should follow the similar reaction behavior during the chlorination disinfection process to verify these predictions we experimentally analyzed the transformation products by ltq orbitrap ms and the results are presented in the following section 3 2 3 2 chlorination product identified by ltq orbitrap ms free chlorine is efficient to remove all chosen sulfonamides and kinetics is illustrated in section 3 3 2 however the total organic carbon toc removal of less than 35 after 14 day s chlorination indicates that mineralization of sulfonamides is hardly achieved as shown in fig s1 considering the almost complete elimination of sulfonamides and the limited toc removal plentiful transformation products should be generated during the chlorination disinfection in this study 85 transformation products from the chlorination of eight chosen sulfonamides are detected where the products of smz were reported in our previous study fu et al 2018 their structures are primarily deduced based on their elementary compositions and fragmentation in ltq orbitrap ms as shown in fig s2 s23 the principles to interpret ms spectra are described in text s2 furthermore based on the 85 ms spectra the typical fragmentation behaviors of chlorination products are summarized in fig s24 firstly for compounds containing the structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide rearrangement occurs to lose so2 and generate the benzene 1 4 diamine cation besides another type of rearrangement occurs simultaneously to form the 4 aminophenol cation secondly chlorine and methoxyl can be easily lost through both heterolysis and homolysis to generate corresponding cation or radical cation respectively moreover the methoxyl group can lose a methyl finally elimination occurs to benzene and other heterocyclic rings the fragmentation behavior of ssm product m z 215 1291 and smx product m z 190 0975 are typical examples as shown in fig s6 and fig s22 respectively based on the products detected the main reaction pathway framework of sulfonamide chlorination is summarized in fig 3 three critical procedures make up the main pathway framework i e cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution and rearrangement to lose the so2 group in fact the ms spectra can only provide evidence that chlorine substituted onto the aniline group because the existence of the fragment of c6h5cln m z 126 0105 it remains unknown whether it is n chlorinated or ring chlorinated in our previous study fu et al 2018 rearrangement to lose the so2 group was identified as a significant transformation pathway of smz chlorination fu et al 2018 through dft calculation we verified that cl substitution onto aniline n was the driving force for rearrangement dodd et al also detected the chlorinated sulfamethoxazole during sulfamethoxazole chlorination they suggested that the primary chlorination site should be the aniline n dodd and huang 2004 furthermore towards reagents that mainly react through electrophilic attack such as kmno4 hu et al 2011 ladbury and cullis 1958 pang et al 2014 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 and clo2 baribeau et al 2002 gagnon et al 2005 the reactive site of sulfonamides were also reported to be the aniline n gao et al 2014 willach et al 2017 therefore the cl substitution site is determined to be the aniline n s n cleavage and the cl substitution at aniline n occur simultaneously as the first step to generate tp1 and the chlorinated sulfonamides the chlorinated sulfonamides undergo further cl substitution to generate tp2 and tp3 or rearrange to lose the so2 group to generate tp5 tp5 is further chlorinated or dechlorinated to generate tp6 tp7 and tp8 tp2 and tp6 go through coupling reaction to generate tp4 and tp10 respectively extrusion of so2 group is ubiquitously observed during the chlorination of eight chosen sulfonamides in spite of their different heterocycle 5 membered or 6 membered sulfonamides in fact this is in accordance with the geometry and electron population analysis in section 3 1 which indicates the effect of heterocycle on the structure and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide is more or less negligible however yin et al and feng et al reported that when reacted with peroxydisulfate combined with 1o2 yin et al 2020 and ferratevi feng et al 2019 so2 extrusion would not occur to sulfonamides with five membered heterocycles the different observation may be originated from different major pathways towards different oxidants or the lack of driving force for so2 extrusion or the desulfated products were too quickly consumed to be detected it has been proposed in section 3 1 that the most possible reactive sites of electrophilic reaction locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide furthermore heterocycles of sulfonamides have little effect on the geometry and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide hence all sulfonamides should follow a similar reaction pattern definitely the prediction results of dft calculation accord well with the ltq orbitrap ms analysis which indicates the feasibility and reliability of reaction site prediction from the calculated molecular properties furthermore it can be deduced that with regards to pollutants belonging to the same class the reaction behavior and transformation products can be successfully predicted via computational chemistry approach 3 3 reaction mechanisms geometry reaction energy barriers and the effect of heterocycles there are several species of reactants under different ph values species of chlorine hocl and ocl react with various forms of sulfonamides cationic neutral and anionic sulfonamides in fact these reactions are elementary reactions that can be considered independently thus here we take the reaction between neutral sulfonamide and hocl molecules as an example to illustrate how to investigate the reaction mechanism with computational chemistry and how to integrate experiment with theory considering the mole fractions of hocl and neutral sulfonamides make up for more than 80 under ph 5 5 except for smx 55 7 and scp 44 3 shown in table s2 the observed rate constants k o b s obtained under ph 5 5 is used to discover the correlation between experimental and theoretical calculation results as to other ph values the same procedure is just followed only with more elementary reactions taken into account 3 3 1 geometry of transition states three key procedures make up the main pathway framework i e the cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution at the aniline n and the following rearrangement to lose the so2 group here sdt is taken as an example to illustrate the geometry transformation from reactants to products of these three procedures the optimized geometry of reactants transition states and products are shown in fig 4 and tables s4 and s5 all the transition states were confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculation and an example is shown in fig s25 the cleavage of s n bond is triggered by the electrophilic substitution of cl on the imino group with regards to the optimized sdt molecule the bond lengths of the c s and s n bonds are 1 763 å and 1 689 å respectively the bond angle of the 5c s 6n is 106 7 table s5 the cl o bond length is 1 737 å of optimized hocl fig 1 as shown in fig 4 through electrostatic attraction the chlorine atom gets close to the 6n atom and the 5c s 6n angle is compressed the s n distance increases to 2 648 å and cleavage transition state of s n cleavage finally the cl n bond forms with a length of 1 771 å and thus generates the stable products cl nh r for cl substitution as shown in fig 4 the chlorine is attracted by the lone pair electrons of 1n the two molecules proceed through a transition state with the 1nh bond increases from 1 009 to 1 117 å and the distance of 1n and cl gradually shortens to 2 673 å which finally formed the chlorinated sdt this molecule goes further to rearrange as the c s bond and s n bond gradually cleave and the distance of 5c and 6n shorten from 2 789 å and finally forms the 5c 6n bond of 1 420 å 3 3 2 the correlation between theoretically calculated free energy barriers and activity in experimental observation free chlorine is efficient to remove all chosen sulfonamides which follows a pseudo first order kinetics model with k o b s ranging from 0 0098 to 0 1371 s 1 at ph 7 in the presence of 3 mg l fac and 0 036 μmol l sulfonamides the k o b s and measured ph values during experiments are listed in table s9 and table s10 respectively derivation of k o b s is shown in text s3 among the eight sulfonamides k o b s of smz is reported in our previous study fu et al 2018 k o b s reported in previous studies are listed in table s11 chamberlain and adams 2006 dodd and huang 2004 dong et al 2019 nassar et al 2018 although there are considerable deviations from different studies which may originated from different experimental conditions e g initial sulfonamide and fac concentrations mixing condition and temperature et al all the results point to a conclusion that sulfonamides react rapidly with fac outwardly the values of free energy barriers δ g and reaction free energy δ g are shown in fig 5 according to the negative values of δ g the reactions of cl substitution rearrangement and cleavage of s n bond are all exergonic which suggests they can spontaneously take place at the standard reaction condition thermodynamically however the values of δ g are relatively high at room temperature 298 15 k which indicates that from the standpoint of dynamics the reaction rates are controlled by their free energy barriers δ g in general an elementary reaction follows the eyring polanyi equation based on the transition state theory evans and polanyi 1935 eyring 1935 eyring and polanyi 2013 11 k k b t h e δ g r t where k is the rate constant k b is boltzmann constant t is the temperature h is planck constant r is ideal gas constant δ g stands for the free energy barrier of the elementary reaction when several elementary reactions occur simultaneously from the same reactant the observed rate constant i e k o b s measured against the reactant presents the following relationship with each elementary reaction 12 k o b s k b t h e δ g n r t where n represents the number of elementary reactions due to the extremely fast growth of exponential function even the δ g n increases slightly the term e δ g n r t will become much smaller it indicates when several elementary reactions are competing with each other the reaction with the lowest δ g can be dominant in the observed rate constant k o b s while the reactions with the higher δ g can be omitted as to the reactions directly consume sulfonamides δ g of cl substitution is the lowest with the value of 35 04 36 77 kcal mol while δ g of cleavage of s n bond are higher varying from 52 39 to 61 41 kcal mol fig 5 hence dynamically the cl substitution is the fastest pathway to consume sulfonamides molecules although the cleavage of s n bond is the competing reaction it can be expected that k o b s of sulfonamide chlorination will follow the equation 13 k o b s k b t h e δ g c l r t where δ g c l is the free energy barrier of cl substitution take logarithm on both sides of the formula ideally the l n k o b s should be in a linear relationship with δ g c l and the slop of the line should be 1 r t 14 l n k o b s l n k b t h δ g c l r t at room temperature of 298 15 k when δ g c l is in the unit of kcal mol this slope should ideally be around 1 677 mol kcal as shown in fig 5 the l n k o b s does present a good linear relationship with the coefficient of determination r2 as high as 0 962 the slope of the line is 1 619 mol kcal which is close to the ideal value of 1 677 mol kcal this good linear relationship indicates that cl substitution does contribute most to sulfonamide consumption and it is the key step of the whole reaction furthermore it presents an excellent accordance between the experiment and theoretical calculation the linear relationship clearly demonstrates that by calculating the free energy barrier of cl substitution k o b s of sulfonamide consumption can be correspondingly estimated although in most cases δ g c l can be a good indicator to estimate k o b s what should be noticed is that such application is not always quantitatively accurate during the linear regression k o b s of sulfonamide consumption should be obtained under the same condition in experiments so are the energy barriers in theoretical calculation in addition under the real condition reactions are quite complex involving a series of steps which could lead to the diversion to the linear line for example as shown in fig 5 the points of smx and scp colored in gray slightly diverged from the linear relationship the major reason should be due to the lower proportions of neutral smx 55 7 and scp 44 3 under ph 5 5 table s2 3 3 3 effect of heterocycles it has been verified that cl substitution is the key step of the overall chlorination reaction which occurs at the aniline n since heterocycles are not directly connected to the aniline group they have little effect on the geometry and electron population of the aniline group its influence on δ g is also relatively small however according to eyring polanyi equation minor variation in δ g value changes the reaction rate constant k exponentially hence the influence of heterocycles emerges when it comes to k o b s the chlorine atom of hocl is positively charged and it is likely to attack electron rich sites therefore the higher the electron density is the quicker the cl substitution will be in general heterocycles containing nitrogen atoms are electron withdrawing groups carey and giuliano 2016 for sulfonamides selected in this study heterocycle of smz ssm sdz sdt and smm is pyrimidine while that of smp is pyridazine fig 3 the methoxy group possesses electron donating character carey and giuliano 2016 which weakens the electron withdrawing capacity of n heterocycle to some extent therefore sdt with two methoxy groups connected to pyrimidine ring presents the fastest reaction rate followed by smm with one methoxy group methyl group is of weak electronic effect and thus the reaction rates of smz ssm and sdz are close to each other and lower than that of sdt and smm compared with pyrimidine pyridazine is of stronger electron withdrawing capacity which is too strong to be made up by the methoxy group carey and giuliano 2016 thus smp with one methoxy group connected to pyridazine presents the slowest reaction rate it can be concluded that the more electron donating the heterocycle is the higher the electron density of the aniline is which leads to the faster reaction rate of sulfonamides notably computational chemistry breaks the boundary of organic chemistry analysis only when the crucial reaction is determined by calculation can we apply such electron withdrawing and electron donating rules for organic chemistry analysis in addition analysis of the electron donating and electron withdrawing property could only work qualitatively but in many cases the quantitative results need to be obtained furthermore when the heterocycle becomes larger and more complex with the different contribution of groups it is hard to get the qualitative effect of heterocycle to sum up computational chemistry calculation is an effective quantitative method conclusion this study presents a systematic strategy to demonstrate how computational chemistry can be applied to investigate the transformation behavior of pollutants take the chlorination of sulfonamides as an example the reactive sites of sulfonamide for chlorination are successfully predicted which primarily locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and electronic properties of the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide in sulfonamides are negligible the reactive sites of sulfonamide chlorination locate on 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide and thus all the sulfonamides follow the similar reaction behavior cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution onto the aniline n and the flowing rearrangement to lose the so2 group are the critical reaction pathways of sulfonamide chlorination the cl substitution is the key step of the whole reaction judged from the lowest free energy barrier δ g the observed rate constant k o b s can be quantitatively predicated by substituting the δ g of cl substitution into the eyring polanyi equation heterocycles impact the reaction rate by affecting the electronic density of aniline in general the more electron donating the heterocycle is the more readily the sulfonamides to be chlorinated applying of this strategy comprehensive information from the molecular properties and reactive sites to the reaction mechanisms and energy barriers is

16758,increasing number of emerging pollutants in environments requires an effective approach which can facilitate the prediction of reactivity and provide insights into the reaction mechanisms computational chemistry is exactly the tool to fulfill this demand with its good performance in theoretical investigation of chemical reactions at molecular level in this study chlorination of sulfonamide antibiotics is used as an illustration to present a systematic strategy demonstrating how computational chemistry can be applied to investigate the reaction behavior of emerging pollutants sulfonamides is a class of micropollutants that contain the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonmaide while differ in their heterocycles based on the calculated conceptual dft indices the reactive sites of sulfonamide are successfully predicted which locate on their common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonmaide therefore all sulfonamides follow the similar reaction pathway product identification by ltq orbitrap ms further verifies the in silico prediction three critical pathways are discovered i e s n bond cleavage cl substitution onto aniline n and the following rearrangement to lose so2 group among which cl substitution is the key step due to its lowest free energy barrier heterocycles impact the reaction rate by affecting the electronic density of aniline group in general the more electron donating the heterocycle is the more readily sulfonamides to be chlorinated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords computational chemistry emerging pollutants fukui function free energy barrier eyring polanyi equation reaction pathway 1 introduction in comparison to heavy metals nutrients and other macropollutants of which the removal behavior are relatively well understood thousands of micropollutants in wastewater which may wreak havoc in the environment remain more or less mysterious investigation of a surging number of micropollutants calls for more effective tools fortunately micropollutants usually fall into several classes their structures are partially the same when they belong to the same class based on the intensive investigation of several typical compounds it is possible to speculate the physical and chemical properties and pollution behavior of a whole class of micropollutants if so the experimental cost could be greatly decreased and the investigation efficiency would largely increase furthermore due to the less experimental consumption of chemical reagents the way we explore the environmental problem will become more environmental friendly computational chemistry is thus the exact tool in fulfilling this goal modern computational chemistry is based on the quantum mechanics and computational techniques to interpret and predict the properties of chemical compounds the common approaches include wave functional theory hartree fock and post hartree fock methods density functional theory dft semi empirical and other computational methods jensen 2017 levine 2014 benefiting from the development of high performance computing complex calculations with tens of atoms can be accomplished within several hours nowadays accordingly computational chemistry calculations especially with the dft method can be applied to larger molecular systems with thousands of atoms koch and holthausen 2001 compared to the semi empirical methods dft calculation well describes geometries electronic structure and spectroscopic properties in addition rather than solving the hartree fock rothaan equation followed by post hartree fock treatments such as configuration interaction and møller plesset perturbation theory dft applies the widely observed fact that the ground state energy is only the function of the electron density which accordingly determines all the other electronic properties of the system hohenberg and kohn 1964 sholl and steckel 2009 this approach makes the computation of dft faster than ab initio post hartree fock methods furthermore the results of dft in most cases agree well with experiments arnold et al 2000 lejaeghere et al 2016 hence dft becomes the most popular computational chemistry method with the current computer architecture computational chemistry has been introduced in many disciplines and thus derives its corresponding new subjects such as computational materials and computational biology a similar trend occurs in the field of environmental science and engineering a number of environmental studies involved computational chemistry for example zhang et al investigated the automobile emission purification of no and co reduced to n2 and co2 dft calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanisms the results revealed that the local coordination environment of the bimetallic site rh1co3 helped to activate the two no molecules and generated the intermediate n2o in contrast to rh co bimetallic nanoparticles coo rh1co3 coo presented high selectivity at a relatively low temperature because of the stronger binding of n2o on rh1co3 site and the rather low activation barrier for dissociation of the intermediate n2o to n2 zhang et al 2015 dft calculation was also applied to investigate the transformation behavior of contaminants such as dioxins pesticides perfluorinated compounds and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps drout et al 2020 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2014 xu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 due to the extreme toxicity and the lack of efficient detection schemes researches on dioxin formation mechanism get into a difficult situation with the aid of dft calculation xu et al elucidated the dioxin formations from the cross condensation of phenoxy radicals with several chlorine substituted phenoxy radicals xu et al 2010 xu et al 2011 by comparing the barriers of possible elementary reactions the most thermodynamically favored pathways were determined rate constants for each elementary reaction were calculated based on the transition state theory drout et al launched an experimental and theoretical investigation on the possible adsorption mechanisms of glyphosate onto a zirconium based metal organic framework i e nu 1000 drout et al 2020 through geometry optimization they indicated that binding in the c pore of nu 1000 was more favorable due to the formation of hydrogen bond through the glyphosate carboxylic acid with the nu 100 terminal hydroxyl ligands ranitidine a histamine h2 receptor antagonist belonging to ppcps presents high n nitrosodimethylamine ndma yield during chloramination compared with other tertiary amines liu et al investigated the formation mechanisms of ndma from ranitidine and other tertiary amines during chloramination by dft calculation and proposed a new four step formation pathway i e nucleophilic substitution by chloramine oxidation dehydration and nitrosation liu et al 2014 they suggested that ranitidine was formidable ndma precursor because its reaction barrier of nitrosation was much lower clearly computational chemistry has shown its charm in a great deal of researches in the field of environmental science and engineering nevertheless the potential of utilizing computational chemistry in environmental science and engineering is yet to be fully explored through calculations a comprehensive understanding of molecular properties of pollutants can be obtained which allows the prediction of reaction behavior and discover the universal mechanism as well as individual difference of pollutants belonging to the same major category considering the situation mentioned above chlorination behaviors of eight sulfonamide antibiotics are investigated theoretically and experimentally as an example to show how we can fully take advantage of the potential and feasibility of computational chemistry to investigate the transformation behavior of emerging environmental pollutants chlorination by hocl ocl is the most common disinfection process used all over the world it is the last toll gate that pollutants go through to enter the aquatic environment sulfonamide antibiotic is a kind of micropollutants that are well known for their continually detection in surface waters ground waters and even drinking waters christian et al 2003 kolpin et al 2002 padhye et al 2014 investigation on the chlorination behavior of sulfonamide antibiotic is of great environmental significance in summary the aim of this study is to demonstrate a general computational chemistry strategy for unraveling the reactivity of emerging pollutants including 1 to predict possible reactive sites of eight chosen sulfonamides with the aid of computational chemistry 2 to experimentally investigate the

natural population analysis npa glendening et al al reed and weinhold 1985 multiwfn version 3 7 lu and chen 2012 was also applied to achieve further analyses of electron density ρ r with the hirshfeld population hirshfeld 1977 ritchie 1985 ritchie and bachrach 1987 and calculate the indices developed from conceptual dft geerlings et al 2003 glendening et al 2003 liu 2009 i e fukui function ayers and levy 2000 parr and yang 1984 and condensed fukui function yang and mortier 1986 to obtain the gibbs free energy of the reactions the entropy values at the standard condition 1 atm and 298 15 k were calculated by harmonic approach first the free energy values in the gas phase with vibrational rotational and translational contributions g g a s for the configurations including reactants transition states and products were calculated 1 g g a s h t s v i b s r o t s t r a n s where h is the enthalpy obtained from the calculation t represents reaction temperature s v i b s r o t and s t r a n s are the entropy contributed from the vibrational rotational and translational movements respectively however for real reactions in aqueous solution the rotational and translational movements of the solute molecules were largely suppressed by the solvent molecules besora et al 2018 according to previous studies the total entropy in solution should be around 70 of that in the gas phase plata and singleton 2015 yu and houk 2003 hence in this study the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution g was estimated by involving 50 of the rotational and translational contributions making the value 70 to 80 of the free energy in gas phase deubel 2008 deubel and lau 2006 2 g h t s v i b 0 5 s r o t 0 5 s t r a n s finally the reaction free energy δ g and the free energy barrier δ g were calculated following the equations 3 δ g g p g r 4 δ g g t s g r where g r g p and g t s are the gibbs free energy in aqueous solution of the reactant product and transition state respectively the free energy barrier δ g of cl substitution calculated from g and g g a s are listed in table s3 the values of δ g δ g g a s and δ g v i b are quite close with each other hence based on the previous studies and our further tests the free energy g calculated by eq 2 were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular properties and reactive site prediction of sulfonamides 3 1 1 geometry the fully optimized geometries of hocl molecule and the chosen sulfonamides are shown in fig 1 tables s4 and s5 the chlorine atom of hocl is different from the oxygen atom in electronegativity thus the cl o bond is polarized clδ ohδ chlorine atom is positively charged with a value of 0 175 npa charge e thus it is likely to attack electron rich sites and evoke the electrophilic reactions this is consistent with the general idea of reaction characteristic of hocl deborde and von gunten 2008 all sulfonamides contain the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide one hydrogen atom of the sulfonamide group is replaced by heterocycles table s2 to form different types of sulfonamides as shown in fig 1 b the aniline nitrogen numbered as 1n is almost coplanar with phenyl group according to the pyykkö covalent radii the single bond and double bond distances between c and n are 1 49 å and 1 27 å respectively pyykkö and atsumi 2009a b the calculated lengths of 1n 2c are 1 364 1 367 å for the eight chosen sulfonamides which are between the length of single and double cn bond indicating the electron delocalization at 1n and the phenyl group it is important to notice that the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide are almost negligible as shown in fig 1 b and table s5 the variations of bond lengths of 1n 2c 5c s and 6n s and the angle of 5c s 6n are 0 003 å 0 003 å 0 028 å and 3 5 respectively furthermore the distances between 5c and 6n lie in the range of 2 750 2 807 å for the eight chosen sas which are considerably shorter than the sum of the van der waals radii of c and n 3 25 å indicating a possible intramolecular interaction between these two atoms batsanov 2001 the bond lengths angles and vibrational frequencies of hocl molecule obtained at other theoretical levels alkorta et al 2008 blanco et al 2009 roohi et al 2010 yuan et al 2009 and by experiments anderson et al 1986 ashby 1971 junttila et al 1994 mirri et al 1971 are shown in table s4 geometry parameters of smz sdz smp scp and smx calculated at m06 2x 6 311 g d p level soriano correa et al 2018 sdz at b3lyp 6 31 g d p ogruc ildiz et al 2009 and b3lyp 6 311 g d p level nikoofard et al 2017 smp and scp at b3lyp 6 31 g d p level shah and hao 2017 shah et al 2015 as well as smp basak et al 1987 and scp tan et al 2005 obtained by x ray diffraction analysis are listed in table s5 the geometry parameters obtained in this study are consistent with those reported in previous studies tables s4 and s5 indicating the feasibility and reliability of our calculation methods 3 1 2 prediction of reactive sites the ideal way to predict reactive sites is to perform ab initio molecular dynamic simulations which is rather time consuming besides based on the transition state theory investigating all possible transition states and comparing their reaction energy barriers is another way to figure out the possible reactive sites compared with these two methods it is straightforward to predict reactive sites based on the properties of molecules e g the electrostatic potential atomic charge and indices proposed by conceptual dft including the frontier molecular orbitals fukui 1970 fukui et al 1952 hirshfeld 1977 and the electronic fukui functions ayers and levy 2000 parr and yang 1984 yang and mortier 1986 which are generally considered as complementary indicators the atomic charges obtain from the electron population analyses can provide a general understanding of the charge distribution over the whole molecule yin et al 2018 and thus can act as the preliminary criteria to predict reaction sites common computational methods for the determination of atomic charges include mulliken hirshfeld npa and so on hirshfeld 1977 mulliken 1955 reed and weinhold 1985 reed et al 1985 ritchie 1985 ritchie and bachrach 1987 the accordingly atomic charges are then named after their calculation methods as shown in fig 1 b tables s5 and s6 hirshfeld and npa atomic charges of 1n 5c 6n oxygen atoms of so2 and the other heteroatoms of the heterocycles are all negatively charged which can be the possible reactive sites of chlorine electrophilic substitution in addition to the atomic charge distribution of frontier molecular orbitals also gives some hints particularly the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo according to frontier molecular orbital theory fukui 1970 fukui et al 1952 electrons in homo are the most active and easy to be lost while lumo takes the least energy to accept electrons as mentioned chlorine atom of hocl is positively charged and likely to interact with the electron rich sites hence in this study homos of sulfonamides are vital to speculate the possible reaction sites as shown in table s7 the homos of all chosen sulfonamides are located on their common structure i e the aniline 1n 2 5c through further orbital composition analysis based on hirshfeld distribution hirshfeld 1977 the exact reactive atom can be determined as listed in table s8 the orbital composition of 2c 3c and 4c are about 11 while contribution of para c 5c is above 15 it is obvious that 1n contributes the most to the homo orbital about 28 thus it should be the preliminary reactive site of chlorine electrophilic reaction the electronic fukui functions f r and their condensed forms further confirmed the above prediction f r can be interpreted as the change of the electron density ρ r at each point r along with the change of the total number of electrons n geerlings et al 2003 5 f r ρ r n v where ν is external potential in general the finite different method is carried out to approximately obtain its right and left hand side derivatives 6 f r ρ n 1 r ρ n r 7 f r ρ n r ρ n 1 r where ρ n r ρ n 1 r ρ n 1 r represent the electron density of systems with n n 1 and n 1 electrons under the same geometry respectively from the above mentioned definition and expressions f r indicates that when a system is attacked by electrophilic reagents and loses an electron how the electron density changes at each point r that is the more intensive isosurface of f r in a particular region the more reactive it is to participate in electrophilic reactions similarly f r represents the activity of a particular region to react with nucleophilic reagents a condensed form of fukui function f a can be obtained 8 f a q a n 1 q a n 9 f a q a n q a n 1 10 f a 0 q a n 1 q a n 1 2 where q a n q a n 1 q a n 1 represent the atomic charge of atom a in systems with n n 1 and n 1 electrons under the same geometry respectively f a 0 represents the activity of a particular atom to participate radical attacking reactions different electron population schemes lead to different atomic charge and f a values the most common used one is hirshfeld charge derived bultinck et al 2007 kinkar roy et al 2001 kinkar roy et al 2000 roy et al 1999 as mentioned hocl attacks the electron rich site and evoke the electrophilic reactions thus f r and f a of sulfonamides should be considered take the contour plot of f r of sdt for example fig 2 f r distributes at the aniline n the para and ortho c the imino group and the heterocycle f 1 n is far larger than other atoms with a value of 0 176 based on the hirshfeld partitioning technique which clearly shows that when electrophilic attack occur the electron density greatly change at the aniline n 1n and this area is most potentially to provoke electrophilic reaction f a has been successfully applied in previous studies to elucidate the reaction ability of sdz towards hydroxyl radical teng et al 2020 and the reactivity of sdz smz and smx towards peroxymonosulfate pms yin et al 2018 and singlet oxygen 1o2 yin et al 2019 these results indicated that the aniline n and the heterocycle of sdz were the most likely reactive sites subject to hydroxyl radical attack while aniline n of sdz smz and smx was the most vulnerable site to be oxidized by pms and 1o2 teng et al 2020 yin et al 2019 yin et al 2018 based on the above calculation and analysis of the molecular properties of sulfonamides it can be predicted that the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and electronic properties of the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide in sulfonamides are more or less negligible furthermore the initial reaction sites of electrophilic reaction most probably locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide i e the common structure of sulfonamides hence all the sulfonamides should follow the similar reaction behavior during the chlorination disinfection process to verify these predictions we experimentally analyzed the transformation products by ltq orbitrap ms and the results are presented in the following section 3 2 3 2 chlorination product identified by ltq orbitrap ms free chlorine is efficient to remove all chosen sulfonamides and kinetics is illustrated in section 3 3 2 however the total organic carbon toc removal of less than 35 after 14 day s chlorination indicates that mineralization of sulfonamides is hardly achieved as shown in fig s1 considering the almost complete elimination of sulfonamides and the limited toc removal plentiful transformation products should be generated during the chlorination disinfection in this study 85 transformation products from the chlorination of eight chosen sulfonamides are detected where the products of smz were reported in our previous study fu et al 2018 their structures are primarily deduced based on their elementary compositions and fragmentation in ltq orbitrap ms as shown in fig s2 s23 the principles to interpret ms spectra are described in text s2 furthermore based on the 85 ms spectra the typical fragmentation behaviors of chlorination products are summarized in fig s24 firstly for compounds containing the structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide rearrangement occurs to lose so2 and generate the benzene 1 4 diamine cation besides another type of rearrangement occurs simultaneously to form the 4 aminophenol cation secondly chlorine and methoxyl can be easily lost through both heterolysis and homolysis to generate corresponding cation or radical cation respectively moreover the methoxyl group can lose a methyl finally elimination occurs to benzene and other heterocyclic rings the fragmentation behavior of ssm product m z 215 1291 and smx product m z 190 0975 are typical examples as shown in fig s6 and fig s22 respectively based on the products detected the main reaction pathway framework of sulfonamide chlorination is summarized in fig 3 three critical procedures make up the main pathway framework i e cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution and rearrangement to lose the so2 group in fact the ms spectra can only provide evidence that chlorine substituted onto the aniline group because the existence of the fragment of c6h5cln m z 126 0105 it remains unknown whether it is n chlorinated or ring chlorinated in our previous study fu et al 2018 rearrangement to lose the so2 group was identified as a significant transformation pathway of smz chlorination fu et al 2018 through dft calculation we verified that cl substitution onto aniline n was the driving force for rearrangement dodd et al also detected the chlorinated sulfamethoxazole during sulfamethoxazole chlorination they suggested that the primary chlorination site should be the aniline n dodd and huang 2004 furthermore towards reagents that mainly react through electrophilic attack such as kmno4 hu et al 2011 ladbury and cullis 1958 pang et al 2014 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 and clo2 baribeau et al 2002 gagnon et al 2005 the reactive site of sulfonamides were also reported to be the aniline n gao et al 2014 willach et al 2017 therefore the cl substitution site is determined to be the aniline n s n cleavage and the cl substitution at aniline n occur simultaneously as the first step to generate tp1 and the chlorinated sulfonamides the chlorinated sulfonamides undergo further cl substitution to generate tp2 and tp3 or rearrange to lose the so2 group to generate tp5 tp5 is further chlorinated or dechlorinated to generate tp6 tp7 and tp8 tp2 and tp6 go through coupling reaction to generate tp4 and tp10 respectively extrusion of so2 group is ubiquitously observed during the chlorination of eight chosen sulfonamides in spite of their different heterocycle 5 membered or 6 membered sulfonamides in fact this is in accordance with the geometry and electron population analysis in section 3 1 which indicates the effect of heterocycle on the structure and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide is more or less negligible however yin et al and feng et al reported that when reacted with peroxydisulfate combined with 1o2 yin et al 2020 and ferratevi feng et al 2019 so2 extrusion would not occur to sulfonamides with five membered heterocycles the different observation may be originated from different major pathways towards different oxidants or the lack of driving force for so2 extrusion or the desulfated products were too quickly consumed to be detected it has been proposed in section 3 1 that the most possible reactive sites of electrophilic reaction locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide furthermore heterocycles of sulfonamides have little effect on the geometry and atomic charges of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide hence all sulfonamides should follow a similar reaction pattern definitely the prediction results of dft calculation accord well with the ltq orbitrap ms analysis which indicates the feasibility and reliability of reaction site prediction from the calculated molecular properties furthermore it can be deduced that with regards to pollutants belonging to the same class the reaction behavior and transformation products can be successfully predicted via computational chemistry approach 3 3 reaction mechanisms geometry reaction energy barriers and the effect of heterocycles there are several species of reactants under different ph values species of chlorine hocl and ocl react with various forms of sulfonamides cationic neutral and anionic sulfonamides in fact these reactions are elementary reactions that can be considered independently thus here we take the reaction between neutral sulfonamide and hocl molecules as an example to illustrate how to investigate the reaction mechanism with computational chemistry and how to integrate experiment with theory considering the mole fractions of hocl and neutral sulfonamides make up for more than 80 under ph 5 5 except for smx 55 7 and scp 44 3 shown in table s2 the observed rate constants k o b s obtained under ph 5 5 is used to discover the correlation between experimental and theoretical calculation results as to other ph values the same procedure is just followed only with more elementary reactions taken into account 3 3 1 geometry of transition states three key procedures make up the main pathway framework i e the cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution at the aniline n and the following rearrangement to lose the so2 group here sdt is taken as an example to illustrate the geometry transformation from reactants to products of these three procedures the optimized geometry of reactants transition states and products are shown in fig 4 and tables s4 and s5 all the transition states were confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate calculation and an example is shown in fig s25 the cleavage of s n bond is triggered by the electrophilic substitution of cl on the imino group with regards to the optimized sdt molecule the bond lengths of the c s and s n bonds are 1 763 å and 1 689 å respectively the bond angle of the 5c s 6n is 106 7 table s5 the cl o bond length is 1 737 å of optimized hocl fig 1 as shown in fig 4 through electrostatic attraction the chlorine atom gets close to the 6n atom and the 5c s 6n angle is compressed the s n distance increases to 2 648 å and cleavage transition state of s n cleavage finally the cl n bond forms with a length of 1 771 å and thus generates the stable products cl nh r for cl substitution as shown in fig 4 the chlorine is attracted by the lone pair electrons of 1n the two molecules proceed through a transition state with the 1nh bond increases from 1 009 to 1 117 å and the distance of 1n and cl gradually shortens to 2 673 å which finally formed the chlorinated sdt this molecule goes further to rearrange as the c s bond and s n bond gradually cleave and the distance of 5c and 6n shorten from 2 789 å and finally forms the 5c 6n bond of 1 420 å 3 3 2 the correlation between theoretically calculated free energy barriers and activity in experimental observation free chlorine is efficient to remove all chosen sulfonamides which follows a pseudo first order kinetics model with k o b s ranging from 0 0098 to 0 1371 s 1 at ph 7 in the presence of 3 mg l fac and 0 036 μmol l sulfonamides the k o b s and measured ph values during experiments are listed in table s9 and table s10 respectively derivation of k o b s is shown in text s3 among the eight sulfonamides k o b s of smz is reported in our previous study fu et al 2018 k o b s reported in previous studies are listed in table s11 chamberlain and adams 2006 dodd and huang 2004 dong et al 2019 nassar et al 2018 although there are considerable deviations from different studies which may originated from different experimental conditions e g initial sulfonamide and fac concentrations mixing condition and temperature et al all the results point to a conclusion that sulfonamides react rapidly with fac outwardly the values of free energy barriers δ g and reaction free energy δ g are shown in fig 5 according to the negative values of δ g the reactions of cl substitution rearrangement and cleavage of s n bond are all exergonic which suggests they can spontaneously take place at the standard reaction condition thermodynamically however the values of δ g are relatively high at room temperature 298 15 k which indicates that from the standpoint of dynamics the reaction rates are controlled by their free energy barriers δ g in general an elementary reaction follows the eyring polanyi equation based on the transition state theory evans and polanyi 1935 eyring 1935 eyring and polanyi 2013 11 k k b t h e δ g r t where k is the rate constant k b is boltzmann constant t is the temperature h is planck constant r is ideal gas constant δ g stands for the free energy barrier of the elementary reaction when several elementary reactions occur simultaneously from the same reactant the observed rate constant i e k o b s measured against the reactant presents the following relationship with each elementary reaction 12 k o b s k b t h e δ g n r t where n represents the number of elementary reactions due to the extremely fast growth of exponential function even the δ g n increases slightly the term e δ g n r t will become much smaller it indicates when several elementary reactions are competing with each other the reaction with the lowest δ g can be dominant in the observed rate constant k o b s while the reactions with the higher δ g can be omitted as to the reactions directly consume sulfonamides δ g of cl substitution is the lowest with the value of 35 04 36 77 kcal mol while δ g of cleavage of s n bond are higher varying from 52 39 to 61 41 kcal mol fig 5 hence dynamically the cl substitution is the fastest pathway to consume sulfonamides molecules although the cleavage of s n bond is the competing reaction it can be expected that k o b s of sulfonamide chlorination will follow the equation 13 k o b s k b t h e δ g c l r t where δ g c l is the free energy barrier of cl substitution take logarithm on both sides of the formula ideally the l n k o b s should be in a linear relationship with δ g c l and the slop of the line should be 1 r t 14 l n k o b s l n k b t h δ g c l r t at room temperature of 298 15 k when δ g c l is in the unit of kcal mol this slope should ideally be around 1 677 mol kcal as shown in fig 5 the l n k o b s does present a good linear relationship with the coefficient of determination r2 as high as 0 962 the slope of the line is 1 619 mol kcal which is close to the ideal value of 1 677 mol kcal this good linear relationship indicates that cl substitution does contribute most to sulfonamide consumption and it is the key step of the whole reaction furthermore it presents an excellent accordance between the experiment and theoretical calculation the linear relationship clearly demonstrates that by calculating the free energy barrier of cl substitution k o b s of sulfonamide consumption can be correspondingly estimated although in most cases δ g c l can be a good indicator to estimate k o b s what should be noticed is that such application is not always quantitatively accurate during the linear regression k o b s of sulfonamide consumption should be obtained under the same condition in experiments so are the energy barriers in theoretical calculation in addition under the real condition reactions are quite complex involving a series of steps which could lead to the diversion to the linear line for example as shown in fig 5 the points of smx and scp colored in gray slightly diverged from the linear relationship the major reason should be due to the lower proportions of neutral smx 55 7 and scp 44 3 under ph 5 5 table s2 3 3 3 effect of heterocycles it has been verified that cl substitution is the key step of the overall chlorination reaction which occurs at the aniline n since heterocycles are not directly connected to the aniline group they have little effect on the geometry and electron population of the aniline group its influence on δ g is also relatively small however according to eyring polanyi equation minor variation in δ g value changes the reaction rate constant k exponentially hence the influence of heterocycles emerges when it comes to k o b s the chlorine atom of hocl is positively charged and it is likely to attack electron rich sites therefore the higher the electron density is the quicker the cl substitution will be in general heterocycles containing nitrogen atoms are electron withdrawing groups carey and giuliano 2016 for sulfonamides selected in this study heterocycle of smz ssm sdz sdt and smm is pyrimidine while that of smp is pyridazine fig 3 the methoxy group possesses electron donating character carey and giuliano 2016 which weakens the electron withdrawing capacity of n heterocycle to some extent therefore sdt with two methoxy groups connected to pyrimidine ring presents the fastest reaction rate followed by smm with one methoxy group methyl group is of weak electronic effect and thus the reaction rates of smz ssm and sdz are close to each other and lower than that of sdt and smm compared with pyrimidine pyridazine is of stronger electron withdrawing capacity which is too strong to be made up by the methoxy group carey and giuliano 2016 thus smp with one methoxy group connected to pyridazine presents the slowest reaction rate it can be concluded that the more electron donating the heterocycle is the higher the electron density of the aniline is which leads to the faster reaction rate of sulfonamides notably computational chemistry breaks the boundary of organic chemistry analysis only when the crucial reaction is determined by calculation can we apply such electron withdrawing and electron donating rules for organic chemistry analysis in addition analysis of the electron donating and electron withdrawing property could only work qualitatively but in many cases the quantitative results need to be obtained furthermore when the heterocycle becomes larger and more complex with the different contribution of groups it is hard to get the qualitative effect of heterocycle to sum up computational chemistry calculation is an effective quantitative method conclusion this study presents a systematic strategy to demonstrate how computational chemistry can be applied to investigate the transformation behavior of pollutants take the chlorination of sulfonamides as an example the reactive sites of sulfonamide for chlorination are successfully predicted which primarily locate on the 5c the aniline n 1n and imino n 6n the effect of heterocycles on the geometry and electronic properties of the common structure of 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide in sulfonamides are negligible the reactive sites of sulfonamide chlorination locate on 4 aminobenzenesulfonamide and thus all the sulfonamides follow the similar reaction behavior cleavage of the s n bond cl substitution onto the aniline n and the flowing rearrangement to lose the so2 group are the critical reaction pathways of sulfonamide chlorination the cl substitution is the key step of the whole reaction judged from the lowest free energy barrier δ g the observed rate constant k o b s can be quantitatively predicated by substituting the δ g of cl substitution into the eyring polanyi equation heterocycles impact the reaction rate by affecting the electronic density of aniline in general the more electron donating the heterocycle is the more readily the sulfonamides to be chlorinated applying of this strategy comprehensive information from the molecular properties and reactive sites to the reaction mechanisms and energy barriers is deciphered and thus facilitates the fundamentally understanding of the reaction behavior of emerging pollutants supporting information details of the hplc ms ms and ltq orbitrap ms detection and

16759,eutrophication strongly influences plant stoichiometric characteristics and physiological status by altering nutrient and light availability in the water column however the mechanisms linking plant functional traits with ecosystem structure and functioning to clarify the decline of submerged macrophytes have not been fully elucidated to date therefore based on a field investigation of 26 macrophytic shallow lakes on the yangtze plain we first constructed a plant trait network at the whole plant level to determine the hub traits of submerged macrophytes that play central regulatory roles in plant phenotype our results suggested that organ leaf stem and root phosphorus p starch and total nonstructural carbohydrate tnc contents were hub traits organ starch and tnc were consistent with those in the experiment based network obtained from a three month manipulation experiment next the mechanisms underlying the relationships between the hub traits and vital aspects of ecological performance were carefully investigated using field investigation data specifically stoichiometric homeostasis of p h p starch and tnc were positively associated with dominance and biomass at the species level and community biomass at the community level additionally structural equation modeling clarified not only a hypothesized pathway from eutrophication to water clarity and community tnc but also combined effects of community tnc and h p on community biomass that is ecosystems dominated by more homeostatic communities tended to have more carbon c rich compounds in relatively oligotrophic conditions which promoted the primary production of macrophytes eutrophication was determined to affect community structure by inhibiting the predominance of more homeostatic species and the production of carbohydrates finally reduced community biomass and increased nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios in plants induced by eutrophication implied a decrease in the c sink in biomass and may potentially lead to an enhancement of litter decomposition rates and nutrient cycling rates by adjusting plant responses to eutrophication stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms linking plant traits with ecosystem structure have important implications for understanding ecosystem processes and these results may contribute to practical management to achieve the restoration of submerged macrophytes and ecosystem services graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords network analysis nonstructural carbohydrate stoichiometric homeostasis ecosystem services eutrophication submerged macrophyte 1 introduction nutrient enrichment and reduced light availability resulting from human induced eutrophication have led to extreme alterations in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems sardans et al 2012 scheffer et al 2001 sterner et al 1997 zhang et al 2020 these stresses have caused regime shifts in many shallow lakes thus making it crucial to understand the mechanisms that are relevant to ecosystem structure and functioning beisner et al 2003 scheffer et al 2001 spears et al 2017 su et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that species functional traits and their interactions and trade offs are responsible for ecosystem processes and functioning under human disturbances diaz and cabido 2001 diaz et al 2004 lavorel and garnier 2002 su et al 2019b because these traits link individual functioning to ecological dominance and primary environmental variables such as nutrient and light availability submerged macrophytes are the key primary producers in shallow lakes and play a vital role in maintaining a clear water state scheffer et al 2001 and they reduce sediment resuspension madsen et al 2001 provide shelter for large body zooplankton and compete for nutrients with phytoplankton jeppesen et al 1998 furthermore the functional traits of these macrophytes in response to different environmental perturbations have been widely explored in manipulation experiments for example low nonstructural carbohydrate nsc mainly starch and soluble sugars in plants are produced under low light and high nutrient conditions chen et al 2020 huber et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 and element contents are influenced by nutrient levels in the surroundings li et al 2018 su et al 2019b however a number of factors have not been well studied first many studies are restricted to a single organ such as leaves or stems thus preventing a whole plant level perspective on trait coordination and functional ecology kleyer and minden 2015 kleyer et al 2019 coordination among traits represents trade offs and allometries in response to the environment stearns 1989 and affects ecosystem properties diaz and cabido 2001 lavorel and garnier 2002 plant trait networks can be used to explain complex correlations among traits from different organs and to calculate the overall topology and hub traits in networks he et al 2020 kleyer et al 2019 second scaling up from organ traits to species dominance and community biomass and the mechanisms underlying the changes have rarely been studied to our knowledge no studies have examined the hub traits i e the traits are correlated with a large number of other traits in the network that play a principal regulatory role in coordinating the whole phenotype and the stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms that link plant hub traits with key facets of ecological performance such as species dominance and ecosystem function at the whole plant level in freshwater ecosystems nutrient enrichment affects plant internal element contents whereas plants have the regulatory ability to maintain a stable internal elemental content in the face of variable nutrient availability under external conditions that is stoichiometric homeostasis cooper 2008 sterner and elser 2002 plant responses to different nutrient supplies depend on their species specific capacity for nutrient storage physiological adjustment and relative growth rate sistla et al 2015 furthermore different plant organs play distinct roles in composing an organic whole and more active organs have stronger ecological homeostasis i e homeostasis leaves branches roots zhang et al 2018 in the aboveground parts of plants stoichiometric homeostasis has been confirmed to be related to ecosystem production and stability su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 however previous research has not investigated the scaling up of homeostasis theory for single organs i e leaves stems and roots to whole communities ecosystems thus we hypothesize that stoichiometric homeostasis for different biological organizations from organs to species and to communities may be related to the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems in the process of eutrophication reduced light availability induced by eutrophication would result in decreasing photosynthesis and nsc contents in plants consequently leading to shortage of basic energy supply for plant growth and survival chen et al 2020 huber et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 however accumulated carbohydrates are beneficial for plants to alleviate low light and high ammonium stress in aquatic ecosystem cao et al 2009 huber et al 2012 rao et al 2018 while many studies have examined nsc roles in osmoregulation and phloem transport in terrestrial ecosystems hoch and korner 2012 martinez vilalta et al 2016 we know little about whether the nsc contents in organisms are related to species dominance ecosystem structure and function in lake ecosystems moreover underwater darkening is a worldwide phenomenon in lakes zhang et al 2020 and there is an urgent need to clarify the links between plant nsc pools and ecosystem functions in response to eutrophication the combined effects of nutrient and light availability on the biomass and stoichiometric properties of submerged macrophytes are critical for understanding the biogeochemical cycle in eutrophic lakes because primary production of plants is inhibited by eutrophication carbon c sink in biomass is expected to decrease c sequestration in plants may be further affected by lower photosynthetic c assimilation under light limitation conditions moreover submerged macrophytes tend to absorb and store excess elements in their tissues under nutrient rich conditions carignan and kalff 1980 thus we hypothesize that plant nutritional quality i e nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios in plant tissues increases with the progress of eutrophication communities composed of plants with high nutritional quality experience faster decomposition rates and nutrient recycling rates cebrian 1999 cebrian and lartigue 2004 cornwell et al 2008 demi et al 2018 li et al 2012 as submerged macrophytes are important for maintaining a clear water state in shallow lakes we could deduce that eutrophication may change nutrient cycling by decreasing the c sink in plant biomass and shifting the basal resource stoichiometry in this paper based on field observations of 26 shallow lakes on the yangtze floodplain fig 1 a we first explored the hub traits of submerged macrophytes at the whole plant level using correlation network analysis then the hub traits from the observed network were further confirmed by an experiment based network constructed from a three month manipulation experiment next we investigated the strength of the stoichiometric homeostasis and physiological constraints of submerged macrophytes based on hub traits and verified whether stoichiometric homeostasis and storage compounds were associated with species dominance ecosystem structure and functioning we finally elucidated the combined effects of light and nutrient availability on primary productivity and nutrient c ratios and then discussed their implications for nutrient cycling in lakes we hypothesized that stoichiometric mechanism and physiological constraints controlled the pattern of productivity of submerged macrophytes which could greatly improve our understanding of nutrient cycling in lakes in the face of eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and investigation as one of the three largest plains in china the yangtze plain contains multitudinous shallow lakes with varied nutrient levels field sampling was conducted in 26 macrophytic lakes located in the yangtze floodplain during the growing season in 2018 fig 1a the sampling method for macrophytes was the modified belt transect method and the number of sampling sites was confirmed based on the area of the macrophytic region the lake area and mean water depth varied from 2 1 to 2537 2 km2 and 1 03 to 3 25 m respectively rao et al 2020 for details in this study six species of common submerged macrophytes widely distributed in these lakes were carefully investigated potamogeton maackianus myriophyllum spicatum ceratophyllum demersum potamogeton wrightii vallisneria natans and hydrilla verticillate the biomass of these plants constituted most of the total submerged macrophytes and they were collected using a rotatable reaping hook covering 0 2 m2 three times at each sampling site the plants were carefully cleaned sorted by species and then weighed to measure the fresh weight fw the whole plants of the six species were sampled and divided into leaf stem and root parts corresponding water samples and sediment samples were collected from 0 5 m below the water surface and the top layers of sediment respectively these samples were placed in portable fridges and taken back to the laboratory for subsequent analysis to obtain the dry weight of organs leaf stem and root in the field survey of 2018 the mean organs mass fraction and moisture content of the six species were carefully investigated in 4 macrophytic lakes with different nutrient levels in 2020 table s1 and fig s1 for details with 170 plant samples in total 2 2 measurement and data collection the leaf stem root and sediment samples were first oven dried at 80 c and then ground to a fine powder for the element and physiological index only plant tissues measurements the c and n contents of these samples were determined with an element analyzer flash ea 1112 series ce instruments italy before measuring p the plant and sediment samples were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and h2so4 hclo4 respectively all samples were measured for p with the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method sparks et al 1996 approximately 100 mg of plant powder was extracted twice with 5 ml 80 ethanol at 80 c for 20 min ten milliliters of the extracts were centrifuged at 104 g for 15 min the free amino acid faa and soluble carbohydrate sc contents in the supernatant and starch contents in the residue were measured using the methods of these articles dirk et al 1999 yemm and cocking 1955 yemm and willis 1954 the sediment pore water was obtained by centrifuging the wet sediment at 2760 g for 20 min the total n tn and total p tp concentrations in the water column and pore water were analyzed as nitrate and orthophosphate after digestion with k2s2o8 according to standard methods huang et al 1999 secchi depth sd was measured with a secchi disk photosynthetically active radiation par was recorded by a li cor data logger li 400 li cor usa the light extinction coefficient k in the water column was computed based on the equation k 1 z ln i 0 i z where i 0 and i z are par at the water surface and water depth z respectively dissolved oxygen do ph and turbidity were measured with a ysi exo2 yellow spring inc usa chlorophyll a chl a was extracted using the ethanol method and then quantified by a spectrophotometer jespersen and christoffersen 1987 2 3 plant trait network analysis a network consists of many nodes and edges in plant trait networks plant functional traits are nodes and trait trait relationships are edges first a matrix of trait trait relationships r was calculated using pearson s correlations kleyer et al 2019 trait trait relationships may reflect the direct mechanistic correlation coselection through optimal design or concerted convergence he et al 2020 a significance threshold of r 0 2 and p 0 05 were applied to avoid spurious correlations among traits then an adjacency matrix a ai j with ai j ϵ 0 1 was yielded by assigning below threshold as 0 additionally a was weighted by the absolute correlation strength between any pair of plant traits rij adjacency in wgcna langfelder and horvath 2008 finally plant trait networks were visualized in cytoscape 3 8 0 using the prefuse force directed opencl layout www prefuse org the correlation strength of edges has been described above and there are two parameters to elucidate the properties of nodes degree cd and betweenness cb which can be used to quantify the connectedness and centrality of each node trait within the network respectively more information on the calculation of cd and cb was described in detail in supplementary material plant traits that have a high cd can be regarded as hub traits that have a regulatory effect on the whole plant phenotype whereas traits with high betweenness cb are mediators that coordinate several modules or subnetworks finally a plant trait network based on field investigation was constructed to determine the hub traits of submerged macrophytes at the whole plant level fig 1b here the ten most connected traits with a higher degree cd were considered as the hub traits 2 4 manipulation experiment after the hub traits in the field based network were confirmed the relationships between these hub traits and eleven environmental variables i e sediment tn and tp sdn and sdp water tn and tp pore water tn and tp pwtn and pwtp chl a sd ph turbidity and do were explored using a canonical correspondence analysis cca significant environmental variables p 0 05 were detected by forward selection within the cca and then the independent contribution of these variables to explained variation was calculated using the r package rdacca hp lai et al 2021 a monte carlo permutation test permutations 999 was performed to test the significance of the full model and each axis our results indicated that these significant variables accounted for 20 5 of the variation in hub traits from the field based network 65 9 of which was explained by tp sd and sdp fig 1c d therefore the manipulation experiment was controlled by different water tp and sdp and low light availability to simulate field surroundings and our main aim was to verify the consistency of hub traits from field and experiment based networks the three month experiment was conducted at the lake donghu experimental station and lasted from 7 june to 30 august 2019 v natans p wrightii h verticillata and m spicatum were cultured in 60 outdoor aquaria 50 50 80 cm which were placed in a shelter covered by a black shade net with 20 ambient light reaching the aquaria fig 1e this process produces values nearest to the mean light transmittance values par in z sd par in water surface at water depth zsd i e z sd is the value of mean sd in all field sampling sites which are calculated by k z sd and par in the water surface at each site the experiment had two treatments water tp enrichment at five levels and sediment type at four levels with three replicates for each treatment five tp addition levels included the control 0

the four sediments mesotrophic sediment a mixture of 70 mesotrophic sediment and 30 hypertrophic sediment volume ratio a mixture of 30 mesotrophic sediment and 70 hypertrophic sediment hypertrophic sediment were 0 81 0 98 1 18 and 1 25 g kg 1 for each species three healthy seedlings were planted in a plastic box 15 22 5 7 cm and 4 boxes containing different types of sediment were placed in an aquarium filled with 60 cm water meanwhile each aquarium received additional n added as nh4no3 to maintain 1 mg l 1 tn in water during the experiment the water tn and tp were measured every week to maintain appropriate concentrations at the end of the experiment plants were washed divided into three organs leaf stem and root and then dried to obtain the organ dry weight dw finally an experiment based network was established to determine whether and to what extent hub traits were consistent with those within the field based network fig 1f 2 5 calculation of element and carbohydrate contents and homeostatic coefficients the nutrient c n and p and carbohydrate starch and tnc contents of individuals and communities were computed using the biomass weighted mean method in the field investigation of 2018 the organ dw was obtained by multiplying the organ mean mass fraction and moisture content by the fw of the whole plant in this study nutrient c and n p ratios were used as the mass ratios element and carbohydrate contents for the species and community were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively for the species 1 e spe e l b l e s b s e r b r b spe where e spe e l e s and e r are the element c n or p and carbohydrate starch or tnc contents g kg 1 dry mass of the species leaves stems and roots respectively and b spe b l b s and b r are the biomass kg m 2 of the species leaves stems and roots respectively for the community 2 e com i 1 n r e l a t i v e b i o m a s s i e i where n is the number of species in a quadrat and e com and ei are the element or carbohydrate content of the plant community and species i respectively the relative biomass of species i is expressed by the biomass of this species as a fraction of the total biomass in a quadrat because submerged macrophytes absorb nutrients mainly from sediment best and mantai 1978 carignan and kalff 1980 sediment element contents n and p were used as the external nutrient supply to calculate the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h of plants it can be determined according to the following equation sterner and elser 2002 log y log c 1 h log x where y is the element content n or p of plant tissues x is the element content n and p of external nutrient resources and c is a constant community h was computed by the weighted mean of h across all submerged species in one quadrat according to eq 3 yu et al 2010 3 h c o m i 1 n r e l a t i v e b i o m a s s i h i where n is the species number in one quadrat and hi is the homeostatic coefficient h of species i 2 6 data analysis first 24

on the field survey in 2018 table s2 for plant traits and their abbreviations in the field based network the hub traits were confirmed and then the relationships between these hub traits and environmental factors were explored to determine the significant environmental factors using cca conducted in the r package vegan according to these key environmental variables in the field a manipulation experiment was conducted to explore the consistency of the hub traits from field and experiment based plant trait networks second to examine the mechanism connecting these hub traits with species and community properties we calculated organ species and community indices h starch and tnc species biomass and dominance and community biomass species biomass was expressed by each species biomass in a quadrat and species dominance was calculated as each species biomass as a proportion of the total biomass in a quadrat community biomass was the total biomass of all living submerged plants within a quadrat averaged by each lake total least square linear regression was used to explore the bivariate relationships between tissue h and storage compounds and species biomass and dominance as well as the bivariate relationships between community h and storage carbohydrates and community biomass then three species with higher h were defined as high h species and the other three species were defined as low h species the high h species dominated communities were quantified by the relative biomass of high h species exceeding 50 in a quadrat we used independent samples t tests to compare the differences in the mean values of the main environmental variables in high and low h species dominated communities to test whether water clarity affected carbohydrate production a linear regression between the sd and tissue and community tnc was conducted moreover we built a conceptual and a subsequent structural equation model based on the following hypothesized relationships tp enrichment promotes the overgrowth of algal which decreases sd light intensity is positively associated with tissue carbohydrate content of submerged macrophytes chen et al 2020 accumulated carbohydrates help plants to alleviate ammonium and low light stress thus benefiting their growth and expansion moreover stoichiometric homeostasis has been confirmed to be related to community biomass more submerged macrophytes can inhibit algal growth by competing for light and nutrients scheffer et al 1993 next we hypothesized that ⅰ tp is positively related to chl a and negatively related to water clarity ⅱ water clarity is negatively associated with chl a ⅲ community tnc is positively related to water clarity and negatively related to chl a and ⅳ community biomass is positively associated with community h and tnc and negatively associated with chl a after formulating the conceptual model structural equation modeling sem was constructed to explore the pathways by which nutrient enrichment affected water clarity and to test whether community biomass was controlled by stochiometric and physiological mechanisms together significant pathways were included in the sem and χ2 test and p values were used to evaluate the fit of the model sem could be performed to test the causal relationship network of multiple variables and the standardized path coefficients between any pair of variables represented the relative correlation strength we performed the sem analysis using the r package lavaan all field investigation data in 2018 were used to perform these analyses finally to explore the implications of changed basal resource stoichiometry and physiological status on nutrient cycling in lakes linear regression was used to elucidate the effect of nutrient enrichment and changed light regime on community nutrient contents c n and p and nutrient ratios n c n p and p c the data set included 176 quadrats in the field investigation of 2018 all data analyses were performed in r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 hub traits within field and experiment based networks in the field based network fig 1b the traits exhibiting the highest connectedness degree cd were stem tnc stnc and starch sstarch followed by leaf tnc ltnc and starch lstarch stem p sp root c rc root tnc rtnc root p rp root starch rstarch and leaf p lp these traits also displayed a high betweenness cb by linking other groups of plant traits belonging to the physiological indices and stoichiometry the variation in these hub traits was explained by the six most significant environmental factors all p 0 05 that were selected through the forward selection method within cca fig 1c d these factors could explain 20 5 of the variation in the hub traits 95 of which was explained by the cca first two axes df 6 f 9 52 p 0 001 cca axis 1 mainly represented the tp sd and sdp gradient and these three factors accounted for 65 9 of the variation in the hub traits from the field based network fig 1c therefore we designed an experiment to simulate the gradients of these three environmental variables that plants experienced in the field fig 1e and the same plant traits were selected to establish an experiment based network it showed fewer connections than the field based network fig 1f the ten most central traits were sstarch stnc rstarch rtnc ltnc lstarch root dw rdw leaf dw ldw stem c sc and leaf n ln these central traits were also connected to biochemical indices and stoichiometry six common hub traits i e sstarch stnc lstarch ltnc rstarch and rtnc were shared by these two networks which indicated the robustness of results about the hub traits within the field based network 3 2 tissue homeostasis coefficient h of submerged macrophytes the stochiometric homeostasis coefficient h represents the regulatory ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal elemental composition it could be described by plotting the bivariate model of the tissue n and p contents with sediment elemental contents our results showed that the homeostasis coefficients of p h p for the six submerged plant species varied and the species with the strongest regulatory ability of p was p maackianus followed by c demersum m spicatum p wrightii v natans and h verticillata fig 2 species h p ranged from 0 93 to 3 30 with an average of 1 85 organ h p was highest in leaves followed by stems and roots however significant homeostasis of n h n was less detected table s3 3 3 linking stoichiometric homeostasis and physiological constraints with species biomass and dominance and community biomass at the organ level organ leaf stem or root h p starch and tnc usually showed significant positive relationships with species biomass and dominance fig 3 a f at the species level similar relationships were observed for h p starch and tnc at the community level community h p starch and tnc of submerged macrophytes were significantly and positively related to community biomass fig 3g i 3 4 mechanisms and consequences of eutrophication affecting community structure and functioning the physiological mechanisms of community succession of submerged macrophytes under the process of eutrophication are poorly understood our results indicated that sd was positively correlated with tissue and community tnc fig s2 according to the order of h p values the high h p species were p maackianus c demersum and m spicatum whereas the low h p species were p wrightii v natans and h verticillate significant differences in water tp and chl a as well as community starch and tnc were observed for the high and low h p species dominated communities figs 4 and s3 the full model that included all possible pathways demonstrated a higher aic value compared to the model including only significant pathways aic 21 50 versus 23 99 fig s4 therefore the sem model that displayed significant pathways with a lower aic value burnham and anderson 2002 was retained and its results elucidated that nutrient enrichment influenced sd and the stochiometric and physiological mechanisms underpinned the community structure of submerged plants our model fit the data well χ2 11 25 df 9 p 0 259 and explained 40 29 31 and 30 of the variation in chl a water clarity community tnc and community biomass respectively fig 5 water tp and chl a indirectly and directly negatively affected water clarity which in turn exerted a negative effect on community tnc the community h p and tnc both had positive effects on the community biomass of submerged macrophytes understanding the effects of eutrophication on community nutrient contents and ratios of submerged plants is important for forecasting the dynamics of nutrient cycling in lake ecosystems our results suggested that community nutrient c n and p contents were positively correlated with water tn tp and sd fig 6 a c community nutrient c ratios n c and p c were positively associated with tn and tp but negatively related to sd fig 6f i a significant relationship was not observed between community n p and tn while a significant and negative relationship between community n p and tp was observed fig 6d e 4 discussion nutrient enrichment and reduced underwater light availability induced by eutrophication influence plant functional traits such as stoichiometric characteristics and physiological indices network analysis provides a useful tool to study correlations between traits and to identify hub traits in the network at the whole plant level first our results revealed that organ p and carbohydrate contents were the hub traits and that change of these hub traits likely affected many other traits next we found that stoichiometric homeostasis of p and carbohydrate were positively associated with species dominance and biomass at the species level and community biomass at the community level finally we clarified the consequences of changes in plant stoichiometry and community biomass on aquatic ecosystem processes specifically c sink in plant biomass decreased and nutrient cycling rates increased with the progress of eutrophication 4 1 implications and consistency of the hub traits within field and experiment based networks the field and experiment based networks both reflected the emphasis placed on organ leaf stem and root starch and tnc fig 1b f these two networks shared six hub traits out of the ten most central traits indicating the consistency and robustness of our results these hub traits were of central importance in the networks and held the largest number of connections therefore difference in the light intensity between field and experiment conditions mean values of chl a 32 28 versus 4 10 μg l 1 may cause distinct scaling relationships of nsc among plant organs in the field based network the relationships among leaf stem and root starch and tnc indicated isometry except the relationship of leaf starch versus root starch table s4 in the experiment based network leaf or stem starch and tnc scaled 1 power with the corresponding root starch and tnc indicating that an increase in leaf or stem carbohydrate contents was accompanied by a larger increase in root carbohydrate contents probably as a result of carbohydrate storage in root tissue the plants experienced less severe light limitation in our manipulation experiment than in our field investigation and thus the experimental plants likely produced more carbohydrates that could be stored in root organ starch and tnc were the hub traits in the field and experiment based networks fig 1b f carbohydrate concentration in shoots and roots was positively associated with submergence induced leaf elongation because the increasing storage compounds were necessary to ensure plastic responses of plants to the environment huber et al 2012 moreover organ carbohydrate was positively related to species dominance and biomass fig 3 because the accumulated carbohydrates provided basic energy for plants to sustain cell growth and biomass accumulation in eutrophic lakes submerged macrophytes often encounter high nutrient and low light stress that suppress carbohydrate production making organ starch and tnc suitable indicators of the physiological responses to eutrophication organ starch and tnc also had connections to multiple other traits showing that changes in organ nsc concentration affect many other functions related to nutrient gain c sequestration and growth nutrient accumulation and underwater darkening are two common problems under the process of eutrophication zhang et al 2020 thus the dynamics of organ storage compounds are important and meaningful for understanding the interactions among plant traits the field based network mainly the negative relationships between organ p and carbohydrate had more connections than the experiment based network fig 1b f in the field survey tp enrichment led to overgrowth of phytoplankton which decreased water clarity fig 5 submerged macrophytes could excessively absorb p under p rich conditions whereas low water clarity suppressed the synthesis of carbohydrate therefore organ p was negatively related to organ starch and tnc moreover all correlations among traits will change when new species are included in the network laughlin 2014 two more high h p species are incorporated in our field data set and species with homeostatic stoichiometry tend to have higher energetic costs to maintain stable elemental contents yu et al 2011 which may enhance the connections between organ p and carbohydrates fig 1b in the manipulation experiment plants with flexible homeostasis present luxury uptake of nutrients which are accumulated in excess of their demand carignan and kalff 1980 moreover denser submerged macrophytes in the aquarium inhibited the growth of phytoplankton which was confirmed by the lower chl a concentration in the manipulation experiment than in the field survey chl a 4 10 versus 32 28 μg l 1 the experimental plants experienced less severe light limitation and thus produced more carbohydrates therefore p accumulation in organs coupled with c decline were not observed in the manipulation experiment fig 1f 4 2 mechanisms linking hub traits with community structure in the process of eutrophication the hub traits i e organ p starch and tnc were quantified in the field based network and then we determined how these hub traits affected species and community dynamics such as species biomass and dominance and community biomass first our results suggested that organs and species had a good ability to regulate internal p but not for n fig 2 table s3 which was consistent with a previous study on submerged macrophytes su et al 2019b long term low p availability in preindustrial times elser et al 2007 schindler 1977 exerted selective pressure on plants which adapted to limited p environments higher stoichiometric homeostasis of p h p was observed in leaves followed by stems and roots which was consistent with previous results in terrestrial plants zhang et al 2018 this result indicated that leaves maintained a stable nutrient level due to their important roles in supplying basic energy resources though photosynthesis to support plant growth these findings verify the hypothesis that more active organs have a higher regulatory ability to maintain a stable internal nutrient content zhang et al 2018 second in the present study organ leaf stem and root and species h p starch and tnc were positively associated with species biomass and dominance fig 3 closer relationships between leaf h p starch and tnc and species biomass and dominance were observed moreover community h p starch and tnc were positively correlated with community biomass although stoichiometric mechanisms underpinning community structure and functioning have been demonstrated in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 our results emphasized that stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms both controlled community structure in shallow lakes fig 5 it is well known that nutrient enrichment and low light availability are two common phenomena of eutrophication which is confirmed by our sem paths chl a increased with increasing water tp and in turn affected water clarity fig 5 because the ability to maintain stable elemental content is species specific water tp enrichment should enhance the competitive advantage of low h p species in eutrophic lakes similarly low water clarity should reduce the synthesis of carbohydrates and thus inhibit plant growth submerged macrophytes can significantly improve local ecological environment through multiple positive interactions and these interactions form positive feedbacks more vegetation inhibits algal growth due to a reduction of nutrient availability and thus leads to higher water clarity which in turn benefits themselves scheffer et al 1993 su et al 2019a our results indicated that communities dominated by high h p species tended to occur in water with lower tp and chl a conditions fig 4 indicating their higher capacity to maintain constant external environments the community dominated by high h p species contained more starch and tnc whereas the community dominated by low h p species contained less starch and tnc fig s3 carbohydrates serve as a source of energy to support energy demanding processes under environments where energy supply is insufficient due to reduced light availability carbohydrates can also serve to build new cell wall material which is necessary to sustain cell growth therefore more carbohydrates are beneficial for plant growth and biomass accumulation plants with strong homeostasis have conservative nutrient use strategies yu et al 2011 thus they can absorb and utilize limiting resources and become predominant in relatively oligotrophic surroundings plants with weak homeostasis tend to grow faster and have adaptive strategies for luxury uptake and storage of excess elements in general in oligotrophic shallow lakes dominant high h p species stabilize the local environment that is suitable for carbohydrate accumulation which benefits their growth however in eutrophic lakes the community is dominated by low h p species and contains low storage compounds which inhibits the primary production of submerged macrophytes it is suggested that positive feedbacks induced by eutrophication would destabilize the ecosystem and h p and nsc can be used to predict community succession of submerged plants under different levels of anthropogenic disturbances 4 3 consequences of changes in plant stoichiometry and community biomass on aquatic ecosystem processes eutrophication has always been considered the driving factor for the decline of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes which was confirmed by our results that nutrient loading promoted the growth of phytoplankton and thus decreased water clarity which influenced the carbohydrate content in plants fig 5 communities composed of plants with low storage materials and low h p had low primary productivity under conditions with higher nutrients which reduced c fixation in plant biomass community c contents tended to decrease with water turbidity fig 6c which further diminished c sequestration in plants our results showed that the negative effects of physiological and stoichiometric constraints on the community c sink were ubiquitous in eutrophic lakes fig 7 plant tissues are decomposed and enter a detritus based food web except when consumed by herbivores litter nutritional quality i e nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios plays a considerable role in determining the process of decomposition where decomposition rates are positively related to litter nutritional quality in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems cebrian 1999 cebrian and lartigue 2004 demi et al 2018 li et al 2012 and even at the global scale cornwell et al 2008 our results showed that plant nutritional quality increased with eutrophication fig 6 thus we can conclude that plant tissues with more nutrients in eutrophic conditions may experience faster decomposition rates which reduces the turnover time of litter in addition elevated nutrient availability often causes greater rates of microbial activity on plant litter thereby accelerating decomposition rates and allowing more nutrient flux into producers and higher trophic levels degasparro et al 2020 gulis et al 2004 gulis and suberkropp 2003 in summary eutrophication may accelerate litter decomposition rates and nutrient cycling rates by changing plant elemental contents and microbial activity which in turn further intensifies eutrophication in lakes fig 7 5 conclusions in our study we clearly illustrate the hub traits that control the whole plant phenotype of submerged macrophytes the mechanisms that link hub traits with ecosystem structure and functioning and the effects of changes in community biomass basal resource stoichiometry and plant physiological status on nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems during the process of eutrophication our results showed that organ p and nsc contents played a vital role in regulating plant performance and the stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms that linked these traits with species dominance and community biomass that is ecosystems dominated by high h p species containing high nsc contents tend to have more primary productivity while those dominated by low h p species containing low nsc contents are more vulnerable to environmental disturbances furthermore eutrophication exerts a profound impact on plant community nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios which likely affects many

16759,eutrophication strongly influences plant stoichiometric characteristics and physiological status by altering nutrient and light availability in the water column however the mechanisms linking plant functional traits with ecosystem structure and functioning to clarify the decline of submerged macrophytes have not been fully elucidated to date therefore based on a field investigation of 26 macrophytic shallow lakes on the yangtze plain we first constructed a plant trait network at the whole plant level to determine the hub traits of submerged macrophytes that play central regulatory roles in plant phenotype our results suggested that organ leaf stem and root phosphorus p starch and total nonstructural carbohydrate tnc contents were hub traits organ starch and tnc were consistent with those in the experiment based network obtained from a three month manipulation experiment next the mechanisms underlying the relationships between the hub traits and vital aspects of ecological performance were carefully investigated using field investigation data specifically stoichiometric homeostasis of p h p starch and tnc were positively associated with dominance and biomass at the species level and community biomass at the community level additionally structural equation modeling clarified not only a hypothesized pathway from eutrophication to water clarity and community tnc but also combined effects of community tnc and h p on community biomass that is ecosystems dominated by more homeostatic communities tended to have more carbon c rich compounds in relatively oligotrophic conditions which promoted the primary production of macrophytes eutrophication was determined to affect community structure by inhibiting the predominance of more homeostatic species and the production of carbohydrates finally reduced community biomass and increased nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios in plants induced by eutrophication implied a decrease in the c sink in biomass and may potentially lead to an enhancement of litter decomposition rates and nutrient cycling rates by adjusting plant responses to eutrophication stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms linking plant traits with ecosystem structure have important implications for understanding ecosystem processes and these results may contribute to practical management to achieve the restoration of submerged macrophytes and ecosystem services graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords network analysis nonstructural carbohydrate stoichiometric homeostasis ecosystem services eutrophication submerged macrophyte 1 introduction nutrient enrichment and reduced light availability resulting from human induced eutrophication have led to extreme alterations in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems sardans et al 2012 scheffer et al 2001 sterner et al 1997 zhang et al 2020 these stresses have caused regime shifts in many shallow lakes thus making it crucial to understand the mechanisms that are relevant to ecosystem structure and functioning beisner et al 2003 scheffer et al 2001 spears et al 2017 su et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that species functional traits and their interactions and trade offs are responsible for ecosystem processes and functioning under human disturbances diaz and cabido 2001 diaz et al 2004 lavorel and garnier 2002 su et al 2019b because these traits link individual functioning to ecological dominance and primary environmental variables such as nutrient and light availability submerged macrophytes are the key primary producers in shallow lakes and play a vital role in maintaining a clear water state scheffer et al 2001 and they reduce sediment resuspension madsen et al 2001 provide shelter for large body zooplankton and compete for nutrients with phytoplankton jeppesen et al 1998 furthermore the functional traits of these macrophytes in response to different environmental perturbations have been widely explored in manipulation experiments for example low nonstructural carbohydrate nsc mainly starch and soluble sugars in plants are produced under low light and high nutrient conditions chen et al 2020 huber et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 and element contents are influenced by nutrient levels in the surroundings li et al 2018 su et al 2019b however a number of factors have not been well studied first many studies are restricted to a single organ such as leaves or stems thus preventing a whole plant level perspective on trait coordination and functional ecology kleyer and minden 2015 kleyer et al 2019 coordination among traits represents trade offs and allometries in response to the environment stearns 1989 and affects ecosystem properties diaz and cabido 2001 lavorel and garnier 2002 plant trait networks can be used to explain complex correlations among traits from different organs and to calculate the overall topology and hub traits in networks he et al 2020 kleyer et al 2019 second scaling up from organ traits to species dominance and community biomass and the mechanisms underlying the changes have rarely been studied to our knowledge no studies have examined the hub traits i e the traits are correlated with a large number of other traits in the network that play a principal regulatory role in coordinating the whole phenotype and the stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms that link plant hub traits with key facets of ecological performance such as species dominance and ecosystem function at the whole plant level in freshwater ecosystems nutrient enrichment affects plant internal element contents whereas plants have the regulatory ability to maintain a stable internal elemental content in the face of variable nutrient availability under external conditions that is stoichiometric homeostasis cooper 2008 sterner and elser 2002 plant responses to different nutrient supplies depend on their species specific capacity for nutrient storage physiological adjustment and relative growth rate sistla et al 2015 furthermore different plant organs play distinct roles in composing an organic whole and more active organs have stronger ecological homeostasis i e homeostasis leaves branches roots zhang et al 2018 in the aboveground parts of plants stoichiometric homeostasis has been confirmed to be related to ecosystem production and stability su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 however previous research has not investigated the scaling up of homeostasis theory for single organs i e leaves stems and roots to whole communities ecosystems thus we hypothesize that stoichiometric homeostasis for different biological organizations from organs to species and to communities may be related to the structure and function of freshwater ecosystems in the process of eutrophication reduced light availability induced by eutrophication would result in decreasing photosynthesis and nsc contents in plants consequently leading to shortage of basic energy supply for plant growth and survival chen et al 2020 huber et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 however accumulated carbohydrates are beneficial for plants to alleviate low light and high ammonium stress in aquatic ecosystem cao et al 2009 huber et al 2012 rao et al 2018 while many studies have examined nsc roles in osmoregulation and phloem transport in terrestrial ecosystems hoch and korner 2012 martinez vilalta et al 2016 we know little about whether the nsc contents in organisms are related to species dominance ecosystem structure and function in lake ecosystems moreover underwater darkening is a worldwide phenomenon in lakes zhang et al 2020 and there is an urgent need to clarify the links between plant nsc pools and ecosystem functions in response to eutrophication the combined effects of nutrient and light availability on the biomass and stoichiometric properties of submerged macrophytes are critical for understanding the biogeochemical cycle in eutrophic lakes because primary production of plants is inhibited by eutrophication carbon c sink in biomass is expected to decrease c sequestration in plants may be further affected by lower photosynthetic c assimilation under light limitation conditions moreover submerged macrophytes tend to absorb and store excess elements in their tissues under nutrient rich conditions carignan and kalff 1980 thus we hypothesize that plant nutritional quality i e nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios in plant tissues increases with the progress of eutrophication communities composed of plants with high nutritional quality experience faster decomposition rates and nutrient recycling rates cebrian 1999 cebrian and lartigue 2004 cornwell et al 2008 demi et al 2018 li et al 2012 as submerged macrophytes are important for maintaining a clear water state in shallow lakes we could deduce that eutrophication may change nutrient cycling by decreasing the c sink in plant biomass and shifting the basal resource stoichiometry in this paper based on field observations of 26 shallow lakes on the yangtze floodplain fig 1 a we first explored the hub traits of submerged macrophytes at the whole plant level using correlation network analysis then the hub traits from the observed network were further confirmed by an experiment based network constructed from a three month manipulation experiment next we investigated the strength of the stoichiometric homeostasis and physiological constraints of submerged macrophytes based on hub traits and verified whether stoichiometric homeostasis and storage compounds were associated with species dominance ecosystem structure and functioning we finally elucidated the combined effects of light and nutrient availability on primary productivity and nutrient c ratios and then discussed their implications for nutrient cycling in lakes we hypothesized that stoichiometric mechanism and physiological constraints controlled the pattern of productivity of submerged macrophytes which could greatly improve our understanding of nutrient cycling in lakes in the face of eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling and investigation as one of the three largest plains in china the yangtze plain contains multitudinous shallow lakes with varied nutrient levels field sampling was conducted in 26 macrophytic lakes located in the yangtze floodplain during the growing season in 2018 fig 1a the sampling method for macrophytes was the modified belt transect method and the number of sampling sites was confirmed based on the area of the macrophytic region the lake area and mean water depth varied from 2 1 to 2537 2 km2 and 1 03 to 3 25 m respectively rao et al 2020 for details in this study six species of common submerged macrophytes widely distributed in these lakes were carefully investigated potamogeton maackianus myriophyllum spicatum ceratophyllum demersum potamogeton wrightii vallisneria natans and hydrilla verticillate the biomass of these plants constituted most of the total submerged macrophytes and they were collected using a rotatable reaping hook covering 0 2 m2 three times at each sampling site the plants were carefully cleaned sorted by species and then weighed to measure the fresh weight fw the whole plants of the six species were sampled and divided into leaf stem and root parts corresponding water samples and sediment samples were collected from 0 5 m below the water surface and the top layers of sediment respectively these samples were placed in portable fridges and taken back to the laboratory for subsequent analysis to obtain the dry weight of organs leaf stem and root in the field survey of 2018 the mean organs mass fraction and moisture content of the six species were carefully investigated in 4 macrophytic lakes with different nutrient levels in 2020 table s1 and fig s1 for details with 170 plant samples in total 2 2 measurement and data collection the leaf stem root and sediment samples were first oven dried at 80 c and then ground to a fine powder for the element and physiological index only plant tissues measurements the c and n contents of these samples were determined with an element analyzer flash ea 1112 series ce instruments italy before measuring p the plant and sediment samples were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and h2so4 hclo4 respectively all samples were measured for p with the ammonium molybdate ascorbic acid method sparks et al 1996 approximately 100 mg of plant powder was extracted twice with 5 ml 80 ethanol at 80 c for 20 min ten milliliters of the extracts were centrifuged at 104 g for 15 min the free amino acid faa and soluble carbohydrate sc contents in the supernatant and starch contents in the residue were measured using the methods of these articles dirk et al 1999 yemm and cocking 1955 yemm and willis 1954 the sediment pore water was obtained by centrifuging the wet sediment at 2760 g for 20 min the total n tn and total p tp concentrations in the water column and pore water were analyzed as nitrate and orthophosphate after digestion with k2s2o8 according to standard methods huang et al 1999 secchi depth sd was measured with a secchi disk photosynthetically active radiation par was recorded by a li cor data logger li 400 li cor usa the light extinction coefficient k in the water column was computed based on the equation k 1 z ln i 0 i z where i 0 and i z are par at the water surface and water depth z respectively dissolved oxygen do ph and turbidity were measured with a ysi exo2 yellow spring inc usa chlorophyll a chl a was extracted using the ethanol method and then quantified by a spectrophotometer jespersen and christoffersen 1987 2 3 plant trait network analysis a network consists of many nodes and edges in plant trait networks plant functional traits are nodes and trait trait relationships are edges first a matrix of trait trait relationships r was calculated using pearson s correlations kleyer et al 2019 trait trait relationships may reflect the direct mechanistic correlation coselection through optimal design or concerted convergence he et al 2020 a significance threshold of r 0 2 and p 0 05 were applied to avoid spurious correlations among traits then an adjacency matrix a ai j with ai j ϵ 0 1 was yielded by assigning below threshold as 0 additionally a was weighted by the absolute correlation strength between any pair of plant traits rij adjacency in wgcna langfelder and horvath 2008 finally plant trait networks were visualized in cytoscape 3 8 0 using the prefuse force directed opencl layout www prefuse org the correlation strength of edges has been described above and there are two parameters to elucidate the properties of nodes degree cd and betweenness cb which can be used to quantify the connectedness and centrality of each node trait within the network respectively more information on the calculation of cd and cb was described in detail in supplementary material plant traits that have a high cd can be regarded as hub traits that have a regulatory effect on the whole plant phenotype whereas traits with high betweenness cb are mediators that coordinate several modules or subnetworks finally a plant trait network based on field investigation was constructed to determine the hub traits of submerged macrophytes at the whole plant level fig 1b here the ten most connected traits with a higher degree cd were considered as the hub traits 2 4 manipulation experiment after the hub traits in the field based network were confirmed the relationships between these hub traits and eleven environmental variables i e sediment tn and tp sdn and sdp water tn and tp pore water tn and tp pwtn and pwtp chl a sd ph turbidity and do were explored using a canonical correspondence analysis cca significant environmental variables p 0 05 were detected by forward selection within the cca and then the independent contribution of these variables to explained variation was calculated using the r package rdacca hp lai et al 2021 a monte carlo permutation test permutations 999 was performed to test the significance of the full model and each axis our results indicated that these significant variables accounted for 20 5 of the variation in hub traits from the field based network 65 9 of which was explained by tp sd and sdp fig 1c d therefore the manipulation experiment was controlled by different water tp and sdp and low light availability to simulate field surroundings and our main aim was to verify the consistency of hub traits from field and experiment based networks the three month experiment was conducted at the lake donghu experimental station and lasted from 7 june to 30 august 2019 v natans p wrightii h verticillata and m spicatum were cultured in 60 outdoor aquaria 50 50 80 cm which were placed in a shelter covered by a black shade net with 20 ambient light reaching the aquaria fig 1e this process produces values nearest to the mean light transmittance values par in z sd par in water surface at water depth zsd i e z sd is the value of mean sd in all field sampling sites which are calculated by k z sd and par in the water surface at each site the experiment had two treatments water tp enrichment at five levels and sediment type at four levels with three replicates for each treatment five tp addition levels included the control 0 1 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mg l 1 added as kh2po4 two sediments were collected from the mesotrophic tanglin lake and the hypertrophic shuiguo lake within the areas of donghu lake the average sdp contents in the four sediments mesotrophic sediment a mixture of 70 mesotrophic sediment and 30 hypertrophic sediment volume ratio a mixture of 30 mesotrophic sediment and 70 hypertrophic sediment hypertrophic sediment were 0 81 0 98 1 18 and 1 25 g kg 1 for each species three healthy seedlings were planted in a plastic box 15 22 5 7 cm and 4 boxes containing different types of sediment were placed in an aquarium filled with 60 cm water meanwhile each aquarium received additional n added as nh4no3 to maintain 1 mg l 1 tn in water during the experiment the water tn and tp were measured every week to maintain appropriate concentrations at the end of the experiment plants were washed divided into three organs leaf stem and root and then dried to obtain the organ dry weight dw finally an experiment based network was established to determine whether and to what extent hub traits were consistent with those within the field based network fig 1f 2 5 calculation of element and carbohydrate contents and homeostatic coefficients the nutrient c n and p and carbohydrate starch and tnc contents of individuals and communities were computed using the biomass weighted mean method in the field investigation of 2018 the organ dw was obtained by multiplying the organ mean mass fraction and moisture content by the fw of the whole plant in this study nutrient c and n p ratios were used as the mass ratios element and carbohydrate contents for the species and community were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively for the species 1 e spe e l b l e s b s e r b r b spe where e spe e l e s and e r are the element c n or p and carbohydrate starch or tnc contents g kg 1 dry mass of the species leaves stems and roots respectively and b spe b l b s and b r are the biomass kg m 2 of the species leaves stems and roots respectively for the community 2 e com i 1 n r e l a t i v e b i o m a s s i e i where n is the number of species in a quadrat and e com and ei are the element or carbohydrate content of the plant community and species i respectively the relative biomass of species i is expressed by the biomass of this species as a fraction of the total biomass in a quadrat because submerged macrophytes absorb nutrients mainly from sediment best and mantai 1978 carignan and kalff 1980 sediment element contents n and p were used as the external nutrient supply to calculate the stoichiometric homeostasis coefficient h of plants it can be determined according to the following equation sterner and elser 2002 log y log c 1 h log x where y is the element content n or p of plant tissues x is the element content n and p of external nutrient resources and c is a constant community h was computed by the weighted mean of h across all submerged species in one quadrat according to eq 3 yu et al 2010 3 h c o m i 1 n r e l a t i v e b i o m a s s i h i where n is the species number in one quadrat and hi is the homeostatic coefficient h of species i 2 6 data analysis first 24 plant traits i e organ leaf stem or root c n p dw faa sc starch and total nonstructural carbohydrates tnc the sum of sc and starch were normalized box cox transformation to construct a network based on the field survey in 2018 table s2 for plant traits and their abbreviations in the field based network the hub traits were confirmed and then the relationships between these hub traits and environmental factors were explored to determine the significant environmental factors using cca conducted in the r package vegan according to these key environmental variables in the field a manipulation experiment was conducted to explore the consistency of the hub traits from field and experiment based plant trait networks second to examine the mechanism connecting these hub traits with species and community properties we calculated organ species and community indices h starch and tnc species biomass and dominance and community biomass species biomass was expressed by each species biomass in a quadrat and species dominance was calculated as each species biomass as a proportion of the total biomass in a quadrat community biomass was the total biomass of all living submerged plants within a quadrat averaged by each lake total least square linear regression was used to explore the bivariate relationships between tissue h and storage compounds and species biomass and dominance as well as the bivariate relationships between community h and storage carbohydrates and community biomass then three species with higher h were defined as high h species and the other three species were defined as low h species the high h species dominated communities were quantified by the relative biomass of high h species exceeding 50 in a quadrat we used independent samples t tests to compare the differences in the mean values of the main environmental variables in high and low h species dominated communities to test whether water clarity affected carbohydrate production a linear regression between the sd and tissue and community tnc was conducted moreover we built a conceptual and a subsequent structural equation model based on the following hypothesized relationships tp enrichment promotes the overgrowth of algal which decreases sd light intensity is positively associated with tissue carbohydrate content of submerged macrophytes chen et al 2020 accumulated carbohydrates help plants to alleviate ammonium and low light stress thus benefiting their growth and expansion moreover stoichiometric homeostasis has been confirmed to be related to community biomass more submerged macrophytes can inhibit algal growth by competing for light and nutrients scheffer et al 1993 next we hypothesized that ⅰ tp is positively related to chl a and negatively related to water clarity ⅱ water clarity is negatively associated with chl a ⅲ community tnc is positively related to water clarity and negatively related to chl a and ⅳ community biomass is positively associated with community h and tnc and negatively associated with chl a after formulating the conceptual model structural equation modeling sem was constructed to explore the pathways by which nutrient enrichment affected water clarity and to test whether community biomass was controlled by stochiometric and physiological mechanisms together significant pathways were included in the sem and χ2 test and p values were used to evaluate the fit of the model sem could be performed to test the causal relationship network of multiple variables and the standardized path coefficients between any pair of variables represented the relative correlation strength we performed the sem analysis using the r package lavaan all field investigation data in 2018 were used to perform these analyses finally to explore the implications of changed basal resource stoichiometry and physiological status on nutrient cycling in lakes linear regression was used to elucidate the effect of nutrient enrichment and changed light regime on community nutrient contents c n and p and nutrient ratios n c n p and p c the data set included 176 quadrats in the field investigation of 2018 all data analyses were performed in r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 hub traits within field and experiment based networks in the field based network fig 1b the traits exhibiting the highest connectedness degree cd were stem tnc stnc and starch sstarch followed by leaf tnc ltnc and starch lstarch stem p sp root c rc root tnc rtnc root p rp root starch rstarch and leaf p lp these traits also displayed a high betweenness cb by linking other groups of plant traits belonging to the physiological indices and stoichiometry the variation in these hub traits was explained by the six most significant environmental factors all p 0 05 that were selected through the forward selection method within cca fig 1c d these factors could explain 20 5 of the variation in the hub traits 95 of which was explained by the cca first two axes df 6 f 9 52 p 0 001 cca axis 1 mainly represented the tp sd and sdp gradient and these three factors accounted for 65 9 of the variation in the hub traits from the field based network fig 1c therefore we designed an experiment to simulate the gradients of these three environmental variables that plants experienced in the field fig 1e and the same plant traits were selected to establish an experiment based network it showed fewer connections than the field based network fig 1f the ten most central traits were sstarch stnc rstarch rtnc ltnc lstarch root dw rdw leaf dw ldw stem c sc and leaf n ln these central traits were also connected to biochemical indices and stoichiometry six common hub traits i e sstarch stnc lstarch ltnc rstarch and rtnc were shared by these two networks which indicated the robustness of results about the hub traits within the field based network 3 2 tissue homeostasis coefficient h of submerged macrophytes the stochiometric homeostasis coefficient h represents the regulatory ability of an organism to maintain a relatively stable internal elemental composition it could be described by plotting the bivariate model of the tissue n and p contents with sediment elemental contents our results showed that the homeostasis coefficients of p h p for the six submerged plant species varied and the species with the strongest regulatory ability of p was p maackianus followed by c demersum m spicatum p wrightii v natans and h verticillata fig 2 species h p ranged from 0 93 to 3 30 with an average of 1 85 organ h p was highest in leaves followed by stems and roots however significant homeostasis of n h n was less detected table s3 3 3 linking stoichiometric homeostasis and physiological constraints with species biomass and dominance and community biomass at the organ level organ leaf stem or root h p starch and tnc usually showed significant positive relationships with species biomass and dominance fig 3 a f at the species level similar relationships were observed for h p starch and tnc at the community level community h p starch and tnc of submerged macrophytes were significantly and positively related to community biomass fig 3g i 3 4 mechanisms and consequences of eutrophication affecting community structure and functioning the physiological mechanisms of community succession of submerged macrophytes under the process of eutrophication are poorly understood our results indicated that sd was positively correlated with tissue and community tnc fig s2 according to the order of h p values the high h p species were p maackianus c demersum and m spicatum whereas the low h p species were p wrightii v natans and h verticillate significant differences in water tp and chl a as well as community starch and tnc were observed for the high and low h p species dominated communities figs 4 and s3 the full model that included all possible pathways demonstrated a higher aic value compared to the model including only significant pathways aic 21 50 versus 23 99 fig s4 therefore the sem model that displayed significant pathways with a lower aic value burnham and anderson 2002 was retained and its results elucidated that nutrient enrichment influenced sd and the stochiometric and physiological mechanisms underpinned the community structure of submerged plants our model fit the data well χ2 11 25 df 9 p 0 259 and explained 40 29 31 and 30 of the variation in chl a water clarity community tnc and community biomass respectively fig 5 water tp and chl a indirectly and directly negatively affected water clarity which in turn exerted a negative effect on community tnc the community h p and tnc both had positive effects on the community biomass of submerged macrophytes understanding the effects of eutrophication on community nutrient contents and ratios of submerged plants is important for forecasting the dynamics of nutrient cycling in lake ecosystems our results suggested that community nutrient c n and p contents were positively correlated with water tn tp and sd fig 6 a c community nutrient c ratios n c and p c were positively associated with tn and tp but negatively related to sd fig 6f i a significant relationship was not observed between community n p and tn while a significant and negative relationship between community n p and tp was observed fig 6d e 4 discussion nutrient enrichment and reduced underwater light availability induced by eutrophication influence plant functional traits such as stoichiometric characteristics and physiological indices network analysis provides a useful tool to study correlations between traits and to identify hub traits in the network at the whole plant level first our results revealed that organ p and carbohydrate contents were the hub traits and that change of these hub traits likely affected many other traits next we found that stoichiometric homeostasis of p and carbohydrate were positively associated with species dominance and biomass at the species level and community biomass at the community level finally we clarified the consequences of changes in plant stoichiometry and community biomass on aquatic ecosystem processes specifically c sink in plant biomass decreased and nutrient cycling rates increased with the progress of eutrophication 4 1 implications and consistency of the hub traits within field and experiment based networks the field and experiment based networks both reflected the emphasis placed on organ leaf stem and root starch and tnc fig 1b f these two networks shared six hub traits out of the ten most central traits indicating the consistency and robustness of our results these hub traits were of central importance in the networks and held the largest number of connections therefore difference in the light intensity between field and experiment conditions mean values of chl a 32 28 versus 4 10 μg l 1 may cause distinct scaling relationships of nsc among plant organs in the field based network the relationships among leaf stem and root starch and tnc indicated isometry except the relationship of leaf starch versus root starch table s4 in the experiment based network leaf or stem starch and tnc scaled 1 power with the corresponding root starch and tnc indicating that an increase in leaf or stem carbohydrate contents was accompanied by a larger increase in root carbohydrate contents probably as a result of carbohydrate storage in root tissue the plants experienced less severe light limitation in our manipulation experiment than in our field investigation and thus the experimental plants likely produced more carbohydrates that could be stored in root organ starch and tnc were the hub traits in the field and experiment based networks fig 1b f carbohydrate concentration in shoots and roots was positively associated with submergence induced leaf elongation because the increasing storage compounds were necessary to ensure plastic responses of plants to the environment huber et al 2012 moreover organ carbohydrate was positively related to species dominance and biomass fig 3 because the accumulated carbohydrates provided basic energy for plants to sustain cell growth and biomass accumulation in eutrophic lakes submerged macrophytes often encounter high nutrient and low light stress that suppress carbohydrate production making organ starch and tnc suitable indicators of the physiological responses to eutrophication organ starch and tnc also had connections to multiple other traits showing that changes in organ nsc concentration affect many other functions related to nutrient gain c sequestration and growth nutrient accumulation and underwater darkening are two common problems under the process of eutrophication zhang et al 2020 thus the dynamics of organ storage compounds are important and meaningful for understanding the interactions among plant traits the field based network mainly the negative relationships between organ p and carbohydrate had more connections than the experiment based network fig 1b f in the field survey tp enrichment led to overgrowth of phytoplankton which decreased water clarity fig 5 submerged macrophytes could excessively absorb p under p rich conditions whereas low water clarity suppressed the synthesis of carbohydrate therefore organ p was negatively related to organ starch and tnc moreover all correlations among traits will change when new species are included in the network laughlin 2014 two more high h p species are incorporated in our field data set and species with homeostatic stoichiometry tend to have higher energetic costs to maintain stable elemental contents yu et al 2011 which may enhance the connections between organ p and carbohydrates fig 1b in the manipulation experiment plants with flexible homeostasis present luxury uptake of nutrients which are accumulated in excess of their demand carignan and kalff 1980 moreover denser submerged macrophytes in the aquarium inhibited the growth of phytoplankton which was confirmed by the lower chl a concentration in the manipulation experiment than in the field survey chl a 4 10 versus 32 28 μg l 1 the experimental plants experienced less severe light limitation and thus produced more carbohydrates therefore p accumulation in organs coupled with c decline were not observed in the manipulation experiment fig 1f 4 2 mechanisms linking hub traits with community structure in the process of eutrophication the hub traits i e organ p starch and tnc were quantified in the field based network and then we determined how these hub traits affected species and community dynamics such as species biomass and dominance and community biomass first our results suggested that organs and species had a good ability to regulate internal p but not for n fig 2 table s3 which was consistent with a previous study on submerged macrophytes su et al 2019b long term low p availability in preindustrial times elser et al 2007 schindler 1977 exerted selective pressure on plants which adapted to limited p environments higher stoichiometric homeostasis of p h p was observed in leaves followed by stems and roots which was consistent with previous results in terrestrial plants zhang et al 2018 this result indicated that leaves maintained a stable nutrient level due to their important roles in supplying basic energy resources though photosynthesis to support plant growth these findings verify the hypothesis that more active organs have a higher regulatory ability to maintain a stable internal nutrient content zhang et al 2018 second in the present study organ leaf stem and root and species h p starch and tnc were positively associated with species biomass and dominance fig 3 closer relationships between leaf h p starch and tnc and species biomass and dominance were observed moreover community h p starch and tnc were positively correlated with community biomass although stoichiometric mechanisms underpinning community structure and functioning have been demonstrated in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems su et al 2019b yu et al 2010 our results emphasized that stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms both controlled community structure in shallow lakes fig 5 it is well known that nutrient enrichment and low light availability are two common phenomena of eutrophication which is confirmed by our sem paths chl a increased with increasing water tp and in turn affected water clarity fig 5 because the ability to maintain stable elemental content is species specific water tp enrichment should enhance the competitive advantage of low h p species in eutrophic lakes similarly low water clarity should reduce the synthesis of carbohydrates and thus inhibit plant growth submerged macrophytes can significantly improve local ecological environment through multiple positive interactions and these interactions form positive feedbacks more vegetation inhibits algal growth due to a reduction of nutrient availability and thus leads to higher water clarity which in turn benefits themselves scheffer et al 1993 su et al 2019a our results indicated that communities dominated by high h p species tended to occur in water with lower tp and chl a conditions fig 4 indicating their higher capacity to maintain constant external environments the community dominated by high h p species contained more starch and tnc whereas the community dominated by low h p species contained less starch and tnc fig s3 carbohydrates serve as a source of energy to support energy demanding processes under environments where energy supply is insufficient due to reduced light availability carbohydrates can also serve to build new cell wall material which is necessary to sustain cell growth therefore more carbohydrates are beneficial for plant growth and biomass accumulation plants with strong homeostasis have conservative nutrient use strategies yu et al 2011 thus they can absorb and utilize limiting resources and become predominant in relatively oligotrophic surroundings plants with weak homeostasis tend to grow faster and have adaptive strategies for luxury uptake and storage of excess elements in general in oligotrophic shallow lakes dominant high h p species stabilize the local environment that is suitable for carbohydrate accumulation which benefits their growth however in eutrophic lakes the community is dominated by low h p species and contains low storage compounds which inhibits the primary production of submerged macrophytes it is suggested that positive feedbacks induced by eutrophication would destabilize the ecosystem and h p and nsc can be used to predict community succession of submerged plants under different levels of anthropogenic disturbances 4 3 consequences of changes in plant stoichiometry and community biomass on aquatic ecosystem processes eutrophication has always been considered the driving factor for the decline of submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes which was confirmed by our results that nutrient loading promoted the growth of phytoplankton and thus decreased water clarity which influenced the carbohydrate content in plants fig 5 communities composed of plants with low storage materials and low h p had low primary productivity under conditions with higher nutrients which reduced c fixation in plant biomass community c contents tended to decrease with water turbidity fig 6c which further diminished c sequestration in plants our results showed that the negative effects of physiological and stoichiometric constraints on the community c sink were ubiquitous in eutrophic lakes fig 7 plant tissues are decomposed and enter a detritus based food web except when consumed by herbivores litter nutritional quality i e nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios plays a considerable role in determining the process of decomposition where decomposition rates are positively related to litter nutritional quality in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems cebrian 1999 cebrian and lartigue 2004 demi et al 2018 li et al 2012 and even at the global scale cornwell et al 2008 our results showed that plant nutritional quality increased with eutrophication fig 6 thus we can conclude that plant tissues with more nutrients in eutrophic conditions may experience faster decomposition rates which reduces the turnover time of litter in addition elevated nutrient availability often causes greater rates of microbial activity on plant litter thereby accelerating decomposition rates and allowing more nutrient flux into producers and higher trophic levels degasparro et al 2020 gulis et al 2004 gulis and suberkropp 2003 in summary eutrophication may accelerate litter decomposition rates and nutrient cycling rates by changing plant elemental contents and microbial activity which in turn further intensifies eutrophication in lakes fig 7 5 conclusions in our study we clearly illustrate the hub traits that control the whole plant phenotype of submerged macrophytes the mechanisms that link hub traits with ecosystem structure and functioning and the effects of changes in community biomass basal resource stoichiometry and plant physiological status on nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems during the process of eutrophication our results showed that organ p and nsc contents played a vital role in regulating plant performance and the stoichiometric and physiological mechanisms that linked these traits with species dominance and community biomass that is ecosystems dominated by high h p species containing high nsc contents tend to have more primary productivity while those dominated by low h p species containing low nsc contents are more vulnerable to environmental disturbances furthermore eutrophication exerts a profound impact on plant community nutrient contents and nutrient c ratios which likely affects many
