5355,establishing a computational model for accurate prediction of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is critical for regional water resources planning and irrigation scheduling design fao penman monteith equation is recommended as the standard model to predict et0 however its application is restricted by lack of complete meteorological data in many regions this study evaluated the performance of catboost an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees for estimating daily et0 using limited meteorological data in arid and semi arid regions of northern china the catboost model was further compared with their corresponding generalized regression neural network grnn and random forests rf models eight input combinations of daily meteorological data including daily maximum air temperature tmax daily minimum air temperature tmin wind speed at 2 m height u2 relative humidity rh and net radiation rn from 15 weather stations during 1996 2015 were used to train and test the models four statistical indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the models including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe the results showed that all the three models using tmax tmin u2 and rn could obtain satisfactory et0 estimates in arid and semi arid regions of northern china with incomplete sets of data for the local models catboost on average rmse ranging 0 096 0 821 mm d 1 was superior to grnn on average rmse ranging 0 206 0 847 mm d 1 and rf on average rmse ranging 0 169 0 866 mm d 1 under the same meteorological parameters as input the results of the generalized models were similar to the local models but the former ones performed worse than the latter ones overall catboost is observed to be the best alternative for estimating et0 which is helpful for irrigation scheduling in arid and semi arid regions of northern china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates keywords reference crop evapotranspiration catboost random forests generalized regression neural network arid and semi arid regions of northern china 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an essential component of hydrological cycle and also affects crop water requirements planning and management of water resources gundalia and dholakia 2013 traore et al 2010 xing et al 2016 reference crop evapotranspiration et0 reflects the impact of weather conditions on evaporation and transpiration it is one of the important factors for estimation of crops water requirement and frequently used to quantify et laaboudi et al 2012 pour ali baba et al 2013 wen et al 2015 yassin et al 2016 thus accurate estimation of et0 can achieve efficient water saving irrigation and improve the efficiency of management in irrigation districts also provide support for water resources planning and optimal utilization kisi 2016 perera et al 2014 about 50 diverse approaches exist to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration the fao penman monteith p m equation which is recommended as the sole standard method for the computation of the et0 has been reported to be able to provide precise et0 values in many regions and climates gavilan et al 2007 lopez urrea et al 2006 however application of this equation requires a number of meteorological data e g maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation fan et al 2018a fan et al 2018b it is difficult to achieve if meteorological data are not available which limit the effective use of the p m equation especially in developing countries cobaner 2011 kumar et al 2002 therefore it is imperative to find a model that can accurately estimates et0 with incomplete meteorological data in an attempt to overcome the restrictions in the application of p m equation the calculation of et0 can be regarded as a complex and nonlinear regression process relying on a large number of meteorological variables it is difficult to develop an accurate empirical model to represent all these complex processes luo et al 2014 so many machine learning models have been successfully applied for modeling et0 these approaches can offer simpler solutions for nonlinear multi variable problems and require no knowledge about internal system variables and factual calculations chaturvedi 2008 huang et al 2010 the estimation accuracy of et0 was significantly improved with the establishment of these models ladlani et al 2012 compared the performance of generalized regression neural network grnn and radial basis function neural network rbfnn for estimation of daily et0 in algeria it was found that grnn performed better than rbfnn and empirical equations feng et al 2017a estimated daily et0 using random forests rf and grnn in southwest china both grnn and rf models performed well for predicting daily et0 and rf performed slightly better than grnn wang et al 2017 investigated the abilities of six different soft computing methods and two regression methods including multilayer perceptron mlp grnn fuzzy genetic fg least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression spline mars adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems with grid partition anfis gp multi linear regression mlr and stephens and stewart model ss the accuracies of above models ranked as mlp grnn lssvm fg anfis gp mars and mlr tabari et al 2012 applied support vector machine svm adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis mlr and temperature and radiation based models to estimate et0 in semi arid regions of iran the svm and anfis models were found to be better than others shiri 2018 proposed a coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology to improve the accuracy of the mass transfer based et0 estimation approaches the results showed that the new coupled wrf model improved the accuracy of single rf models kim and kim 2008 applied the grnn model embedding the genetic algorithm ga to estimate the pan evaporation and the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration and indicated that the optimal combine grnn ga can estimate the pan evaporation which is missed or ungauged and the alfalfa reference evapotranspiration which is not measured with the least cost and endeavor kim et al 2013 developed multilayer perceptron neural networks model mlp nnm grnn and anfis for estimating daily pan evaporation in south korea it was concluded that the applied neural networks models can be successfully employed for estimating daily pan evaporation gradient enhancement is a powerful machine learning technology lu et al 2018 catboost is a new type of gradient enhancement technology dorogush et al 2018 it has been applied in many fields as a result of good performance e g short term weather forecast diao et al 2019 prediction for kickstarter campaigns jhaveri et al 2019 driving style recognition liu et al 2020 and diabetes prediction miao et al 2019 in addition catboost is gradually being used to reference crop evapotranspiration estimation huang et al 2019 utilized catboost rf and svm for modeling evapotranspiration process in humid region of china also analyzed the potential of catboost for accurately modeling daily et0 under humid conditions their finding revealed that catboost showed better accuracy and lower computational cost when compared to rf and svm however et0 is a function of climatic variables which are generally specific to the geographical location and climate type of the region allen et al 1998 torres et al 2011 thus the climate characteristics of the study area may affect the performance of models the accuracy of catboost for modeling et0 in arid and semi arid regions of northern china compared to other models has not been evaluated therefore the main objective of this study are 1 to evaluate the applicant of catboost for estimation of daily et0 using different meteorological combinations by comparing with rf and grnn models 2 to determine the importance of different meteorological parameters for accuracy of daily et0 prediction 3 to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the generalized model in arid and semi arid regions of northern china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area which includes xinjiang gansu ningxia and inner mongolia are located in arid and semi arid regions of northern china fig 1 it occupies about one third of the area of china on the plateau about 1000 m there are not only mountains above 3000 m in horizontal ridges but inland basins range from 250 m to 500 m the study area is located inside the eurasian continent it is far from the sea and less affected by summer monsoon the humid ocean air is blocked by mountains so the climate is dry the annual precipitation ranges from 100 mm to 400 mm with more precipitation on the east than west china is one of the countries with severe water shortage the situation is even more serious in the arid and semi arid regions farmland irrigation consumes most of the water resources in recent years along with social economy development and population explosion the area of arable land has further expanded in addition the demand for water resources has also increased therefore this region has become a hotspot for studying the distribution and dynamics of water resources 2 2 dataset this study selected daily meteorological data from 15 weather stations in arid and semi arid regions of northern china during 1996 2015 the meteorological data including daily minimum air temperature tmin daily maximum air temperature tmax sunshine duration n relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m height u2 were provided and quality examined by the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration to ensure the accuracy of estimation daily data were excluded if any of the above meteorological data was missing the collected data from 1996 to 2015 were divided into two groups the first group 1996 2009 was used to train the three machine learning models while the second group 2010 2015 was used for the machine learning models testing the statistical properties of the daily data during 1996 2005 are shown in the appended table s1 2 3 penman monteith equation the penman monteith p m equation allen et al 1998 was employed to estimate daily et0 using multiple meteorological variables besides this method was universally selected to evaluate the accuracy of empirical equations and machine learning models in predicting et0 allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017b the formula of p m equation can be written as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 t is mean air temperature u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 δ is slope of vapor pressure curve kpa 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures respectively kpa 2 4 random forests random forests rf is a data mining algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 and this algorithm is widely applied for classification and regression problems it uses breiman s bagging idea to ensemble a set of decision trees with control variance the rf model is essentially one of machine learning algorithms ensemble learning algorithm ensemble learning solves a single prediction problem by building a combination of several models it can generate multiple models then learning and making predictions independently finally these predictions are combined into a single prediction so it is better than any single classification similar to the bagging algorithm rf is also based on the bootstrap method to resample and generate multiple training sets for each training set it establishes an unpruned classification or regression tree in each round of random sampling of bagging about 36 8 of the training data will not be sampled these uncollected data can be used to detect the generalization ability of the models for the classification problem the final classification result is selected by majority vote decision however the final result is the average of all the tree results for the regression problem breiman 2001 in addition rf uses a method of randomly selecting split attribute sets when constructing a decision tree matin and chelgani 2016 this method will improve the generalization and the bias will increase however due to the vote selection rf can effectively reduce model variance more details about rf can be found in breiman 2001 the structure of the random forests model is given in fig 2 breiman 2001 2 5 generalized regression neural network generalized regression neural network grnn was originally proposed by specht 1991 which is one kind of radial basis function neural network rbfnn rbfnn is an artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions it is an efficient feed forward neural network fnn compared with rbfnn grnn has one more summation layer and the weight connection between the hidden layer and the output layer is removed due to its strong non linear mapping capability and learning speed grnn can approximate any non linear relationship mapping function the grnn model is a similar method to the back propagation neural network bpnn which is a non linear multilayer forward network the major difference between the grnn and bpnn is that grnn adopts the approximation principle of local response while bpnn uses global approximation algorithm as shown in fig 3 specht 1991 grnn consists of four layers including input layer pattern layer summation layer and output layer it is based on the following formula kisi 2008 2 y x i 1 n y i e x p x x i t x x i 2 σ 2 i 1 n e x p x x i t x x i 2 σ 2 where y x is output value of the neural network σ is width coefficient of the gaussian function also referred as smoothing factor xi is input value corresponding training sample yi is excepted value of output 2 6 catboost catboost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and it was proposed by engineers of yandex in 2017 prokhorenkova et al 2018 gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning technique it can solve problems with heterogeneous features noisy data and complex dependencies comparing with other gbdt algorithms catboost has the following advantages firstly this algorithm can handle categorical features well traditional gbdt algorithm can replace categorical features with corresponding average label value in decision tree the average label value will be used as the criterion for node splitting this method is called greedy target based statistics greedy tbs which is defined as the follows prokhorenkova et al 2018 3 j 1 p x j k x i k y i j 1 n x j k x i k generally features contain more information than labels if we use average label value to represent features forcefully it will lead to a conditional shift zhang et al 2013 catboost adds a prior value to greedy tbs assume that we are given a dataset of observations d xi yi i 1 n if a permutation is σ σ 1 σ n x σ p k is substituted with prokhorenkova et al 2018 4 j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j a p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where p is a prior value a is the weight of prior value this method contributes to reducing the noise obtained from the low frequency category secondly catboost combines multiple categorical features catboost uses a greedy way to combine all categorical features and their combinations in the current tree with all categorical features in the dataset thirdly catboost can overcome gradient bias in gbdt it generates a weak learner in each iteration and each learner is trained based on the gradient of the previous learner accumulation of classified results of all learners provides the output friedman 2002 but it will lead biased pointwise gradient estimation which makes the final learned model overfit catboost uses a new method to change the gradient estimation method in the classic algorithm which is named as ordered boosting this method can overcome prediction shift caused by gradient bias and further enhance the generalization ability of the model the pseudo code of ordered boosting is expressed in table 1 prokhorenkova et al 2018 in order to obtain an unbiased gradient estimation catboost trains a separate model mi for each sample xi the model mi is trained with a training set that does not contain sample xi we use mi to obtain a gradient estimation of the sample furthermore this gradient will be used to train base learner for final model 2 7 model scenarios and input combinations in the present study we considered two types of scenarios 1 local approach the catboost grnn and rf models were trained separately at each station and the remaining data of each station were used for testing 2 generalized approach the catboost grnn and rf models were trained separately using the data set of each station while the data sets of other stations were reserved for testing eight input combinations of variables based on tmax tmin rh u2 and rn were considered to estimate the daily reference crop evapotranspiration the input combinations are shown in table 2 rh and u2 reflect the effects of aerodynamic components on et0 rn derived from the hours dimensions and altitude of the sun reflects the effects of radiation components in addition air temperature can reflect the impact of aerodynamic and radiation components 2 8 evaluation criteria the accuracy and performance of the proposed models for estimating daily reference crop evapotranspiration were evaluated using four commonly used statistical indicators despotovic et al 2015 draper and smith 1981 wu et al 2019 which were coefficient of determination r2 eq 5 root mean square error rmse eq 6 mean absolute error mae eq 7 and mean bias error mbe eq 8 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i p i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i i 1 n p i p i 6 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 7 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 8 mbe 1 n i 1 n o i p i where n is the total number of data oi and pi denote the observed and estimated values o i and p i represent the average of responding values respectively we selected a ranking procedure proposed by elagib and mansell 2000 to evaluate the overall performance of different models for each station 24 models three algorithms eight models were compared using r2 rmse mae and mbe then each model obtained a rating score based on statistical parameters e g the model with the highest r2 was ranked number 1 ranking score 1 on the contrary the model with the lowest r2 was ranked number 24 ranking score 24 finally the performance of the model was evaluated based on the sum of scores namely the model that have the smallest score was the best 3 results and discussion 3 1 local performance of the models as mentioned earlier three machine learning models were considered to predict daily et0 including rf grnn and catboost models meteorological data from 15 weather stations in arid and semi arid regions of northern china were used the sum of ranking scores of the 15 stations under different input combinations shown in table 3 give a clearer vision about the prediction accuracy of daily et0 under different models and input combinations in the training stage the catboost models showed the lowest scores with highest r2 and lowest rmse and mae the ranks of the proposed models in terms of performance in estimating daily et0 were catboost grnn rf the catboost models also had better prediction accuracy than the other two models during testing stage however the grnn models showed comparable estimates of daily et0 to the rf models for the specific input combination the performance ranked as catboost grnn rf in the combination 1 2 4 and as catboost rf grnn in the combination 3 5 6 7 while for the combination 8 the statistical indicators of rf and grnn showed inconsistencies in general the catboost models had the lowest scores which means catboost outperformed the two other models in predicting et0 for all input combinations fig 4 showed the performance of the catboost grnn rf models in the testing stage based on the statistical indicators provided in fig 4 the catboost models showed the highest r2 and lowest rmse and mae the mbe values of the catboost models were close to zero indicating there was little overestimation or underestimation of the et0 estimated by p m equation the type of meteorological parameters plays an important role in accuracy of machine learning for estimating daily et0 taking the catboost models as an example the model employing complete meteorological parameters tmax tmin rh u2 rn had the best prediction accuracy as compared with the incomplete parameters inputs which was generally in accordance with the previous studies mattar 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 catboost1 fed only with tmax tmin presented the lowest performance in training and testing stage adding rh u2 or rn to the input combination significantly improved the estimation accuracy for models using three variable input combinations catboost3 with tmax tmin and u2 inputs performed better than catboost4 with tmax tmin and rn inputs the r2 ranging 0 904 0 982 rmse ranging 0 236 0 705 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 144 0 537 mm d 1 mbe ranging 0 138 0 203 mm d 1 respectively furthermore catboost3 and catboost4 showed higher accuracy than catboost2 with tmax tmin and rh inputs this is in accordance with kisi and ozturk 2007 this result indicates that u2 seem to be more effective and powerful than rh and rn in accurately modeling the nonlinear complex process of et0 fisher et al 2005 liu and lin 2005 we analyzed combinations of four variable input here can be seen improvement of accuracy of et0 prediction with the four inputs the catboost7 with tmax tmin u2 and rn provided the highest prediction accuracy the r2 ranging 0 964 0 997 rmse ranging 0 110 0 439 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 067 0 311 mm d 1 and mbe ranging 0 029 0 157 mm d 1 respectively it is notable that adding rn to tmax tmin and u2 as a fourth input led to much better model performance than adding rh but both of which showed higher accuracy than using the combination of tmax tmin rh and rn overall for the three variables rh u2 rn their importance for improving model performance on the basis of tmax and tmin was ranked as u2 rn rh adding wind speed to the input combination improved the model s performance significantly it is generally in accordance with traore and guven 2012 who investigates the performance ability of the gene expression programming gep for modeling et0 using decadal climatic data from a sahelian country burkina faso the result showed that the model with wind speed yield higher accuracy than relative humidity this may be due to the advection effect of wind speed on et0 citakoglu et al 2014 kisi 2007 the sum of ranking scores of the different statistical indicators in each station for the local models were provided in table 4 including r2 rmse and mae as seen in the table the trends of model performance and the overall average rankings were similar to the results showed above table 3 except for few stations where the patterns were inconsistent with the average ranking this might be attributed to the differences in the observation data between the training and testing stages in order to further compare the performance of the three machine learning models the best input combinations were selected from the two three four and five variable input combinations respectively at the same time four representative stations including wusu hetian yinchuan and jarud were selected for plotting figs 5 8 the abscissa represents the et0 value calculated by p m equation the ordinate represents the et0 value predicted by the catboost grnn and rf models in the testing stage taking the wusu station as an example for any input combinations the performance of all the models followed the same trend however the et0 estimated by catboost were close to the value calculated by p m equation the dispersion degree of the data points in the scatter plots of the catboost model was substantially lower than that in the plots of the other two proposed models this indicates that catboost model has great potential for predicting daily et0 in addition the models employing complete meteorological dataset had the best prediction accuracy furthermore the statistical values of machine learning models in the combination 7 were close to those with complete meteorological input therefore tmax tmin u2 and rn can replace the complete meteorological dataset as input to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid regions of northern china 3 2 generalized performance of the models table 5 and table 6 compared the ranking scores of statistical indicators of the generalized models among 15 stations during the training and testing stages similar to the results of the local models catboost showed the highest accuracy among the three machine learning models during training stage but the performance of the grnn and rf models were slightly poor in the testing stage a better result of estimating et0 can be achieved using the catboost model but the rf and grnn models performed uncertainly consequently it can be seen that catboost has better ability to predict daily et0 than rf and grnn under the same input fig 9 showed the statistical indicators of the generalized models during the testing stage in general the catboost model had better prediction accuracy than the other two machine learning models as indicated by the statistical values in fig 9 particularly the catboost8 was predominant for daily et0 estimation among all the studied generalized machine learning models with average r2 of 0 992 rmse of 0 151 mm d 1 mae of 0 104 mm d 1 mbe of 0 025 mm d 1 the prediction accuracy of the catboost7 tmax tmin u2 rn was slightly worse than that of the catboost8 with average r2 of 0 968 rmse of 0 323 mm d 1 mae of 0 104 mm d 1 mbe of 0 058 mm d 1 comparing the local and generalized models fig 4 fig 9 table 3 and table 5 the generalized analysis of the performance of the proposed models confirmed the results obtained by the local analysis however the generalized models showed 2 37 and 4 33 increases in rmse and mae in comparison with the local models respectively thus the accuracy for estimating et0 of the generalized models was slightly worse than that of the local models the results were generally in accordance with the previous study huang et al 2019 the good performance of the proposed models for et0 estimation was found in this study however they had no physical basis and belong to a class of data driven approaches which can only be applied when the training data are available kisi and cimen 2009 generally physical modeling and machine learning have often been treated as two different fields with different scientific paradigms in fact these approaches are complementary with physical approaches being directly interpretable and offering the potential of extrapolation beyond observed conditions whereas data driven approaches are highly flexible in adapting to data reichstein et al 2019 combining physical process models with the data driven machine learning will be the most promising but also challenging approach reichstein et al 2019 the present study used the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by fao penman monteith model as the standard value although p m equation showed good performance in many regions and climates the conclusions drawn when only considering calculated results as benchmarks were not enough martí et al 2015 thus further study should consider evaluating the performance of the models using experimental et0 data as targets 4 conclusion this paper investigates the ability of catboost model in predicting daily et0 in 15 major weather stations covering the arid and semi arid regions of northern china in comparison with rf and grnn models the results showed that catboost on average r2 ranging 0 846 0 999 rmse ranging 0 096 0 821 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 067 0 603 mm d 1 mbe ranging 0 011 0 068 mm d 1 provided the most accurate results among the considered models grnn performed better than rf in the combination 1 tmax tmin combination 2 tmax tmin rh and combination 4 tmax tmin rn however rf provided the more accurate results in other combinations all the three machine learning algorithms whose combinations include tmax tmin rn and u2 can highly be recommended for predictions of daily et0 in case of incomplete sets of weather data moreover the generalized model provided the similar results to that obtained from the local model but the accuracy of the former ones was slightly poorer than the latter ones overall the catboost model showed great ability for modeling daily et0 and can be recommended for et0 estimation in arid and semi arid regions of northern china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates which has great importance for water resource management and reliable irrigation design especially in developing countries where meteorological data are

characteristics of the study area may affect the performance of models the accuracy of catboost for modeling et0 in arid and semi arid regions of northern china compared to other models has not been evaluated therefore the main objective of this study are 1 to evaluate the applicant of catboost for estimation of daily et0 using different meteorological combinations by comparing with rf and grnn models 2 to determine the importance of different meteorological parameters for accuracy of daily et0 prediction 3 to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the generalized model in arid and semi arid regions of northern china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area which includes xinjiang gansu ningxia and inner mongolia are located in arid and semi arid regions of northern china fig 1 it occupies about one third of the area of china on the plateau about 1000 m there are not only mountains above 3000 m in horizontal ridges but inland basins range from 250 m to 500 m the study area is located inside the eurasian continent it is far from the sea and less affected by summer monsoon the humid ocean air is blocked by mountains so the climate is dry the annual precipitation ranges from 100 mm to 400 mm with more precipitation on the east than west china is one of the countries with severe water shortage the situation is even more serious in the arid and semi arid regions farmland irrigation consumes most of the water resources in recent years along with social economy development and population explosion the area of arable land has further expanded in addition the demand for water resources has also increased therefore this region has become a hotspot for studying the distribution and dynamics of water resources 2 2 dataset this study selected daily meteorological data from 15 weather stations in arid and semi arid regions of northern china during 1996 2015 the meteorological data including daily minimum air temperature tmin daily maximum air temperature tmax sunshine duration n relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m height u2 were provided and quality examined by the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration to ensure the accuracy of estimation daily data were excluded if any of the above meteorological data was missing the collected data from 1996 to 2015 were divided into two groups the first group 1996 2009 was used to train the three machine learning models while the second group 2010 2015 was used for the machine learning models testing the statistical properties of the daily data during 1996 2005 are shown in the appended table s1 2 3 penman monteith equation the penman monteith p m equation allen et al 1998 was employed to estimate daily et0 using multiple meteorological variables besides this method was universally selected to evaluate the accuracy of empirical equations and machine learning models in predicting et0 allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017b the formula of p m equation can be written as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is reference crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 t is mean air temperature u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 δ is slope of vapor pressure curve kpa 1 es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures respectively kpa 2 4 random forests random forests rf is a data mining algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 and this algorithm is widely applied for classification and regression problems it uses breiman s bagging idea to ensemble a set of decision trees with control variance the rf model is essentially one of machine learning algorithms ensemble learning algorithm ensemble learning solves a single prediction problem by building a combination of several models it can generate multiple models then learning and making predictions independently finally these predictions are combined into a single prediction so it is better than any single classification similar to the bagging algorithm rf is also based on the bootstrap method to resample and generate multiple training sets for each training set it establishes an unpruned classification or regression tree in each round of random sampling of bagging about 36 8 of the training data will not be sampled these uncollected data can be used to detect the generalization ability of the models for the classification problem the final classification result is selected by majority vote decision however the final result is the average of all the tree results for the regression problem breiman 2001 in addition rf uses a method of randomly selecting split attribute sets when constructing a decision tree matin and chelgani 2016 this method will improve the generalization and the bias will increase however due to the vote selection rf can effectively reduce model variance more details about rf can be found in breiman 2001 the structure of the random forests model is given in fig 2 breiman 2001 2 5 generalized regression neural network generalized regression neural network grnn was originally proposed by specht 1991 which is one kind of radial basis function neural network rbfnn rbfnn is an artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions it is an efficient feed forward neural network fnn compared with rbfnn grnn has one more summation layer and the weight connection between the hidden layer and the output layer is removed due to its strong non linear mapping capability and learning speed grnn can approximate any non linear relationship mapping function the grnn model is a similar method to the back propagation neural network bpnn which is a non linear multilayer forward network the major difference between the grnn and bpnn is that grnn adopts the approximation principle of local response while bpnn uses global approximation algorithm as shown in fig 3 specht 1991 grnn consists of four layers including input layer pattern layer summation layer and output layer it is based on the following formula kisi 2008 2 y x i 1 n y i e x p x x i t x x i 2 σ 2 i 1 n e x p x x i t x x i 2 σ 2 where y x is output value of the neural network σ is width coefficient of the gaussian function also referred as smoothing factor xi is input value corresponding training sample yi is excepted value of output 2 6 catboost catboost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and it was proposed by engineers of yandex in 2017 prokhorenkova et al 2018 gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning technique it can solve problems with heterogeneous features noisy data and complex dependencies comparing with other gbdt algorithms catboost has the following advantages firstly this algorithm can handle categorical features well traditional gbdt algorithm can replace categorical features with corresponding average label value in decision tree the average label value will be used as the criterion for node splitting this method is called greedy target based statistics greedy tbs which is defined as the follows prokhorenkova et al 2018 3 j 1 p x j k x i k y i j 1 n x j k x i k generally features contain more information than labels if we use average label value to represent features forcefully it will lead to a conditional shift zhang et al 2013 catboost adds a prior value to greedy tbs assume that we are given a dataset of observations d xi yi i 1 n if a permutation is σ σ 1 σ n x σ p k is substituted with prokhorenkova et al 2018 4 j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j a p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where p is a prior value a is the weight of prior value this method contributes to reducing the noise obtained from the low frequency category secondly catboost combines multiple categorical features catboost uses a greedy way to combine all categorical features and their combinations in the current tree with all categorical features in the dataset thirdly catboost can overcome gradient bias in gbdt it generates a weak learner in each iteration and each learner is trained based on the gradient of the previous learner accumulation of classified results of all learners provides the output friedman 2002 but it will lead biased pointwise gradient estimation which makes the final learned model overfit catboost uses a new method to change the gradient estimation method in the classic algorithm which is named as ordered boosting this method can overcome prediction shift caused by gradient bias and further enhance the generalization ability of the model the pseudo code of ordered boosting is expressed in table 1 prokhorenkova et al 2018 in order to obtain an unbiased gradient estimation catboost trains a separate model mi for each sample xi the model mi is trained with a training set that does not contain sample xi we use mi to obtain a gradient estimation of the sample furthermore this gradient will be used to train base learner for final model 2 7 model scenarios and input combinations in the present study we considered two types of scenarios 1 local approach the catboost grnn and rf models were trained separately at each station and the remaining data of each station were used for testing 2 generalized approach the catboost grnn and rf models were trained separately using the data set of each station while the data sets of other stations were reserved for testing eight input combinations of variables based on tmax tmin rh u2 and rn were considered to estimate the daily reference crop evapotranspiration the input combinations are shown in table 2 rh and u2 reflect the effects of aerodynamic components on et0 rn derived from the hours dimensions and altitude of the sun reflects the effects of radiation components in addition air temperature can reflect the impact of aerodynamic and radiation components 2 8 evaluation criteria the accuracy and performance of the proposed models for estimating daily reference crop evapotranspiration were evaluated using four commonly used statistical indicators despotovic et al 2015 draper and smith 1981 wu et al 2019 which were coefficient of determination r2 eq 5 root mean square error rmse eq 6 mean absolute error mae eq 7 and mean bias error mbe eq 8 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i p i p i 2 i 1 n o i o i i 1 n p i p i 6 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 7 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 8 mbe 1 n i 1 n o i p i where n is the total number of data oi and pi denote the observed and estimated values o i and p i represent the average of responding values respectively we selected a ranking procedure proposed by elagib and mansell 2000 to evaluate the overall performance of different models for each station 24 models three algorithms eight models were compared using r2 rmse mae and mbe then each model obtained a rating score based on statistical parameters e g the model with the highest r2 was ranked number 1 ranking score 1 on the contrary the model with the lowest r2 was ranked number 24 ranking score 24 finally the performance of the model was evaluated based on the sum of scores namely the model that have the smallest score was the best 3 results and discussion 3 1 local performance of the models as mentioned earlier three machine learning models were considered to predict daily et0 including rf grnn and catboost models meteorological data from 15 weather stations in arid and semi arid regions of northern china were used the sum of ranking scores of the 15 stations under different input combinations shown in table 3 give a clearer vision about the prediction accuracy of daily et0 under different models and input combinations in the training stage the catboost models showed the lowest scores with highest r2 and lowest rmse and mae the ranks of the proposed models in terms of performance in estimating daily et0 were catboost grnn rf the catboost models also had better prediction accuracy than the other two models during testing stage however the grnn models showed comparable estimates of daily et0 to the rf models for the specific input combination the performance ranked as catboost grnn rf in the combination 1 2 4 and as catboost rf grnn in the combination 3 5 6 7 while for the combination 8 the statistical indicators of rf and grnn showed inconsistencies in general the catboost models had the lowest scores which means catboost outperformed the two other models in predicting et0 for all input combinations fig 4 showed the performance of the catboost grnn rf models in the testing stage based on the statistical indicators provided in fig 4 the catboost models showed the highest r2 and lowest rmse and mae the mbe values of the catboost models were close to zero indicating there was little overestimation or underestimation of the et0 estimated by p m equation the type of meteorological parameters plays an important role in accuracy of machine learning for estimating daily et0 taking the catboost models as an example the model employing complete meteorological parameters tmax tmin rh u2 rn had the best prediction accuracy as compared with the incomplete parameters inputs which was generally in accordance with the previous studies mattar 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2017 catboost1 fed only with tmax tmin presented the lowest performance in training and testing stage adding rh u2 or rn to the input combination significantly improved the estimation accuracy for models using three variable input combinations catboost3 with tmax tmin and u2 inputs performed better than catboost4 with tmax tmin and rn inputs the r2 ranging 0 904 0 982 rmse ranging 0 236 0 705 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 144 0 537 mm d 1 mbe ranging 0 138 0 203 mm d 1 respectively furthermore catboost3 and catboost4 showed higher accuracy than catboost2 with tmax tmin and rh inputs this is in accordance with kisi and ozturk 2007 this result indicates that u2 seem to be more effective and powerful than rh and rn in accurately modeling the nonlinear complex process of et0 fisher et al 2005 liu and lin 2005 we analyzed combinations of four variable input here can be seen improvement of accuracy of et0 prediction with the four inputs the catboost7 with tmax tmin u2 and rn provided the highest prediction accuracy the r2 ranging 0 964 0 997 rmse ranging 0 110 0 439 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 067 0 311 mm d 1 and mbe ranging 0 029 0 157 mm d 1 respectively it is notable that adding rn to tmax tmin and u2 as a fourth input led to much better model performance than adding rh but both of which showed higher accuracy than using the combination of tmax tmin rh and rn overall for the three variables rh u2 rn their importance for improving model performance on the basis of tmax and tmin was ranked as u2 rn rh adding wind speed to the input combination improved the model s performance significantly it is generally in accordance with traore and guven 2012 who investigates the performance ability of the gene expression programming gep for modeling et0 using decadal climatic data from a sahelian country burkina faso the result showed that the model with wind speed yield higher accuracy than relative humidity this may be due to the advection effect of wind speed on et0 citakoglu et al 2014 kisi 2007 the sum of ranking scores of the different statistical indicators in each station for the local models were provided in table 4 including r2 rmse and mae as seen in the table the trends of model performance and the overall average rankings were similar to the results showed above table 3 except for few stations where the patterns were inconsistent with the average ranking this might be attributed to the differences in the observation data between the training and testing stages in order to further compare the performance of the three machine learning models the best input combinations were selected from the two three four and five variable input combinations respectively at the same time four representative stations including wusu hetian yinchuan and jarud were selected for plotting figs 5 8 the abscissa represents the et0 value calculated by p m equation the ordinate represents the et0 value predicted by the catboost grnn and rf models in the testing stage taking the wusu station as an example for any input combinations the performance of all the models followed the same trend however the et0 estimated by catboost were close to the value calculated by p m equation the dispersion degree of the data points in the scatter plots of the catboost model was substantially lower than that in the plots of the other two proposed models this indicates that catboost model has great potential for predicting daily et0 in addition the models employing complete meteorological dataset had the best prediction accuracy furthermore the statistical values of machine learning models in the combination 7 were close to those with complete meteorological input therefore tmax tmin u2 and rn can replace the complete meteorological dataset as input to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid regions of northern china 3 2 generalized performance of the models table 5 and table 6 compared the ranking scores of statistical indicators of the generalized models among 15 stations during the training and testing stages similar to the results of the local models catboost showed the highest accuracy among the three machine learning models during training stage but the performance of the grnn and rf models were slightly poor in the testing stage a better result of estimating et0 can be achieved using the catboost model but the rf and grnn models performed uncertainly consequently it can be seen that catboost has better ability to predict daily et0 than rf and grnn under the same input fig 9 showed the statistical indicators of the generalized models during the testing stage in general the catboost model had better prediction accuracy than the other two machine learning models as indicated by the statistical values in fig 9 particularly the catboost8 was predominant for daily et0 estimation among all the studied generalized machine learning models with average r2 of 0 992 rmse of 0 151 mm d 1 mae of 0 104 mm d 1 mbe of 0 025 mm d 1 the prediction accuracy of the catboost7 tmax tmin u2 rn was slightly worse than that of the catboost8 with average r2 of 0 968 rmse of 0 323 mm d 1 mae of 0 104 mm d 1 mbe of 0 058 mm d 1 comparing the local and generalized models fig 4 fig 9 table 3 and table 5 the generalized analysis of the performance of the proposed models confirmed the results obtained by the local analysis however the generalized models showed 2 37 and 4 33 increases in rmse and mae in comparison with the local models respectively thus the accuracy for estimating et0 of the generalized models was slightly worse than that of the local models the results were generally in accordance with the previous study huang et al 2019 the good performance of the proposed models for et0 estimation was found in this study however they had no physical basis and belong to a class of data driven approaches which can only be applied when the training data are available kisi and cimen 2009 generally physical modeling and machine learning have often been treated as two different fields with different scientific paradigms in fact these approaches are complementary with physical approaches being directly interpretable and offering the potential of extrapolation beyond observed conditions whereas data driven approaches are highly flexible in adapting to data reichstein et al 2019 combining physical process models with the data driven machine learning will be the most promising but also challenging approach reichstein et al 2019 the present study used the reference crop evapotranspiration calculated by fao penman monteith model as the standard value although p m equation showed good performance in many regions and climates the conclusions drawn when only considering calculated results as benchmarks were not enough martí et al 2015 thus further study should consider evaluating the performance of the models using experimental et0 data as targets 4 conclusion this paper investigates the ability of catboost model in predicting daily et0 in 15 major weather stations covering the arid and semi arid regions of northern china in comparison with rf and grnn models the results showed that catboost on average r2 ranging 0 846 0 999 rmse ranging 0 096 0 821 mm d 1 mae ranging 0 067 0 603 mm d 1 mbe ranging 0 011 0 068 mm d 1 provided the most accurate results among the considered models grnn performed better than rf in the combination 1 tmax tmin combination 2 tmax tmin rh and combination 4 tmax tmin rn however rf provided the more accurate results in other combinations all the three machine learning algorithms whose combinations include tmax tmin rn and u2 can highly be recommended for predictions of daily et0 in case of incomplete sets of weather data moreover the generalized model provided the similar results to that obtained from the local model but the accuracy of the former ones was slightly poorer than the latter ones overall the catboost model showed great ability for modeling daily et0 and can be recommended for et0 estimation in arid and semi arid regions of northern china and maybe elsewhere with similar climates which has great importance for water resource management and reliable irrigation design especially in developing countries where meteorological data are

5356,surface water mapping is very important for studying its role in global water cycle flooding dynamic monitoring and water resources management the most famous techniques for water body extraction like those based on water spectral indices wsi require rich spectral information however the wsi methods are no longer practical in high resolution multispectral ms images due to insufficient spectral information in addition surface water mapping faces an utmost overestimation issue because shadows are misclassified as water bodies to address the above mentioned problems in this paper a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn is proposed the global spatial spectral convolution gssc module is developed to enhance surface water body features a novel multiscale learning module is designed to extract multi scale contextual information in addition the surface water body boundary refinement swbbr module is adopted to enhance surface water body boundaries the results show that the proposed method achieved good performance with a mean overall accuracy of 98 97 a mean kappa coefficient of 94 78 and a mean boundary overall accuracy of 98 01 therefore wbe nn can be used for mapping surface water with high accuracy in complex areas keywords surface water deep learning high resolution multispectral imagery convolutional neural networks 1 introduction surface water bodies such as rivers lakes and ponds play a crucial role in ecosystem balance and hydrological cycle and provide fundamental resources for vegetation animals and human life varis vakkilainen 2001 huntington 2006 tulbure broich 2013 advances in remote sensing technology is becoming a crucial approach of extracting surface water bodies the measuring and monitoring of global surface water using remote sensing technology is a hot topic optical high resolution remote sensing technology can provide useful information for surface water body extraction however clouds and their shadows often appear in optical remote sensing images chen et al 2018a the shadows cloud shadows and building shadows and water bodies have a similar appearance in optical remote sensing images fig 1 therefore water body extraction is not an easy task in the optical high resolution images due to the limited spectral ranges including blue green red and near infrared bands and the complexity of low albedo objects cloud shadows vegetation and building shadows in the last four decades many methods have been proposed to produce water maps from optical remote sensing images in this study two types of methods are summarized 1 spectral analysis 2 image classification the water spectral indices wsi are widely used to enhance the differences between water and non water bodies mcfeeters 1996 present the normalized difference water index ndwi to detect water bodies using the near infrared nir and green bands however the ndwi poorly differentiate between water bodies and shadows in urban areas xu 2006 xu 2006 developed a modified ndwi mndwi by using the green and shortwave infrared swir bands to extract water bodies while suppressing the noise from built up areas it should be noted that ndwi and mndwi are not very appropriate for producing water maps from cloud shadows contaminated high spatial resolution images feyisa et al 2014 developed automated water extraction index awei by using multiple bands 1 2 4 5 and 7 of landsat 5 tm to extract water bodies while suppressing the noise from built up and mountainous areas yang et al 2017 exploited a water body extraction ndwi model based image sharpening to reduce the errors resulting from shadows yang et al 2018 used the noise prediction strategy and two water indices mndwi and awei to eliminate such misclassified non water regions from sentinel 2 msi image although the water spectral indices can achieve good accuracy for extracting surface water areas however some above wsi methods are no longer practical in high resolution multispectral ms images due to insufficient spectral information various classification methods were developed to overcome the limitation of wsi methods in the optical high resolution images nath and deb 2010 the classification method based on feature extraction and machine learning is an advanced technique for surface water mapping rokni et al 2014 machine learning ml is also an effective method for extracting surface water bodies huang et al 2015 the decision tree model is used to extract surface water from the thematic mapper tm image fu et al 2008 the support vector machine svm is applied to produce flood mapping nandi et al 2017 an expert system is used to extract global surface water pekel et al 2016 however the above classification methods cannot mine high level features and semantic information lead to the performance extraction of surface water bodies is limited in recent years deep learning dl has shown effective and excellent feature learning ability where the two representative features are learnt end to end and hierarchically lecun et al 2015 convolutional neural networks cnn are popular deep learning method maggiori et al 2016 the cnn is widely used in many remote sensing image analyses such as semantic segmentation clouds detection and water bodies extraction and so on zhu et al 2017 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2018 various novel deep learning models have been developed for surface water bodies extraction on remote sensing data jiang et al 2018 isikdogan et al 2017 the self adaptive pooling sap cnn model is used to extract surface water bodies from superpixels chen et al 2018b feng et al 2018 exploited the combined application of deep u net and conditional random fields crf to extract surface water bodies from superpixels obtained by the simple linear iterative cluster slic method however the performance of the above cnn methods is too dependent on superpixels segmentation accuracy in addition owing to the stride convolution and pooling operations the cnn is applied directly to water body extraction leading to the blurring of water boundaries some water body extraction based 2d cnn methods cannot fully extract the joint spatial spectral correlations feature which can be critical for water body extraction yu et al 2017 miao et al 2018 duan and hu 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 in order to produce good water body extraction results based on limited spectral information more information such as multiscale semantic information should be taken into consideration to address the above mentioned issues a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn is proposed the overall method structure is divided into three parts which contains global spatial spectral convolution module multiscale learning module and boundary refinement module the proposed method enjoys the benefit from end to end ss cnn architecture and the performance of our method is not dependent on superpixel segmentation accuracy specifically the multiscale learning module is designed to mine water body semantic information from both global scope and local scope it is difficult to directly extract spatial spectral information from ms images in both the spatial and the spectral dimensions when the traditional 2d convolution is used in order to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously the global spatial spectral convolution gssc module is developed in addition a novel surface water body boundary refinement uwbbr module is adopted to improve water body extraction results the major works of this paper can be concluded as follows 1 we design a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe net architecture for more accurate water body extraction from optical high resolution multispectral imagery 2 global spatial spectral convolution module is developed to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously thereby further enhancing surface water body features 3 a novel multiscale learning module is designed which can extract the multiscale semantic information of surface water bodies 2 methodology in this section the proposed framework of surface water body extraction based on deep learning is described first the global spatial spectral convolution module is introduced to extract global spectral spatial information then the multiscale learning module is discussed which is used to multiscale semantic information from both global and local scopes finally the uwbbr module extraction layer and loss function are presented in detail the flowchart of the proposed method is shown in fig 2 2 1 global spatial spectral convolution module the cnn architecture often consists of alternatively stacked convolution layers followed by pooling layer hu et al 2015 the convolution layer produces new feature maps from previous feature maps and acts as multiple learnable filters in the input data sajjad et al 2018 according to the different spatial dimensions the convolution kernel can be mainly classified into three classes 1 one dimensional 1 d convolution kernel 2 two dimensional 2 d convolution kernels 3 three dimensional 3 d convolution kernels 1 d convolution kernels are used to extract 1 d features from input data krizhevsky et al 2012 2 d convolution kernel is one of the most frequently used operations in an image alshehhi et al 2017 recently 3d convolution layer is achieved to extract features from both the spatial and the spectral dimensions by convolving a 3d kernel at the remote sensing classification task li et al 2017 vetrivel et al 2018 the highly nonlinear semantic relationship between multispectral ms image bands indicates that higher level expression is essential for surface water body extraction although three dimensional convolutions can extract spatial features and spectral features simultaneously however this leads to an obvious increase in the number of parameters in every 3d convolution layer making this method more prone to overfitting karpathy et al 2014 to address the problems above in this work we decide to factorize 3d convolutions into 2d spatial convolutions and 1d spectral convolutions namely spatial spectral convolution if the spatial spectral convolutions are used leads to fewer parameters the proposed spatial spectral convolution operation is shown in fig 3 a in this study first we compute spatial feature maps gt for every band xs a pixel at position i j of the k th feature map is defined as follows 1 g tij k m 1 4 w spat k m x s m ij where m is the number of input ms image bands the operation symbol represents a convolution operation w spat k m represents the weight feature vector of the k th convolution kernel finally we compute across the spectral dimension for every position i j the 1d spectral convolution process is defined as follows 2 s sij k f n 1 n w spe kn g ij n s b k where n is the number of spatial feature maps b k is the bias vector f is the rectified linear units relu w spe is trainable parameters in this study the rectified linear units relu are applied to every layer the relu is defined as follows dahl et al 2013 3 relu x max 0 x a pooling operator is used to reduce parameters including average pooling and max pooling zou et al 2015 generally speaking a 3d max pooling mp layer follows each 3d cnn however if 3d max pooling is used leading to complex computation cost here we decide to factorize 3d max pooling into 2d spatial max pooling and 1d max pooling in this work in order to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously global spatial spectral convolution module is designed as demonstrated in fig 3 b an input image is 512 512 4 consisting of four channels each with dimension 512 512 the first spatial spectral convolution layer of sizes is 256 256 followed by max pooling of sizes is 1 1 2 2 multiscale learning module multiscale contextual information is widely used in various segmentation tasks qi et al 2019 for water body extraction large region surface water bodies can conveniently be detected at low resolution score maps small size surface water bodies can be effectively detected from the high resolution score maps generally speaking large image patch to feed into cnn to gather more robust semantics information and a small image patch to get more precise location features therefore we can get more precise contextual information of different levels to extract surface water bodies multiscale contextual information is an important factor for more precise surface water mapping by the analysis above however the single cnn method cannot extract multiscale semantics information from input data inspired by fully cnn fcnn sherrah 2016 as a backbone to extract multiscale semantic features multiscale learning module is designed to extract semantic information of different levels as shown in fig 4 the proposed multiscale learning module which contains a sampling module multiscale features extraction module and feature fusion module in the sampling module input images preprocessing in order to get the input image of different levels we first up sample the original feature map by a factor of 2 via bilinear interpolation to get the input data of size 512 512 4 then we down sample the original images as the input data of size 128 128 4 finally the different size patches 512 512 4 256 256 4 and128 128 4 are inputted into the multiscale extraction module previous studies have shown that the smaller size convolutional kernels are used to exploit local features the larger size convolutional kernels are used to exploit global features gao et al 2019 ma et al 2019 here in the multiscale features extraction module in order to extract both low level spatial information and multiscale semantic information we set different sizes of the spatial spectral convolution kernel global contextual information has strong contexts but weak local spatial information whereas local spatial information has strong locations but weak contexts sun et al 2019 after the learning process of multiscale features extraction module the low level spatial information of combination images has been transformed into multiscale semantic information the multiscale learning module is used to generate multi scale semantic score maps three low resolution score maps for water body extraction firstly three low resolution score maps are fused by an elementwise summation operation then features of different levels are concatenated as the final output feature vector which is then reshaped into128 128 4 in the feature fusion module finally the new score map 256 256 4 is upsampled to the same size as the original input image in order to achieve better extraction accuracy of than the features extraction module with only multiscale semantic information the multiscale semantic and low level spatial features are applied simultaneously in the up sampling process combined with the extracted multiscale semantic information with low level spatial features the input image is detected into the water body and non water body in pixel level 2 3 surface water body

architecture training 3000 images are used for training and 2000 for test the stochastic gradient descent sgd bengio 2012 is used for training the validation processing was regularized by dropout regularization with dropout ratio set to 0 5 the weights in each layer were initialized from a zero mean gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0 01 a mini batch size of 256 is used the learning rate started from 0 001 with initial bias set to constant 0 1 and achieved a value equivalent to divided by 10 of the initial when the error plateaus respectively the weight decay and momentum were set to 0 001 and 0 1 respectively fig 7 shows the loss function in each of training and validation datasets in high resolution multispectral images after 1000 epochs each time we run the entire datasets it can be clearly seen that error is gradually decreased 3 2 evaluation of suppressing shadow noise performance of the proposed method the spectrum for shadows cloud shadow mountain shadow and building shadow is similar to that for surface water bodies therefore it is a challenging task to remove shadow noises from surface water bodies to validate the proposed method suppressing noise performance we use three major noise images including cloud shadows mountain shadows building shadows in addition we have compared the proposed method with ndwi method mcfeeters 1996 and best svm method nandi et al 2017 based on the visual assessment a performance comparison of the different noise scenes is shown in fig 8 from fig 8 e1 e3 it can be seen that three major noise cloud shadows mountain shadows building shadows can be removed using the proposed method however for the regions in fig 8 a2 a3 ndwi method cannot eliminate noise from mountain shadows and building shadows from 8 d1 d3 the svm method mixes some of the cloud and building shadows with the surface water bodies the ndwi and svm methods fail to solve the overestimation phenomenon shadows are misclassified as water bodies our method achieves better performance when suppressing noise compared to the other two methods table 1 summarizes the extraction accuracy of the water mapping with the ndwi svm and the proposed method on the different noise images from table 1 it can be seen that the proposed method significantly outperformed traditional ndwi method at discriminating water from mountain shadow and building shadow for cloud shadows the svm method shows overestimation phenomenon with low kappa accuracy 69 04 the ndwi method has obvious over extraction problems in the mountain and building shadow regions with low boa and kappa accuracy the above results show that our proposed method can eliminate shadow noise and reserve water bodies simultaneously 3 3 analysis of the proposed network components on the performance of water body extraction to testify the validity of the proposed cnn structure we have compared the proposed method with cnn without gssc module our proposed method without the global spatial spectral convolution cnn without ml module our proposed method without multiscale learning module and cnn without br module our proposed method without boundary refinement module fig 9 shows the water body extraction results of the proposed network structure components from fig 9 b and fig 9 f it can be seen that the extraction result of our proposed method appears very similar to the ground truth water body maps however the proposed cnn gssc module and the proposed cnn multiscale learning module cannot extract small surface water bodies see fig 9 c d red box especially narrow rivers from fig 9 e some adjacent water bodies are also be detected as one water body at the proposed cnn br module overall the proposed method is capable of successfully extracting different types of surface water bodies based on the above experimental comparisons fig 10 shows the overall accuracy kappa and boundary overall accuracy values obtained with without 1 the global spatial spectral convolution module 3 the boundary refinement module for the global spatial spectral convolution module we can observe that it can promote the accuracy of oa and kappa by about 2 and 3 5 as shown in fig 10 a1 and a2 respectively for the multiscale learning module the kappa dramatically improves by about 6 see fig 10 b2 indicating that extracting more features with multi scale semantic information is beneficial for surface water extraction with the boundary refinement module the boundary overall accuracy observably improves by about 7 5 fig 10 c3 clearly demonstrates its effects on the accuracy of water body boundary in the proposed cnn net therefore through quantitatively evaluate results of the proposed network structure components the proposed method shows a significant improvement for water mapping and achieves stable results in the different surface scene 3 4 comparison with other state of the art methods to validate the proposed method performance we compared the proposed method to the cnn superpixel method chen et al 2018b the deep u net method ronneberger et al 2015 and the deep u net crf method feng et al 2018 both the cnn and the deep u net are good performed deep semantic segmentation networks for natural images fig 11 shows some of surface water extraction results using state of the art deep learning method from fig 11 c e the cnn superpixel method the deep u net method and deep u net crf method fail to detect small water bodies lead to the underestimation phenomenon on the surface water mapping the reason for this result can be summarized that these deep learning net not easy generate multiscale resolution score maps especially high resolution score maps well known small size surface water bodies can be easily extracted from the high resolution score maps from fig 11 c d we further find that the cnn superpixel and deep u net methods fail to solve the problem of separating adjacent surface water bodies the blurring of water boundaries in comparison with the above deep learning methods the proposed approach can well extract different types of surface water bodies and solve the problem of underestimation on a more complex scene the quantitative evaluation for fig 11 is shown in table 2 in addition underestimate water areas are calculated the high oa indicates the feasibility of the three deep learning methods and the newly proposed method however the water boundary accuracy is relatively lower in the cnn superpixel and deep u net methods the estimation of total surface water area has slight underestimation in the cnn superpixel the deep u ne and deep u net crf methods these result from omission errors due to the small water bodies are undetected from table 2 it can be seen that the proposed method has the best values in the oa kappa and underestimate water areas the above results show that the proposed method delivers more accurate water maps in the different types of surface water bodies 4 conclusions in this study we propose a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn with a global spatial spectral convolution module a multiscale learning module and surface water body boundary refinement module this method aims to solve the overestimation problem shadows are misclassified as surface water bodies on the surface water mapping when using the high resolution multispectral image specifically global spatial spectral convolution module is designed to enhance surface water body features multiscale contextual information is a key factor for distinguishing between surface water bodies and shadows so a novel multiscale learning module is designed to extract multi scale contextual information the surface water body boundary refinement module is adopted to enhance surface water body boundaries thereby further boosting accuracy the proposed wbe net has two advantages i it extracts global spatial and spectral features simultaneously ii it exploits the low level spatial information of combination images has been transformed into multiscale semantic information and generates relatively detailed boundary score maps experimental results showed that the proposed method is robust and has an ability to accurately extract water bodies and solve the overestimation issue the proposed method reduces the commission errors in the precision surface water

5356,surface water mapping is very important for studying its role in global water cycle flooding dynamic monitoring and water resources management the most famous techniques for water body extraction like those based on water spectral indices wsi require rich spectral information however the wsi methods are no longer practical in high resolution multispectral ms images due to insufficient spectral information in addition surface water mapping faces an utmost overestimation issue because shadows are misclassified as water bodies to address the above mentioned problems in this paper a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn is proposed the global spatial spectral convolution gssc module is developed to enhance surface water body features a novel multiscale learning module is designed to extract multi scale contextual information in addition the surface water body boundary refinement swbbr module is adopted to enhance surface water body boundaries the results show that the proposed method achieved good performance with a mean overall accuracy of 98 97 a mean kappa coefficient of 94 78 and a mean boundary overall accuracy of 98 01 therefore wbe nn can be used for mapping surface water with high accuracy in complex areas keywords surface water deep learning high resolution multispectral imagery convolutional neural networks 1 introduction surface water bodies such as rivers lakes and ponds play a crucial role in ecosystem balance and hydrological cycle and provide fundamental resources for vegetation animals and human life varis vakkilainen 2001 huntington 2006 tulbure broich 2013 advances in remote sensing technology is becoming a crucial approach of extracting surface water bodies the measuring and monitoring of global surface water using remote sensing technology is a hot topic optical high resolution remote sensing technology can provide useful information for surface water body extraction however clouds and their shadows often appear in optical remote sensing images chen et al 2018a the shadows cloud shadows and building shadows and water bodies have a similar appearance in optical remote sensing images fig 1 therefore water body extraction is not an easy task in the optical high resolution images due to the limited spectral ranges including blue green red and near infrared bands and the complexity of low albedo objects cloud shadows vegetation and building shadows in the last four decades many methods have been proposed to produce water maps from optical remote sensing images in this study two types of methods are summarized 1 spectral analysis 2 image classification the water spectral indices wsi are widely used to enhance the differences between water and non water bodies mcfeeters 1996 present the normalized difference water index ndwi to detect water bodies using the near infrared nir and green bands however the ndwi poorly differentiate between water bodies and shadows in urban areas xu 2006 xu 2006 developed a modified ndwi mndwi by using the green and shortwave infrared swir bands to extract water bodies while suppressing the noise from built up areas it should be noted that ndwi and mndwi are not very appropriate for producing water maps from cloud shadows contaminated high spatial resolution images feyisa et al 2014 developed automated water extraction index awei by using multiple bands 1 2 4 5 and 7 of landsat 5 tm to extract water bodies while suppressing the noise from built up and mountainous areas yang et al 2017 exploited a water body extraction ndwi model based image sharpening to reduce the errors resulting from shadows yang et al 2018 used the noise prediction strategy and two water indices mndwi and awei to eliminate such misclassified non water regions from sentinel 2 msi image although the water spectral indices can achieve good accuracy for extracting surface water areas however some above wsi methods are no longer practical in high resolution multispectral ms images due to insufficient spectral information various classification methods were developed to overcome the limitation of wsi methods in the optical high resolution images nath and deb 2010 the classification method based on feature extraction and machine learning is an advanced technique for surface water mapping rokni et al 2014 machine learning ml is also an effective method for extracting surface water bodies huang et al 2015 the decision tree model is used to extract surface water from the thematic mapper tm image fu et al 2008 the support vector machine svm is applied to produce flood mapping nandi et al 2017 an expert system is used to extract global surface water pekel et al 2016 however the above classification methods cannot mine high level features and semantic information lead to the performance extraction of surface water bodies is limited in recent years deep learning dl has shown effective and excellent feature learning ability where the two representative features are learnt end to end and hierarchically lecun et al 2015 convolutional neural networks cnn are popular deep learning method maggiori et al 2016 the cnn is widely used in many remote sensing image analyses such as semantic segmentation clouds detection and water bodies extraction and so on zhu et al 2017 chen et al 2014 wang et al 2018 various novel deep learning models have been developed for surface water bodies extraction on remote sensing data jiang et al 2018 isikdogan et al 2017 the self adaptive pooling sap cnn model is used to extract surface water bodies from superpixels chen et al 2018b feng et al 2018 exploited the combined application of deep u net and conditional random fields crf to extract surface water bodies from superpixels obtained by the simple linear iterative cluster slic method however the performance of the above cnn methods is too dependent on superpixels segmentation accuracy in addition owing to the stride convolution and pooling operations the cnn is applied directly to water body extraction leading to the blurring of water boundaries some water body extraction based 2d cnn methods cannot fully extract the joint spatial spectral correlations feature which can be critical for water body extraction yu et al 2017 miao et al 2018 duan and hu 2019 gebrehiwot et al 2019 in order to produce good water body extraction results based on limited spectral information more information such as multiscale semantic information should be taken into consideration to address the above mentioned issues a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn is proposed the overall method structure is divided into three parts which contains global spatial spectral convolution module multiscale learning module and boundary refinement module the proposed method enjoys the benefit from end to end ss cnn architecture and the performance of our method is not dependent on superpixel segmentation accuracy specifically the multiscale learning module is designed to mine water body semantic information from both global scope and local scope it is difficult to directly extract spatial spectral information from ms images in both the spatial and the spectral dimensions when the traditional 2d convolution is used in order to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously the global spatial spectral convolution gssc module is developed in addition a novel surface water body boundary refinement uwbbr module is adopted to improve water body extraction results the major works of this paper can be concluded as follows 1 we design a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe net architecture for more accurate water body extraction from optical high resolution multispectral imagery 2 global spatial spectral convolution module is developed to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously thereby further enhancing surface water body features 3 a novel multiscale learning module is designed which can extract the multiscale semantic information of surface water bodies 2 methodology in this section the proposed framework of surface water body extraction based on deep learning is described first the global spatial spectral convolution module is introduced to extract global spectral spatial information then the multiscale learning module is discussed which is used to multiscale semantic information from both global and local scopes finally the uwbbr module extraction layer and loss function are presented in detail the flowchart of the proposed method is shown in fig 2 2 1 global spatial spectral convolution module the cnn architecture often consists of alternatively stacked convolution layers followed by pooling layer hu et al 2015 the convolution layer produces new feature maps from previous feature maps and acts as multiple learnable filters in the input data sajjad et al 2018 according to the different spatial dimensions the convolution kernel can be mainly classified into three classes 1 one dimensional 1 d convolution kernel 2 two dimensional 2 d convolution kernels 3 three dimensional 3 d convolution kernels 1 d convolution kernels are used to extract 1 d features from input data krizhevsky et al 2012 2 d convolution kernel is one of the most frequently used operations in an image alshehhi et al 2017 recently 3d convolution layer is achieved to extract features from both the spatial and the spectral dimensions by convolving a 3d kernel at the remote sensing classification task li et al 2017 vetrivel et al 2018 the highly nonlinear semantic relationship between multispectral ms image bands indicates that higher level expression is essential for surface water body extraction although three dimensional convolutions can extract spatial features and spectral features simultaneously however this leads to an obvious increase in the number of parameters in every 3d convolution layer making this method more prone to overfitting karpathy et al 2014 to address the problems above in this work we decide to factorize 3d convolutions into 2d spatial convolutions and 1d spectral convolutions namely spatial spectral convolution if the spatial spectral convolutions are used leads to fewer parameters the proposed spatial spectral convolution operation is shown in fig 3 a in this study first we compute spatial feature maps gt for every band xs a pixel at position i j of the k th feature map is defined as follows 1 g tij k m 1 4 w spat k m x s m ij where m is the number of input ms image bands the operation symbol represents a convolution operation w spat k m represents the weight feature vector of the k th convolution kernel finally we compute across the spectral dimension for every position i j the 1d spectral convolution process is defined as follows 2 s sij k f n 1 n w spe kn g ij n s b k where n is the number of spatial feature maps b k is the bias vector f is the rectified linear units relu w spe is trainable parameters in this study the rectified linear units relu are applied to every layer the relu is defined as follows dahl et al 2013 3 relu x max 0 x a pooling operator is used to reduce parameters including average pooling and max pooling zou et al 2015 generally speaking a 3d max pooling mp layer follows each 3d cnn however if 3d max pooling is used leading to complex computation cost here we decide to factorize 3d max pooling into 2d spatial max pooling and 1d max pooling in this work in order to extract global spatial features and spectral features simultaneously global spatial spectral convolution module is designed as demonstrated in fig 3 b an input image is 512 512 4 consisting of four channels each with dimension 512 512 the first spatial spectral convolution layer of sizes is 256 256 followed by max pooling of sizes is 1 1 2 2 multiscale learning module multiscale contextual information is widely used in various segmentation tasks qi et al 2019 for water body extraction large region surface water bodies can conveniently be detected at low resolution score maps small size surface water bodies can be effectively detected from the high resolution score maps generally speaking large image patch to feed into cnn to gather more robust semantics information and a small image patch to get more precise location features therefore we can get more precise contextual information of different levels to extract surface water bodies multiscale contextual information is an important factor for more precise surface water mapping by the analysis above however the single cnn method cannot extract multiscale semantics information from input data inspired by fully cnn fcnn sherrah 2016 as a backbone to extract multiscale semantic features multiscale learning module is designed to extract semantic information of different levels as shown in fig 4 the proposed multiscale learning module which contains a sampling module multiscale features extraction module and feature fusion module in the sampling module input images preprocessing in order to get the input image of different levels we first up sample the original feature map by a factor of 2 via bilinear interpolation to get the input data of size 512 512 4 then we down sample the original images as the input data of size 128 128 4 finally the different size patches 512 512 4 256 256 4 and128 128 4 are inputted into the multiscale extraction module previous studies have shown that the smaller size convolutional kernels are used to exploit local features the larger size convolutional kernels are used to exploit global features gao et al 2019 ma et al 2019 here in the multiscale features extraction module in order to extract both low level spatial information and multiscale semantic information we set different sizes of the spatial spectral convolution kernel global contextual information has strong contexts but weak local spatial information whereas local spatial information has strong locations but weak contexts sun et al 2019 after the learning process of multiscale features extraction module the low level spatial information of combination images has been transformed into multiscale semantic information the multiscale learning module is used to generate multi scale semantic score maps three low resolution score maps for water body extraction firstly three low resolution score maps are fused by an elementwise summation operation then features of different levels are concatenated as the final output feature vector which is then reshaped into128 128 4 in the feature fusion module finally the new score map 256 256 4 is upsampled to the same size as the original input image in order to achieve better extraction accuracy of than the features extraction module with only multiscale semantic information the multiscale semantic and low level spatial features are applied simultaneously in the up sampling process combined with the extracted multiscale semantic information with low level spatial features the input image is detected into the water body and non water body in pixel level 2 3 surface water body boundary refinement module the trained ss cnn is used on a high resolution ms image for water body extraction however the ss cnn entails pooling and upsampling operations leading to the blurring of water body boundaries to preserve detailed surface water body boundaries conditional random field crf is usually adopted as a post processing step due to its good mathematical formation such as deep u net crf feng et al 2018 however the post processing strategy could be suboptimal in the mathematics inference process gao et al 2019 in our ss cnn we adopt a boundary refinement module peng et al 2017 to enhance surface water body boundaries as shown in fig 5 the uwbbr module is boundary regulation as a residual structure assuming that the r 1 is a coarse score map the refined score map r2 after

from the high resolution score maps from fig 11 c d we further find that the cnn superpixel and deep u net methods fail to solve the problem of separating adjacent surface water bodies the blurring of water boundaries in comparison with the above deep learning methods the proposed approach can well extract different types of surface water bodies and solve the problem of underestimation on a more complex scene the quantitative evaluation for fig 11 is shown in table 2 in addition underestimate water areas are calculated the high oa indicates the feasibility of the three deep learning methods and the newly proposed method however the water boundary accuracy is relatively lower in the cnn superpixel and deep u net methods the estimation of total surface water area has slight underestimation in the cnn superpixel the deep u ne and deep u net crf methods these result from omission errors due to the small water bodies are undetected from table 2 it can be seen that the proposed method has the best values in the oa kappa and underestimate water areas the above results show that the proposed method delivers more accurate water maps in the different types of surface water bodies 4 conclusions in this study we propose a novel refined water body extraction neural network wbe nn with a global spatial spectral convolution module a multiscale learning module and surface water body boundary refinement module this method aims to solve the overestimation problem shadows are misclassified as surface water bodies on the surface water mapping when using the high resolution multispectral image specifically global spatial spectral convolution module is designed to enhance surface water body features multiscale contextual information is a key factor for distinguishing between surface water bodies and shadows so a novel multiscale learning module is designed to extract multi scale contextual information the surface water body boundary refinement module is adopted to enhance surface water body boundaries thereby further boosting accuracy the proposed wbe net has two advantages i it extracts global spatial and spectral features simultaneously ii it exploits the low level spatial information of combination images has been transformed into multiscale semantic information and generates relatively detailed boundary score maps experimental results showed that the proposed method is robust and has an ability to accurately extract water bodies and solve the overestimation issue the proposed method reduces the commission errors in the precision surface water mapping using high spatial resolution images which benefits for global precision surface water mapping flooding dynamic monitoring and water resources management we will explore the possibility of the proposed method for different types of sensor images such as sentinel 2 and landsat in future work credit author statement yang chen is responsible for the research design experiments and analysis and

5357,for rainfall runoff modelling in the river reservoir integrated catchment command areas the use of the soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 is limited due to improper description of crop field dynamics in the model framework to model the dominant paddy field hydrology in most of the catchments in asian countries with tropical monsoon type climatology swat couples a pothole module in place of the conventional curve number cn approach although few pothole modules exist in the literature their conceptual frameworks have a number of calibration parameters which could generally increase the model uncertainty with the underestimation of high flows and overestimation of low flows to account for the physical dynamics of water transport in paddy fields in the rainfall runoff transformation process of a catchment this study advocates an enhanced pothole approach integrated with the swat considering the sub surface soil moisture movement under ponding and drying soil conditions evapotranspiration flux under alternate wetting and moisture stress conditions and contribution of irrigation return flow from the paddy fields subsequently the enhanced swat pothole approach swat ep was evaluated in the kangsabati river catchment reservoir command 12 014 70 km2 in the eastern india the results reveal that the proposed enhanced model performed the best as compared to the existing swat pothole approaches and the conventional swat cn approach in modeling the catchment response and evapotranspiration flux moreover the proposed approach is more parsimonious with 17 numbers of initial calibration parameters as compared to 25 parameters in the existing ones the performance evaluation measures and quantile regression based uncertainty analysis reveal that the proposed swat ep pothole model has the best performance in reproducing both the high and low flow estimates actual evapotranspiration as well as overall streamflow hydrodynamics with a scope of wider applicability in many world river catchments keywords catchment evapotranspiration pothole streamflow swat uncertainty analysis 1 introduction catchment scale assessment of streamflow under varying topographic land use and climatic conditions is an integral component of policy implementation for managing flood hazards ravazzani et al 2015 drought monitoring dash et al 2019 irrigation water application ramireddygari et al 2000 appraisal of environmental flow requirement dash et al 2020 and hydropower generation wu and chen 2013 rice being the staple food in most of the asian countries it plays a distinctive role in hydrological modeling as the paddy growing regions are affected by both natural factors precipitation evapotranspiration and percolation loss and anthropogenic factors irrigation fertilizer application and drainage hence this complex human ecosystem nexus necessitates for a thorough understanding of the intermediate processes while formulating a sustainable water resource management framework in paddy dominated catchments the catchment scale estimation of streamflow in paddy dominated agricultural watersheds is mostly carried out by the water balance approaches khepar et al 2000 or by the physically based approaches refsgaard and storm 1995 arnold et al 1998 however the simple water balance approaches with few calibration parameters generally fail to capture the complex dynamics of the typical paddy field hydrology in tropical monsoon type catchments to combat the effect of dry spells of monsoon rainfall on rice yield the paddy fields are encircled with dikes earthen bunds of 10 40 cm in height that results in significant percolation loss which in turn alters the saturated and un saturated sub surface zone hydrology sahoo et al 2018 swat is a popular semi distributed catchment scale hydrologic model that simulates the streamflow sediment yield and pollutant loads from non point sources under varying land use climate and management scenarios as compared to other existing catchment scale rainfall runoff models swat can add on multiple agricultural management practices of irrigation drainage fertilizer application tillage and pesticide applications and storage structures like ponds depression areas and reservoirs these add on modules in swat have evolved it to be used as a reliable tool for extensively modeling the rural watersheds worldwide gassman et al 2007 in most of the tropical asian countries and elsewhere the catchments are covered with paddy fields during both the rainy monsoon and dry non monsoon periods with prevalent alternate wetting and drying phases of soil the typical characteristics of the paddy fields with the presence of standing water and intermittent application of irrigation water and drainage during the growing period make the swat modeling more intricate with the development of an add on pothole module du et al 2005 the original pothole module in swat was advocated by du et al 2005 to model the streamflow generation from a cultivated landscape grown with corn soybean in which the whole catchment was conceptualized to be comprised of considerable number of potholes resulted due to reduced density of surface drainage networks the pothole module emphasized three basic hydrological processes tile flow under sub surface drainage condition water table fluctuation and the role of pothole topography on streamflow simulation for an integrated reservoir catchment scale application the conceptualization of significant water retention in the potholes configuring shape of the paddy fields has made the pothole module popular to be applied in paddy dominated agricultural watersheds kang et al 2006 boulange et al 2014 the pothole module in swat was revised to account for the evapotranspiration et loss during both the ponded and drainage soil conditions xie and cui 2011 however in this approach the non consideration of water stress condition during the drying phase could result in overestimation of the et values e g sahoo et al 2012 srivastava et al 2017 subsequently dechmi et al 2012 modified the existing swat by accounting for the excess infiltration in an intensively irrigated catchment in the existing swat pothole module as advocated by kang et al 2006 the daily percolation rate of water in the paddy fields under saturated condition is characterized by a soil texture specific constant value however this conceptualization completely ignores the soil moisture movement in the underlying sub surface layers under saturated conditions a coupled pcpf 1 swat was developed to estimate the catchment scale pesticide concentrations in the surface soil and streamflow in the paddy fields boulange et al 2014 this integrated application of swat could evaluate the effect of best management practices bmps on the total maximum daily pollutant loading in a paddy dominated watershed conversely sakaguchi et al 2014 pointed out the inadequacy in the pothole module developed by boulange et al 2014 for simulating the percolation and evaporation losses from the ponded water surface and significantly modified these loss estimation approaches however this revised simplified modeling framework proved futile in partitioning different flow components in the sub surface soil layers with a poor description of the paddy field hydrology for agricultural water management in the paddy fields during the crop growth phase ponding water depth is generally regulated frequently whereas in the conceptual potholes the impounded water depth varies in an uncontrolled manner the existing pothole module analyzes the impoundment depth for quantifying the evaporation loss and irrigation scheduling however the dynamics of water transport in the sub surface soil is completely ignored under these circumstances according to the cultivation practice the paddy fields are generally kept at the saturated condition to fulfill the crop water requirement leaching of salt in irrigation water and preventing weed growth jha et al 2017 although traditional rice cultivation practice in the tropical region is characterized by maintaining a fixed depth of ponding water in the field the concept of alternate wetting and drying awd has been emerged as a modern water saving practice in which the field is first made saturated for some days and kept dry for the next few days this practice not only reduces water consumption but also augment the rice yield significantly yang et al 2009 however in the awd approach the sub surface hydrology differs very much from that in the traditional rice cultivation practice by incorporating the method of awd in the revised hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model sahoo et al 2018 a realistic simulation of soil water content was obtained during the non ponding phase and subsequently the water balance components were estimated with a higher degree of accuracy in addition hydrological modeling studies are generally carried out at catchment scale for effective implementation of various river basin management strategies including flood control drought management irrigation application hydropower plants environmental flow assessment and climate change impact assessment conversely all the previous swat pothole based approaches are tested for field scale hydrological modeling lumping various hydrological flux components extension of these field scale approaches for catchment scale applications by adjusting the calibration parameters may not yield reliable results these discrepancies between the conceptualizations of the paddy fields and potholes foster a critical concern to opt for a proper simulation approach with the development of an enhanced swat pothole module depicting a realistic paddy field hydrology for catchment scale streamflow generation in light of the above discussion the specific limitations in the existing swat pothole module are i lack of alternate wetting and drying phenomenon resulting due to the irrigation practices in paddy fields ii improper quantification of evaporation from ponded water surface tsuchiya et al 2018 iii non consideration of the effect of excess irrigation water return flow in streamflow generation from the paddy fields and iv defining all the percolation and sub surface loss components from the paddy field by a single parameter reducing the flexibility of the pothole module addressing these limitations in the existing swat pothole modules could enhance its performance in streamflow modeling from paddy dominant agricultural watersheds therefore this study addresses the following research questions i since the existing swat pothole approaches have already been tested at field scale would they be equally applicable for catchment scale streamflow estimation in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed and ii how would the swat pothole model perform in simulating the catchment scale water balance components upon improvising the sub surface vadose zone dynamics in the existing pothole module consequently this study aims to develop a fully physically based parsimonious swat pothole model for conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics the specific objectives of this study are i to inter compare the existing variants of swat pothole approaches by du et al 2005 and sakaguchi et al 2014 and swat curve number cn for streamflow simulation in a paddy dominated catchment ii to develop a physically based parsimonious swat pothole module accounting for the sub surface soil moisture dynamics under awd scenario partitioning different surface and sub surface flow components dealing with a major limitation in the existing pothole approaches and iii to analyze the model uncertainty of the proposed and existing approaches 2 existing approaches of streamflow modeling in swat 2 1 curve number cn approach swat cn considering paddy land use in the hrus the popular in built cn based approach is also adopted in the literature for estimating streamflow from the agricultural watersheds mango et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 in the swat the rainfall runoff transformation process is modeled by the cn approach usda 1972 as 1 q surf p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 5 08 1000 cn 10 p 20 32 1000 cn 10 2 where qsurf is the depth of direct surface runoff mm day p is the depth of precipitation mm day and s is the maximum potential soil retention mm day and cn is the curve number that depends on the land use soil class land slope management practice and antecedent moisture condition of the soil 2 2 default pothole approach swat p in swat 2012 du et al 2005 the swat 2012 has the provision to assign multiple hrus as potholes and thereby adds more realistic conceptualization framework to the swat neitsch et al 2011 once the pothole is set to impound the water balance of the pothole is represented by du et al 2005 2 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the remaining volume of water in the pothole at the end of the day m3 vstored is

of precipitation over pothole in a given day m3 vevap is the water evaporated from the pothole m3 and vseep is the seepage loss from pothole m3 the pothole surface area is assumed to be conical and the time varying depth of water inside a pothole is characterized by the pothole surface area given by du et al 2005 3 sa π 10 4 3 v π s l o p e 2 3 where sa is the pothole surface area ha and slope is the hru slope m m the inflow to the pothole generally occurs from any hru inside a sub basin however the volume of inflow from the respective hrus are regulated by a pothole fraction factor pot fr and in case of the paddy fields the value of pot fr is set to 1 so that all the generated runoff directly flows into the potholes additionally the pothole gets a certain amount of inflow in the form of irrigation which is maintained by the management operation under this combined inflow scenario the volume of inflow is estimated by 4 v flowin i r r hru 1 n p o t f r 10 q surf h r u q gw h r u q

evapotranspiration of a particular hru mm vseep is the seepage loss from pothole m3 ksat is the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer in a given profile mm h sw is the daily soil water content of the profile mm and fc is the field capacity moisture content mm the outflow of water from pothole to the corresponding river reach occurs in three modes first when the current water depth exceeds the maximum volume of potholes spilling occurs in the form of overflow as 7 v flowout v v potmx i f v v potmx where vflowout is the water volume flowing out of the pothole m3 and vpotmx is the maximum volume of water retained in the pothole m3 during the crop growth period the paddy field is characterized by two critical water management phases of ponding and drainage fig 1 whenever water is applied to the paddy fields in the form of irrigation or rainfall ponding begins and subsequently impoundment status is set to active in the pothole module during the ponding phase percolation and evaporation processes dominate over other hydrological processes with no contribution of runoff from paddy field to the river conversely when the water release operation is scheduled due to crop management strategies the available volume of water inside the pothole drains outside of it additionally the presence of high water table in fields instigates the adoption of tile drainage and subsequently a significant amount of water is discharged outside of the pothole in the indian context out of these three circumstances the first two scenarios are mostly experienced for which the streamflow simulation is conceptualized accordingly in this study after simulating the individual process components of a pothole the volume of surface runoff that contributes to the corresponding downstream river reach is estimated using the water balance equation eq 7 2 3 revised swat pothole approach swat ps by sakaguchi et al 2014 to improve upon the existing pothole approach sakaguchi et al 2014 modified the percolation loss under saturated condition by calibrating the percolation rate in the range of 0 to 33 mm day at which the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is the maximum this maximum percolation rate is treated as the representative percolation loss from the study area under saturated condition the estimated revised potential percolation loss is used to quantify the seepage loss in the revised pothole module as sakaguchi et al 2014 8 v seep 10 p p s a i f v stored 10 p p s a v stored i f v stored 10 p p s a where pp is the potential percolation rate mm day as it is difficult to quantify the daily irrigation water requirement for the swat pothole module a fixed daily irrigation depth can be assumed accounting for the streamflow generated as a consequence of excess irrigation application as sakaguchi et al 2014 9 irr pot v potmx v stored i f v stored i r r v potmx i r r i f v stored i r r v potmx where irr pot daily depth of water added to the pothole mm irr volume of water added by irrigation in a day m3 and v stored initial volume of water stored in the pothole m3 the excess irrigation water attributed to the increased runoff contribution from the paddy field can be expressed as 10 q surf q surf normal v stored i r r v potmx 10 area hru i f v stored i r r v potmx q surf normal i f v stored i r r v potmx where q surf is the depth of daily surface runoff discharged from the hru to the main stream mm and q surf normal is the depth of daily surface runoff discharged from the hru to the main stream excluding the overflow from the pothole resulted from irrigation mm further the evaporation loss from the impounded water surface as simulated by the existing pothole approach is found to be continuously overestimated sakaguchi et al 2014 to deal with this situation sakaguchi et al 2014 suggested a reduced evaporation coefficient value of 0 6 as 11 v evap 0 6 10 1 lai lai evap e 0 s a i f l a i lai evap 0 i f l a i lai evap out of all the proposed modifications by sakaguchi et al 2014 only the effect of excess irrigation water on downstream streamflow simulation is found to be significant that improved the streamflow simulation however this proposed seepage calculation procedure lumps different flow components into a single entity without capturing the soil moisture dynamics under both excess and limited water availability conditions the introduced evaporation coefficient of 0 6 in eq 11 only reduces the net evaporation from the impoundment surface wherein the dynamics of evaporation under moisture stress condition remained unexplained to address these issues with the existing pothole modules the current study is motivated for developing an enhanced parsimonious swat pothole module as discussed in section 3 3 development of enhanced swat pothole module swat ep the enhanced pothole module models the paddy field dynamics fig 1 under awd condition comprising of the inflow outflow and sub surface soil moisture variation under irrigated field condition the framework of the swat ep module developed herein is illustrated in fig 2 the specific enhancements incorporated in the existing swat pothole module are described in the subsequent sub sections 3 1 revised estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the existing swat pothole approach du et al 2005 considers only the clay percentage to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first soil layer however in a real field the saturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the soil texture and bulk density therefore the estimation of k sat mm h can be revised in the enhanced model by the pedo transfer function ptf as indicated by jabro 1992 12 k sat 9 56 0 81 log p silt 1 09 log p clay 4 64 b d where p silt is the percentage of silt in the soil p clay is the percentage of clay in the soil and b d is the bulk density of the soil mg m3 note that eq 12 was derived by using 350 soil samples collected from different geographical locations all over the world for all types of soil categories to obtain the highest correlation coefficient between the measured k sat and the corresponding soil composition in the indian context only two ptfs have been developed to date for estimating the field capacity and wilting point water contents the ptf developed by adhikary et al 2008 is based on the concept of saxton et al 1986 and the study comprised of 1400 soil samples across india however the results of this study differ significantly from that of saxton et al 1986 in which relatively higher error was observed for the tropical regions such as the study area considered in this study further the proposed ptf by santra et al 2018 is only applicable to the arid western indian region and was not validated for other climatic conditions in india therefore these two ptfs are not used in this study to estimate the ksat 3 2 incorporation of percolation algorithm in all the existing pothole modules the percolation loss is treated as an explicit function of the available soil water content in the underlying soil layers however the percolation loss in a paddy field is governed by the saturated irrigated soil condition that varies significantly from the usual seepage phenomenon due to continuous irrigation application a plough pan layer is developed beneath the soil surface that affects the vertical movement of water significantly further due to pulverization in the puddled soil layer there is an increased porosity in soil that increases the soil water movement to incorporate these processes the existing percolation algorithm of pothole module can be modified as indicated by janssen et al 2010 13 v s e e p 240 k sat s a po t depth pu thick pl thick where v seep is the daily volume of water lost through the pothole bottom m3 po t depth is the depth of water on the impounded surface in a particular day mm pu thick is the puddled layer thickness mm and pl thick is the plough pan thickness mm furthermore the presence of standing water in the field results in a significant amount of seepage loss through the bunds in all the existing variants of the pothole module in swat the seepage loss through the bunds is considered to be negligible and is not accounted for the seepage calculation conversely the seepage loss through the bunds in the paddy field is considered as a function of ponding depth width of the bund and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bund following janssen et al 2010 14 q bund a 0 a 1 p o t depth a 2 w a 3 log 10 k bunds where q bund is the seepage loss through the bunds w is the width of the bund k bunds is the hydraulic conductivity of the bund and a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the coefficients of linear regression having values of 0 76 7 64 0 14 and 147 11 respectively therefore in the advocated swat ep module the total seepage loss from the paddy field is revised as following 15 v seep t o t a l v seep q bund 3 3 incorporation of deep percolation loss under awd scenario the water management schedule during different crop growth stages makes the dynamics of the paddy field quite different than the other crops as rice crop requires a significant depth of standing water during its growth generally farmers in most of the countries practice the surface flooding irrigation method for the paddy cultivation which is un economical and inefficient under limited water availability condition in such situation the awd approach is proven to be an advanced alternative worldwide the awd approach is characterized by three phases as detailed below 3 3 1 deep percolation during ponding phase during the ponding phase the paddy field is submerged with a pre defined depth of water so that the soil is at saturated state under such conditions the vertical water movement through layered soil can be modeled by a steady state one dimensional laplace equation polyanin 2002 that combines the continuity equation and darcy s law as following 16 z k sat φ z 0 where φ is the hydraulic head mm and z is the elevation head mm to estimate the value of φ at different soil layers eq 16 can be solved by a central finite difference scheme first the soil profile is discretized into different layers based on the lithology of the study area and subsequently the depth and saturated hydraulic conductivity of each layer is ascertained through the field observations further the problem domain is separated into multiple grid cells as 17 n d w t δ l where n is the number of soil layers dwt is the water table depth mm from the ground surface and δ l is the grid spacing mm the value of φ in eq 16 is estimated in each grid cell by defining the following boundary conditions the upper boundary condition is represented by the hydraulic head 18 φ 0 hp i 1 d w t where hp i 1 is the depth of ponding mm which varies with respect to change in rainfall and irrigation application the water table label is treated as the lower boundary condition since the pressure is atmospheric at the free water table surface the lower boundary condition is represented by 19 φ n 0 now substituting the boundary conditions the deep percolation loss below the root zone depth can be estimated using the darcy s law as 20 dp k n r z φ n r z 1 φ n r z δ l where dp is the deep percolation loss mm day k n r z is the hydraulic conductivity in the nrz th root zone node mm day φ n r z 1 is the hydraulic head at the n r z 1 th node above root zone mm and φ n r z is the hydraulic head at the root zone mm 3 3 2 deep percolation during drying phase in the awd approach generally there is gradual disappearance of ponded water from the field after two weeks from the day after transplanting dat bouman et al 2007 before the next irrigation application the field is kept completely dry for few days thereby prevailing the unsaturated sub surface condition of soil moisture convection to address this complex sub surface soil water transport dynamics of modeling the deep percolation loss during the drying phase the top 30 cm soil layer can be considered as hydraulically functional and subsequently divided into two compartments e g khepar et al 2000 so that the transpiration and evaporation losses are predominant in the top soil compartment l v 1 and in the bottom compartment l v 2 the deep percolation and transpiration losses in the form of root water uptake are prevalent the deep percolation flux dp can be estimated in discrete form by the darcy s law as 21 dp φ 1 φ 2 k avg θ l v where l v is the total depth of vadose zone soil layer mm and φ 1 and φ 2 are the hydraulic heads or total heads mm for l v 1 and l v 2 soil layers respectively mm given by 22 φ 1 ψ 1 z 1 23 φ 2 ψ 2 z 2 24 k avg θ k 1 θ k 2 θ 2 where k avg θ is the average of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for the l v 1 and l v 2 soil layers mm day and ψ 1 and ψ 2 are the suction heads in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments mm that can be estimated using the van genuchten mualem approach respectively as mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 25a ψ 1 1 α 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 m e 1 1 1 n p 1 25b ψ 2 1 α 2 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 m e 2 1 1 n p 2 where α 1 and α 2 are the inverse of air entry pressure for the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments mm 1 respectively θ 1 and θ 2 are the respective volumetric moisture contents in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 θ s 1 and θ s 2 are the corresponding volumetric saturated moisture contents in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 θ r 1 and θ r 2 are the volumetric residual moisture content in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 and n p 1 and n p 2 are the corresponding pore size distribution indices which are derived using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 accounting for the soil texture sand silt and clay and bulk density of individual soil layers table 1 m e 1 and m e 2 are the corresponding empirical parameters that can be estimated as a function of pore size distribution index as 26a m e 1 1 1 n p 1 26b m e 2 1 1 n p 2 during the initiation of the drying phase the saturated soil water in the two selected soil compartments get depleted by the plant root water uptake and evapotranspiration as 27 θ 1 i θ 1 i 1 l v 1 tp i 1 b z ep i 1 l v 1 28 θ 2 i θ 2 i 1 l v 2 tp i 1 b z dp i 1 l v 2 note that on the first day θ1 i 1 θ2 i 1 θs1 where tp i 1 and ep i 1 are the potential transpiration and evaporation losses during the previous day mm respectively i is the day index and b z is the plant water uptake function given by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 as 29 b z 1 667 l r z l 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l z l r z l l r l 0 2 l r 0 z l l r where l is the z coordinate of soil surface mm wherein bottom of the soil profile is located at z 0 and the soil surface is at z l and l r is the depth of root zone mm considering beer s law the potential evapotranspiration loss can be segregated into potential evaporation and transpiration separating the solar radiation component of the energy budget by the leaf area index lai derived canopy interception as ritchie 1972 30 t p et p 1 e k l a i 31 e p et p e k l a i where k is a constant that governs the radiation extent by plant canopy as a function of sun angle the actual transpiration rate from the underlying soil bears direct relation with the plant water uptake from the root zones as feddes et al 1974 32 t act r p b x where t act is the actual plant water uptake mm and r p is the potential water uptake rate mm that equals to t p under water abundant condition using the values of θ 1 and θ 2 from eqs 27 and 28 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k 1 θ and k 2 θ can be estimated as 33 k 1 θ k 1 s a t k r 1 34 k 2 θ k 2 s a t k r 2 where k r 1 and k r 2 are the relative unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions given by van genuchten 1980 as 35 k r 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 λ p 1 1 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 m c 1 m c 1 2 36 k r 2 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 λ p 2 1 1 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 m c 2 m c 2 2 where λ p 1 is the pore connectivity empirical parameter generally considered as 0 5 mualem 1976 bhadra et al 2013 moret fernández et al 2017 the values of the soil moisture content are updated for the next day by replacing the values of θ s 1 eq 27 with θ 1 to estimate the updated deep percolation flux using eq 21 3 4 enhancement in evapotranspiration algorithm the different phases of awd have a significant effect on evapotranspiration dynamics that vary significantly during the ponded and depletion phases in the existing pothole variants evapotranspiration is estimated as the single value function of the leaf area index lai however the available soil moisture condition plays a crucial role in quantifying the actual evapotranspiration et act loss during both the ponding and saturated phases et act can be computed as 37 et act k c pet day w h e n θ θ s where et act is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient for paddy and pet day is the reference evapotranspiration mm day as estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1994 during the drying phase with reduced soil water availability an inherent moisture stress condition is induced and the actual et is estimated as allen et al 1998 sahoo et al 2018 38 et act aw t rz d aw t aw r pet day w h e n θ r θ θ s where aw t is the total available moisture content in the root zone mm rz d is the root zone moisture depletion mm and aw r is the readily available moisture content in the crop root zone under unsaturated condition mm given by 39 aw r ρ aw t where ρ is the fraction of total available water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress ρ 0 2 allen et al 1998 the existing swat pothole module du et al 2005 is valid under the saturated soil condition as it computes et act as a unique function of lai depicting the evaporation from ponded water and transpiration from rice crop conversely in the proposed enhanced et sub routine the actual et is partitioned into soil evaporation crop transpiration and impounded water evaporation which could capture the sub surface soil water dynamics in a better way by appropriately distributing the seepage and percolation losses along the whole soil profile 3 5 incorporating return flow contribution to streamflow the return flow shows a delayed response towards the downstream streamflow generation process the return flow in paddy dominated catchments could be resulted from three sources surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater contribution moreover the usual magnitude of return

state is located in the eastern india and bounded in between the longitudes of 86 00 e and 87 30 e and latitudes of 22 20 n and 23 30 n fig 3 of the total basin area the river catchment is of 5735 22 km2 and the reservoir command is of 6279 48 km2 the kangsabati river originates in the uplands of the chhota nagpur plateau that has caused highly eroded and gullied undulated topography in the upper reaches where ephemeral 1st and 2nd order streams are dominant the basin elevation ranges from 2 656 m above mean sea level msl nearly 70 13 of the basin area constitutes the sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil classes paddy is the main crop grown in the cultivable land of the command area the krb experiences an average annual rainfall of 1348 mm year concentrated about 80 during the tropical monsoon season june october in this study the developed swat based models were applied for streamflow simulation separately at i the reservoir inflow location contributed by the upstream river catchment of 5735 22 km2 area characterized with mixed land uses and ii mohanpur outlet contributed by dominant paddy land uses in the command area 5568 km2 and downstream river catchment 711 48 km2 with mixed land uses wherein the releases from the kangsabati reservoir formed the upstream boundary for the swat pothole models 4 2 data sources the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem was used in this study to characterize the basin topography the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un developed soil map was procured from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 1 that contains two soil layer information from 0 to 30 cm and 30 100 cm depths the land use land cover lulc map of the basin was prepared by using the liss iii imageries procured from bhuvan indian space research organization isro http bhuvan nrsc gov in bhuvan links php the lulc map so generated for the krb constitutes sixteen distinct land use classes having the paddy field and forest as the two major classes the daily time series of observed weather data of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for the period 1981 to 2010 available at five weather stations were procured from the india meteorological department imd pune and agro meteorology department government of west bengal and are interpolated by the thiessen polygon method for input to the swat model since this study is focused only on the agricultural catchment consisting of paddy land use the use of imd gridded data product consisting of only precipitation and temperature may result in erroneous et estimation the observed daily time series of streamflow data available for the gauging stations located at the inflow to kangsabati reservoir simulia tusuma rangagora kharidwar and mohanpur outlet were collected from the central water commission cwc kolkata and irrigation and water ways department iwwd government of west bengal the reservoir surface area and storage volumes corresponding to the emergency spillway and principal spillway are 12 498 ha and 123 500 m3 and 11 101 ha and 98 186 m3 respectively the essential information related to crop growth viz crop calendar irrigation schedule irrigation efficiency and management practices were collected through field surveys from the local farmers the obtained information was processed under the management module of swat to mimic the real crop field dynamics in the model framework 4 3 configuring the paddy hrus the study was carried out by using the rev 637 of swat 2012 version this current version of swat has the advantage of defining more than one hru inside a single sub basin with paddy lulc with an improved model discretization first the entire paddy hrus were identified and set as potholes followed by proper parameterization of pothole module to ensure that the whole hru area drains into the paddy fields the value of pot fr was kept as 1 as per the field survey conducted in the study basin the rice cultivation period begins from the 1st week of june and lasts up to the 2nd week of october the irrigation is initiated on the 1st week of july and due to the lack of information on the depth of irrigation applied auto irrigation option was selected in the management module the impoundment status was set to on just after the initiation of irrigation with the two mid season drainages during the month of august and september finally the harvesting operation was scheduled to happen on the 10th october all these field management practices were incorporated into the model through the management module of swat 4 4 configuring model subroutines for incorporating the enhancements in the pothole module as discussed in section 3 the original fortran codes rev 637 of the swat pothole were modified using the intel visual fortran this program works on intel parallel studio xe 2018 cluster edition which is based on the intel visual studio platform version 2013 and subsequently the debugging and compilation was carried out to build the modified executables the original swat 2012 version is comprised of 302 sub routines in which each sub routine is meant to model a single multiple process component the proposed modifications were incorporated in the nine sub routines of the original swat 2012 version the modified ptf for the estimation of ks was updated in the estimate ksat f subroutine and subsequently the estimated ks was set to call in the readsol f sub routine further the quantification of deep percolation loss under the ponding and drying conditions were updated in the percmain f and pothole f sub routines the effect of moisture stress on the etact of paddy field as described in section 3 4 was updated in the pothole f sub routine since the chosen study area is having the paddy land use the introduction of moisture stress factor is limited to the pothole hrus and therefore the etact f subroutine was kept unrevised the contribution of irrigation return flow to the streamflow was included in the pothole f sub routine of the enhanced model the newly introduced variables for revision were updated in the modparm f and allocate parms f finally the revised hru specific water yield computation equation was updated in the hruday f90 and subbasin f sub routines once the individual sub routines got updated the main programme main f read all the inputs and called the linked subroutines to execute the subsequent modeling steps after successful compilation of all the sub routines the executables were built both in the release and debug modes the newly created executables were updated in the swat installation folder for subsequent model simulation 5 model evaluation 5 1 model calibration and validation since efficient model calibration depends on the expertise of the modeler to address the biasness it was decided to evaluate all the model variants using the auto calibration option of the swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters table 2 in reproducing the observed streamflow was carried out using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method consisting of 1000 simulation runs in the first iteration and 300 simulation runs in the subsequent iterations of swat cup for the three existing approaches i e swat cn swat p and swat ps the commonly used 25 calibration parameters were considered whereas in case of the swat ep contemplating the physical significance of the developed module eight parameters e g gw revap revapmn pot k evpot lat time irr sq epco and irr mx were excluded from the calibration process to contemplate the inter annual variability of weather variables and their response towards different hydrological flux components three years 1996 1998 of data was used for model warming up to limit the underlying uncertainties due to catchment initial condition followed by five years 1999 2003 of data for calibration and three years 2004 2006 of data for validation these calibrated values were updated inside the arc swat database with the suitable sql statements the model calibration and validation were carried out at two locations viz the inflow to kangsabati reservoir sub basin 4 attributing the effect of upstream rain fed non irrigated paddy fields and at the mohanpur outlet sub basin 39 attributing the impacts of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields the sub basin 4 corresponds to a headwater catchment which is deprived of the hydropeaking effect whereas the sub basin 39 integrates the hydropeaking effect with the command area dynamics the developed enhanced swat ep model was compared with the existing swat cn swat p and swat ps model variants in reproducing the observed streamflow response by using the popular performance measures of nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the acceptable ranges of these performance indicators are generally considered as nse 0 6 r2 0 6 and pbias 15 the degree of agreement between the observed and simulated streamflows by different swat pothole variants is graphically summarized by using the taylor diagram this diagram quantifies the efficiency e of individual approaches in terms of centered root mean square difference rmsd pearson correlation coefficient r and standard deviation σ signifying the amplitude of variation as follows 42 rmsd 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o 2 1 2 where n is the total number of observations s i is the simulated streamflow m3 s s is the mean of simulated streamflow m3 s and o i is the observed streamflow m3 s and o is the mean of observed streamflow m3 s given by 43 r 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o where r is the pearson correlation coefficient σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of the observed and simulated streamflows m3 s defined as 44 σ s 1 n i 1 n s i s 2 1 2 45 σ o 1 n i 1 n o i o 2 1 2 moreover flow duration curve fdc based analysis was carried out to visualize the qualitative model performance in simulating the high and low flows where 10 q10 and 90 q90 dependable flows were considered as the high and low flows respectively as nse is more sensitive to high flows they may not be able to evaluate the model performance in simulating the low flows appropriately hence logarithmic transformed nse log 10 n s e was used as an indicator to observe the degree of reproducibility between the observed and simulated low flows stoelzle et al 2014 46 log 10 n s e 1 1 n ln q s ε ln q o ε 2 1 n ln q o ε ln q o ε 2 where q s is the simulated streamflow m3 s q o is the observed streamflow m3 s q o is mean of

et al 2004 to examine the model performance the quantification of individual water balance components is of paramount importance due to the unavailability of information regarding the measured water balance fluxes such as percolation loss etact and baseflow only the satellite based 8 daily mod16a2 etact data https earthdata nasa gov was considered as the benchmark subsequently the performance of individual approaches in partitioning the hydrological fluxes was evaluated to estimate the mass conservation error mce 5 2 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty in the swat simulated streamflow can be attributed to the erroneous input data modeler s skill and model framework in this study the quantile regression qr based non parametric uncertainty analysis koenker and bassett 1978 koenker 2005 nanda et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020 was carried out in which different quantiles of a conditional distribution are estimated once the 90 confidence interval was constructed two widely used indices viz p factor and r factor were used to quantify the uncertainty the p factor represents the fraction of the observed data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu band that ranges from 0 to 1 wherein 1 corresponds to 100 subsumption of the observed data expressed as 47 p n 95 n total where n 95 is the number of data points bracketed inside the 95 ppu band n total is the total data points including the error term 1 p represents the residual error of the observed data alternatively the r factor indicates the ratio of the average width of the 95 ppu band to the standard deviation of the observed data r 1 5 being the accepted value in streamflow simulation e g abbaspour et al 2004 a balance must be maintained between the satisfactory ranges of these two factors during the calibration process of individual iterations the iteration that corresponds to the optimum value of p factor and r factor was considered as the final and the respective parameter values were regarded as the fitted calibration parameters 6 results and discussion 6 1 performances of different swat pothole model variants in reproducing observed streamflow time series the reproduction capability of the observed streamflow hydrographs by all the swat pothole variants is illustrated in figs 4 7 which show that the peak and recession limbs are best reproduced by the swat ep model followed by swat ps swat p and swat cn the streamflow peaks mostly underpredicted by the existing model variants as shown in table 3 the nse estimates varied in the range of 0 77 0 89 0 41 0 66 0 49 0 65 and 0 51 0 71 for the swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps variants at both the reservoir inflow and catchment command area outlet locations respectively these results reveal the improved performance of the proposed swat ep approach over the three existing approaches for catchment scale streamflow estimation as seen in figs 4 5 and table 3 during the calibration and validation phases of all the models at reservoir inflow location contributed by an upstream catchment area with about 11 paddy land use the performance among all the four approaches considered herein ranged from nse 0 59 swat p to nse 0 84 swat ep conversely as compared to the swat cn variant with a lower nse estimate of 0 41 table 3 the improvement in the nse estimate 0 87 by the swat ep variant was appreciable in simulating the streamflow at the mohanpur outlet gauging station contributed by the catchment command area with considerable paddy land use of 62 fig 6 similarly during validation the performance of the swat ep approach was the best with nse 0 89 followed by the lower estimates by the swat ps nse 0 51 swat p nse 0 49 and swat cn nse 0 46 models moreover the swat ep approach performed the best with the r2 measure during both calibration and validation at the mohanpur outlet followed by the swat cn swat p and swat ps models the relatively poor performance of the existing three swat based approaches in the selected area revealed their inadequacy in conceptualizing the integrated catchment command dynamics as highlighted in section 3 the potential to simulate the peak and low streamflows also defines the true catchment scale applicability of a hydrological model hence the performances of swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps were evaluated in simulating the peak as well as low flows at two gauging locations with varied lulc scenarios the observed peak reservoir inflows of 1748 m3 s 1118 m3 s 864 m3 s and 820 m3 s occurred from 1 1 1999 1 3 1999 10 20 2005 and 9 23 2006 were evaluated against the simulated peaks by all the swat pothole model variants and the swat ep was found to be in good agreement with the observed ones characterized by the lowest pbias estimate of 0 4 at the mohanpur outlet the swat ep also performed very well in reproducing the peak flows of magnitude 2219 m3 s 2101 m3 s and 2061 m3 s that occurred from 9 25 1999 9 27 1999 and 8 7 1999 it can be envisaged from fig 8 that out of 1826 number of reservoir inflow data points 91 of data points were over or underestimated by 10 by the swat ep whereas in case of the swat cn swat p and swat ps variants only 61 68 and 72 of data points were over or underestimated by 10 respectively most of the swat ep simulated streamflows were found to be concentrated along the 1 1 line depicting an improved performance of the proposed approach in quantifying the runoff generation from paddy fields it can be clearly seen from figs 8 and 9 that the observed low flow q90 regimes are very well reproduced by almost all the model variants however except the swat ep model the other variants failed to reproduce the observed median flow q50 and high flow q10 regimes it can be surmised from the fig 9a that the high reservoir inflows up to the exceedance probability of 35 were constantly overestimated by the swat ps and swat cn however in the case of swat p the low flows were overestimated by a magnitude of about 30 m3 s which could be attributed to the non consideration of irrigation return flows in the modeling framework the swat ep was found to be the best in reproducing the observed streamflows except from 9 12 1999 and 10 19 1999 events which may be attributed to instantaneous high rainfall over the catchment generating high return flow from the paddy fields in the command area conversely at mohanpur outlet representing the dynamics of command area the peak flows up to 10 exceedance probability in fig 9b were significantly overestimated by the swat p and thereby indicating the structural limitations in the original swat pothole variant similarly the 10 to 40 dependable flows depicting the medium flows were almost overestimated by order of 20 by the swat cn approach whereas this overestimation in case of the swat p and swat ps were from 16 to 21 conversely for mohanpur outlet slight underestimation was noticed in the range of 55 to 75 dependable flows by all the swat pothole variants the low streamflows at the reservoir inflow location characterized by 90 exceedance probability level were best reproduced by the swat ep with log 10 n s e of 0 81 as compared to the swat cn log 10 n s e 0 52 swat p log 10 n s e 0 45 and swat ps log 10 n s e 0 59 variants similarly at the mohanpur outlet the existing swat pothole model variant continuously underestimated the low flows whereas the swat ep best reproduced the low flows with log 10 n s e 0 72 overall the performance of the different variants of the swat pothole model for streamflow simulation in the integrated reservoir command was of the order swat p swat cn swat ps swat ep which proclaim an enhanced and flexible application of the proposed approach in paddy as well as non paddy dominant catchments with lesser number of calibration parameters the rmsd standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient estimates by the four swat pothole variants during the calibration and validation are illustrated in the taylor diagram fig 10 the swat ep model resulted in the lowest rmsd estimates that ranged from 32 25 44 36 m3 s and 41 57 52 39 m3 s at the reservoir inflow and mohanpur gauging stations respectively for reservoir inflow simulation by the swat cn model the rmsd value was estimated as 62 34 m3 s whereas it was the maximum 122 25 m3 s at the mohanpur outlet reflecting the relative inability of this approach in modeling the effect of paddy land uses similarly at the mohanpur outlet the swat ps model estimated a relatively lower rmse value of 84 72 m3 s during the validation period the standard deviation estimates by the swat ep model was in the range of 41 32 46 32 m3 s at the mohanpur outlet that revealed the enhanced capability of the proposed approach encompassing the observed low to high flows the model performance results presented in table 3 revealed that overall the swat ep model performed the best with acceptable accuracy whereas the existing swat pothole model variants performed poorly in simulating streamflow from an integrated catchment command area with dominant paddy land use this could be attributed to the crude conceptualization of the paddy field hydrology in the existing approaches without considering the alternate wetting and drying phenomena of the sub surface vadose zone the significant underestimation of peak flows by the existing approaches could be due to their failure in capturing the streamflow generated from the paddy fields forced with instantaneous high rainfall furthermore the assumption of constant percolation rate in paddy fields in the swat ps model sakaguchi et al 2014 might incurred more infiltration loss in the paddy fields and subsequently underestimated the low flows to a greater extent conversely the concept of drying and ponding phases introduced in the proposed swat ep approach enhanced the baseflow estimation contributing to the streamflow generation thereby increased the model accuracy 6 2 assessment of predictive uncertainty of different swat pothole approaches the qr based uncertainty assessment was carried out to evaluate all the swat pothole model variants in terms of confidence intervals ci defined based on the estimated quantiles β 0 05 0 95 the model performance was evaluated as the percentage of observed dataset bracketed inside the 90 ci band the average thickness of 90 ci was computed as 84 35 m3 s 126 32 m3 s 163 97 m3 s and 143 74 m3 s for the swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps variants during the validation period for reservoir inflow simulation respectively revealing an enhanced performance of the proposed approach in a non paddy dominated area fig 11 further for the swat ep model the p factor of 0 82 which corresponds to 82 of the observed streamflow bracketed inside the 90 ci band was significantly higher than that of the existing approaches the r factor of 0 69 in the swat ep indicates a relatively narrow uncertainty band which is also confirmed from the qr based analysis as illustrated in fig 12 for the paddy dominated command area the average thickness of the 90 ci bands for the swat ep model was 72 53 m3 s which were 209 32 m3 s 189 62 m3 s and 123 27 m3 s for the swat cn swat p and swat ps models respectively from fig 12 it can be surmised that for streamflow simulation at the reservoir inflow location with mixed land use the predictive uncertainties were reduced in the order swat p swat ps swat cn swat ep whereas at the mohanpur outlet with dominant paddy land use the corresponding order was swat cn swat p swat ps swat ep this reveals that the proposed swat ep model with improved vadose zone process components could represent the catchment dynamics in a better way as compared to the existing swat based approaches irrespective of the lulc conditions in the catchment further the initial number of model parameters for calibration in the swat cn swat p and swat ps were 25 which were significantly reduced to 17 in the proposed swat ep model in the existing model frameworks many of the complex hydrological processes were parameterized using simple empirical coefficients increasing the number of model parameters however in the proposed swat ep model framework the process dynamics of deep percolation loss evapotranspiration under moisture stress condition and partitioning of evaporation and transpiration components are replaced with the process based equations with reduced number of calibration parameters making the proposed model more parsimonious than the existing ones furthermore lowering the number of calibration parameters reduced the possibility of equifinality problem in auto calibration thereby reduced the model structural uncertainty to a greater extent 6 3 performance of swat pothole model variants in estimating water balance components in the command area enclosed with the downstream location of the reservoir and the mohanpur outlet the daily scale reservoir release is the only upstream flow contribution along with the rainfall and irrigation inputs the surface runoff actual crop evapotranspiration soil moisture storage deep percolation loss and baseflow are the outflow water balance components in the swat framework fig 13 illustrates the reproduction of the 8 daily observed mod16a2 satellite based etact estimates by the different swat pothole approaches it can be envisaged from fig 13 that the swat p and swat cn approaches mostly overestimated the etact whereas the swat ps and swat ep reproduced the observed high etact values closely during the low etact periods the swat ps either underestimated or overestimated the mod16a2 values the swat ep reproduced the 8 daily etact with a high nse estimate of 0 85 whereas the swat cn swat p and swat ps performed poorly in these conditions as evidenced from the nse estimate of 0 05 0 22 and 0 42 respectively in terms of the rmse measure among all the models the lowest rmse estimate of 0 41 mm day by the swat ep shows that this model outperformed all the existing approaches moreover during the rabi season november february relatively lower rmse was observed by the swat ep and swat ps approaches in reproducing the etact whereas the swat p and swat cn approaches performed with a higher rmse estimate during both the kharif june october and rabi seasons the high pbias 22 estimates in the etact by the swat cn and swat p variants may be attributed to the absence of irrigation return flow conceptualization in these approaches table 4 shows the swat pothole estimated annual average water balance components during 2001 2005 in the reservoir command as envisaged from table 4 during 2001 2005 out of the total 2216 23 202 23 mm year 100 of water applied in terms of precipitation and irrigation in the downstream catchment command area all the models almost partitioned it into surface runoff sro etact soil moisture storage sms deep percolation dp and baseflow bf with an acceptable mce of 5 1 34 although the swat ep was the best with mce 2 5 02 it can be seen in table 4 that with respect to the observed sro the swat ep simulated this flux very closely with 3 33 4 48 error followed by the swat ps 8 29 3 31 swat cn 9 05 2 63 and swat p 10 51 1 98 approaches similarly with respect to the 25 42 of observed mod16a2 etact flux of the water balance the swat ep simulated it the best with 1 20 0 74 error followed by swat ps 2 68 1 45 swat cn 6 05 1 99 and swat p 6 98 1 98 approaches since no observed information was available for the other partitioned fluxes only a comparative assessment was carried out among the models in simulating these fluxes table 4 shows that the deep percolation loss was the highest in case of the swat ps model followed by the swat p swat ep and swat cn models and the baseflow was the highest in case of the swat p approach followed by swat cn swat ps and swat ep models a close comparison of these results with fig 9 revealed that the low flows were always overpredicted by the swat p approach due to the highest baseflow contribution followed by the swat cn model without following the pattern of the observed baseflow although the swat ps and swat ep approaches almost well reproduced the observed baseflow the simulated et act dp loss was the highest by the swat p 48 77 followed by the swat ps 47 50 swat cn 45 98 and swat ep 42 16 the lowest et act dp loss estimated by the swat ep model led to increased surface runoff generation with a better reproduction of streamflow peaks however this correlation is difficult to establish in other models which may be attributed to the improper process description of the vadose zone dynamics and et act under water stressed conditions leading to undesirable pattern in the streamflow peaks in case of the swat ep model the exclusive process description of percolation loss under ponding and drying phases could have captured the sub surface catchment dynamics in a better manner to estimate the actual dp loss moreover in the swat ps model defining the potential percolation rate factor as an empirical parameter could have resulted in the highest deep percolation loss reducing the surface runoff at the mohanpur outlet it can be envisaged from figs 6 and 7 that the observed baseflow recession is very fast in case of the mohanpur outlet which was very well reproduced by the swat ep model consistently whereas the other models either partially failed swat ps and swat p or fully failed swat cn to capture this pattern the highest baseflow contribution in case of the swat p could have been favoured by the partitioned lower deep percolation loss the simple volumetric model conceptualization in the original pothole approach could have added more error in estimating the sub surface water balance components of percolation loss and baseflow leading to poor performance in estimating the surface runoff in the command area as a proof of the concept in the pothole module of xie and cui 2011 the auto irrigation is initiated using the concept of three critical water depths i e minimum and maximum fitting depths and the maximum ponding depth inside the pothole as suggested by guo et al 1997 which were kept as constant global parameters in the model despite of the soil and agro climatology of the region the real time irrigation was triggered when ponding water level dropped below the minimum critical depth and continued till it reached the maximum fitting depth without accounting for actual crop water stress resulting in significant overestimation of etact similarly the oversimplified estimation of vertical percolation loss and lateral seepage through embankments by a calibration parameter namely the potential percolation rate in the swat ps resulted in substantial overestimation and underestimation in the water balance components as far as the water management in paddy field is concerned the realistic estimation of intermediate hydrological fluxes associated with paddy growth is of paramount importance the existing swat pothole variants overestimated the etact in the range of 2 68 1 45 to 6 98 1 98 which may be attributed to the absence of soil moisture stress coefficient and physically based vadose zone dynamics in these frameworks conversely the proposed swat ep variant with the awd feature could estimate etact with the minimum overestimation of 1 20 0 74 table 4 and a substantially reduced rmse of 0 41 mm day however as envisaged in fig 13 the mismatch between the observed and swat ep simulated etact is relatively higher during the rabi season characterized by high moisture stress as compared to that during the kharif season characterized by low moisture stress this shows that there is a scope to improve the etact estimates further during the severe moisture stress periods since the available soil water content and etact play crucial role in the irrigation scheduling and quantification of irrigation water requirement the proposed swat ep would act as a decision making tool for the water managers while planning sustainable paddy cultivation moreover the improved vadose zone conceptualization would be helpful in modeling the nutrient transport in the sub surface waters to address the adverse impacts of excessive fertilizer application therefore reliable estimation of individual water balance components at varying temporal scales would lead to accurate estimation of irrigation water requirement across different growth phases of paddy for enhanced crop yield with optimum irrigation application considering awd however the proposed model may not perform satisfactorily in the wetlands due to the absence of the phenomena of drying phase et under moisture stress condition and return flow in the wetland hydrology as envisaged in figs 4 7 reproduction of the recession limbs is well imitated by the swat ep although the peak flows are still consistently underestimated this could be attributed to the lumped conceptualization of potholes in swat resulting in varying storage capacities in the catchment with consistent underestimation of the peak flows this necessitates for a more dynamic representation of the pothole depressions as a future work the comparative results of this study are based on a single catchment command area therefore follow up studies could include the evaluation of this approach in other catchment commands with varying climatic and soil conditions moreover the assumption of uniform distribution of irrigation water to the individual paddy hru irrespective of the crop growth stage limits the dynamics of water balance hence this necessitates for considering the growth stage specific water distribution to distinct paddy hrus in the subsequent swat pothole revisions incorporation of these modifications in the future could transform the swat pothole into a compact agro hydrological model that can conceptualize both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the paddy field hydrology in the catchment scale applications in the existing swat pothole variants the water balance components of etact and percolation losses in the paddy field are estimated as arbitrary fractions of pet and precipitation respectively which are far from reality conversely in the proposed fully physically based pothole approach in the swat ep model etact is estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith equation using both the energy budget and mass transfer principle accounting for the soil moisture stress similarly the deep percolation losses in the paddy field during the drying and ponding phases are estimated by the physically based darcy s equation consequently the remaining water balance components such as the soil moisture storage and baseflow are estimated to be more close to the observations 7 conclusions for integrated water resources management the hydrological flux components need to be estimated accurately from paddy dominated catchments in this context a novel physically based swat enhanced pothole module swat ep was advocated in this study to simulate the streamflow generation in such type of catchments addressing the inconsistent hydrological process descriptions in the existing approaches the proposed swat ep was evaluated in a real reservoir catchment command for daily streamflow simulation under alternate wetting and drying conditions the results reveal that the swat ep model outperformed all the existing swat pothole variants with the following improved features i pedo transfer function based estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity to represent the soil hydraulic parameter in the paddy fields ii process dynamics of soil water movement under both ponding and drying phases of vadose zone representing alternate wetting and drying conditions of irrigation application iii reduced evapotranspiration flux under soil moisture deficit condition and iv role of irrigation return flow in streamflow simulation process the specific conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the inclusion of added physical process dynamics in the swat ep model made the model more parsimonious with 17 calibration parameters than the existing swat pothole approach with 25 model parameters this could reduce the predictive uncertainty significantly in the proposed swat ep approach 2 under both the irrigated and non irrigated catchment conditions with or without significant paddy land uses the streamflow estimation efficiency increased in the order swat p swat cn swat ps swat ep revealing that the proposed swat ep model is the best approach the swat ep approach is also more consistent in reproducing the observed high and low flows with the baseflow recession curves 3 the water balance analysis revealed that the developed swat ep approach simulated the water balance components more precisely than the existing approaches which is consistent with the rainfall runoff transformation dynamics the existing swat p approach always overestimated the et act due to the definition of et act as the unique function of leaf area index ignoring the deficit soil moisture condition moreover the improved performance of swat ep nse 0 85 over swat p nse 0 22 in reproducing the daily scale et act could be suitably utilized for irrigation planning in the command area since swat cn is not capable of conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics under awd condition it should not be used for the estimation of water balance components in paddy dominated catchments 4 the swat ep exhibits least predictive uncertainty in streamflow simulation under both the rainfed and irrigated catchment conditions with higher p factor 0 76 0 81 and lower r factor 0 51 0 53 the quantile regression based uncertainty analysis revealed that the uncertainty is higher in the case of irrigated paddy fields than the rainfed paddy fields the enhanced modeling approach of the swat ep could have the potential benefits to various studies

5357,for rainfall runoff modelling in the river reservoir integrated catchment command areas the use of the soil and water assessment tool swat 2012 is limited due to improper description of crop field dynamics in the model framework to model the dominant paddy field hydrology in most of the catchments in asian countries with tropical monsoon type climatology swat couples a pothole module in place of the conventional curve number cn approach although few pothole modules exist in the literature their conceptual frameworks have a number of calibration parameters which could generally increase the model uncertainty with the underestimation of high flows and overestimation of low flows to account for the physical dynamics of water transport in paddy fields in the rainfall runoff transformation process of a catchment this study advocates an enhanced pothole approach integrated with the swat considering the sub surface soil moisture movement under ponding and drying soil conditions evapotranspiration flux under alternate wetting and moisture stress conditions and contribution of irrigation return flow from the paddy fields subsequently the enhanced swat pothole approach swat ep was evaluated in the kangsabati river catchment reservoir command 12 014 70 km2 in the eastern india the results reveal that the proposed enhanced model performed the best as compared to the existing swat pothole approaches and the conventional swat cn approach in modeling the catchment response and evapotranspiration flux moreover the proposed approach is more parsimonious with 17 numbers of initial calibration parameters as compared to 25 parameters in the existing ones the performance evaluation measures and quantile regression based uncertainty analysis reveal that the proposed swat ep pothole model has the best performance in reproducing both the high and low flow estimates actual evapotranspiration as well as overall streamflow hydrodynamics with a scope of wider applicability in many world river catchments keywords catchment evapotranspiration pothole streamflow swat uncertainty analysis 1 introduction catchment scale assessment of streamflow under varying topographic land use and climatic conditions is an integral component of policy implementation for managing flood hazards ravazzani et al 2015 drought monitoring dash et al 2019 irrigation water application ramireddygari et al 2000 appraisal of environmental flow requirement dash et al 2020 and hydropower generation wu and chen 2013 rice being the staple food in most of the asian countries it plays a distinctive role in hydrological modeling as the paddy growing regions are affected by both natural factors precipitation evapotranspiration and percolation loss and anthropogenic factors irrigation fertilizer application and drainage hence this complex human ecosystem nexus necessitates for a thorough understanding of the intermediate processes while formulating a sustainable water resource management framework in paddy dominated catchments the catchment scale estimation of streamflow in paddy dominated agricultural watersheds is mostly carried out by the water balance approaches khepar et al 2000 or by the physically based approaches refsgaard and storm 1995 arnold et al 1998 however the simple water balance approaches with few calibration parameters generally fail to capture the complex dynamics of the typical paddy field hydrology in tropical monsoon type catchments to combat the effect of dry spells of monsoon rainfall on rice yield the paddy fields are encircled with dikes earthen bunds of 10 40 cm in height that results in significant percolation loss which in turn alters the saturated and un saturated sub surface zone hydrology sahoo et al 2018 swat is a popular semi distributed catchment scale hydrologic model that simulates the streamflow sediment yield and pollutant loads from non point sources under varying land use climate and management scenarios as compared to other existing catchment scale rainfall runoff models swat can add on multiple agricultural management practices of irrigation drainage fertilizer application tillage and pesticide applications and storage structures like ponds depression areas and reservoirs these add on modules in swat have evolved it to be used as a reliable tool for extensively modeling the rural watersheds worldwide gassman et al 2007 in most of the tropical asian countries and elsewhere the catchments are covered with paddy fields during both the rainy monsoon and dry non monsoon periods with prevalent alternate wetting and drying phases of soil the typical characteristics of the paddy fields with the presence of standing water and intermittent application of irrigation water and drainage during the growing period make the swat modeling more intricate with the development of an add on pothole module du et al 2005 the original pothole module in swat was advocated by du et al 2005 to model the streamflow generation from a cultivated landscape grown with corn soybean in which the whole catchment was conceptualized to be comprised of considerable number of potholes resulted due to reduced density of surface drainage networks the pothole module emphasized three basic hydrological processes tile flow under sub surface drainage condition water table fluctuation and the role of pothole topography on streamflow simulation for an integrated reservoir catchment scale application the conceptualization of significant water retention in the potholes configuring shape of the paddy fields has made the pothole module popular to be applied in paddy dominated agricultural watersheds kang et al 2006 boulange et al 2014 the pothole module in swat was revised to account for the evapotranspiration et loss during both the ponded and drainage soil conditions xie and cui 2011 however in this approach the non consideration of water stress condition during the drying phase could result in overestimation of the et values e g sahoo et al 2012 srivastava et al 2017 subsequently dechmi et al 2012 modified the existing swat by accounting for the excess infiltration in an intensively irrigated catchment in the existing swat pothole module as advocated by kang et al 2006 the daily percolation rate of water in the paddy fields under saturated condition is characterized by a soil texture specific constant value however this conceptualization completely ignores the soil moisture movement in the underlying sub surface layers under saturated conditions a coupled pcpf 1 swat was developed to estimate the catchment scale pesticide concentrations in the surface soil and streamflow in the paddy fields boulange et al 2014 this integrated application of swat could evaluate the effect of best management practices bmps on the total maximum daily pollutant loading in a paddy dominated watershed conversely sakaguchi et al 2014 pointed out the inadequacy in the pothole module developed by boulange et al 2014 for simulating the percolation and evaporation losses from the ponded water surface and significantly modified these loss estimation approaches however this revised simplified modeling framework proved futile in partitioning different flow components in the sub surface soil layers with a poor description of the paddy field hydrology for agricultural water management in the paddy fields during the crop growth phase ponding water depth is generally regulated frequently whereas in the conceptual potholes the impounded water depth varies in an uncontrolled manner the existing pothole module analyzes the impoundment depth for quantifying the evaporation loss and irrigation scheduling however the dynamics of water transport in the sub surface soil is completely ignored under these circumstances according to the cultivation practice the paddy fields are generally kept at the saturated condition to fulfill the crop water requirement leaching of salt in irrigation water and preventing weed growth jha et al 2017 although traditional rice cultivation practice in the tropical region is characterized by maintaining a fixed depth of ponding water in the field the concept of alternate wetting and drying awd has been emerged as a modern water saving practice in which the field is first made saturated for some days and kept dry for the next few days this practice not only reduces water consumption but also augment the rice yield significantly yang et al 2009 however in the awd approach the sub surface hydrology differs very much from that in the traditional rice cultivation practice by incorporating the method of awd in the revised hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model sahoo et al 2018 a realistic simulation of soil water content was obtained during the non ponding phase and subsequently the water balance components were estimated with a higher degree of accuracy in addition hydrological modeling studies are generally carried out at catchment scale for effective implementation of various river basin management strategies including flood control drought management irrigation application hydropower plants environmental flow assessment and climate change impact assessment conversely all the previous swat pothole based approaches are tested for field scale hydrological modeling lumping various hydrological flux components extension of these field scale approaches for catchment scale applications by adjusting the calibration parameters may not yield reliable results these discrepancies between the conceptualizations of the paddy fields and potholes foster a critical concern to opt for a proper simulation approach with the development of an enhanced swat pothole module depicting a realistic paddy field hydrology for catchment scale streamflow generation in light of the above discussion the specific limitations in the existing swat pothole module are i lack of alternate wetting and drying phenomenon resulting due to the irrigation practices in paddy fields ii improper quantification of evaporation from ponded water surface tsuchiya et al 2018 iii non consideration of the effect of excess irrigation water return flow in streamflow generation from the paddy fields and iv defining all the percolation and sub surface loss components from the paddy field by a single parameter reducing the flexibility of the pothole module addressing these limitations in the existing swat pothole modules could enhance its performance in streamflow modeling from paddy dominant agricultural watersheds therefore this study addresses the following research questions i since the existing swat pothole approaches have already been tested at field scale would they be equally applicable for catchment scale streamflow estimation in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed and ii how would the swat pothole model perform in simulating the catchment scale water balance components upon improvising the sub surface vadose zone dynamics in the existing pothole module consequently this study aims to develop a fully physically based parsimonious swat pothole model for conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics the specific objectives of this study are i to inter compare the existing variants of swat pothole approaches by du et al 2005 and sakaguchi et al 2014 and swat curve number cn for streamflow simulation in a paddy dominated catchment ii to develop a physically based parsimonious swat pothole module accounting for the sub surface soil moisture dynamics under awd scenario partitioning different surface and sub surface flow components dealing with a major limitation in the existing pothole approaches and iii to analyze the model uncertainty of the proposed and existing approaches 2 existing approaches of streamflow modeling in swat 2 1 curve number cn approach swat cn considering paddy land use in the hrus the popular in built cn based approach is also adopted in the literature for estimating streamflow from the agricultural watersheds mango et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 in the swat the rainfall runoff transformation process is modeled by the cn approach usda 1972 as 1 q surf p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p 5 08 1000 cn 10 p 20 32 1000 cn 10 2 where qsurf is the depth of direct surface runoff mm day p is the depth of precipitation mm day and s is the maximum potential soil retention mm day and cn is the curve number that depends on the land use soil class land slope management practice and antecedent moisture condition of the soil 2 2 default pothole approach swat p in swat 2012 du et al 2005 the swat 2012 has the provision to assign multiple hrus as potholes and thereby adds more realistic conceptualization framework to the swat neitsch et al 2011 once the pothole is set to impound the water balance of the pothole is represented by du et al 2005 2 v v stored v flowin v flowout v pcp v evap v seep where v is the remaining volume of water in the pothole at the end of the day m3 vstored is the stored water volume in the pothole at the starting of the day m3 vflowin is the volume of water entering to the pothole m3 vflowout is the volume of outflow from the pothole m3 vpcp is the amount of precipitation over pothole in a given day m3 vevap is the water evaporated from the pothole m3 and vseep is the seepage loss from pothole m3 the pothole surface area is assumed to be conical and the time varying depth of water inside a pothole is characterized by the pothole surface area given by du et al 2005 3 sa π 10 4 3 v π s l o p e 2 3 where sa is the pothole surface area ha and slope is the hru slope m m the inflow to the pothole generally occurs from any hru inside a sub basin however the volume of inflow from the respective hrus are regulated by a pothole fraction factor pot fr and in case of the paddy fields the value of pot fr is set to 1 so that all the generated runoff directly flows into the potholes additionally the pothole gets a certain amount of inflow in the form of irrigation which is maintained by the management operation under this combined inflow scenario the volume of inflow is estimated by 4 v flowin i r r hru 1 n p o t f r 10 q surf h r u q gw h r u q

pothole q surf h r u is the surface runoff generated from the hru mm q gw h r u is the groundwater flow contribution from the hru mm q lat h r u is the lateral flow generated inside the hru mm and area hru is the hru area ha the volume of water stored inside the pothole is susceptible to evaporation and seepage losses given by 5 v evap 10 1 lai lai evap e 0 s a i f l a i lai evap 0 i f l a i

evapotranspiration of a particular hru mm vseep is the seepage loss from pothole m3 ksat is the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil layer in a given profile mm h sw is the daily soil water content of the profile mm and fc is the field capacity moisture content mm the outflow of water from pothole to the corresponding river reach occurs in three modes first when the current water depth exceeds the maximum volume of potholes spilling occurs in the form of overflow as 7 v flowout v v potmx i f v v potmx where vflowout is the water volume flowing out of the pothole m3 and vpotmx is the maximum volume of water retained in the pothole m3 during the crop growth period the paddy field is characterized by two critical water management phases of ponding and drainage fig 1 whenever water is applied to the paddy fields in the form of irrigation or rainfall ponding begins and subsequently impoundment status is set to active in the pothole module during the ponding phase percolation and evaporation processes dominate over other hydrological processes with no contribution of runoff from paddy field to the river conversely when the water release operation is scheduled due to crop management strategies the available volume of water inside the pothole drains outside of it additionally the presence of high water table in fields instigates the adoption of tile drainage and subsequently a significant amount of water is discharged outside of the pothole in the indian context out of these three circumstances the first two scenarios are mostly experienced for which the streamflow simulation is conceptualized accordingly in this study after simulating the individual process components of a pothole the volume of surface runoff that contributes to the corresponding downstream river reach is estimated using the water balance equation eq 7 2 3 revised swat pothole approach swat ps by sakaguchi et al 2014 to improve upon the existing pothole approach sakaguchi et al 2014 modified the percolation loss under saturated condition by calibrating the percolation rate in the range of 0 to 33 mm day at which the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is the maximum this maximum percolation rate is treated as the representative percolation loss from the study area under saturated condition the estimated revised potential percolation loss is used to quantify the seepage loss in the revised pothole module as sakaguchi et al 2014 8 v seep 10 p p s a i f v stored 10 p p s a v stored i f v stored 10 p p s a where pp is the potential percolation rate mm day as it is difficult to quantify the daily irrigation water requirement for the swat pothole module a fixed daily irrigation depth can be assumed accounting for the streamflow generated as a consequence of excess irrigation application as sakaguchi et al 2014 9 irr pot v potmx v stored i f v stored i r r v potmx i r r i f v stored i r r v potmx where irr pot daily depth of water added to the pothole mm irr volume of water added by irrigation in a day m3 and v stored initial volume of water stored in the pothole m3 the excess irrigation water attributed to the increased runoff contribution from the paddy field can be expressed as 10 q surf q surf normal v stored i r r v potmx 10 area hru i f v stored i r r v potmx q surf normal i f v stored i r r v potmx where q surf is the depth of daily surface runoff discharged from the hru to the main stream mm and q surf normal is the depth of daily surface runoff discharged from the hru to the main stream excluding the overflow from the pothole resulted from irrigation mm further the evaporation loss from the impounded water surface as simulated by the existing pothole approach is found to be continuously overestimated sakaguchi et al 2014 to deal with this situation sakaguchi et al 2014 suggested a reduced evaporation coefficient value of 0 6 as 11 v evap 0 6 10 1 lai lai evap e 0 s a i f l a i lai evap 0 i f l a i lai evap out of all the proposed modifications by sakaguchi et al 2014 only the effect of excess irrigation water on downstream streamflow simulation is found to be significant that improved the streamflow simulation however this proposed seepage calculation procedure lumps different flow components into a single entity without capturing the soil moisture dynamics under both excess and limited water availability conditions the introduced evaporation coefficient of 0 6 in eq 11 only reduces the net evaporation from the impoundment surface wherein the dynamics of evaporation under moisture stress condition remained unexplained to address these issues with the existing pothole modules the current study is motivated for developing an enhanced parsimonious swat pothole module as discussed in section 3 3 development of enhanced swat pothole module swat ep the enhanced pothole module models the paddy field dynamics fig 1 under awd condition comprising of the inflow outflow and sub surface soil moisture variation under irrigated field condition the framework of the swat ep module developed herein is illustrated in fig 2 the specific enhancements incorporated in the existing swat pothole module are described in the subsequent sub sections 3 1 revised estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity the existing swat pothole approach du et al 2005 considers only the clay percentage to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the first soil layer however in a real field the saturated hydraulic conductivity is a function of the soil texture and bulk density therefore the estimation of k sat mm h can be revised in the enhanced model by the pedo transfer function ptf as indicated by jabro 1992 12 k sat 9 56 0 81 log p silt 1 09 log p clay 4 64 b d where p silt is the percentage of silt in the soil p clay is the percentage of clay in the soil and b d is the bulk density of the soil mg m3 note that eq 12 was derived by using 350 soil samples collected from different geographical locations all over the world for all types of soil categories to obtain the highest correlation coefficient between the measured k sat and the corresponding soil composition in the indian context only two ptfs have been developed to date for estimating the field capacity and wilting point water contents the ptf developed by adhikary et al 2008 is based on the concept of saxton et al 1986 and the study comprised of 1400 soil samples across india however the results of this study differ significantly from that of saxton et al 1986 in which relatively higher error was observed for the tropical regions such as the study area considered in this study further the proposed ptf by santra et al 2018 is only applicable to the arid western indian region and was not validated for other climatic conditions in india therefore these two ptfs are not used in this study to estimate the ksat 3 2 incorporation of percolation algorithm in all the existing pothole modules the percolation loss is treated as an explicit function of the available soil water content in the underlying soil layers however the percolation loss in a paddy field is governed by the saturated irrigated soil condition that varies significantly from the usual seepage phenomenon due to continuous irrigation application a plough pan layer is developed beneath the soil surface that affects the vertical movement of water significantly further due to pulverization in the puddled soil layer there is an increased porosity in soil that increases the soil water movement to incorporate these processes the existing percolation algorithm of pothole module can be modified as indicated by janssen et al 2010 13 v s e e p 240 k sat s a po t depth pu thick pl thick where v seep is the daily volume of water lost through the pothole bottom m3 po t depth is the depth of water on the impounded surface in a particular day mm pu thick is the puddled layer thickness mm and pl thick is the plough pan thickness mm furthermore the presence of standing water in the field results in a significant amount of seepage loss through the bunds in all the existing variants of the pothole module in swat the seepage loss through the bunds is considered to be negligible and is not accounted for the seepage calculation conversely the seepage loss through the bunds in the paddy field is considered as a function of ponding depth width of the bund and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bund following janssen et al 2010 14 q bund a 0 a 1 p o t depth a 2 w a 3 log 10 k bunds where q bund is the seepage loss through the bunds w is the width of the bund k bunds is the hydraulic conductivity of the bund and a 0 a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the coefficients of linear regression having values of 0 76 7 64 0 14 and 147 11 respectively therefore in the advocated swat ep module the total seepage loss from the paddy field is revised as following 15 v seep t o t a l v seep q bund 3 3 incorporation of deep percolation loss under awd scenario the water management schedule during different crop growth stages makes the dynamics of the paddy field quite different than the other crops as rice crop requires a significant depth of standing water during its growth generally farmers in most of the countries practice the surface flooding irrigation method for the paddy cultivation which is un economical and inefficient under limited water availability condition in such situation the awd approach is proven to be an advanced alternative worldwide the awd approach is characterized by three phases as detailed below 3 3 1 deep percolation during ponding phase during the ponding phase the paddy field is submerged with a pre defined depth of water so that the soil is at saturated state under such conditions the vertical water movement through layered soil can be modeled by a steady state one dimensional laplace equation polyanin 2002 that combines the continuity equation and darcy s law as following 16 z k sat φ z 0 where φ is the hydraulic head mm and z is the elevation head mm to estimate the value of φ at different soil layers eq 16 can be solved by a central finite difference scheme first the soil profile is discretized into different layers based on the lithology of the study area and subsequently the depth and saturated hydraulic conductivity of each layer is ascertained through the field observations further the problem domain is separated into multiple grid cells as 17 n d w t δ l where n is the number of soil layers dwt is the water table depth mm from the ground surface and δ l is the grid spacing mm the value of φ in eq 16 is estimated in each grid cell by defining the following boundary conditions the upper boundary condition is represented by the hydraulic head 18 φ 0 hp i 1 d w t where hp i 1 is the depth of ponding mm which varies with respect to change in rainfall and irrigation application the water table label is treated as the lower boundary condition since the pressure is atmospheric at the free water table surface the lower boundary condition is represented by 19 φ n 0 now substituting the boundary conditions the deep percolation loss below the root zone depth can be estimated using the darcy s law as 20 dp k n r z φ n r z 1 φ n r z δ l where dp is the deep percolation loss mm day k n r z is the hydraulic conductivity in the nrz th root zone node mm day φ n r z 1 is the hydraulic head at the n r z 1 th node above root zone mm and φ n r z is the hydraulic head at the root zone mm 3 3 2 deep percolation during drying phase in the awd approach generally there is gradual disappearance of ponded water from the field after two weeks from the day after transplanting dat bouman et al 2007 before the next irrigation application the field is kept completely dry for few days thereby prevailing the unsaturated sub surface condition of soil moisture convection to address this complex sub surface soil water transport dynamics of modeling the deep percolation loss during the drying phase the top 30 cm soil layer can be considered as hydraulically functional and subsequently divided into two compartments e g khepar et al 2000 so that the transpiration and evaporation losses are predominant in the top soil compartment l v 1 and in the bottom compartment l v 2 the deep percolation and transpiration losses in the form of root water uptake are prevalent the deep percolation flux dp can be estimated in discrete form by the darcy s law as 21 dp φ 1 φ 2 k avg θ l v where l v is the total depth of vadose zone soil layer mm and φ 1 and φ 2 are the hydraulic heads or total heads mm for l v 1 and l v 2 soil layers respectively mm given by 22 φ 1 ψ 1 z 1 23 φ 2 ψ 2 z 2 24 k avg θ k 1 θ k 2 θ 2 where k avg θ is the average of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity for the l v 1 and l v 2 soil layers mm day and ψ 1 and ψ 2 are the suction heads in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments mm that can be estimated using the van genuchten mualem approach respectively as mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 25a ψ 1 1 α 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 m e 1 1 1 n p 1 25b ψ 2 1 α 2 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 m e 2 1 1 n p 2 where α 1 and α 2 are the inverse of air entry pressure for the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments mm 1 respectively θ 1 and θ 2 are the respective volumetric moisture contents in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 θ s 1 and θ s 2 are the corresponding volumetric saturated moisture contents in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 θ r 1 and θ r 2 are the volumetric residual moisture content in the l v 1 and l v 2 soil compartments cm3 cm3 and n p 1 and n p 2 are the corresponding pore size distribution indices which are derived using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 accounting for the soil texture sand silt and clay and bulk density of individual soil layers table 1 m e 1 and m e 2 are the corresponding empirical parameters that can be estimated as a function of pore size distribution index as 26a m e 1 1 1 n p 1 26b m e 2 1 1 n p 2 during the initiation of the drying phase the saturated soil water in the two selected soil compartments get depleted by the plant root water uptake and evapotranspiration as 27 θ 1 i θ 1 i 1 l v 1 tp i 1 b z ep i 1 l v 1 28 θ 2 i θ 2 i 1 l v 2 tp i 1 b z dp i 1 l v 2 note that on the first day θ1 i 1 θ2 i 1 θs1 where tp i 1 and ep i 1 are the potential transpiration and evaporation losses during the previous day mm respectively i is the day index and b z is the plant water uptake function given by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 as 29 b z 1 667 l r z l 0 2 l r 2 0833 l r 1 l z l r z l l r l 0 2 l r 0 z l l r where l is the z coordinate of soil surface mm wherein bottom of the soil profile is located at z 0 and the soil surface is at z l and l r is the depth of root zone mm considering beer s law the potential evapotranspiration loss can be segregated into potential evaporation and transpiration separating the solar radiation component of the energy budget by the leaf area index lai derived canopy interception as ritchie 1972 30 t p et p 1 e k l a i 31 e p et p e k l a i where k is a constant that governs the radiation extent by plant canopy as a function of sun angle the actual transpiration rate from the underlying soil bears direct relation with the plant water uptake from the root zones as feddes et al 1974 32 t act r p b x where t act is the actual plant water uptake mm and r p is the potential water uptake rate mm that equals to t p under water abundant condition using the values of θ 1 and θ 2 from eqs 27 and 28 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k 1 θ and k 2 θ can be estimated as 33 k 1 θ k 1 s a t k r 1 34 k 2 θ k 2 s a t k r 2 where k r 1 and k r 2 are the relative unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions given by van genuchten 1980 as 35 k r 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 λ p 1 1 1 θ 1 θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 m c 1 m c 1 2 36 k r 2 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 λ p 2 1 1 θ 2 θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 m c 2 m c 2 2 where λ p 1 is the pore connectivity empirical parameter generally considered as 0 5 mualem 1976 bhadra et al 2013 moret fernández et al 2017 the values of the soil moisture content are updated for the next day by replacing the values of θ s 1 eq 27 with θ 1 to estimate the updated deep percolation flux using eq 21 3 4 enhancement in evapotranspiration algorithm the different phases of awd have a significant effect on evapotranspiration dynamics that vary significantly during the ponded and depletion phases in the existing pothole variants evapotranspiration is estimated as the single value function of the leaf area index lai however the available soil moisture condition plays a crucial role in quantifying the actual evapotranspiration et act loss during both the ponding and saturated phases et act can be computed as 37 et act k c pet day w h e n θ θ s where et act is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient for paddy and pet day is the reference evapotranspiration mm day as estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1994 during the drying phase with reduced soil water availability an inherent moisture stress condition is induced and the actual et is estimated as allen et al 1998 sahoo et al 2018 38 et act aw t rz d aw t aw r pet day w h e n θ r θ θ s where aw t is the total available moisture content in the root zone mm rz d is the root zone moisture depletion mm and aw r is the readily available moisture content in the crop root zone under unsaturated condition mm given by 39 aw r ρ aw t where ρ is the fraction of total available water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress ρ 0 2 allen et al 1998 the existing swat pothole module du et al 2005 is valid under the saturated soil condition as it computes et act as a unique function of lai depicting the evaporation from ponded water and transpiration from rice crop conversely in the proposed enhanced et sub routine the actual et is partitioned into soil evaporation crop transpiration and impounded water evaporation which could capture the sub surface soil water dynamics in a better way by appropriately distributing the seepage and percolation losses along the whole soil profile 3 5 incorporating return flow contribution to streamflow the return flow shows a delayed response towards the downstream streamflow generation process the return flow in paddy dominated catchments could be resulted from three sources surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater contribution moreover the usual magnitude of return flow is supplemented by the excess irrigation application the advocated enhanced approach estimates the available irrigation return flow generated from the irrigation application as wu et al 2019 40 ir flow irr day irr day p day q day l day irr day η 0 p day irr day η 0 gw day where ir flow is the available irrigation return flow mm day irr day is the irrigation water application mm day p day is the precipitation over the impoundment mm day q day is the runoff contribution to river channel m3 day l day is the lateral flow contribution to river channel m3 day gw day is the sub surface return flow to river channel m3 day and η 0 is the irrigation efficiency now the total water released from the potholes to the river reach can be computed as 41 q day out q day i r flow where q day out is the total surface runoff release from the pothole to the river reach mm day 4 study area and pedo hydrologic database 4 1 site description the kangsabati river basin krb 12 014 70 km2 of west bengal

km2 and the reservoir command is of 6279 48 km2 the kangsabati river originates in the uplands of the chhota nagpur plateau that has caused highly eroded and gullied undulated topography in the upper reaches where ephemeral 1st and 2nd order streams are dominant the basin elevation ranges from 2 656 m above mean sea level msl nearly 70 13 of the basin area constitutes the sandy clay loam and sandy loam soil classes paddy is the main crop grown in the cultivable land of the command area the krb experiences an average annual rainfall of 1348 mm year concentrated about 80 during the tropical monsoon season june october in this study the developed swat based models were applied for streamflow simulation separately at i the reservoir inflow location contributed by the upstream river catchment of 5735 22 km2 area characterized with mixed land uses and ii mohanpur outlet contributed by dominant paddy land uses in the command area 5568 km2 and downstream river catchment 711 48 km2 with mixed land uses wherein the releases from the kangsabati reservoir formed the upstream boundary for the swat pothole models 4 2 data sources the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem was used in this study to characterize the basin topography the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao un developed soil map was procured from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 1 that contains two soil layer information from 0 to 30 cm and 30 100 cm depths the land use land cover lulc map of the basin was prepared by using the liss iii imageries procured from bhuvan indian space research organization isro http bhuvan nrsc gov in bhuvan links php the lulc map so generated for the krb constitutes sixteen distinct land use classes having the paddy field and forest as the two major classes the daily time series of observed weather data of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for the period 1981 to 2010 available at five weather stations were procured from the india meteorological department imd pune and agro meteorology department government of west bengal and are interpolated by the thiessen polygon method for input to the swat model since this study is focused only on the agricultural catchment consisting of paddy land use the use of imd gridded data product consisting of only precipitation and temperature may result in erroneous et estimation the observed daily time series of streamflow data available for the gauging stations located at the inflow to kangsabati reservoir simulia tusuma rangagora kharidwar and mohanpur outlet were collected from the central water commission cwc kolkata and irrigation and water ways department iwwd government of west bengal the reservoir surface area and storage volumes corresponding to the emergency spillway and principal spillway are 12 498 ha and 123 500 m3 and 11 101 ha and 98 186 m3 respectively the essential information related to crop growth viz crop calendar irrigation schedule irrigation efficiency and management practices were collected through field surveys from the local farmers the obtained information was processed under the management module of swat to mimic the real crop field dynamics in the model framework 4 3 configuring the paddy hrus the study was carried out by using the rev 637 of swat 2012 version this current version of swat has the advantage of defining more than one hru inside a single sub basin with paddy lulc with an improved model discretization first the entire paddy hrus were identified and set as potholes followed by proper parameterization of pothole module to ensure that the whole hru area drains into the paddy fields the value of pot fr was kept as 1 as per the field survey conducted in the study basin the rice cultivation period begins from the 1st week of june and lasts up to the 2nd week of october the irrigation is initiated on the 1st week of july and due to the lack of information on the depth of irrigation applied auto irrigation option was selected in the management module the impoundment status was set to on just after the initiation of irrigation with the two mid season drainages during the month of august and september finally the harvesting operation was scheduled to happen on the 10th october all these field management practices were incorporated into the model through the management module of swat 4 4 configuring model subroutines for incorporating the enhancements in the pothole module as discussed in section 3 the original fortran codes rev 637 of the swat pothole were modified using the intel visual fortran this program works on intel parallel studio xe 2018 cluster edition which is based on the intel visual studio platform version 2013 and subsequently the debugging and compilation was carried out to build the modified executables the original swat 2012 version is comprised of 302 sub routines in which each sub routine is meant to model a single multiple process component the proposed modifications were incorporated in the nine sub routines of the original swat 2012 version the modified ptf for the estimation of ks was updated in the estimate ksat f subroutine and subsequently the estimated ks was set to call in the readsol f sub routine further the quantification of deep percolation loss under the ponding and drying conditions were updated in the percmain f and pothole f sub routines the effect of moisture stress on the etact of paddy field as described in section 3 4 was updated in the pothole f sub routine since the chosen study area is having the paddy land use the introduction of moisture stress factor is limited to the pothole hrus and therefore the etact f subroutine was kept unrevised the contribution of irrigation return flow to the streamflow was included in the pothole f sub routine of the enhanced model the newly introduced variables for revision were updated in the modparm f and allocate parms f finally the revised hru specific water yield computation equation was updated in the hruday f90 and subbasin f sub routines once the individual sub routines got updated the main programme main f read all the inputs and called the linked subroutines to execute the subsequent modeling steps after successful compilation of all the sub routines the executables were built both in the release and debug modes the newly created executables were updated in the swat installation folder for subsequent model simulation 5 model evaluation 5 1 model calibration and validation since efficient model calibration depends on the expertise of the modeler to address the biasness it was decided to evaluate all the model variants using the auto calibration option of the swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2004 the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters table 2 in reproducing the observed streamflow was carried out using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method consisting of 1000 simulation runs in the first iteration and 300 simulation runs in the subsequent iterations of swat cup for the three existing approaches i e swat cn swat p and swat ps the commonly used 25 calibration parameters were considered whereas in case of the swat ep contemplating the physical significance of the developed module eight parameters e g gw revap revapmn pot k evpot lat time irr sq epco and irr mx were excluded from the calibration process to contemplate the inter annual variability of weather variables and their response towards different hydrological flux components three years 1996 1998 of data was used for model warming up to limit the underlying uncertainties due to catchment initial condition followed by five years 1999 2003 of data for calibration and three years 2004 2006 of data for validation these calibrated values were updated inside the arc swat database with the suitable sql statements the model calibration and validation were carried out at two locations viz the inflow to kangsabati reservoir sub basin 4 attributing the effect of upstream rain fed non irrigated paddy fields and at the mohanpur outlet sub basin 39 attributing the impacts of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields the sub basin 4 corresponds to a headwater catchment which is deprived of the hydropeaking effect whereas the sub basin 39 integrates the hydropeaking effect with the command area dynamics the developed enhanced swat ep model was compared with the existing swat cn swat p and swat ps model variants in reproducing the observed streamflow response by using the popular performance measures of nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse the acceptable ranges of these performance indicators are generally considered as nse 0 6 r2 0 6 and pbias 15 the degree of agreement between the observed and simulated streamflows by different swat pothole variants is graphically summarized by using the taylor diagram this diagram quantifies the efficiency e of individual approaches in terms of centered root mean square difference rmsd pearson correlation coefficient r and standard deviation σ signifying the amplitude of variation as follows 42 rmsd 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o 2 1 2 where n is the total number of observations s i is the simulated streamflow m3 s s is the mean of simulated streamflow m3 s and o i is the observed streamflow m3 s and o is the mean of observed streamflow m3 s given by 43 r 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o σ s σ o where r is the pearson correlation coefficient σ s and σ o are the standard deviation of the observed and simulated streamflows m3 s defined as 44 σ s 1 n i 1 n s i s 2 1 2 45 σ o 1 n i 1 n o i o 2 1 2 moreover flow duration curve fdc based analysis was carried out to visualize the qualitative model performance in simulating the high and low flows where 10 q10 and 90 q90 dependable flows were considered as the high and low flows respectively as nse is more sensitive to high flows they may not be able to evaluate the model performance in simulating the low flows appropriately hence logarithmic transformed nse log 10 n s e was used as an indicator to observe the degree of reproducibility between the observed and simulated low flows stoelzle et al 2014 46 log 10 n s e 1 1 n ln q s ε ln q o ε 2 1 n ln q o ε ln q o ε 2 where q s is the simulated streamflow m3 s q o is the observed streamflow m3 s q o is mean of the observed streamflows m3 s and ε is a small threshold to avoid the errors caused due to zero streamflow values and estimated as a small fraction of mean inter annual discharge i e q o 40 hoffmann et al 2004 to examine the model performance the quantification of individual water balance components is of paramount importance due to the unavailability of information regarding the measured water balance fluxes such as percolation loss etact and baseflow only the satellite based 8 daily mod16a2 etact data https earthdata nasa gov was considered as the benchmark subsequently the performance of individual approaches in partitioning the hydrological fluxes was evaluated to estimate the mass conservation error mce 5 2 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty in the swat simulated streamflow can be attributed to the erroneous input data modeler s skill and model framework in this study the quantile regression qr based non parametric uncertainty analysis koenker and bassett 1978 koenker 2005 nanda et al 2019 sahoo et al 2020 was carried out in which different quantiles of a conditional distribution are estimated once the 90 confidence interval was constructed two widely used indices viz p factor and r factor were used to quantify the uncertainty the p factor represents the fraction of the observed data bracketed by the 95 prediction uncertainty ppu band that ranges from 0 to 1 wherein 1 corresponds to 100 subsumption of the observed data expressed as 47 p n 95 n total where n 95 is the number of data points bracketed inside the 95 ppu band n total is the total data points including the error term 1 p represents the residual error of the observed data alternatively the r factor indicates the ratio of the average width of the 95 ppu band to the standard deviation of the observed data r 1 5 being the accepted value in streamflow simulation e g abbaspour et al 2004 a balance must be maintained between the satisfactory ranges of these two factors during the calibration process of individual iterations the iteration that corresponds to the optimum value of p factor and r factor was considered as the final and the respective parameter values were regarded as the fitted calibration parameters 6 results and discussion 6 1 performances of different swat pothole model variants in reproducing observed streamflow time series the reproduction capability of the observed streamflow hydrographs by all the swat pothole variants is illustrated in figs 4 7 which show that the peak and recession limbs are best reproduced by the swat ep model followed by swat ps swat p and swat cn the streamflow peaks mostly underpredicted by the existing model variants as shown in table 3 the nse estimates varied in the range of 0 77 0 89 0 41 0 66 0 49 0 65 and 0 51 0 71 for the swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps variants at both the reservoir inflow and catchment command area outlet locations respectively these results reveal the improved performance of the proposed swat ep approach over the three existing approaches for catchment scale streamflow estimation as seen in figs 4 5 and table 3 during the calibration and validation phases of all the models at reservoir inflow location contributed by an upstream catchment area with about 11 paddy land use the performance among all the four approaches considered herein ranged from nse 0 59 swat p to nse 0 84 swat ep conversely as compared to the swat cn variant with a lower nse estimate of 0 41 table 3 the improvement in the nse estimate 0 87 by the swat ep variant was appreciable in simulating the streamflow at the mohanpur outlet gauging station contributed by the catchment command area with considerable paddy land use of 62 fig 6 similarly during validation the performance of the swat ep approach was the best with nse 0 89 followed by the lower estimates by the swat ps nse 0 51 swat p nse 0 49 and swat cn nse 0 46 models moreover the swat ep approach performed the best with the r2 measure during both calibration and validation at the mohanpur outlet followed by the swat cn swat p and swat ps models the relatively poor performance of the existing three swat based approaches in the selected area revealed their inadequacy in conceptualizing the integrated catchment command dynamics as highlighted in section 3 the potential to simulate the peak and low streamflows also defines the true catchment scale applicability of a hydrological model hence the performances of swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps were evaluated in simulating the peak as well as low flows at two gauging locations with varied lulc scenarios the observed peak reservoir inflows of 1748 m3 s 1118 m3 s 864 m3 s and 820 m3 s occurred from 1 1 1999 1 3 1999 10 20 2005 and 9 23 2006 were evaluated against the simulated peaks by all the swat pothole model variants and the swat ep was found to be in good agreement with the observed ones characterized by the lowest pbias estimate of 0 4 at the mohanpur outlet the swat ep also performed very well in reproducing the peak flows of magnitude 2219 m3 s 2101 m3 s and 2061 m3 s that occurred from 9 25 1999 9 27 1999 and 8 7 1999 it can be envisaged from fig 8 that out of 1826 number of reservoir inflow data points 91 of data points were over or underestimated by 10 by the swat ep whereas in case of the swat cn swat p and swat ps variants only 61 68 and 72 of data points were over or underestimated by 10 respectively most of the swat ep simulated streamflows were found to be concentrated along the 1 1 line depicting an improved performance of the proposed approach in quantifying the runoff generation from paddy fields it can be clearly seen from figs 8 and 9 that the observed low flow q90 regimes are very well reproduced by almost all the model variants however except the swat ep model the other variants failed to reproduce the observed median flow q50 and high flow q10 regimes it can be surmised from the fig 9a that the high reservoir inflows up to the exceedance probability of 35 were constantly overestimated by the swat ps and swat cn however in the case of swat p the low flows were overestimated by a magnitude of about 30 m3 s which could be attributed to the non consideration of irrigation return flows in the modeling framework the swat ep was found to be the best in reproducing the observed streamflows except from 9 12 1999 and 10 19 1999 events which may be attributed to instantaneous high rainfall over the catchment generating high return flow from the paddy fields in the command area conversely at mohanpur outlet representing the dynamics of command area the peak flows up to 10 exceedance probability in fig 9b were significantly overestimated by the swat p and thereby indicating the structural limitations in the original swat pothole variant similarly the 10 to 40 dependable flows depicting the medium flows were almost overestimated by order of 20 by the swat cn approach whereas this overestimation in case of the swat p and swat ps were from 16 to 21 conversely for mohanpur outlet slight underestimation was noticed in the range of 55 to 75 dependable flows by all the swat pothole variants the low streamflows at the reservoir inflow location characterized by 90 exceedance probability level were best reproduced by the swat ep with log 10 n s e of 0 81 as compared to the swat cn log 10 n s e 0 52 swat p log 10 n s e 0 45 and swat ps log 10 n s e 0 59 variants similarly at the mohanpur outlet the existing swat pothole model variant continuously underestimated the low flows whereas the swat ep best reproduced the low flows with log 10 n s e 0 72 overall the performance of the different variants of the swat pothole model for streamflow simulation in the integrated reservoir command was of the order swat p swat cn swat ps swat ep which proclaim an enhanced and flexible application of the proposed approach in paddy as well as non paddy dominant catchments with lesser number of calibration parameters the rmsd standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient estimates by the four swat pothole variants during the calibration and validation are illustrated in the taylor diagram fig 10 the swat ep model resulted in the lowest rmsd estimates that ranged from 32 25 44 36 m3 s and 41 57 52 39 m3 s at the reservoir inflow and mohanpur gauging stations respectively for reservoir inflow simulation by the swat cn model the rmsd value was estimated as 62 34 m3 s whereas it was the maximum 122 25 m3 s at the mohanpur outlet reflecting the relative inability of this approach in modeling the effect of paddy land uses similarly at the mohanpur outlet the swat ps model estimated a relatively lower rmse value of 84 72 m3 s during the validation period the standard deviation estimates by the swat ep model was in the range of 41 32 46 32 m3 s at the mohanpur outlet that revealed the enhanced capability of the proposed approach encompassing the observed low to high flows the model performance results presented in table 3 revealed that overall the swat ep model performed the best with acceptable accuracy whereas the existing swat pothole model variants performed poorly in simulating streamflow from an integrated catchment command area with dominant paddy land use this could be attributed to the crude conceptualization of the paddy field hydrology in the existing approaches without considering the alternate wetting and drying phenomena of the sub surface vadose zone the significant underestimation of peak flows by the existing approaches could be due to their failure in capturing the streamflow generated from the paddy fields forced with instantaneous high rainfall furthermore the assumption of constant percolation rate in paddy fields in the swat ps model sakaguchi et al 2014 might incurred more infiltration loss in the paddy fields and subsequently underestimated the low flows to a greater extent conversely the concept of drying and ponding phases introduced in the proposed swat ep approach enhanced the baseflow estimation contributing to the streamflow generation thereby increased the model accuracy 6 2 assessment of predictive uncertainty of different swat pothole approaches the qr based uncertainty assessment was carried out to evaluate all the swat pothole model variants in terms of confidence intervals ci defined based on the estimated quantiles β 0 05 0 95 the model performance was evaluated as the percentage of observed dataset bracketed inside the 90 ci band the average thickness of 90 ci was computed as 84 35 m3 s 126 32 m3 s 163 97 m3 s and 143 74 m3 s for the swat ep swat cn swat p and swat ps variants during the validation period for reservoir inflow simulation respectively revealing an enhanced performance of the proposed approach in a non paddy dominated area fig 11 further for the swat ep model the p factor of 0 82 which corresponds to 82 of the observed streamflow bracketed inside the 90 ci band was significantly higher than that of the existing approaches the r factor of 0 69 in the swat ep indicates a relatively narrow uncertainty band which is also confirmed from the qr based analysis as illustrated in fig 12 for the paddy dominated command area the average thickness of the 90 ci bands for the swat ep model was 72 53 m3 s which were 209 32 m3 s 189 62 m3 s and 123 27 m3 s for the swat cn swat p and swat ps models respectively from fig 12 it can be surmised that for streamflow simulation at the reservoir inflow location with mixed land use the predictive uncertainties were reduced in the order swat p swat ps swat cn swat ep whereas at the mohanpur outlet with dominant paddy land use the corresponding order was swat cn swat p swat ps swat ep this reveals that the proposed swat ep model with improved vadose zone process components could represent the catchment dynamics in a better way as compared to the existing swat based approaches irrespective of the lulc conditions in the catchment further the initial number of model parameters for calibration in the swat cn swat p and swat ps were 25 which were significantly reduced to 17 in the proposed swat ep model in the existing model frameworks many of the complex hydrological processes were parameterized using simple empirical coefficients increasing the number of model parameters however in the proposed swat ep model framework the process dynamics of deep percolation loss evapotranspiration under moisture stress condition and partitioning of evaporation and transpiration components are replaced with the process based equations with reduced number of calibration parameters making the proposed model more parsimonious than the existing ones furthermore lowering the number of calibration parameters reduced the possibility of equifinality problem in auto calibration thereby reduced the model structural uncertainty to a greater extent 6 3 performance of swat pothole model variants in estimating water balance components in the command area enclosed with the downstream location of the reservoir and the mohanpur outlet the daily scale reservoir release is the only upstream flow contribution along with the rainfall and irrigation inputs the surface runoff actual crop evapotranspiration soil moisture storage deep percolation loss and baseflow are the outflow water balance components in the swat framework fig 13 illustrates the reproduction of the 8 daily observed mod16a2 satellite based etact estimates by the different swat pothole approaches it can be envisaged from fig 13 that the swat p and swat cn approaches mostly overestimated the etact whereas the swat ps and swat ep reproduced the observed high etact values closely during the low etact periods the swat ps either underestimated or overestimated the mod16a2 values the swat ep reproduced the 8 daily etact with a high nse estimate of 0 85 whereas the swat cn swat p and swat ps performed poorly in these conditions as evidenced from the nse estimate of 0 05 0 22 and 0 42 respectively in terms of the rmse measure among all the models the lowest rmse estimate of 0 41 mm day by the swat ep shows that this model outperformed all the existing approaches moreover during the rabi season november february relatively lower rmse was observed by the swat ep and swat ps approaches in reproducing the etact whereas the swat p and swat cn approaches performed with a higher rmse estimate during both the kharif june october and rabi seasons the high pbias 22 estimates in the etact by the swat cn and swat p variants may be attributed to the absence of irrigation return flow conceptualization in these approaches table 4 shows the swat pothole estimated annual average water balance components during 2001 2005 in the reservoir command as envisaged from table 4 during 2001 2005 out of the total 2216 23 202 23 mm year 100 of water applied in terms of precipitation and irrigation in the downstream catchment command area all the models almost partitioned it into surface runoff sro etact soil moisture storage sms deep percolation dp and baseflow bf with an acceptable mce of 5 1 34 although the swat ep was the best with mce 2 5 02 it can be seen in table 4 that with respect to the observed sro the swat ep simulated this flux very closely with 3 33 4 48 error followed by the swat ps 8 29 3 31 swat cn 9 05 2 63 and swat p 10 51 1 98 approaches similarly with respect to the 25 42 of observed mod16a2 etact flux of the water balance the swat ep simulated it the best with 1 20 0 74 error followed by swat ps 2 68 1 45 swat cn 6 05 1 99 and swat p 6 98 1 98 approaches since no observed information was available for the other partitioned fluxes only a comparative assessment was carried out among the models in simulating these fluxes table 4 shows that the deep percolation loss was the highest in case of the swat ps model followed by the swat p swat ep and swat cn models and the baseflow was the highest in case of the swat p approach followed by swat cn swat ps and swat ep models a close comparison of these results with fig 9 revealed that the low flows were always overpredicted by the swat p approach due to the highest baseflow contribution followed by the swat cn model without following the pattern of the observed baseflow although the swat ps and swat ep approaches almost well reproduced the observed baseflow the simulated et act dp loss was the highest by the swat p 48 77 followed by the swat ps 47 50 swat cn 45 98 and swat ep 42 16 the lowest et act dp loss estimated by the swat ep model led to increased surface runoff generation with a better reproduction of streamflow peaks however this correlation is difficult to establish in other models which may be attributed to the improper process description of the vadose zone dynamics and et act under water stressed conditions leading to undesirable pattern in the streamflow peaks in case of the swat ep model the exclusive process description of percolation loss under ponding and drying phases could have captured the sub surface catchment dynamics in a better manner to estimate the actual dp loss moreover in the swat ps model defining the potential percolation rate factor as an empirical parameter could have resulted in the highest deep percolation loss reducing the surface runoff at the mohanpur outlet it can be envisaged from figs 6 and 7 that the observed baseflow recession is very fast in case of the mohanpur outlet which was very well reproduced by the swat ep model consistently whereas the other models either partially failed swat ps and swat p or fully failed swat cn to capture this pattern the highest baseflow contribution in case of the swat p could have been favoured by the partitioned lower deep percolation loss the simple volumetric model conceptualization in the original pothole approach could have added more error in estimating the sub surface water balance components of percolation loss and baseflow leading to poor performance in estimating the surface runoff in the command area as a proof of the concept in the pothole module of xie and cui 2011 the auto irrigation is initiated using the concept of three critical water depths i e minimum and maximum fitting depths and the maximum ponding depth inside the pothole as suggested by guo et al 1997 which were kept as constant global parameters in the model despite of the soil and agro climatology of the region the real time irrigation was triggered when ponding water level dropped below the minimum critical depth and continued till it reached the maximum fitting depth without accounting for actual crop water stress resulting in significant overestimation of etact similarly the oversimplified estimation of vertical percolation loss and lateral seepage through embankments by a calibration parameter namely the potential percolation rate in the swat ps resulted in substantial overestimation and underestimation in the water balance components as far as the water management in paddy field is concerned the realistic estimation of intermediate hydrological fluxes associated with paddy growth is of paramount importance the existing swat pothole variants overestimated the etact in the range of 2 68 1 45 to 6 98 1 98 which may be attributed to the absence of soil moisture stress coefficient and physically based vadose zone dynamics in these frameworks conversely the proposed swat ep variant with the awd feature could estimate etact with the minimum overestimation of 1 20 0 74 table 4 and a substantially reduced rmse of 0 41 mm day however as envisaged in fig 13 the mismatch between the observed and swat ep simulated etact is relatively higher during the rabi season characterized by high moisture stress as compared to that during the kharif season characterized by low moisture stress this shows that there is a scope to improve the etact estimates further during the severe moisture stress periods since the available soil water content and etact play crucial role in the irrigation scheduling and quantification of irrigation water requirement the proposed swat ep would act as a decision making tool for the water managers while planning sustainable paddy cultivation moreover the improved vadose zone conceptualization would be helpful in modeling the nutrient transport in the sub surface waters to address the adverse impacts of excessive fertilizer application therefore reliable estimation of individual water balance components at varying temporal scales would lead to accurate estimation of irrigation water requirement across different growth phases of paddy for enhanced crop yield with optimum irrigation application considering awd however the proposed model may not perform satisfactorily in the wetlands due to the absence of the phenomena of drying phase et under moisture stress condition and return flow in the wetland hydrology as envisaged in figs 4 7 reproduction of the recession limbs is well imitated by the swat ep although the peak flows are still consistently underestimated this could be attributed to the lumped conceptualization of potholes in swat resulting in varying storage capacities in the catchment with consistent underestimation of the peak flows this necessitates for a more dynamic representation of the pothole depressions as a future work the comparative results of this study are based on a single catchment command area therefore follow up studies could include the evaluation of this approach in other catchment commands with varying climatic and soil conditions moreover the assumption of uniform distribution of irrigation water to the individual paddy hru irrespective of the crop growth stage limits the dynamics of water balance hence this necessitates for considering the growth stage specific water distribution to distinct paddy hrus in the subsequent swat pothole revisions incorporation of these modifications in the future could transform the swat pothole into a compact agro hydrological model that can conceptualize both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the paddy field hydrology in the catchment scale applications in the existing swat pothole variants the water balance components of etact and percolation losses in the paddy field are estimated as arbitrary fractions of pet and precipitation respectively which are far from reality conversely in the proposed fully physically based pothole approach in the swat ep model etact is estimated by the fao 56 penman monteith equation using both the energy budget and mass transfer principle accounting for the soil moisture stress similarly the deep percolation losses in the paddy field during the drying and ponding phases are estimated by the physically based darcy s equation consequently the remaining water balance components such as the soil moisture storage and baseflow are estimated to be more close to the observations 7 conclusions for integrated water resources management the hydrological flux components need to be estimated accurately from paddy dominated catchments in this context a novel physically based swat enhanced pothole module swat ep was advocated in this study to simulate the streamflow generation in such type of catchments addressing the inconsistent hydrological process descriptions in the existing approaches the proposed swat ep was evaluated in a real reservoir catchment command for daily streamflow simulation under alternate wetting and drying conditions the results reveal that the swat ep model outperformed all the existing swat pothole variants with the following improved features i pedo transfer function based estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity to represent the soil hydraulic parameter in the paddy fields ii process dynamics of soil water movement under both ponding and drying phases of vadose zone representing alternate wetting and drying conditions of irrigation application iii reduced evapotranspiration flux under soil moisture deficit condition and iv role of irrigation return flow in streamflow simulation process the specific conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the inclusion of added physical process dynamics in the swat ep model made the model more parsimonious with 17 calibration parameters than the existing swat pothole approach with 25 model parameters this could reduce the predictive uncertainty significantly in the proposed swat ep approach 2 under both the irrigated and non irrigated catchment conditions with or without significant paddy land uses the streamflow estimation efficiency increased in the order swat p swat cn swat ps swat ep revealing that the proposed swat ep model is the best approach the swat ep approach is also more consistent in reproducing the observed high and low flows with the baseflow recession curves 3 the water balance analysis revealed that the developed swat ep approach simulated the water balance components more precisely than the existing approaches which is consistent with the rainfall runoff transformation dynamics the existing swat p approach always overestimated the et act due to the definition of et act as the unique function of leaf area index ignoring the deficit soil moisture condition moreover the improved performance of swat ep nse 0 85 over swat p nse 0 22 in reproducing the daily scale et act could be suitably utilized for irrigation planning in the command area since swat cn is not capable of conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics under awd condition it should not be used for the estimation of water balance components in paddy dominated catchments 4 the swat ep exhibits least predictive uncertainty in streamflow simulation under both the rainfed and irrigated catchment conditions with higher p factor 0 76 0 81 and lower r factor 0 51 0 53 the quantile regression based uncertainty analysis revealed that the uncertainty is higher in the case of irrigated paddy fields than the rainfed paddy fields the enhanced modeling approach of the swat ep could have the potential benefits to various studies involving integrated water resource management activities in complex river catchment command regions to improve the validity and applicability of the proposed model it should be evaluated under varying climatic and topographic conditions in the future studies credit authorship contribution statement sonam sandeep dash conceptualization data curation software formal analysis writing original

5358,water resource is an irreplaceable natural resource for the development of human society as a key parameter of irrigation scheduling crop coefficient has an important reference value for precision irrigation and water saving in agriculture although crop coefficient method proposed by fao has been verified in many areas and crops how the crop coefficient varied during a long period and whether it was stable during different years remain uncertain we investigated the maize evapotranspiration etc reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficient kc under film mulch in northwest china through a 12 year crop evapotranspiration observation by using the eddy covariance system from 2007 to 2018 the annual average etc was 481 68 mm and the annual average et0 was 551 48 mm to our surprise not only the interannual variation in etc and et0 was small over a 12 year period the average crop coefficient remained more stable over a long period the mean annual kc was 0 88 and the coefficient of variation was only 12 18 in the whole process of crop growth and development crop coefficient advised by fao kc fao can reflect the variation of observed crop coefficient kc loc and kc fao is only 7 higher than kc loc the kc lai and gdd were fitted by cubic polynomials and the determination coefficient r2 were 0 74 and 0 75 respectively our study demonstrates the stability of maize crop coefficient the close relation between crop coefficient with lai and gdd and the high reliability of the crop coefficient modelling method advised by fao this study provides an important scientific basis for the practice of agricultural irrigation management keywords crop coefficient maize evapotranspiration film mulching border irrigation 1 introduction water shortage particularly the lack of agricultural irrigation water is a global problem pfisteret al 2011 that leads to reduced crop production and food shortages that result in hunger and poverty and has become an important factor that impinges on social development irrigation is the largest consumer of available water in the world and the crop evapotranspiration etc from farmland is the primary form of agricultural water consumption therefore reducing evapotranspiration is the key to achieving agricultural water savings to effectively reduce the evapotranspiration from farmland water saving technologies such as mulching and drip irrigation have been widely used around the world dong et al 2009 the crop coefficient kc can be defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 and is an important basis for planning irrigation systems in agriculture however how etc and the kc will change and how to accurately estimate etc and the kc in response to plastic film mulching are still unclear and require further study to date there have been many studies on the water saving effect of mulching these have primarily focused on three aspects of mulching the first is that mulching has a significant effect on reducing crop evapotranspiration in a study of mulching vs non mulching the experimental results showed that mulching can effectively reduce crop evapotranspiration by 22 patil and tiwari 2018 second mulching can improve soil moisture soil temperature and the crop germination rate some studies have shown that mulching not only reduces soil evaporation and improves soil temperature but also effectively controls weeds and promotes the growth and development of crops hou et al 2010 third the research focus is the estimation of etc and the kc under mulching conditions li et al 2013 proposed a method of calculating etc under the condition of mulching which provides an important method for the calculation of crop water demand li et al 2013 to better guide the practice of estimating etc the fao proposed crop coefficients for different crops at different growth stages the crop coefficient is affected by many factors including climate irrigation method and other management measures kang et al 2003 yang et al 2016 in the north china plain for the winter wheat spring maize intercropping system research has shown that compared with a single crop an intercropping system changes the crop coefficient gao et al 2009 in the arid area of northwest china the crop coefficient was related to the level of irrigation han et al 2019 under the dual effects of mulching and drip irrigation the local crop coefficient also changed significantly compared with the crop coefficient recommended by the fao yang et al 2016 the study on the crop coefficient of drip irrigated cotton under plastic mulched found that kc decreased significantly in the initial and developmental growth stage moreover mulching can not only increase crop yield but also reduce evapotranspiration and crop coefficient patil and tiwari 2018 therefore in different regions and under different management measures researchers need to consider whether the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 is applicable and whether to adjust the reference value of the crop coefficient based on the actual conditions of the region although many studies have already been conducted the results have primarily involved data over a short time scale and little attention has been paid to how etc and the kc change and whether the kc has interannual stability under the condition of long term mulching the traditional measurement methods such as the water consumption balance method can only determine the crop coefficient over a certain period of time and cannot accurately determine the daily crop coefficient in addition the crop coefficient method proposed by the fao has been verified in many areas and for many crops but it is not clear how accurate it is under the condition of mulching therefore to address these issues we used the eddy covariance technique to conduct field observations on maize in a film mulched field in the arid area of northwest china for 12 consecutive years the main purposes of this study were 1 to analyse the changes to etc et0 and the kc of spring maize under film mulch and to test the stability of the kc 2 to verify the applicability of the crop coefficient method proposed by the fao under the condition of film mulch and 3 to explore the relationship between the kc and crop factors and meteorological factors this study will provide an important scientific basis for revealing the water saving effect of mulching 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our experiment was conducted in an arid area of northwestern china during the spring maize growing season from 2007 to 2018 this site is located in the shiyanghe river basin 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m which is the third largest river in the hexi corridor of gansu province the average temperature is 8 c the annual accumulated temperature is 3550 c the average annual sunshine duration is 3000 h and the frost free period is 150 days the annual precipitation is only 164 mm but the annual pan evaporation is greater than 2000 mm the groundwater depth is 40 50 m the soil in the test area is sandy loam li et al 2014 the soil texture at 0 0 8 m deep is silty loam li et al 2015 the average soil dry bulk is 1 52 g cm 3 and the average field capacity is 0 29 m3 m 3 the annual irrigation volume for 2007 2018 is shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of etc meteorological factors and leaf area index the daily maize evapotranspiration and meteorological factors were measured using the eddy covariance ec technique maize was the major crop in the surrounding farmland and its planting area was large enough to provide adequate fetch for the ec measurement the ec system consisted of an open path infrared gas analyser ec150 campbell scientific inc usa a three dimensional anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa and temperature and humidity sensors hmp155a csi usa these sensors were installed 3 5 m above the ground radiation was monitored with a radiation metre cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands which was installed at a height of 4 m above the ground and was oriented towards the south two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflua netherlands were installed at a depth of 5 cm below the soil surface one was installed beneath bare soil and the other was installed under the mulch the energy closure rates during 2007 to 2018 were 93 95 78 84 79 82 76 74 70 71 69 and 73 respectively from the seedling stage to crop harvest the leaf area index of maize was measured manually at intervals of seven to ten days to obtain accurate experimental results we chose six different locations within the experimental field with nine representative plants at each location a measuring tape was used to measure the length and width of each leaf the lai of the maize was then obtained using the following formula eq 1 guo et al 2019 2 lai 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s where lai is the leaf area index 0 74 is the empirical constant li is the length of leaf i wi is the width of leaf i and d and s are the distance between two rows and the space between two plants respectively 2 3 calculation of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient using the fao 56 single coefficient method under the condition of sufficient irrigation crop evapotranspiration is estimated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the coefficient kc that reflects the specific characteristics of the crop the reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation as recommended by allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g 900 t a

maize under standard conditions the single crop coefficient kc is described by kc ini kc mid and kc end for the initial middle and late growth stages respectively with respective recommended values of 0 3 1 20 and 0 6 0 35 for maize allen et al 1998 however to improve the estimation of the kc curve for a specific site the recommended values need to be adjusted to obtain a local kc value when the amount of infiltration from precipitation or irrigation is relatively small infiltration depth is 10 mm or less the kc ini needs to be adjusted for the early growing season calibration of kc ini is usually made according to figure 29 in fao 56 according to fao 56 the kc ini is estimated as a function of the average interval between wetting events and the evaporation rate et0 the kc mid and kc end should be adjusted by wind speed minimum relative humidity and crop height the adjustment equation is as follows 5 k c f a o m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where kc fao

available energy rn g was 9 86 mj m 2 d 1 and showed a downward trend from 2011 to 2014 the annual average value of available energy rn g was lowest in 2012 8 35 mj m 2 d 1 from 2015 to 2018 the available energy was greater than the multi year average and was greatest in 2016 11 32 mj m 2 d 1 the average air temperature ta during the growth period of the crops showed little variation as with rn g the average temperature was highest in 2016 20 06 c the fluctuation in wind speed u2 was demonstrable at a height of 2 m the average wind speed was 0 94 1 65 m s 1 from 2007 to 2018 and was lowest in 2012 the relative humidity rh was below average from 2015 to 2018 with the lowest value 36 67 in 2016 the variation of the maize leaf area index from 2007 to 2018 is shown in fig 2 generally it shows a parabolic trend and changes slowly during the early stage after entering the period of rapid growth the lai increased rapidly peaked in the middle of july and then began to decrease slowly after 2014 the lai exhibited a change during the middle and late growth periods this is because the maize planted in this area from 2014 to 2018 was intended for seed production due to special management measures that require the removal of part of the plant there was a sudden change in the lai as seen in fig 2 there was a change in the maximum leaf area index laimax between 2007 and 2018 overall the laimax was highest in 2016 6 14 and lowest 3 64 in 2013 3 2 seasonal and interannual variations of et0 etc and kc during 2007 2018 the seasonal variation in et0 and etc from 2007 to 2018 is shown in fig 3 during the growth period of the crops the fluctuation in et0 was clear and affected by climate factors the daily average et0 varied from 0 47 to 7 64 mm d 1 in contrast the etc showed clear seasonal variation during the growth period at the early stage of growth the etc was low and gradually increased with the growth and development of the crops it peaked at the end of july and then decreased slowly with ageing of and subsequent changes in the crops the maximum daily average etc was 9 82 mm d 1 during the early stage of growth the etc was much less than the et0 so the kc at this stage was lower during the middle stage of growth the etc increased significantly whereas there was no significant change in the et0 the kc also increased during this stage and was greater than 1 at some points as the crops matured with the senescence and yellowing of the plant leaves and the change in environmental factors the transpiration capacity of the plants decreased the etc gradually decreased and the kc also slowly decreased fig 4 shows the variation in monthly mean values of et0 etc and the kc from may to september from 2007 to 2018 under the dual influence of crop growth and environmental factors the daily average value of etc was lowest in may and highest in july the rate of change variation in etc from may through september was 1 28 3 43 4 91 3 93 and 2 6 mm d 1 respectively compared with etc the et0 showed little change ranging from 2 88 to 4 25 mm d 1 the kc increased month by month in may june and july and then stabilized the average value of the kc in each month from may to september was 0 35 0 93 1 16 1 08 and 0 9 respectively there was some interannual variation from 2007 to 2018 in the average etc et0 and kc compared with the etc the et0 changed only slightly over the 12 years fig 5 as seen in fig 5 the etc from 2011 to 2014 was significantly lower than in other years with an average annual etc of 481 68 mm the lowest etc was in 2013 352 38 mm and reached 615 90 mm in 2015 with a coefficient of variation of 16 97 over 12 years during the period 2015 2018 the et0 was significantly larger than in other years based on the meteorological conditions of that year the available energy from 2011 to 2014 was significantly lower than that in other years resulting in a decrease in etc and et0 the annual average et0 was 525 40 mm and the coefficient of variation was 16 90 the change in the kc was smaller than the change in etc overall the average kc was 0 88 the kc was greater than 1 1 07 in 2009 and 2014 the minimum occurred in 2011 0 75 and the coefficient of variation was 12 18 table 2 the coefficient of variation is a statistical measure of the degree of variation in the observed values and is shown for the data over 12 consecutive years the kc remained stable over a long period of time with only a small degree of variation 3 3 crop coefficient fig 6 shows the seasonal variation in the kc loc and kc fao during the growth period of spring maize from 2007 to 2018 as previously mentioned the value of the kc fao was corrected according to the method provided by fao 56 as seen from fig 6 the kc fao generally reflected the trend of the kc loc during the early stage there was intense variation in the kc loc but during the middle stage the kc loc tended to be stable traditional surface irrigation was used in the experimental area of this study after correction the value of the kc loc mid ranged from 1 17 to 1 24 and the multi year average was 1 21 due to variation in the harvest dates each year the kc loc end varied from year to year during the early stage of growth due to the small leaf area index and low rates of transpiration of the crops the kc loc was small sometimes near 0 and the multi year mean crop coefficient ranged from 0 15 to 0 35 with the growth and development of spring maize the transpiration of the leaves increased and the kc loc increased gradually and reached a peak during the first ten days of july except for 2009 the peak value of the kc loc was approximately 1 2 1 35 during the late growth stage of spring maize the kc decreased gradually with leaf senescence the kc loc end depended on the final harvest date based on the relationship between the kc loc and the crop growth period the kc could be predicted over time according to the seasonal variation of kc loc we obtained the crop coefficients of different growth stages of spring maize corresponding to fao 56 the results showed that kc loc ini and kc fao ini were basically close to each other in the initial stages of crop growth and in the middle growing season kc fao mid was greater than kc loc mid at the end of the spring maize season the 12 year average value of kc loc end was 0 61 the crop coefficient is the key reference point when planning an irrigation system can the crop coefficient recommended by the fao replace the local crop coefficient fig 7 shows the comparison between the kc loc and the kc fao from 2007 to 2018 the annual data show that the kc loc calculated from the data is smaller than the adjusted kc fao using a consistency test it was found that there was a good consistency between the two measures and the pearson coefficient was greater than 0 85 p 0 001 in 2012 the root mean square error was 0 23 which was the maximum in 12 years however the minimum rmse value was 0 11 in 2010 in order to further evaluate the relationship between kc fao and kc loc we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient to evaluate the overall analysis of the 12 year dataset showed that there is a significant linear relationship between the kc loc and the kc fao p 0 001 in which the kc loc was 7 lower than the kc fao indicating that the observed crop coefficient was generally lower than the fao recommended value fig 8 3 4 relationships between crop coefficient with lai and gdd the calculation of the crop coefficient is the basis for estimating agricultural irrigation indexes such as crop water demand the accurate calculation of the crop coefficient is of great practical significance for improving the water use efficiency of farmland and formulating a scientific and appropriate irrigation system in areas where data is lacking can we use simple and easily available data to predict the actual crop coefficient to answer this we analysed the relationship among crop coefficient leaf area index and accumulated growth temperature gdd as seen in fig 9 the kc and lai exhibited a cubic polynomial relationship from 2007 to 2018 when the lai 2 the kc increased rapidly with an increase in lai when the lai 2 the kc increased slowly with an increase in lai fig 10 shows the relationship between the kc and gdd the crop coefficient had a parabolic relationship with gdd at gdd 2000 c the kc increased rapidly with an increase in gdd when the gdd 2000 c the kc decreased with an increase in gdd which was consistent with the growth and development process of the crops in order to obtain a reliable and consistent calculation formula we used the data from 2007 to 2012 to fit the relationship between kc lai and gdd the relationship among kc lai and gdd was as follows 13 k c 0 01 l a i 3 0 12 l a i 2 0 49 l a i 0 34 r 2 0 74 14 k c 7 63 1 0 11 g d d 3 7 22 10 9 g d d 2 8 52 10 4 g d d 0 12 r 2 0 75 the results showed that the accuracy of the lai and the gdd in estimating the daily variation in the kc was similar fig 11 but the lai is a direct physiological index that characterises crop growth which may be related to the variability in crop transpiration in order to verify the applicability of the formulas we calculated the crop coefficient from 2013 to 2018 by the formula 13 and 14 and made a comparison with kc loc by comparing kc loc with kc calculated by formulas 13 and 14 the results showed that kc calculated based on lai changed slowly in the early stage of growth and it changed rapidly as the crops entered the fast growing period and maintained at a high level after the middle stage of growth as lai changed slowly in the late growth period of spring maize the calculated crop coefficient was basically stable in the later period however since gdd was constantly changing with the growth and development of crops there is a significant downward trend in the later stages generally speaking the crop coefficient calculated based on lai was close to the observed value in the early and middle period of growth while the variation of the crop coefficient calculated based on gdd was similar to the observed value in the later period and the peak value of crop coefficient calculated by gdd was greater than that calculated by lai which was closer to the observed value therefore we can use the lai or the gdd to estimate the spring maize kc in an arid area which provides a basis for evapotranspiration simulation in a maize field fig 12 3 5 the accuracy of et calculated with different crop coefficients in order to compare the precision of different crop coefficients the evapotranspiration of spring maize was calculated by using different crop coefficients the results showed that the 12 year average of etkc loc calculated by using the crop coefficient in table 3 was very close to the observed value etec and the etkc fao which was calculated based on the crop coefficient recommended by fao was 8 08 higher than compared with etkc lai calculated based on the relationship between crop coefficient and lai etkc gdd calculated based on formula 14 was closer to the measured value it was only 2 29 higher than etec therefore according to the accuracy of calculating total etc the ranking of four kinds of crop coefficients is kc loc kc gdd kc fao and kc lai table 4 4 discussion 4 1 the stability of crop coefficient the homeostasis hypothesis refers to the fact that the chemical element composition in a living body will not change greatly under the constantly changing environment and the element composition in the body can basically remain stable in our study the variation coefficient of crop coefficient in 12 years was only 0 12 which to some extent confirmed the ability of plants to maintain stable growth conditions in changing environments in order to further test the stability of crop coefficient we analyzed the variation coefficient of crop coefficient in different growth stages of spring maize the results showed that the coefficient of variation of crop coefficient was 0 35 in the early stage 0 06 in the middle stage and 0 20 in the later stage table 5 kang et al obtained from 10 years research data that the variation coefficient of maize crop coefficient was only 0 08 while that of wheat was 0 10 kang et al 2003 which was very close to our research results the study on crop coefficient in beijing also found that the crop coefficient under low salt stress in 2012 and 2013 was 0 97 and 1 11 respectively and the coefficient of variation was only 0 07 the study on cotton in northwest china showed that the variation coefficient of crop coefficient between 2012 and 2014 was only 0 03 yang et al 2016 the above researches shows that the crop coefficient the crop coefficient is stable over many years 4 2 can the adjusted kc fao better replace kc loc the analysis of 12 years of data shows that there is a significant linear correlation between the corrected kc fao and the kc loc the kc fao is 1 07 times the kc loc by comparing etc of two parameters the results showed that etc calculated based on kc fao is 3 higher than etc calculated based on kc loc there is a significant linear relationship between the etkc fao and etkc loc p 0 001 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 0 88 fig 13 all the results showed that the crop coefficient method recommended by the fao has a high accuracy and applicability yang et al 2016 also found that the average value of the kc loc was very close to the adjusted kc fao during the crop growth period and was 3 5 lower than the kc fao in humid areas it was found that when rainfall and irrigation times were lower during the early stage of crop growth the crop coefficients kc ini and kc ini recommended by fao 56 for the early stage of crop biology were also consistent with the kc fao whereas the kc mid was always lower than the fao s adjusted values by approximately 15 facchi et al 2013 similarly experiments in beijing china showed that there was no difference between the kc loc and the kc fao with or without straw mulching when the level of irrigation was low wang et al 2018 the kc fao generally reflected the trend of the kc loc throughout the entire growth period the kc loc of the mulching treatment was lower than in the treatment with no mulching during the early and late crop stages and the effect of mulching on the kc loc was more noticeable during the early and late stages of growth with values 16 lower in the mulching treatment this effect is negligible during the intermediate growth stage han et al 2019 according to a study of cotton crop coefficients in the humid area of the south central united states the kc loc was 26 lower than the kc fao during the early growth stage of cotton whereas during the middle growth stage the two values were very close with the kc loc only 6 lower than the kc fao kumar et al 2015 however in brazil the average difference between the kc fao and the kc ini kc mid and kc end were 13 18 and 10 respectively bezerra et al 2012 the research on crop coefficients cited above showed similar results the kc loc was lower than the kc fao to varying degrees at all growth stages in the early growth stage of crops the difference is larger whereas in the middle and late growth stages the difference is smaller in arid areas the difference between the kc loc and the kc fao is smaller than in non arid areas the above research indicates that the crop coefficient method recommended by fao has certain reference value for guiding the development of irrigation system in regions where et data is insufficient 4 3 the relationship between kc with lai and gdd according to our research results the crop coefficient is closely related to the growth process of the crops from the relationship among the crop coefficient leaf area index and accumulated growth temperature we established a regression equation to predict the maize crop coefficient much research has been conducted on the determination methods and numerical calculation of crop coefficients for different regions and crops kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 shukla et al 2014 kang et al 2003 divided the relationship between kc and lai into two parts based on the size of the lai and obtained a segmentation model suitable for the prediction of the kc in summer maize however in northwest china studies on the coefficients of cotton and maize crops found that the relationship between the kc and lai was logarithmic yang et al 2016 li et al 2008 when studying the crop coefficient of grapes it was found that the relationship between the kc and lai was linear wang et al 2019 the results of this 12 year long term study showed that the cubic polynomial function was best to simulate the relationship between crop coefficient and leaf area index the relationship between the kc and gdd is generally considered to be best fit by a polynomial yang et al 2016 used cubic polynomials to fit the relationship between the kc and gdd with a good result and a determination coefficient of 0 96 yang et al 2016 similarly a study of summer maize in the north china plain also showed that the relationship between the kc and gdd is a cubic polynomial r2 0 80 ji et al 2017 the research on spring maize in northwest china was consistent with our research results ji et al 2017 the relationship between crop coefficient and gdd is best represented by a cubic polynomial 5 conclusion according to the above analysis these conclusions can be draw from 1 the crop coefficient kc varied gently with a low variation coefficient of 0 12 the multiyear average of maize kc under film mulching condition with border irrigation was 0 88 the parameter would play a critical role in designing the irrigation schedule 2 the high reliability of the kc modelling method recommended by fao in northwest china was confirmed by the 12 years measurements the total evapotranspiration calculated by the adjusted kc fao method was 8 08 higher than the measured value 3 kc has a close relationship between lai and gdd the determination coefficients of kc vs lai and kc vs gpp were 0 74and 0 75 respectively lai and gdd play an important role in degerming kc variation our study confirmed the stability of crop coefficient and the reliability of kc fao method using the 12 years measurements which will provide an important scientific basis for precision irrigation management in the global agricultural practise credit authorship contribution statement hui guo data curation

5358,water resource is an irreplaceable natural resource for the development of human society as a key parameter of irrigation scheduling crop coefficient has an important reference value for precision irrigation and water saving in agriculture although crop coefficient method proposed by fao has been verified in many areas and crops how the crop coefficient varied during a long period and whether it was stable during different years remain uncertain we investigated the maize evapotranspiration etc reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficient kc under film mulch in northwest china through a 12 year crop evapotranspiration observation by using the eddy covariance system from 2007 to 2018 the annual average etc was 481 68 mm and the annual average et0 was 551 48 mm to our surprise not only the interannual variation in etc and et0 was small over a 12 year period the average crop coefficient remained more stable over a long period the mean annual kc was 0 88 and the coefficient of variation was only 12 18 in the whole process of crop growth and development crop coefficient advised by fao kc fao can reflect the variation of observed crop coefficient kc loc and kc fao is only 7 higher than kc loc the kc lai and gdd were fitted by cubic polynomials and the determination coefficient r2 were 0 74 and 0 75 respectively our study demonstrates the stability of maize crop coefficient the close relation between crop coefficient with lai and gdd and the high reliability of the crop coefficient modelling method advised by fao this study provides an important scientific basis for the practice of agricultural irrigation management keywords crop coefficient maize evapotranspiration film mulching border irrigation 1 introduction water shortage particularly the lack of agricultural irrigation water is a global problem pfisteret al 2011 that leads to reduced crop production and food shortages that result in hunger and poverty and has become an important factor that impinges on social development irrigation is the largest consumer of available water in the world and the crop evapotranspiration etc from farmland is the primary form of agricultural water consumption therefore reducing evapotranspiration is the key to achieving agricultural water savings to effectively reduce the evapotranspiration from farmland water saving technologies such as mulching and drip irrigation have been widely used around the world dong et al 2009 the crop coefficient kc can be defined as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration to reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 and is an important basis for planning irrigation systems in agriculture however how etc and the kc will change and how to accurately estimate etc and the kc in response to plastic film mulching are still unclear and require further study to date there have been many studies on the water saving effect of mulching these have primarily focused on three aspects of mulching the first is that mulching has a significant effect on reducing crop evapotranspiration in a study of mulching vs non mulching the experimental results showed that mulching can effectively reduce crop evapotranspiration by 22 patil and tiwari 2018 second mulching can improve soil moisture soil temperature and the crop germination rate some studies have shown that mulching not only reduces soil evaporation and improves soil temperature but also effectively controls weeds and promotes the growth and development of crops hou et al 2010 third the research focus is the estimation of etc and the kc under mulching conditions li et al 2013 proposed a method of calculating etc under the condition of mulching which provides an important method for the calculation of crop water demand li et al 2013 to better guide the practice of estimating etc the fao proposed crop coefficients for different crops at different growth stages the crop coefficient is affected by many factors including climate irrigation method and other management measures kang et al 2003 yang et al 2016 in the north china plain for the winter wheat spring maize intercropping system research has shown that compared with a single crop an intercropping system changes the crop coefficient gao et al 2009 in the arid area of northwest china the crop coefficient was related to the level of irrigation han et al 2019 under the dual effects of mulching and drip irrigation the local crop coefficient also changed significantly compared with the crop coefficient recommended by the fao yang et al 2016 the study on the crop coefficient of drip irrigated cotton under plastic mulched found that kc decreased significantly in the initial and developmental growth stage moreover mulching can not only increase crop yield but also reduce evapotranspiration and crop coefficient patil and tiwari 2018 therefore in different regions and under different management measures researchers need to consider whether the crop coefficient recommended by fao 56 is applicable and whether to adjust the reference value of the crop coefficient based on the actual conditions of the region although many studies have already been conducted the results have primarily involved data over a short time scale and little attention has been paid to how etc and the kc change and whether the kc has interannual stability under the condition of long term mulching the traditional measurement methods such as the water consumption balance method can only determine the crop coefficient over a certain period of time and cannot accurately determine the daily crop coefficient in addition the crop coefficient method proposed by the fao has been verified in many areas and for many crops but it is not clear how accurate it is under the condition of mulching therefore to address these issues we used the eddy covariance technique to conduct field observations on maize in a film mulched field in the arid area of northwest china for 12 consecutive years the main purposes of this study were 1 to analyse the changes to etc et0 and the kc of spring maize under film mulch and to test the stability of the kc 2 to verify the applicability of the crop coefficient method proposed by the fao under the condition of film mulch and 3 to explore the relationship between the kc and crop factors and meteorological factors this study will provide an important scientific basis for revealing the water saving effect of mulching 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our experiment was conducted in an arid area of northwestern china during the spring maize growing season from 2007 to 2018 this site is located in the shiyanghe river basin 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m which is the third largest river in the hexi corridor of gansu province the average temperature is 8 c the annual accumulated temperature is 3550 c the average annual sunshine duration is 3000 h and the frost free period is 150 days the annual precipitation is only 164 mm but the annual pan evaporation is greater than 2000 mm the groundwater depth is 40 50 m the soil in the test area is sandy loam li et al 2014 the soil texture at 0 0 8 m deep is silty loam li et al 2015 the average soil dry bulk is 1 52 g cm 3 and the average field capacity is 0 29 m3 m 3 the annual irrigation volume for 2007 2018 is shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of etc meteorological factors and leaf area index the daily maize evapotranspiration and meteorological factors were measured using the eddy covariance ec technique maize was the major crop in the surrounding farmland and its planting area was large enough to provide adequate fetch for the ec measurement the ec system consisted of an open path infrared gas analyser ec150 campbell scientific inc usa a three dimensional anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa and temperature and humidity sensors hmp155a csi usa these sensors were installed 3 5 m above the ground radiation was monitored with a radiation metre cnr4 kipp zonen netherlands which was installed at a height of 4 m above the ground and was oriented towards the south two soil heat flux plates hfp01 hukseflua netherlands were installed at a depth of 5 cm below the soil surface one was installed beneath bare soil and the other was installed under the mulch the energy closure rates during 2007 to 2018 were 93 95 78 84 79 82 76 74 70 71 69 and 73 respectively from the seedling stage to crop harvest the leaf area index of maize was measured manually at intervals of seven to ten days to obtain accurate experimental results we chose six different locations within the experimental field with nine representative plants at each location a measuring tape was used to measure the length and width of each leaf the lai of the maize was then obtained using the following formula eq 1 guo et al 2019 2 lai 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s where lai is the leaf area index 0 74 is the empirical constant li is the length of leaf i wi is the width of leaf i and d and s are the distance between two rows and the space between two plants respectively 2 3 calculation of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient using the fao 56 single coefficient method under the condition of sufficient irrigation crop evapotranspiration is estimated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by the coefficient kc that reflects the specific characteristics of the crop the reference evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation as recommended by allen et al 1998 3 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g 900 t a

maize under standard conditions the single crop coefficient kc is described by kc ini kc mid and kc end for the initial middle and late growth stages respectively with respective recommended values of 0 3 1 20 and 0 6 0 35 for maize allen et al 1998 however to improve the estimation of the kc curve for a specific site the recommended values need to be adjusted to obtain a local kc value when the amount of infiltration from precipitation or irrigation is relatively small infiltration depth is 10 mm or less the kc ini needs to be adjusted for the early growing season calibration of kc ini is usually made according to figure 29 in fao 56 according to fao 56 the kc ini is estimated as a function of the average interval between wetting events and the evaporation rate et0 the kc mid and kc end should be adjusted by wind speed minimum relative humidity and crop height the adjustment equation is as follows 5 k c f a o m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h min 45 h 3 0 3 where kc fao

available energy rn g was 9 86 mj m 2 d 1 and showed a downward trend from 2011 to 2014 the annual average value of available energy rn g was lowest in 2012 8 35 mj m 2 d 1 from 2015 to 2018 the available energy was greater than the multi year average and was greatest in 2016 11 32 mj m 2 d 1 the average air temperature ta during the growth period of the crops showed little variation as with rn g the average temperature was highest in 2016 20 06 c the fluctuation in wind speed u2 was demonstrable at a height of 2 m the average wind speed was 0 94 1 65 m s 1 from 2007 to 2018 and was lowest in 2012 the relative humidity rh was below average from 2015 to 2018 with the lowest value 36 67 in 2016 the variation of the maize leaf area index from 2007 to 2018 is shown in fig 2 generally it shows a parabolic trend and changes slowly during the early stage after entering the period of rapid growth the lai increased rapidly peaked in the middle of july and then began to decrease slowly after 2014 the lai exhibited a change during the middle and late growth periods this is because the maize planted in this area from 2014 to 2018 was intended for seed production due to special management measures that require the removal of part of the plant there was a sudden change in the lai as seen in fig 2 there was a change in the maximum leaf area index laimax between 2007 and 2018 overall the laimax was highest in 2016 6 14 and lowest 3 64 in 2013 3 2 seasonal and interannual variations of et0 etc and kc during 2007 2018 the seasonal variation in et0 and etc from 2007 to 2018 is shown in fig 3 during the growth period of the crops the fluctuation in et0 was clear and affected by climate factors the daily average et0 varied from 0 47 to 7 64 mm d 1 in contrast the etc showed clear seasonal variation during the growth period at the early stage of growth the etc was low and gradually increased with the growth and development of the crops it peaked at the end of july and then decreased slowly with ageing of and subsequent changes in the crops the maximum daily average etc was 9 82 mm d 1 during the early stage of growth the etc was much less than the et0 so the kc at this stage was lower during the middle stage of growth the etc increased significantly whereas there was no significant change in the et0 the kc also increased during this stage and was greater than 1 at some points as the crops matured with the senescence and yellowing of the plant leaves and the change in environmental factors the transpiration capacity of the plants decreased the etc gradually decreased and the kc also slowly decreased fig 4 shows the variation in monthly mean values of et0 etc and the kc from may to september from 2007 to 2018 under the dual influence of crop growth and environmental factors the daily average value of etc was lowest in may and highest in july the rate of change variation in etc from may through september was 1 28 3 43 4 91 3 93 and 2 6 mm d 1 respectively compared with etc the et0 showed little change ranging from 2 88 to 4 25 mm d 1 the kc increased month by month in may june and july and then stabilized the average value of the kc in each month from may to september was 0 35 0 93 1 16 1 08 and 0 9 respectively there was some interannual variation from 2007 to 2018 in the average etc et0 and kc compared with the etc the et0 changed only slightly over the 12 years fig 5 as seen in fig 5 the etc from 2011 to 2014 was significantly lower than in other years with an average annual etc of 481 68 mm the lowest etc was in 2013 352 38 mm and reached 615 90 mm in 2015 with a coefficient of variation of 16 97 over 12 years during the period 2015 2018 the et0 was significantly larger than in other years based on the meteorological conditions of that year the available energy from 2011 to 2014 was significantly lower than that in other years resulting in a decrease in etc and et0 the annual average et0 was 525 40 mm and the coefficient of variation was 16 90 the change in the kc was smaller than the change in etc overall the average kc was 0 88 the kc was greater than 1 1 07 in 2009 and 2014 the minimum occurred in 2011 0 75 and the coefficient of variation was 12 18 table 2 the coefficient of variation is a statistical measure of the degree of variation in the observed values and is shown for the data over 12 consecutive years the kc remained stable over a long period of time with only a small degree of variation 3 3 crop coefficient fig 6 shows the seasonal variation in the kc loc and kc fao during the growth period of spring maize from 2007 to 2018 as previously mentioned the value of the kc fao was corrected according to the method provided by fao 56 as seen from fig 6 the kc fao generally reflected the trend of the kc loc during the early stage there was intense variation in the kc loc but during the middle stage the kc loc tended to be stable traditional surface irrigation was used in the experimental area of this study after correction the value of the kc loc mid ranged from 1 17 to 1 24 and the multi year average was 1 21 due to variation in the harvest dates each year the kc loc end varied from year to year during the early stage of growth due to the small leaf area index and low rates of transpiration of the crops the kc loc was small sometimes near 0 and the multi year mean crop coefficient ranged from 0 15 to 0 35 with the growth and development of spring maize the transpiration of the leaves increased and the kc loc increased gradually and reached a peak during the first ten days of july except for 2009 the peak value of the kc loc was approximately 1 2 1 35 during the late growth stage of spring maize the kc decreased gradually with leaf senescence the kc loc end depended on the final harvest date based on the relationship between the kc loc and the crop growth period the kc could be predicted over time according to the seasonal variation of kc loc we obtained the crop coefficients of different growth stages of spring maize corresponding to fao 56 the results showed that kc loc ini and kc fao ini were basically close to each other in the initial stages of crop growth and in the middle growing season kc fao mid was greater than kc loc mid at the end of the spring maize season the 12 year average value of kc loc end was 0 61 the crop coefficient is the key reference point when planning an irrigation system can the crop coefficient recommended by the fao replace the local crop coefficient fig 7 shows the comparison between the kc loc and the kc fao from 2007 to 2018 the annual data show that the kc loc calculated from the data is smaller than the adjusted kc fao using a consistency test it was found that there was a good consistency between the two measures and the pearson coefficient was greater than 0 85 p 0 001 in 2012 the root mean square error was 0 23 which was the maximum in 12 years however the minimum rmse value was 0 11 in 2010 in order to further evaluate the relationship between kc fao and kc loc we use the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient to evaluate the overall analysis of the 12 year dataset showed that there is a significant linear relationship between the kc loc and the kc fao p 0 001 in which the kc loc was 7 lower than the kc fao indicating that the observed crop coefficient was generally lower than the fao recommended value fig 8 3 4 relationships between crop coefficient with lai and gdd the calculation of the crop coefficient is the basis for estimating agricultural irrigation indexes such as crop water demand the accurate calculation of the crop coefficient is of great practical significance for improving the water use efficiency of farmland and formulating a scientific and appropriate irrigation system in areas where data is lacking can we use simple and easily available data to predict the actual crop coefficient to answer this we analysed the relationship among crop coefficient leaf area index and accumulated growth temperature gdd as seen in fig 9 the kc and lai exhibited a cubic polynomial relationship from 2007 to 2018 when the lai 2 the kc increased rapidly with an increase in lai when the lai 2 the kc increased slowly with an increase in lai fig 10 shows the relationship between the kc and gdd the crop coefficient had a parabolic relationship with gdd at gdd 2000 c the kc increased rapidly with an increase in gdd when the gdd 2000 c the kc decreased with an increase in gdd which was consistent with the growth and development process of the crops in order to obtain a reliable and consistent calculation formula we used the data from 2007 to 2012 to fit the relationship between kc lai and gdd the relationship among kc lai and gdd was as follows 13 k c 0 01 l a i 3 0 12 l a i 2 0 49 l a i 0 34 r 2 0 74 14 k c 7 63 1 0 11 g d d 3 7 22 10 9 g d d 2 8 52 10 4 g d d 0 12 r 2 0 75 the results showed that the accuracy of the lai and the gdd in estimating the daily variation in the kc was similar fig 11 but the lai is a direct physiological index that characterises crop growth which may be related to the variability in crop transpiration in order to verify the applicability of the formulas we calculated the crop coefficient from 2013 to 2018 by the formula 13 and 14 and made a comparison with kc loc by comparing kc loc with kc calculated by formulas 13 and 14 the results showed that kc calculated based on lai changed slowly in the early stage of growth and it changed rapidly as the crops entered the fast growing period and maintained at a high level after the middle stage of growth as lai changed slowly in the late growth period of spring maize the calculated crop coefficient was basically stable in the later period however since gdd was constantly changing with the growth and development of crops there is a significant downward trend in the later stages generally speaking the crop coefficient calculated based on lai was close to the observed value in the early and middle period of growth while the variation of the crop coefficient calculated based on gdd was similar to the observed value in the later period and the peak value of crop coefficient calculated by gdd was greater than that calculated by lai which was closer to the observed value therefore we can use the lai or the gdd to estimate the spring maize kc in an arid area which provides a basis for evapotranspiration simulation in a maize field fig 12 3 5 the accuracy of et calculated with different crop coefficients in order to compare the precision of different crop coefficients the evapotranspiration of spring maize was calculated by using different crop coefficients the results showed that the 12 year average of etkc loc calculated by using the crop coefficient in table 3 was very close to the observed value etec and the etkc fao which was calculated based on the crop coefficient recommended by fao was 8 08 higher than compared with etkc lai calculated based on the relationship between crop coefficient and lai etkc gdd calculated based on formula 14 was closer to the measured value it was only 2 29 higher than etec therefore according to the accuracy of calculating total etc the ranking of four kinds of crop coefficients is kc loc kc gdd kc fao and kc lai table 4 4 discussion 4 1 the stability of crop coefficient the homeostasis hypothesis refers to the fact that the chemical element composition in a living body will not change greatly under the constantly changing environment and the element composition in the body can basically remain stable in our study the variation coefficient of crop coefficient in 12 years was only 0 12 which to some extent confirmed the ability of plants to maintain stable growth conditions in changing environments in order to further test the stability of crop coefficient we analyzed the variation coefficient of crop coefficient in different growth stages of spring maize the results showed that the coefficient of variation of crop coefficient was 0 35 in the early stage 0 06 in the middle stage and 0 20 in the later stage table 5 kang et al obtained from 10 years research data that the variation coefficient of maize crop coefficient was only 0 08 while that of wheat was 0 10 kang et al 2003 which was very close to our research results the study on crop coefficient in beijing also found that the crop coefficient under low salt stress in 2012 and 2013 was 0 97 and 1 11 respectively and the coefficient of variation was only 0 07 the study on cotton in northwest china showed that the variation coefficient of crop coefficient between 2012 and 2014 was only 0 03 yang et al 2016 the above researches shows that the crop coefficient the crop coefficient is stable over many years 4 2 can the adjusted kc fao better replace kc loc the analysis of 12 years of data shows that there is a significant linear correlation between the corrected kc fao and the kc loc the kc fao is 1 07 times the kc loc by comparing etc of two parameters the results showed that etc calculated based on kc fao is 3 higher than etc calculated based on kc loc there is a significant linear relationship between the etkc fao and etkc loc p 0 001 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is 0 88 fig 13 all the results showed that the crop coefficient method recommended by the fao has a high accuracy and applicability yang et al 2016 also found that the average value of the kc loc was very close to the adjusted kc fao during the crop growth period and was 3 5 lower than the kc fao in humid areas it was found that when rainfall and irrigation times were lower during the early stage of crop growth the crop coefficients kc ini and kc ini recommended by fao 56 for the early stage of crop biology were also consistent with the kc fao whereas the kc mid was always lower than the fao s adjusted values by approximately 15 facchi et al 2013 similarly experiments in beijing china showed that there was no difference between the kc loc and the kc fao with or without straw mulching when the level of irrigation was low wang et al 2018 the kc fao generally reflected the trend of the kc loc throughout the entire growth period the kc loc of the mulching treatment was lower than in the treatment with no mulching during the early and late crop stages and the effect of mulching on the kc loc was more noticeable during the early and late stages of growth with values 16 lower in the mulching treatment this effect is negligible during the intermediate growth stage han et al 2019 according to a study of cotton crop coefficients in the humid area of the south central united states the kc loc was 26 lower than the kc fao during the early growth stage of cotton whereas during the middle growth stage the two values were very close with the kc loc only 6 lower than the kc fao kumar et al 2015 however in brazil the average difference between the kc fao and the kc ini kc mid and kc end were 13 18 and 10 respectively bezerra et al 2012 the research on crop coefficients cited above showed similar results the kc loc was lower than the kc fao to varying degrees at all growth stages in the early growth stage of crops the difference is larger whereas in the middle and late growth stages the difference is smaller in arid areas the difference between the kc loc and the kc fao is smaller than in non arid areas the above research indicates that the crop coefficient method recommended by fao has certain reference value for guiding the development of irrigation system in regions where et data is insufficient 4 3 the relationship between kc with lai and gdd according to our research results the crop coefficient is closely related to the growth process of the crops from the relationship among the crop coefficient leaf area index and accumulated growth temperature we established a regression equation to predict the maize crop coefficient much research has been conducted on the determination methods and numerical calculation of crop coefficients for different regions and crops kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 shukla et al 2014 kang et al 2003 divided the relationship between kc and lai into two parts based on the size of the lai and obtained a segmentation model suitable for the prediction of the kc in summer maize however in northwest china studies on the coefficients of cotton and maize crops found that the relationship between the kc and lai was logarithmic yang et al 2016 li et al 2008 when studying the crop coefficient of grapes it was found that the relationship between the kc and lai was linear wang et al 2019 the results of this 12 year long term study showed that the cubic polynomial function was best to simulate the relationship between crop coefficient and leaf area index the relationship between the kc and gdd is generally considered to be best fit by a polynomial yang et al 2016 used cubic polynomials to fit the relationship between the kc and gdd with a good result and a determination coefficient of 0 96 yang et al 2016 similarly a study of summer maize in the north china plain also showed that the relationship between the kc and gdd is a cubic polynomial r2 0 80 ji et al 2017 the research on spring maize in northwest china was consistent with our research results ji et al 2017 the relationship between crop coefficient and gdd is best represented by a cubic polynomial 5 conclusion according to the above analysis these conclusions can be draw from 1 the crop coefficient kc varied gently with a low variation coefficient of 0 12 the multiyear average of maize kc under film mulching condition with border irrigation was 0 88 the parameter would play a critical role in designing the irrigation schedule 2 the high reliability of the kc modelling method recommended by fao in northwest china was confirmed by the 12 years measurements the total evapotranspiration calculated by the adjusted kc fao method was 8 08 higher than the measured value 3 kc has a close relationship between lai and gdd the determination coefficients of kc vs lai and kc vs gpp were 0 74and 0 75 respectively lai and gdd play an important role in degerming kc variation our study confirmed the stability of crop coefficient and the reliability of kc fao method using the 12 years measurements which will provide an important scientific basis for precision irrigation management in the global agricultural practise credit authorship contribution statement hui guo data curation

5359,numerical experiments on vertical unsaturated flow using the richards equation were conducted to examine the physical basis of why storm runoff responses from mountainous watersheds in tectonically active regions could be simulated by simple runoff models with a runoff storage power law relationship pressure head propagation transmitted through vertical unsaturated flow could produce a rapid response of the outflow from bottom of the soil column regardless of the inherent soil hydraulic properties similar to storm runoff responses observed on a hillslope in a constant allocation period when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff additional experiments were conducted both for an increasing stage of downward flux in response to increasing rainfall intensity and for a recession stage without rainfall to investigate the detailed characteristics of vertical unsaturated flow the creation of a wetting front during the increasing stage delayed the increase of outflow but this delay was small during a constant allocation period an interdependent relationship between the outflow rate and the total storage of the soil column throughout the recession stage was approximated by a power law equation derived from relationships between total storage and constant outflow under steady state conditions the exponent of the power law equation approached a maximum of unity as the column length decreased and it approached the minimum value obtained from the intrinsic relationship between soil hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as the column length increased the interdependence of the outflow rate with the total storage generally detected only in the unsaturated zone might cause a low sensitivity of outflow responses to the heterogeneities of soil hydraulic properties justifying the application of simple runoff models in heterogeneous mountain watersheds keywords hillslope hydrology storm runoff response vertical unsaturated flow soil hydraulic properties runoff storage relationship 1 introduction predicting stream runoff responses to large magnitude storms is critically important to mitigate severe flood hazards in tectonically active regions including japan and other circum pacific regions tsukamoto and minematsu 1987 sidle et al 2006 sidle and bogaard 2016 it was already found over a half century ago that storm runoff responses could be roughly simulated by simple runoff models sueishi 1955 nash 1960 sugawara 1961 but we have not clearly understood what hydrological processes dominantly control the responses fatichi et al 2016 mcdonnell et al 2007 montgomery and dietrich 2002 chifflard et al 2019 it is difficult even now to determine what watershed characteristics each parameter of such a simple runoff model may physically reflect therefore to couple studies on the runoff model development with those on storm runoff generation mechanisms is still a fundamental subject in hydrological sciences in this paper we try to examine the physical meaning included in a model parameter by selecting the storage function model sfm proposed by kimura 1961 this lumped runoff model includes a power law relationship between storage and discharge as the core equation this model is the standard tool for projects undertaken by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism project for the enhancement of capabilities in flood control and sabo engineering of the dpwh 2002 and has been widely used throughout asia sugiyama et al 1997 park et al 1999 wu et al 2011 gopalan et al 2018 on the other hand various types of runoff models emphasizing increasingly detailed hydrological processes have been proposed in the past half century beven 2012 but the relatively simple application of the sfm suggests there are two kinds of general characteristics discussed below included in watershed hydrological processes regardless of its simple and rather old fashioned structure one characteristic provided by the sfm is derived from the concept of saturated rainfall the sfm assumes the area contributing to a storm runoff response is limited to a portion of the watershed at the beginning of a storm event but that the contributing area is spatially extended by a sequence of rainfall kimura 1975 defined saturated rainfall as the cumulative rainfall at the time when the contribution area reaches the entire watershed and considered that the ratio of rainfall allocated to the storm runoff had a constant value called as the saturated runoff ratio park et al 1999 this concept has been accepted in many studies on runoff analysis a recent study by supraba and yamada 2015 investigated storm runoff responses in 36 mountainous watersheds in japan and demonstrated that all the rainfall was allocated to storm runoff after the cumulative rainfall reached the saturated rainfall in 23 watersheds the value of which ranged from 81 8 mm to 170 9 mm the saturated runoff ratio may be regarded as unity for these watersheds however this result should be checked because the simple concept of saturated rainfall in the sfm was empirically obtained from runoff analysis to simulate runoff responses to storms at a watershed scale and did not specify detailed hydrological mechanisms at a hillslope scale kimura 1975 first we have to consider that the value of runoff ratio for storm runoff responses may be affected by the underestimation of watershed mean rainfall particularly in mountainous regions tani 1996 arnaud et al 2011 even though the rainfall records are sufficiently accurate the runoff ratio should be lower than unity this is caused both by forest canopy interception during a storm event murakami 2006 and leakage into the deep underground structure where groundwater does not contribute to storm runoff response katsuyama et al 2008 from this perspective we refer to a sprinkler experiment conducted in watershed cb1 in oregon coast range usa montgomery et al 1997 anderson et al 1997 torres et al 1998 sprinkled water was supplied at constant intensity onto a small unchanneled watershed for several days and runoff reached a constant rate although the rate per unit watershed area was lower than the rainfall intensity due to losses including evapotranspiration and infiltration into the underlying bedrock however the actual input rate of the sprinkled water had a diurnal oscillation due to an influence of evapotranspiration and this was reflected by a gentler diurnal oscillation in the output runoff rate and the period with constant runoff rate was called as quasi steady state montgomery et al 1997 this result suggested that such a period is important for analyzing runoff generation mechanisms even if the runoff ratio is less than unity and the input rainfall is not with a constant intensity certainly the concept of saturated rainfall was only empirically obtained from runoff analyses by the sfm but the period when the rainfall exceeds the saturated rainfall may contribute to an elucidation of complex storm runoff mechanisms because we can assume the stormflow contribution area does not change anymore hence we define constant allocation period cap as the period when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff our analysis in this paper focuses on stormflow generation processes only in cap to avoid the complexity derived from the temporal and spatial variability of stormflow contributing area hewlett and hibbert 1967 the second characteristic of sfm assumes that the functional relationship between the runoff rate and storage is a simple power law equation which can be described with the continuum equation as 1 s f k q f p 2 ds f dt r q f where sf and qf are the watershed storage l and the runoff rate l t 1 per unit watershed area calculated by sfm r is the rainfall intensity l t 1 and p dimensionless and k l1 p t p are empirical parameters eqs 1 and 2 imply that runoff rate can be obtained from watershed storage by a one to one relationship and the equation set composed of eqs 1 and 2 included in sfm is hereinafter referred to as sfe in this paper hysteresis between storage and runoff has been already recognized since the original proposal of sfm kimura 1975 and the one to one relationship can only be an approximation nevertheless the sfe has been included as a component in many runoff models including the tank model sugawara 1961 1995 hbv model bergström and forsman 1973 hycymodel fukushima and suzuki 1988 tani et al 2012 and the nam model madsen 2000 therefore a major question in hillslope hydrology is why a simple equation set like sfe provides adequate descriptions of runoff responses despite the litany of stormflow generation mechanisms identified by previous studies these two characteristics of sfm may suggest that a cap is created in response to a large magnitude storm where cumulative rainfall exceeds saturated rainfall and that the temporal change in runoff hydrograph produced from the rainfall hyetograph may be approximated by sfe considering only the cap we can focus on analyzing the simple conversion process from the hyetograph to the hydrograph within the fixed runoff contribution area our paper aims to elucidate the hydraulic mechanism at the hillslope scale that produces storm runoff responses approximated by sfe because rainfall at the ground surface is a parallel vertical flux of water moving under the influence of gravity the first process of water movement on a hillslope may usually occur as a vertical infiltration although the flow direction is somewhat modified by heterogeneous soil physical properties noguchi et al 1999 sidle et al 2000 retter et al 2006 of course above ground and soil surface heterogeneities may disturb the parallelism for example the throughfall and stem flow in forest may generate a bypass flow within a preferential path nanko et al 2010 liang et al 2011 similarly ground surfaces with a low permeability may promote the generation of infiltration excess overland flow miyata et al 2009 such quick flows may contribute to the stormflow generation even if the soil matrix remains dry liang et al 2009 dusek et al 2012 in a cap when most of the rainwater contributes to storm runoff responses however it is unrealistic to assume that all the storm runoff volume is produced only by preferential and or overland flows important contributions of the soil matrix to storm runoff responses have been suggested also from many field studies showing that a large portion of the stream water during a storm event is occupied by the pre event water pearce et al 1986 gomi et al 2010 iwasaki et al 2015 consequently we estimate that rainwater first infiltrates vertically into the soil and then lateral flow is generated at some depth due to decreasing permeability with depth beven 1984 each contribution of the vertical or lateral flow components may be controlled by various hillslope properties buttle and mcdonald 2002 ebel et al 2007 mirus and loague 2013 and it is important to separately quantify the effects of each component on the storm runoff responses in a cap vertical and lateral flows both in the soil matrix and preferential paths actively contribute to the storm runoff response as schematically illustrated in fig 1 because a large constant portion of the rainfall is allocated to the storm runoff among these flow components this paper mainly focuses on elucidating the contribution of vertical flow component in the soil matrix to storm runoff responses through numerical experiments using the richards equation naturally the contribution of preferential flow should be also evaluated and the vertical flow should be coupled with lateral flow in order to completely understand stormflow generation mechanism on a hillslope however it is important to initially specify the role of vertical unsaturated flow vuf first because it has not been adequately understood tani 1985a dusek et al 2012 we will make some discussion in sections 4 2 and 4 3 on effects of heterogeneities with preferential paths and interrelationship between vertical and lateral flow systems before we investigate the role of vuf in storm runoff responses we have to examine whether the application of sfe to runoff responses in caps at a watershed scale can be applied also at a hillslope scale this assessment is important because scale issues derived from spatial differences from hillslopes to watersheds have been widely discussed in hydrology blöschl and sivapalan 1995 sivapalan 2003 mcguire et al 2005 clark et al 2009 asano et al 2009 sidle et al 2017 hence we reanalyzed a hydrometric observation on a steep planar hillslope with a thin soil layer in appendix 1 before we begin our main investigation using the numerical experiments by the richards equation parameter values of p and k in eq 1 obtained from the application of sfe to the hillslope observational result will be used as a criterion to determine whether the vuf can produce storm runoff responses 2 method of numerical experiments 2 1 fundamental equation the vertical unsaturated flow vuf occurs as the first stage of stormflow generation on forested hillslopes as long as the soil layer is not fully saturated we conducted numerical experiments using the one dimensional vertical form of richards equation for vuf in the soil column 3 c ψ t z k ψ z 1 where k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 c is the specific water capacity defined as d θ d ψ l 1 ψ is the pressure head l θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless and t is time t the origin is placed at the bottom of the soil column and the vertical z axis is positive in the upward direction the boundary conditions at the column surface is set as 4 f r where r is the rainfall intensity l t 1 and f is the vertical water flux l t 1 defined by darcy s law as 5 f k ψ z 1 the boundary condition at the column bottom is set to a seepage face in which the outflow rate is calculated by a pressure head of zero at a saturated bottom condition with the rate remaining at zero for negative pressure head conditions because we focus our analysis on vuf only during cap ψ at the column bottom is always zero indicating that the groundwater table is fixed to the bottom this assumption might be unrealistic for a rising groundwater table but issues on the interactions between saturated and unsaturated zones are discussed in section 4 3 a versatile software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 was adopted to get numerical solutions of the richards equation a physically based kosugi 1996 model was selected to define soil hydraulic properties for the solutions because this model is derived from pore size distribution and suitable for our purpose of parameter identification for forest soils with abundant macropores 6 θ θ s θ r s e θ r θ s θ r q ln ψ ψ m σ θ r 7 k k s q ln ψ ψ m σ 1 2 q ln ψ ψ m σ σ 2 where θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents dimensionless se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 ψm is the pressure head calculated from the median pore radius σ is the standard deviation of the log normal distribution of soil pore radius dimensionless and q is the complimentary normal distribution function note that our solutions of eq 3 are the temporal changes in spatial distributions of hydraulic variables ψ θ and k and flux in the vertical soil column and that the outflow rate from the bottom can be calculated from the solutions the runoff rate from the downslope end of the soil layer cannot be estimated from our numerical experiments because the hydraulic formula for lateral flow is not given regarding this limitation of ignoring lateral flow it should be emphasized that hydraulic characteristics of lateral flow system including preferential flow paths have yet to be quantified because of their heterogeneous distributions in the soil layer even though the observational findings generally showed their important roles in quick drainage of the groundwater anderson et al 1997 sidle et al 2000 uchida et al 2003 see the discussion in section 4 3 hence it may be important as an initial step for our comprehensive understanding of hillslope runoff responses to identify hydraulic behaviour in the unsaturated zone because outflow from this zone promotes subsequent lateral flow 2 2 soil hydraulic properties to examine the physical basis why storm runoff responses can be widely simulated by the sfe in caps it is desirable to compare the results of vuf calculated from the richards equation using many types of soil hydraulic properties and various heterogeneous structures composed of the plural soil types in this paper we addressed this examination by selecting small numbers of different soil types to save a lot of energy for the comparison for this purpose we used five soils with homogeneous hydraulic properties two soil types sa and sb were derived from the soil layer on a study hillslope sl 0 05 ha see appendix 1 one typical forest soil cr one loamy soil lm and one soil substituted for preferential flow network pf were also used for our analysis in addition we discussed dependences of the vuf on three different stratified soil structures the parameters of soil hydraulic properties used for our numerical experiments are listed in table 1 the relationships of θ and k to ψ are plotted in fig 2 a and b respectively where the axis of ψ is given in a logarithmic scale because the relationships near the saturation should be emphasized when analyzing the behaviour in caps with relatively wet soil conditions two soils sa and sb were estimated by tani 1997 for soils at 10 cm depths the plots of which were 11 0 m called t4 and 1 2 m called t1 upslope from the hillslope bottom of sl with the length of 42 7 m because the thin soil layer at sl was not clearly stratified we tried to simulate the pressure head values observed at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at t4 by combining these two soils as described in section 3 1 cr was one of the average crumb structure soils selected from a catalogue for forest soil in japan using the 282 samples mashimo 1960 and lm was one of the average loamy soil taken from mualem s 1976 catalogue parameters of soil hydraulic properties in eqs 6 and 7 for cr and lm were determined based on a characterization study on forest soil by kosugi 1997a 1997b table 1a one additional soil pf was chosen to examine effects of preferential path network on vuf using the richards equation based on a dual continuum model gerke and van genuchten 1993 developed to assess infiltration processes in vertical columns consisting of soil matrix and preferential flow domains in this model the preferential path network was substituted for one type of soil filled with relatively coarse particles eroded from the matrix vogel et al 2010 and the soil hydraulic properties given for such a soil by dusek et al 2012 was also selected for pf the values of parameters α l 1 and n dimensionless in the following van genuchten 1980 model are listed in table 1b 8 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 9 k k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 the hydraulic properties for pf can be well fitted also by kosugi model as pfkos fig 2 the parameter of which are listed in table 1a the value of ψm for pfkos will be used for a discussion in section 3 5 we should note that because pf represents only one type of preferential paths with a small amount of fine particles flow in other types including pipe like preferential paths may give different effects on the vuf general effects of heterogeneities including preferential paths on the vuf is discussed in section 4 2 we also selected three types of stratified soil structures to consider the effects of heterogeneous soil structure on vuf one was lsa consisting of lm at depths of 0 20 cm and 50 70 cm with sa between these layers another stratified structure kes was composed of seven layers each with a depth of 10 cm the properties of kes were measured in a forested hillslope at kamigamo experimental station in kyoto japan liang et al 2009 table 1c and hydraulic properties of kes are inserted into fig 2 the third soil structure sab was a combination of sa for the depth of 0 12 cm and sb for the depth of 12 70 cm the ranges of parameter space considered by mirus and loague 2013 in an investigation of runoff generation mechanisms are identified in fig 2 to secure the generality of our numerical experiments the ψ k relationships in in fig 2b correspond approximately with the range by mirus and loague fig 2b but ψ θ relationships for cr pf and soils included in kes extend beyond the range near saturation fig 2a however note that differences between θs and θr for cr and soils in kes are similar to our other soil types and may control the behaviour of vuf through the value of c d θ d ψ in our fundamental eq 3 hence the absolute values of θs and θr are not important to the simulation results a large value of 0 59 in the difference of θs and θr for pf can be regarded reasonable because of the existence of preferential flow paths thus we can conclude our experiments can generally describe the basic behaviour of vuf in cap although the numbers of soil types tested are limited 2 3 design of experiments six types of numerical experiments were designed for this study first we conducted a comparison of results calculated through vuf with those observed in the sl exp 1 the next two types of experiments aimed to determine detailed characteristics of vuf in cap through calculations pertaining to an increasing stage that followed an initial steady state during transition to another steady state with higher rainfall intensity exp 2 and a recession stage without rainfall following a steady state response to a constant rainfall exp 3 experiment 4 was added to examine the characteristics of vuf under steady state conditions in response to rainfall with various constant intensities the length of the soil column for experiments 1 2 3 and 4 was constant 70 cm as shown later the relationship of soil column storage to the outflow rate during the recession stage was closely associated to a string of the relationships under steady state conditions in addition experiments 5 and 6 were conducted to ascertain the meaning of parameter p in sfe as well as to identify dependences of vuf on soil column depth evaporation was assumed to be negligible in all the experiments because our target was to examine only stormflow responses 3 experiment results 3 1 comparison with field observations the final stage of the 1987 storm observed at the sl shown in fig a4 was targeted for our comparison in exp 1 because this period can be estimated as a cap due to enough amount of cumulative rainfall see detailed description of this storm event in appendix 1 although comparisons focused on the responses in a cap calculations started at the onset of this july 14 storm the initial condition of ψ was zero at the base of the soil column and the vertical distribution in the column was set at hydrostatic equilibrium the results calculated by eight soil structures consisting of sa sb cr lm pf lsa kes and sab are shown in panels a to h of fig 3 the upper panels a1 to h1 illustrate the observed rainfall intensity r the observed runoff rate qb and the calculated outflow rate from the soil layer bottom u the lower panels a2 to h2 show the observed and calculated ψ values at 10 30 and 50 cm depths the runoff rate qf calculated by sfe with p and k of 0 3 and 27 mm0 7 h0 3 also plotted in fig a4 is inserted to the panel a1 rapid propagation of the pressure head in the soil columns was commonly found in the observed and calculated values and all the calculated hydrographs of outflow rates exhibited similar timescales to the storm runoff hydrographs observed in sl and calculated by sfe fig 3 however the magnitude of the delay and smoothing for the calculated results depended on the soil types and the peak outflow rates in descending order were kes lm lsa pf sb sab cr and sa the observed peak runoff rate and that calculated by sfe were almost the same and located between the peak outflow rates for cr and sa interestingly lm with the lowest ks value produced a high runoff peak although the highest ks value was represented by pf hence the outflow responses never reflected the magnitude of ks but were dependent on the hydraulic characteristics of vuf which were controlled by relationships among ψ θ and k the calculated distributions of ψ for sab in fig 3 h2 compared well with those observations but this is obvious because this combination of these soils was tuned by a trial and error to get a comparatively good result it should be rather noted that the local distributions of hydraulic variables were sensitive to soil hydraulic properties and stratified structures fig 3 lower panels a more important finding derived from this experiment was that temporal changes of u were rapid enough to produce the observed storm runoff response regardless of soil structure the peak of each calculated outflow with the exception of sa was higher than the peak of the observed runoff and its time of occurrence coincided closely to those observed for most of the soil structures fig 3 however both cr and sa exhibited a slightly later time of occurrence because the subsequent lateral flow was added to the vuf for hillslope runoff discharge we have to consider an additional change of the hydrograph through lateral flow nonetheless these results suggest this change may be generally small fig 3 some areas on the sl hillslope have very thin soil and the unsaturated zone may become thinner than the depth of the soil layer near the hillslope toe because the accumulation of water there causes a rise of groundwater table consequently these zones may contribute to the generation of higher outflow peaks and earlier times of occurrence although effects of these heterogeneities on runoff responses are taken into consideration it should be emphasized that the process of pressure head propagation through the vuf fig 3 can substantially contribute to the production of rapid storm runoff responses in a cap this occurs even though various flow components including infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flows and preferential flow in the soil and weathered bedrock layers may also contribute to the generation of storm runoff on a hillslope 3 2 summary of experiments with constant rainfall intensities a large contribution of vuf to storm runoff responses was suggested from our comparison of the results from exp 1 with those observed on a hillslope the next experiments attempted to further investigate the detailed distributions of hydraulic variables within a soil column and to elucidate whether the outflow rate produced through vuf can be generally approximated by the runoff rate qf produced by the sfe consequently exps 2 and 3 focused on responses to simpler rainfall conditions with constant intensities instead of conditions existing in a natural storm i e exp 1 experiment 2 was conducted for a transient increasing stage from an initial steady state with a constant rainfall of 1 mm h 1 to a new steady state with a constant rainfall of 10 mm h 1 this was selected as an example of hydrological responses to an increase in rainfall intensity during a cap after the entire soil layer already became wet during large cumulative rainfall experiment 3 examined the recession stage after a steady state with constant rainfall of 10 mm h 1 soil column length soil type and stratified structure in both exps 2 and 3 were the same as those for exp 1 temporal changes in u calculated for each soil structure and changes in qf calculated by sfe using the same parameter values as exp 1 are plotted in fig 4 temporal and spatial distributions of hydraulic variables including ψ θ k and downward flux fd are illustrated in fig 5 to allow examination of the detailed hydrological behaviour in each soil column with different structures fig 6 shows the relationships of storage s to u where s is defined as the storage l of the column of length of d l 10 s 0 d θ d z sd in fig 6 a represents the storage of transient water defined as 11 s d s s 0 where s 0 is the storage at hydrostatic equilibrium with ψ at the column bottom of zero as 12 s 0 0 d θ ψ z d z the sf for sfe calculated from qf in eq 1 is also plotted in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the relationship in a log log scale using the dimensionless ratio s of sd to the total storage of transient water defined as 13 s s d s s s 0 where ss is the storage at full saturation of the soil column and defined as 14 s s d θ s both s and u the outflow rate from the soil layer bottom decrease toward zero because evapotranspiration is neglected in our numerical experiments and the maximum of s is unity in response to the maximum of u equal to ks hence this definition of s can provide a useful methodology for a comparison of the calculation results between vuf with sfe during the recession stage in addition to the results from exp 3 the values of s at steady state in response to a constant r intensity obtained from exp 4 are plotted in fig 6 b lines inserted there are the gradients in the power law relationships between qf and sf given by p values in eq 1 3 3 increasing stage from an initial steady state to another with higher rainfall intensity the order of increasing time at which outflow begins to increase called hereinafter increasing start time was lm pf kes cr lsa sb sab and sa fig 4 however the timing to approach a new steady state rate of 10 mm h 1 differed due to differences in the rate of increase for each calculation a relatively rapid increase is shown in the curves of kes lsa sb sab and sa in contrast a gentle rate of increase occurred in lm pf and cr hence hydrographs may reflect differences in the pressure head propagation among various soil structures effects of each soil structure on the distributions of variables ψ θ and k and flux fd are presented in fig 5 in the case of sa where u increased rapidly almost the entire soil column exhibited constant values of ψ θ and k except for a thin zone near the bottom when the column was under the initial and final steady states in response to the two rainfall intensities of 1 and 10 mm h 1 in contrast soil structure lm lacked zones with any constant values of these variables under both steady states and increases in the values of these variables were smoothly transmitted from the surface to the bottom of the soil column resulting in the early increasing start time of u fig 4 however the increasing curve for lm was much gentler than that for sa and the time when it attained the new steady state with 10 mm h 1 was not much different to understand the hydraulic behaviours that depend on soil hydraulic properties as shown for sa and lm we investigated the theoretical structure of eq 3 with a homogeneous soil structure the effects of advection and diffusion on hydraulic behaviours are represented by the first and second terms on the right hand side of darcy s law included in eq 3 and rewritten from eq 5 as 15 f d f k k ψ z because the diffusion term is zero within the zone with constant hydraulic variables that was created in the upper portion of the soil column the constant value of ψ is calculated from r by assigning r to k in eq 15 if the diffusion term can be negligible the richards equation in eq 3 is converted to the following continuity equation 16 θ t c ψ t k z when rainfall intensity increases from r 1 to r 2 the zone with flux r 2 is extended downward with velocity va smith 1983 torres et al 1998 and described as follows 17 v a r 2 r 1 θ k r 2 θ k r 1 when applying the equation to the vuf for sa va is 18 7 cm h 1 because r 1 r 2 θ k r 1 and θ k r 2 are 1 mm h 1 10 mm h 1 0 338 and 0 386 respectively and the propagation time for the 70 cm column was calculated as 3 7 h suggesting the assumption of advection in eq 16 may be acceptable for sa figs 4 and 5 therefore a large delay of the increasing start time of u in fig 4 was caused by a small value of va when each of the variables ψ θ and k are controlled only by the advection term a sharp wetting front below the zone with constant values of hydraulic variables would be delineated as a horizontal line in each of panels a to e of fig 5 however the actual wetting front in each panel was more or less smooth caused by the diffusion term furthermore the value of each hydraulic variable decreased with increasing depth along the wetting front the distribution of ψ near the bottom of the column approached the hydrostatic equilibrium line passing through ψ 0 at the bottom and the value of each variable increased with increasing depth hence the distribution of ψ has an inflection point at ψ z 0 between the two reverse curves fig 5 consequently the distributions of hydraulic variables in the soil column in an increasing stage can be segmented into three zones the near surface zone with constant values for the variables is controlled only by the advection term the second and third zones are divided by the inflection point and both controlled by advection and diffusion terms however u does not begin to increase unless the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under the initial steady state where the downward flux fd remains equal to the initial outflow rate of 1 mm h 1 therefore for soil types such as sa where a large rainwater is absorbed in the first and second zones the inflection point departing from the original distribution is deep and the increasing start time of u is late figs 4a 5a1 after the inflection point departs from its original distribution the increase of ψ at the inflection point is transmitted to the bottom due to an effect of the diffusion term and u rapidly increases from the initial rate to the final steady state on the other hand for soil types such as lm fig 5d1 where the near surface zone controlled by the advection term is hardly produced the inflection point of ψ created at a shallow depth rapidly departs its original distribution hence u rapidly begins to increase but the increasing velocity is low because most of the rainwater supplied from the surface is allocated to storage increase throughout the soil column and only a small portion of the storage increase is discharged as u figs 4a 5d2 accordingly the interdependence between u and storage volume may cause a gradual increase of u indeed fig 4 demonstrates that the runoff rate qf calculated by sfe was the most gradual increase because a large portion of the rainwater was allocated to storage sf from the beginning of increasing stage due to the one to one relationship between qf and sf in eq 1 consequently the vuf in the increasing stage during a cap may produce a different outflow response from the storm runoff response calculated from sfe because a delay for the increasing start time of u is created in the former but not in the latter nonetheless the total time necessary for outflow increase is enough short and similar to that for storm runoff responses not only calculated by sfe but also observed on a hillslope figs 3 and 4 however the short timescale similar to storm runoff responses is generated only during caps but much longer timescale is needed when the initial soil condition is dry this issue will be discussed in section 4 1 next let us compare the behaviours of vuf and their contributions to the outflow responses among soil types fig 6a shows that the increase of sd for each soil type is constructed of two portions represented by a dashed line and dashed dotted line the former represents a vertical line without an increase in u because the inflection point of ψ has not yet departed from its original distribution under the initial steady state on the other hand the latter represents an inclined curve because the inflection point has already departed from the original distribution and the storage increase is accompanied by an increase in u the increasing patterns of u for the homogeneous soil structures in fig 4 are explained by the distributions of volumetric water content in fig 5 as follows the earlier increasing start time for sb compared to sa is caused by its smaller difference of θ between the two steady state conditions panels a2 and b2 resulting in a larger va in eq 17 a comparatively shallow inflection point of ψ panel e1 for pf coincided with a gentle increase of u in fig 4 the curve of u in cr in fig 4 with a late increasing start time and a gentle curve may result from the distribution pattern where the inflection point of ψ departs from the original distribution at an intermediate depth panel c1 unlike homogeneous soil structures the distributions of hydraulic variables ψ θ and k for stratified structures in panels f to h of fig 5 were complex particularly near the borders between layers in both homogeneous and stratified structures however it should be noted that the downward flux fd was constant or monotonically decreased with increasing depth throughout the transient process from one steady state to another in response to increasing rainfall intensity consequently smooth curves of fd compared to the hydraulic variables are illustrated in each of the bottom panels f4 to h4 of fig 5 therefore even though the distributions of variables were varied considerably we believe that their complex shapes resulted from the calculation processes i e eq 3 which ensured that smooth distributions of fd are produced from the boundary conditions for kes the propagation time calculated from va was 1 36 h shorter than that for sa sb and sab this may be caused by the soil structure consisting of soils with relatively small differences between θr and θs fig 2 and table 1c responding to an early increase of u fig 4 the distribution for soil column lsa exhibited an interesting shape due to an immediate transmission in the both side layers with lm and a delay of the transmission was mainly created in the sa layer sandwiched between the lm layers fig 5f2 hence the delay in the transmission through the 30 cm sa zone was calculated as 1 6 h eq 17 matching the timing of the increasing start time for lsa in fig 4 from the distributions of hydraulic variables for three stratified structures fig 5f to h it is apparent that the downward fluxes fd were similar to those found in the homogeneous soil structures consequently we suggest that the dependences of u on the behaviours of vuf may be generally applicable irrespective of whether soil hydraulic properties in the column are homogeneous or heterogeneous 3 4 recession stage from a steady state at the beginning of the recession stage time was required for the transmission of a sudden flux change at the soil layer surface to the bottom fig 4 this is represented by each curve in both panels of fig 6 which exhibited a small region showing a storage decrease accompanied with little decrease of u at the beginning of recession stage however each curve in fig 6 was soon connected to a smooth curve with an intrinsic outflow and storage relationship because the surface boundary condition changed from constant rainfall intensity to zero at the beginning of exp 3 fd always increased with increasing depth throughout the recession stage when soil hydraulic properties were homogeneous panels a to e of fig 5 the variables ψ θ and k increased monotonically with increasing depth these monotonic increases may be reflected in smooth decreasing curves of u without abrupt changes in fig 4 and smooth curves of the distributions of the variables without inflection points in fig 5 although the increasing start time and inflection point were created in an increasing stage section 3 3 the entire column in a recession stage was always included within the zone controlled both by advective and diffusive terms of eq 15 consequently fig 6 shows that relationships between outflow and storage exhibited smooth curves throughout the recession stage and that the gradients of these curves were comparable with the gradient controlled by parameter p of sfe the outflow and storage relationships in the dimensionless scale in fig 6 b demonstrate that all curves in the recession stage from exp 3 were parallel to those in a string of relationships under steady state conditions obtained from exp 4 except near the beginning of the recession stage the parallel curves for all soil structures were slightly upwardly convex and their gradients increased with decreasing outflow rates comparing responses among the five homogeneous soil structures those producing late increasing start time of u arising from the effect of the near surface zone controlled only by the advection term in the increasing stages e g sa and sb tended to have smaller p values in the recession stage whereas those structures characterized by gradually increasing curves e g lm and pf had larger p values intermediate p values were detected for cr which produced an intermediate curve characteristic for u such dependences of p value on soil hydraulic properties are examined in exps 5 and 6 in section 3 5 for each of the three stratified soil structures lsa kes and sab the increase in fd with increasing depth fig 5f4 h4 was similar to that for each of the homogeneous structures even though those for ψ θ and k for each stratified structure were considerably deformed near the layer junctions such a low sensitivity of fd to heterogeneities is reflected in their similar shapes compared to those with homogeneous properties both in hydrographs fig 4 and in the outflow storage relationships fig 6 therefore it is noted that the outflow storage relationship can be approximated by a power law equation in sfe even though the soil structure is heterogeneous 3 5 parameterization of vertical unsaturated flow for the runoff storage relationship in order to determine dependences of p values included in sfe on soil hydraulic properties and soil column lengths additional numerical experiments exps 5 and 6 were conducted for soil columns with hydraulic properties of sb experiment 5 focused on a recession stage similar to exp 3 although the length of the column and the flux intensity for the initial steady state conditions were set as 200 cm and 100 mm h 1 respectively experiment 6 was similar to exp 4 for a string of the steady state responses of vuf to various rainfall intensities but the calculations were made for eight columns with lengths d of 10 20 30 50 70 100 150 and 200 cm the relationships of s to u calculated from the experiments are illustrated in fig 7 the relationship between u and s directly calculated from the hydraulic properties k and θ for sb hereinafter called the θ k base relationship is also plotted in fig 7 by substituting steady state flux u into k and converting θ to s using eqs 6 10 13 fig 8 shows the distributions of θ in the 200 cm soil column at several time points during the recession stage exp 5 and those under the steady state conditions exp 6 producing the same u value as in the recession stage the vertical distribution of θ for steady state conditions obtained from exp 6 was generally segmented into two zones fig 8 vertical lines near the surface were originated from the advection term of darcy s law in eq 15 and k values along these lines were regarded equal to the downward steady state flux fd and rainfall intensity r because ψ z 0 in eq 15 on the other hand our bottom boundary condition ψ 0 enforced higher k values than fd and values of ψ z close to 1 in eq 15 near the bottom consequently both distributions in the recession stage and under steady state conditions approached hydrostatic equilibrium near the bottom the former zone near the surface and the latter zone near the bottom are hereinafter defined as an advection zone az and an asymptotic equilibrium zone ez respectively the gradients of u s relationships were then examined the θ k base relationship can be regarded as the u s relationship for a very long soil column fig 7 where the proportion of ez to the total column length is negligible because most of this column is within az fig 8 therefore u s curves under steady state conditions approach the θ k base relationship as column length increases fig 7 thus we recognize that the smallest p value in response to a given range of u is determined by the θ k base relationship derived from soil hydraulic properties in contrast to long columns the u s relationships for short columns exhibited large p values approaching unity indicating the linear relationship between u and s as column length decreased fig 7 this may reflect the distribution of θ under steady state conditions fig 8 the distribution of a steady state flux is controlled only by the bottom boundary condition but not dependent on the column length consequently the steady state distribution of θ illustrated for depth from the bottom 200 cm to 200 d cm fig 8 may represent the distribution of θ for the soil column with length of d and almost the entire portion of a column with a very small d value may reside within ez for the soil hydraulic properties of sb therefore the range of p may range from unity for a short column residing mostly in ez to a small value for a long column derived from az fig 7 interestingly this dependence of p on the proportion of the az and ez zones is also detected in the dependence on the hydraulic properties in each homogeneous soil fig 6 for example fig 5 d2 shows most of the column lm was covered within ez or a transition zone between ez and az under steady state conditions with u 1 or 10 mm h 1 but vertical lines representing az were not contained in the steady state distributions these distributions may be reflected in the value of p for lm fig 6b that is p 1 for u 1 mm h 1 and a slightly smaller p value for u 10 mm h 1 on the other hand fig 5 a2 shows that most of the column for sa was covered with az under the steady state resulting in the smallest value of p for a local u value in fig 6 b the slightly higher p value for sb compared to sa can be explained by the shorter az for sb compare fig 5b2 and a2 consequently we can conclude that dependences of p values on soil hydraulic properties and soil column lengths are mainly controlled by the vertical distribution of θ in a column with a given length under a steady state condition because this distribution may be controlled by the soil pore size distribution in eqs 6 and 7 kosugi 1996 and ψm is incorporated as a parameter originated from the median pore radius a dimensionless parameter δ was introduced here to parameterize the characteristics of vertical unsaturated flow for the p values 18 δ d ψ m fig 9 shows the dependence of p on δ in response to u 1 mm h 1 based on the results of exp 6 eight plots for sb and a plot for each of other four soil types indicate the results for columns with lengths from 10 to 200 cm and the result for the 70 cm column respectively besides p values for the θ k base relationships of these soils are also plotted at the right side although soil hydraulic properties and column length both involve the dependence the decreasing tendency of p from 1 to a small value given by the θ k base relationship can be consistently detected in response to increasing δ value accordingly δ may play an important role in the hydraulic behaviours of vuf such a dimensionless parameter defined as a ratio of vertical soil column length to representative pressure head was often introduced by similarity analyses of unsaturated flow miller and miller 1956 verma and brutsaert 1970 tani 1982 1985b however the basic hydraulic findings from these studies have been rarely used for the hydrological studies on storm runoff response tani 1985a 2013 it is believed that our finding on parameterization of vuf for the relationship of p to δ may contribute to a new perspective about a coupling of hydrology with soil physics 4 discussion 4 1 effects of soil wetness on outflow response our numerical experiments strongly suggest that vuf may produce rapid outflow responses to storm rainfall regardless of the type of soil structure as long as the entire soil layer is already wet in a cap this suggests the lateral flow receiving outflow from the vertical flow process is so fast that storm flow hydrograph is little deformed through the lateral process in a cap we first discuss the rationale why such rapid responses were produced from vuf the interdependence of outflow and storage was detected in the increasing stage from one steady state to another only after the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under the initial steady state fig 5 resulting in a creation of increasing start time of u fig 4 however the timescale of this increasing start time is significantly different between wet conditions during cap and dry conditions prior to a rainfall event note that the usual range of rainfall intensity r from 1 mm h 1 for a very gentle intensity to 100 mm h 1 for an extraordinarily heavy storm is limited small compared to the full range of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k and that this may cause large effects of soil wetness on the outflow responses because sufficient cumulative rainfall occurs from the start of the event during a cap the range θ at every depth of the soil column is included only in a small wet portion of the full range from θr to θs this small fluctuation range of θ results in a large va eq 17 and may explain why the vuf during a cap can produce a rapid runoff response with an early increasing start time such a rapid response was observed not only in our study hillslope sl fig a4 but also in a small unchanneled watershed cb1 torres et al 1998 ebel and loague 2008 on the other hand we should note that k values for dry soils prior to a rainfall event are several orders of magnitude lower than those during a cap because of the effects of evapotranspiration and infiltration during the previous rainless period consequently remarkably different behaviours are produced from the vuf under different wetness conditions due to the nonlinear relationship of k to θ much rainwater at the beginning of an event is absorbed when the soil column was dry whereas most of the rainwater received during a cap rapidly contributes to outflow even though its increasing start time may be created this large effect of soil wetness on vuf clearly explained the characteristics of the relationships between total storm rainfall and runoff sl and mn fig a2 which were composed of a dependence of storm runoff volume on the initial runoff rate and a large allocation of rainwater volume to storm runoff volume after large cumulative rainfall accordingly threshold responses discussed by previous studies noguchi et al 1997 tani 1997 graham and mcdonnell 2010 ali et al 2013 dusek and vogel 2016 may at least partly be explained by the hydraulic behaviours of vuf as discussed here 4 2 sensitivity of outflow response to spatial heterogeneities next we discuss the dependency of outflow response on spatial heterogeneities that characterize a natural hillslope soil to address this it is important to understand differences in hydraulic characteristics between lateral and vertical water flow systems in the soil groundwater flow in the saturated zone plays a main role in the lateral flow system contributing to storm runoff response tani 2008 dusek et al 2012 because all the pores included in the soil are filled with water due to the positive pressure potential in the saturated zone flow velocity is mainly controlled by large pores with small friction resistances even though most of the soil layer is occupied by the soil matrix flow through a preferential path may play a dominant role in the lateral system where this exists particularly we should note the large difference in the position of the groundwater table during a cap the soil layer without preferential paths may contain a substantial saturated zone due to a large rise of water table in response to heavy rainfall whereas the unsaturated zone coupled with a low water table remains in the layer containing preferential flow paths because of the effective drainage of groundwater through them the hydraulic behaviour in many preferential pathways cannot be described by darcy s law but rather by the manning equation previously derived from measurements of undisturbed soil with natural pipes kitahara 1993 and hydraulic experiments using artificial pipes sidle et al 1995 tsutsumi et al 2005 however the spatial distribution of ks in the soil matrix and the resistance for a preferential flow network are very difficult to estimate due to their large heterogeneous distribution this causes a fundamental problem for evaluating the effects of lateral flow on runoff response because the velocities through preferential flow networks range across several orders of magnitude anderson et al 1997 uchida et al 2003 hence although many observational studies suggest that storm runoff responses were produced through the lateral flow system including preferential flow paths mcdonnell 1990 sidle et al 2001 uchida et al 2005 guo et al 2014 these individual findings can be hardly extended to a general quantification about the roles of the lateral system this is because of the unknown spatial distribution of these paths indeed it is extremely difficult to formulate the necessary generality required for modelling processes within a soil with abundant heterogeneities unlike a homogeneous system sidle et al 2001 mcdonnell et al 2007 troch et al 2009 effects of the heterogeneities on the vuf may be significantly different from those impacting lateral flow systems connecting paths around living or decayed tree roots certainly produce a quick bypass flow in the unsaturated zone noguchi et al 1999 liang et al 2011 ghestem et al 2011 but the contribution of rapid flow through them may be insufficient to allow a large volume of storm runoff that is nearly equivalent to the rainfall volume in a cap the soil matrix surrounding these paths may also play a role in the production of the large runoff volume tsuboyama et al 1994 in addition our analysis on vuf has demonstrated that the propagation of ψ within the soil matrix in a cap has enough impact to produce a quick storm response figs 4 and 5 the effects of heterogeneity on vuf are examined next based on an application of soil physics let us consider a storage change in an unsaturated zone in response to a change in the vertical flux this process follows the continuity equation derived from eqs 3 and 15 as 19 θ t f d z hence a temporal change in θ in a local thin horizontal layer within the unsaturated zone generally arises in response to a change in fd l t 1 passing through it as long as the layer is under a non steady state because such a change from θ to θ δθ occurs at every local layer the local change is extended to a change in storage of a large portion of the soil column such an interdependence between θ and fd does not occur before the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under an initial steady state fig 5 because this isolation of the surface zone from the layer bottom does not occur during a recession stage however it should be emphasized that the interdependence at a local point may strongly support a close relationship of u to the total storage in the entire soil column approximated by sfe as shown in the u s relationships fig 6b note that this interdependence is derived from δθ at each local point in the soil column during a recession stage then the effects of heterogeneities can be easily understood because water is preferentially retained smaller pores by capillary forces compared to larger ones in an unsaturated zone θ can be described by the relationship c d θ d ψ as the pore capillary pressure distribution function kosugi 1994 and thus 20 θ ψ ψ c ψ d ψ because this equation may be generally applied to any soil even for pf with a small amount of fine particles the dependence of the storage change in the entire soil column on δθ occurs in all soil types this common characteristic found in an unsaturated zone is particularly important because the outflow rate and the entire column storage are always interdependent whether the distribution of soil hydraulic properties is homogeneous or not causing that the sensitivity of the interdependence to heterogeneities of soil structure may be generally small this is because preferential paths with large pores that characterize heterogenous soils may play only a limited role in the vuf due to their small capillary forces unlike the lateral flow system we can therefore conclude that the approximation of storm runoff responses by sfe may be commonly acceptable by regarding the vuf as the main mechanism of stormflow generation irrespective whether the soil structure is homogeneous or heterogeneous 4 3 connection between vertical and lateral flow processes vertical flows both in the soil matrix and via preferential paths can produce storm runoff responses fig 1 in a cap however a large magnitude storm runoff must be produced through lateral flow processes from water provided by vertical flow throughout almost the entire slope area because our findings from this paper are limited only to vertical processes it has not been demonstrated what downslope drainage processes produce large magnitude storm runoff responses in caps however some field studies showed that rainfall runoff responses were mainly produced through vuf and lateral flow process gave little deformation to storm flow hydrograph although characteristics of storm runoff responses are qualitatively similar between the watershed mn and the hillslope sl in tatsunokuchi yama experimental watershed see appendix 1 the geology of 96 of the area in mn is different from that of sl instead of a thin soil layer overlying a hard quartz porphyry bedrock at sl hillslopes in mn generally have deep weathered paleozoic sedimentary bedrock and most rainwater infiltrates into this deep zone a recent study by hosoda and tani 2016 monitored the responses of the groundwater table in the weathered bedrock including the formation of clays and joints on a general hillslope in the mn see the location in fig a1 demonstrating that the water table quickly rose and fell after the entire soil layer became sufficiently wet in such wet conditions an analysis of sio2 concentration showed more than half of the stream water was occupied by pre event water the volume of storm runoff for mn was almost the same as that of rainfall in caps fig a2 during these wet periods the conversion of hyetograph to the hydrograph might be created through vertical flow processes because the hydrograph responses were mostly synchronized with groundwater table responses hosoda and tani 2016 such synchronization cannot be explained unless fissures in the bedrock played a role in groundwater drainage as noted in another watershed underlain by sedimentary bedrock onda et al 2001 another field study in a small steep watershed in the rokko mountains japan was conducted based on observations from numerous wells in weathered granite bedrock kosugi et al 2011 this study showed triple peak runoff responses at different timescales controlled by groundwater in two regionalized bedrock aquifers and the soil mantle groundwater although most mountainous watersheds do not show such multiple peak runoff responses kosugi et al suggested that these unique hydrological processes might be affected by diastrophic activities producing many fault lines the synchronization of responses between the groundwater table and stream water may support our argument on the flow mechanism although a large lag time for each of the two slower runoff peaks is not in the range of stormflow responses the results at this site can be understood by our concept that the conversions of hyetograph to hydrograph might be mainly created not through lateral flow processes but through vertical flow processes based on the results obtained from watershed and hillslope observations previously described as well as from our numerical experiments we conclude that vertical flow component not lateral one may play a dominant role in the conversion from the hyetograph to hydrograph in a cap see fig 1 although the spatial scale involved in vertical processes is generally much shorter than for lateral flow processes this tendency provides a novel point for physically based storm runoff models because the rainfall runoff responses may depend more strongly on properties involved in vertical flow than those for lateral flow indeed montgomery and dietrich 2002 showed that the time lag between rainfall and runoff for a steep hillslope depended little on slope gradient but was rather controlled by the soil moisture retention curve suggesting a larger contribution of vuf to rainfall runoff responses some studies proposed runoff models treating vufs independently from the total runoff processes on a hillslope ohta et al 1983 tani 1985a dusek et al 2012 although vertical preferential flow and lateral flow system may also be involved in storm runoff responses as shown in fig 1 our discussion above may suggest a rationality in these models certainly dependences of storm runoff responses on watershed properties might emerge from more sophisticated models based on the three dimensional form of the richards equation vanderkwaak and loague 2001 sudicky et al 2008 mirus and loague 2013 nonetheless we should note that preferential paths constructed of large pores work in effective lateral drainage routes insofar as they are included in the saturated zone section 4 2 this effect derived from strong spatial heterogeneities suggests a serious limitation to any kinds of models based on the richards equation because the modelling method representing such severe heterogeneities has yet to be developed montgomery and dietrich 2002 uchida et al 2005 ebel et al 2007 chifflard et al 2019 consequently storm runoff models not only focusing only on vertical processes but also describing the three dimensional processes suffer from similar problems related to quantifying the effects of heterogeneous preferential flow networks on storm runoff responses a next stage of the runoff model development must specify each effect of the vertical and lateral processes on the responses our study has demonstrated that storm runoff responses in a cap approximated by sfe can be roughly explained by vuf although the effects of the subsequent lateral flow on the hyetograph hydrograph conversion may not be addressed probably preferential paths provide rapid lateral drainage of groundwater anderson et al 1997 montgomery and dietrich 2002 dusek et al 2012 resulting in a small contribution of the lateral flow to hydrograph change however it is a fundamental question whether such a rapid drainage generally occurs on a steep hillslope we assume that subsurface structures including preferential paths are developed through long time scale processes field investigations for steep hillslopes in tectonically active regions have suggested that the subsurface structures producing runoff processes may have evolved through geomorphological processes supported by vegetation effects shimokawa 1984 heimsath et al 1999 roering et al 2002 istanbulluoglu and bras 2005 matsushi and matsuzaki 2010 sidle and bogaard 2016 however the support of vegetation root system is not sufficient to maintain slope stability for this long period against often occurrences of large magnitude storms because a rise of the groundwater table often triggers a landslide occurrence montgomery et al 2009 milledge et al 2014 boggard and greco 2015 consequently it is needed to restrain the rise of the groundwater table by the effective drainage of groundwater preferential flow paths tani 2013 matsushi et al 2016 watakabe and matshushi 2019 further interdisciplinary studies are needed to understand a connection between a short timescale hydrological process producing storm runoff responses and a long timescale geomorphological process creating the subsurface structures 5 conclusions hydrological studies on flood control suggest that the storm runoff response to rainfall in quasi steady state periods when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff could be simulated by a simple runoff model based on a power law equation between runoff rate and watershed storage our paper examines why this model produces good results using numerical experiments with the one dimensional vertical form of richards equation the findings are summarized as follows 1 the propagation of the pressure head through vertical unsaturated flow could produce a rapid response in the outflow rate from the bottom boundary of the soil column similar to storm runoff response observed on a hillslope regardless of soil hydraulic properties 2 vertical distribution of pressure head in the soil column during an increasing stage from an initial steady state to another with higher rainfall intensity was characterized by the creation of an inflection point below the wetting front above and below which the pressure head decreased and increased with increasing depth respectively the shape of outflow hydrograph was controlled by the depth where the inflection point departed from its original distribution under the initial steady state 3 although the delay of increasing start time of outflow rate in an increasing stage was small enough to produce rapid storm runoff responses during a quasi steady state period the absorption of rainwater within dry soil did not usually contribute to storm runoff response at the beginning of a rainfall event this could partly explain the so called threshold storm runoff response 4 the outflow rate and the total storage in the entire soil column were interdependent throughout the recession stage the outflow storage relationship was approximated by a simple power law equation and such an approximation was originated from a string of relationships of the total storage to constant outflow rate under steady state conditions 5 the exponent of the power law equation reflected the distributions of hydraulic variables in the soil column and was controlled by a ratio of vertical soil column length to representative pressurehead the exponent ranged from unity linear outflow storage relationship for a small ratio to the smallest value for a large ratio originating from the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content for the given soil 6 the reason why the outflow rate and the entire column storage are interdependent was derived from the characteristic of the unsaturated zone where water is preferentially retained in smaller soil pores with large capillary forces compared to larger ones this interdependence occurs irrespective of whether the distributions of soil hydraulic properties are homogeneous or not resulting in a low sensitivity of outflow response to soil heterogeneities this may provide a rationale for applying simple runoff models to storm runoff responses 7 because every runoff model representing three dimensional processes on a hillslope suffers from problems related to quantifying the effects of heterogeneous preferential flow networks on storm runoff responses a next stage of the runoff model development must specify each effect of the vertical and lateral processes on the responses in consideration of the heterogeneities large dependences of storm runoff responses on vertical unsaturated flow processes estimated from this study may encourage the development of innovative physically based runoff models this may also suggest the need for future interdisciplinary studies consisting of

appendix 1 applicability of storage function model to hillslope scale observational results we examine whether the application of sfe to runoff responses in caps at a watershed scale can be applied at a hillslope scale this assessment is made because scale issues derived from spatial differences from hillslopes to watersheds have been widely discussed in hydrology blöschl and sivapalan 1995 sivapalan 2003 mcguire et al 2005 clark et al 2009 asano et al 2009 sidle et al 2017 hence we reanalyze a hydrometric observation on a steep planar hillslope with a thin soil layer a1 1 site description of study hillslope for this examination storm records in july 1987 on a steep planar hillslope without a riparian corridor in the tatsunokuchi yama experimental watershed okayama japan were assessed fig a1 these observations were conducted by the forestry and forest products research institute and the data analysis and site description were reported by tani 1997 a long term hydrological study in a small watershed minamitani mn 22 6 ha in tatsunokuchi yama has continued since 1937 and runoff responses to storms have been assessed by several studies tani and abe 1987 tani et al 2012 hosoda and tani 2016 our study hillslope sl located inside of the mn watershed is underlain by quartz porphyry although about 96 of the watershed is underlain by paleozoic rock formations the topography of the sl is steep 34 6 and short 42 7 m and the soil layer is thin compared with most slopes in mn runoff discharge from a trench at the toe of the slope was monitored using a 6 m long brick wall tightly fixed to the exposed bedrock along the stream channel the contributing area of sl was estimated at 500 m2 average width was 11 7 m and slope length was 42 7 m this width is larger than the bottom width 6 m suggesting that water flow converges from the wider upslope area despite its planar surface topography soil textures are clay loam and sandy loam produced from the bedrock and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated as 1 7 to 6 3 10 3 cm s 1 observations of the soil profile at the trench showed that the mineral soil contained many macropores which preferentially produced much runoff discharge during storms an old landslide scar existed halfway up the slope with bedrock exposed at the headwall of the landslide soil depth varied along the slope with an average depth of about 50 cm in addition to measuring runoff discharge pressure head was monitored at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at t4 11 0 m upslope from the trench these observed values were used to examine the applicability of the richards equation to the pressure head propagation the observations in sl were conducted between january 1986 and november 1987 a1 2 model applicability the basic characteristics of storm runoff responses for sl were similar to those for the entire mn watershed despite different geology topography and spatial scale tani and abe 1987 tani 1997 fig a2 shows relationships of total storm rainfall and runoff at sl and mn the relationships between the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff for our target storm event in july 1987 the total rainfall 137 mm and total runoff from mn and sl 48 mm and 69 mm respectively are plotted in panels fig a2a and fig a2b in addition the relationship for an event in september 1976 in which the total rainfall and storm runoff were 375 and 248 mm respectively one of the largest storms in the 80 year observation periods of mn is also plotted in fig a2 a in both mn and sl when rainfall was small total storm runoff was very low because most of the rainwater was stored in the soil and this storage effect depends on antecedent moisture conditions as indicated by the initial runoff rates of mn before the event in both mn and sl storm runoff occur until a threshold of rainfall was reached although this value depends on the antecedent moisture conditions the rate of increase in storm runoff was similar to that of rainfall during large storms as shown in the cumulative relationship for the storm of 1976 fig a2a although this tendency occurred in both mn and sl fig a2b the steeper increase in storm runoff for sl compared to mn may be caused by a more rapid extension of the stormflow contributing area likely due to the short and steep topography and thin soil layer in sl compared to the averaged slope properties of mn tani 1997 hence when cumulative rainfall is large enough the concept of saturated rainfall in sfm is applicable not only to the small watershed scale mn but also to the planar hillslope sl during the 1976 storm the threshold for runoff increase in mn occurred around 2 00 on september 10 fig a3 and the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff volumes up to this threshold were 67 and 4 mm respectively the cap was achieved around 14 00 on september11 and the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff volumes up to this time were 186 and 54 mm respectively therefore three stages in the runoff generation mechanism can be distinguished as follows 1 initially rainwater falling onto most of the entire watershed was absorbed in the dry soil in the first dry stage 2 then the area contributing to stormflow generation was extended over the entire catchment and 3 finally the contributing area was fixed to the entire watershed because total storm runoff 186 mm in this period was almost equal to total rainfall 189 mm interestingly a similar and constant value 5 4 mm h 1 for both rainfall intensity and runoff rate occurred from 10 00 to 14 00 on september 12 suggesting a steady state response to constant rainfall intensity was achieved in this period for the entire mn watershed to examine the applicability of sfe to the runoff responses this equation set was applied to the storm event by optimizing the parameter values for the hydrograph in the third stage cap using the method of least squares optimized values of p and k are 0 3 and 40 mm0 7 h0 3 respectively fig a3 the comparison between observed and calculated hydrographs clearly demonstrates a distinction in the characteristics of the three stages as well as good agreement between the result calculated by sfe with the observed hydrograph in the third stage runoff responses in mn and sl during a storm in july 1987 were compared with those calculated by sfe where the parameters for mn were the same as those in the 1976 storm fig a3 cap was not fully achieved for mn because the calculated hydrograph was higher than the observed hydrograph but the second transient stage continued until the end of the event for sl however the hydrograph calculated using the optimized k value 27 mm0 7 h0 3 obtained by the method of least squares for the same p value 0 3 agreed with the observed hydrograph in the final stage of this event after 2 00 on july 19 hence the cap may be roughly achieved although the total runoff 47 mm in this duration was somewhat smaller than the total rainfall 60 mm and a small portion of rainfall was not contributing to storm runoff we can therefore conclude that the applicability of sfe is valid for storm runoff responses at a hillslope scale as well at a small watershed scale although the cumulative rainfall necessary to achieve cap was smaller fig a2 and the hydrograph is steeper fig a4 for sl than mn 
5359,numerical experiments on vertical unsaturated flow using the richards equation were conducted to examine the physical basis of why storm runoff responses from mountainous watersheds in tectonically active regions could be simulated by simple runoff models with a runoff storage power law relationship pressure head propagation transmitted through vertical unsaturated flow could produce a rapid response of the outflow from bottom of the soil column regardless of the inherent soil hydraulic properties similar to storm runoff responses observed on a hillslope in a constant allocation period when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff additional experiments were conducted both for an increasing stage of downward flux in response to increasing rainfall intensity and for a recession stage without rainfall to investigate the detailed characteristics of vertical unsaturated flow the creation of a wetting front during the increasing stage delayed the increase of outflow but this delay was small during a constant allocation period an interdependent relationship between the outflow rate and the total storage of the soil column throughout the recession stage was approximated by a power law equation derived from relationships between total storage and constant outflow under steady state conditions the exponent of the power law equation approached a maximum of unity as the column length decreased and it approached the minimum value obtained from the intrinsic relationship between soil hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as the column length increased the interdependence of the outflow rate with the total storage generally detected only in the unsaturated zone might cause a low sensitivity of outflow responses to the heterogeneities of soil hydraulic properties justifying the application of simple runoff models in heterogeneous mountain watersheds keywords hillslope hydrology storm runoff response vertical unsaturated flow soil hydraulic properties runoff storage relationship 1 introduction predicting stream runoff responses to large magnitude storms is critically important to mitigate severe flood hazards in tectonically active regions including japan and other circum pacific regions tsukamoto and minematsu 1987 sidle et al 2006 sidle and bogaard 2016 it was already found over a half century ago that storm runoff responses could be roughly simulated by simple runoff models sueishi 1955 nash 1960 sugawara 1961 but we have not clearly understood what hydrological processes dominantly control the responses fatichi et al 2016 mcdonnell et al 2007 montgomery and dietrich 2002 chifflard et al 2019 it is difficult even now to determine what watershed characteristics each parameter of such a simple runoff model may physically reflect therefore to couple studies on the runoff model development with those on storm runoff generation mechanisms is still a fundamental subject in hydrological sciences in this paper we try to examine the physical meaning included in a model parameter by selecting the storage function model sfm proposed by kimura 1961 this lumped runoff model includes a power law relationship between storage and discharge as the core equation this model is the standard tool for projects undertaken by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism project for the enhancement of capabilities in flood control and sabo engineering of the dpwh 2002 and has been widely used throughout asia sugiyama et al 1997 park et al 1999 wu et al 2011 gopalan et al 2018 on the other hand various types of runoff models emphasizing increasingly detailed hydrological processes have been proposed in the past half century beven 2012 but the relatively simple application of the sfm suggests there are two kinds of general characteristics discussed below included in watershed hydrological processes regardless of its simple and rather old fashioned structure one characteristic provided by the sfm is derived from the concept of saturated rainfall the sfm assumes the area contributing to a storm runoff response is limited to a portion of the watershed at the beginning of a storm event but that the contributing area is spatially extended by a sequence of rainfall kimura 1975 defined saturated rainfall as the cumulative rainfall at the time when the contribution area reaches the entire watershed and considered that the ratio of rainfall allocated to the storm runoff had a constant value called as the saturated runoff ratio park et al 1999 this concept has been accepted in many studies on runoff analysis a recent study by supraba and yamada 2015 investigated storm runoff responses in 36 mountainous watersheds in japan and demonstrated that all the rainfall was allocated to storm runoff after the cumulative rainfall reached the saturated rainfall in 23 watersheds the value of which ranged from 81 8 mm to 170 9 mm the saturated runoff ratio may be regarded as unity for these watersheds however this result should be checked because the simple concept of saturated rainfall in the sfm was empirically obtained from runoff analysis to simulate runoff responses to storms at a watershed scale and did not specify detailed hydrological mechanisms at a hillslope scale kimura 1975 first we have to consider that the value of runoff ratio for storm runoff responses may be affected by the underestimation of watershed mean rainfall particularly in mountainous regions tani 1996 arnaud et al 2011 even though the rainfall records are sufficiently accurate the runoff ratio should be lower than unity this is caused both by forest canopy interception during a storm event murakami 2006 and leakage into the deep underground structure where groundwater does not contribute to storm runoff response katsuyama et al 2008 from this perspective we refer to a sprinkler experiment conducted in watershed cb1 in oregon coast range usa montgomery et al 1997 anderson et al 1997 torres et al 1998 sprinkled water was supplied at constant intensity onto a small unchanneled watershed for several days and runoff reached a constant rate although the rate per unit watershed area was lower than the rainfall intensity due to losses including evapotranspiration and infiltration into the underlying bedrock however the actual input rate of the sprinkled water had a diurnal oscillation due to an influence of evapotranspiration and this was reflected by a gentler diurnal oscillation in the output runoff rate and the period with constant runoff rate was called as quasi steady state montgomery et al 1997 this result suggested that such a period is important for analyzing runoff generation mechanisms even if the runoff ratio is less than unity and the input rainfall is not with a constant intensity certainly the concept of saturated rainfall was only empirically obtained from runoff analyses by the sfm but the period when the rainfall exceeds the saturated rainfall may contribute to an elucidation of complex storm runoff mechanisms because we can assume the stormflow contribution area does not change anymore hence we define constant allocation period cap as the period when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff our analysis in this paper focuses on stormflow generation processes only in cap to avoid the complexity derived from the temporal and spatial variability of stormflow contributing area hewlett and hibbert 1967 the second characteristic of sfm assumes that the functional relationship between the runoff rate and storage is a simple power law equation which can be described with the continuum equation as 1 s f k q f p 2 ds f dt r q f where sf and qf are the watershed storage l and the runoff rate l t 1 per unit watershed area calculated by sfm r is the rainfall intensity l t 1 and p dimensionless and k l1 p t p are empirical parameters eqs 1 and 2 imply that runoff rate can be obtained from watershed storage by a one to one relationship and the equation set composed of eqs 1 and 2 included in sfm is hereinafter referred to as sfe in this paper hysteresis between storage and runoff has been already recognized since the original proposal of sfm kimura 1975 and the one to one relationship can only be an approximation nevertheless the sfe has been included as a component in many runoff models including the tank model sugawara 1961 1995 hbv model bergström and forsman 1973 hycymodel fukushima and suzuki 1988 tani et al 2012 and the nam model madsen 2000 therefore a major question in hillslope hydrology is why a simple equation set like sfe provides adequate descriptions of runoff responses despite the litany of stormflow generation mechanisms identified by previous studies these two characteristics of sfm may suggest that a cap is created in response to a large magnitude storm where cumulative rainfall exceeds saturated rainfall and that the temporal change in runoff hydrograph produced from the rainfall hyetograph may be approximated by sfe considering only the cap we can focus on analyzing the simple conversion process from the hyetograph to the hydrograph within the fixed runoff contribution area our paper aims to elucidate the hydraulic mechanism at the hillslope scale that produces storm runoff responses approximated by sfe because rainfall at the ground surface is a parallel vertical flux of water moving under the influence of gravity the first process of water movement on a hillslope may usually occur as a vertical infiltration although the flow direction is somewhat modified by heterogeneous soil physical properties noguchi et al 1999 sidle et al 2000 retter et al 2006 of course above ground and soil surface heterogeneities may disturb the parallelism for example the throughfall and stem flow in forest may generate a bypass flow within a preferential path nanko et al 2010 liang et al 2011 similarly ground surfaces with a low permeability may promote the generation of infiltration excess overland flow miyata et al 2009 such quick flows may contribute to the stormflow generation even if the soil matrix remains dry liang et al 2009 dusek et al 2012 in a cap when most of the rainwater contributes to storm runoff responses however it is unrealistic to assume that all the storm runoff volume is produced only by preferential and or overland flows important contributions of the soil matrix to storm runoff responses have been suggested also from many field studies showing that a large portion of the stream water during a storm event is occupied by the pre event water pearce et al 1986 gomi et al 2010 iwasaki et al 2015 consequently we estimate that rainwater first infiltrates vertically into the soil and then lateral flow is generated at some depth due to decreasing permeability with depth beven 1984 each contribution of the vertical or lateral flow components may be controlled by various hillslope properties buttle and mcdonald 2002 ebel et al 2007 mirus and loague 2013 and it is important to separately quantify the effects of each component on the storm runoff responses in a cap vertical and lateral flows both in the soil matrix and preferential paths actively contribute to the storm runoff response as schematically illustrated in fig 1 because a large constant portion of the rainfall is allocated to the storm runoff among these flow components this paper mainly focuses on elucidating the contribution of vertical flow component in the soil matrix to storm runoff responses through numerical experiments using the richards equation naturally the contribution of preferential flow should be also evaluated and the vertical flow should be coupled with lateral flow in order to completely understand stormflow generation mechanism on a hillslope however it is important to initially specify the role of vertical unsaturated flow vuf first because it has not been adequately understood tani 1985a dusek et al 2012 we will make some discussion in sections 4 2 and 4 3 on effects of heterogeneities with preferential paths and interrelationship between vertical and lateral flow systems before we investigate the role of vuf in storm runoff responses we have to examine whether the application of sfe to runoff responses in caps at a watershed scale can be applied also at a hillslope scale this assessment is important because scale issues derived from spatial differences from hillslopes to watersheds have been widely discussed in hydrology blöschl and sivapalan 1995 sivapalan 2003 mcguire et al 2005 clark et al 2009 asano et al 2009 sidle et al 2017 hence we reanalyzed a hydrometric observation on a steep planar hillslope with a thin soil layer in appendix 1 before we begin our main investigation using the numerical experiments by the richards equation parameter values of p and k in eq 1 obtained from the application of sfe to the hillslope observational result will be used as a criterion to determine whether the vuf can produce storm runoff responses 2 method of numerical experiments 2 1 fundamental equation the vertical unsaturated flow vuf occurs as the first stage of stormflow generation on forested hillslopes as long as the soil layer is not fully saturated we conducted numerical experiments using the one dimensional vertical form of richards equation for vuf in the soil column 3 c ψ t z k ψ z 1 where k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 c is the specific water capacity defined as d θ d ψ l 1 ψ is the pressure head l θ is the volumetric water content dimensionless and t is time t the origin is placed at the bottom of the soil column and the vertical z axis is positive in the upward direction the boundary conditions at the column surface is set as 4 f r where r is the rainfall intensity l t 1 and f is the vertical water flux l t 1 defined by darcy s law as 5 f k ψ z 1 the boundary condition at the column bottom is set to a seepage face in which the outflow rate is calculated by a pressure head of zero at a saturated bottom condition with the rate remaining at zero for negative pressure head conditions because we focus our analysis on vuf only during cap ψ at the column bottom is always zero indicating that the groundwater table is fixed to the bottom this assumption might be unrealistic for a rising groundwater table but issues on the interactions between saturated and unsaturated zones are discussed in section 4 3 a versatile software hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 was adopted to get numerical solutions of the richards equation a physically based kosugi 1996 model was selected to define soil hydraulic properties for the solutions because this model is derived from pore size distribution and suitable for our purpose of parameter identification for forest soils with abundant macropores 6 θ θ s θ r s e θ r θ s θ r q ln ψ ψ m σ θ r 7 k k s q ln ψ ψ m σ 1 2 q ln ψ ψ m σ σ 2 where θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents dimensionless se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 ψm is the pressure head calculated from the median pore radius σ is the standard deviation of the log normal distribution of soil pore radius dimensionless and q is the complimentary normal distribution function note that our solutions of eq 3 are the temporal changes in spatial distributions of hydraulic variables ψ θ and k and flux in the vertical soil column and that the outflow rate from the bottom can be calculated from the solutions the runoff rate from the downslope end of the soil layer cannot be estimated from our numerical experiments because the hydraulic formula for lateral flow is not given regarding this limitation of ignoring lateral flow it should be emphasized that hydraulic characteristics of lateral flow system including preferential flow paths have yet to be quantified because of their heterogeneous distributions in the soil layer even though the observational findings generally showed their important roles in quick drainage of the groundwater anderson et al 1997 sidle et al 2000 uchida et al 2003 see the discussion in section 4 3 hence it may be important as an initial step for our comprehensive understanding of hillslope runoff responses to identify hydraulic behaviour in the unsaturated zone because outflow from this zone promotes subsequent lateral flow 2 2 soil hydraulic properties to examine the physical basis why storm runoff responses can be widely simulated by the sfe in caps it is desirable to compare the results of vuf calculated from the richards equation using many types of soil hydraulic properties and various heterogeneous structures composed of the plural soil types in this paper we addressed this examination by selecting small numbers of different soil types to save a lot of energy for the comparison for this purpose we used five soils with homogeneous hydraulic properties two soil types sa and sb were derived from the soil layer on a study hillslope sl 0 05 ha see appendix 1 one typical forest soil cr one loamy soil lm and one soil substituted for preferential flow network pf were also used for our analysis in addition we discussed dependences of the vuf on three different stratified soil structures the parameters of soil hydraulic properties used for our numerical experiments are listed in table 1 the relationships of θ and k to ψ are plotted in fig 2 a and b respectively where the axis of ψ is given in a logarithmic scale because the relationships near the saturation should be emphasized when analyzing the behaviour in caps with relatively wet soil conditions two soils sa and sb were estimated by tani 1997 for soils at 10 cm depths the plots of which were 11 0 m called t4 and 1 2 m called t1 upslope from the hillslope bottom of sl with the length of 42 7 m because the thin soil layer at sl was not clearly stratified we tried to simulate the pressure head values observed at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at t4 by combining these two soils as described in section 3 1 cr was one of the average crumb structure soils selected from a catalogue for forest soil in japan using the 282 samples mashimo 1960 and lm was one of the average loamy soil taken from mualem s 1976 catalogue parameters of soil hydraulic properties in eqs 6 and 7 for cr and lm were determined based on a characterization study on forest soil by kosugi 1997a 1997b table 1a one additional soil pf was chosen to examine effects of preferential path network on vuf using the richards equation based on a dual continuum model gerke and van genuchten 1993 developed to assess infiltration processes in vertical columns consisting of soil matrix and preferential flow domains in this model the preferential path network was substituted for one type of soil filled with relatively coarse particles eroded from the matrix vogel et al 2010 and the soil hydraulic properties given for such a soil by dusek et al 2012 was also selected for pf the values of parameters α l 1 and n dimensionless in the following van genuchten 1980 model are listed in table 1b 8 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 9 k k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 the hydraulic properties for pf can be well fitted also by kosugi model as pfkos fig 2 the parameter of which are listed in table 1a the value of ψm for pfkos will be used for a discussion in section 3 5 we should note that because pf represents only one type of preferential paths with a small amount of fine particles flow in other types including pipe like preferential paths may give different effects on the vuf general effects of heterogeneities including preferential paths on the vuf is discussed in section 4 2 we also selected three types of stratified soil structures to consider the effects of heterogeneous soil structure on vuf one was lsa consisting of lm at depths of 0 20 cm and 50 70 cm with sa between these layers another stratified structure kes was composed of seven layers each with a depth of 10 cm the properties of kes were measured in a forested hillslope at kamigamo experimental station in kyoto japan liang et al 2009 table 1c and hydraulic properties of kes are inserted into fig 2 the third soil structure sab was a combination of sa for the depth of 0 12 cm and sb for the depth of 12 70 cm the ranges of parameter space considered by mirus and loague 2013 in an investigation of runoff generation mechanisms are identified in fig 2 to secure the generality of our numerical experiments the ψ k relationships in in fig 2b correspond approximately with the range by mirus and loague fig 2b but ψ θ relationships for cr pf and soils included in kes extend beyond the range near saturation fig 2a however note that differences between θs and θr for cr and soils in kes are similar to our other soil types and may control the behaviour of vuf through the value of c d θ d ψ in our fundamental eq 3 hence the absolute values of θs and θr are not important to the simulation results a large value of 0 59 in the difference of θs and θr for pf can be regarded reasonable because of the existence of preferential flow paths thus we can conclude our experiments can generally describe the basic behaviour of vuf in cap although the numbers of soil types tested are limited 2 3 design of experiments six types of numerical experiments were designed for this study first we conducted a comparison of results calculated through vuf with those observed in the sl exp 1 the next two types of experiments aimed to determine detailed characteristics of vuf in cap through calculations pertaining to an increasing stage that followed an initial steady state during transition to another steady state with higher rainfall intensity exp 2 and a recession stage without rainfall following a steady state response to a constant rainfall exp 3 experiment 4 was added to examine the characteristics of vuf under steady state conditions in response to rainfall with various constant intensities the length of the soil column for experiments 1 2 3 and 4 was constant 70 cm as shown later the relationship of soil column storage to the outflow rate during the recession stage was closely associated to a string of the relationships under steady state conditions in addition experiments 5 and 6 were conducted to ascertain the meaning of parameter p in sfe as well as to identify dependences of vuf on soil column depth evaporation was assumed to be negligible in all the experiments because our target was to examine only stormflow responses 3 experiment results 3 1 comparison with field observations the final stage of the 1987 storm observed at the sl shown in fig a4 was targeted for our comparison in exp 1 because this period can be estimated as a cap due to enough amount of cumulative rainfall see detailed description of this storm event in appendix 1 although comparisons focused on the responses in a cap calculations started at the onset of this july 14 storm the initial condition of ψ was zero at the base of the soil column and the vertical distribution in the column was set at hydrostatic equilibrium the results calculated by eight soil structures consisting of sa sb cr lm pf lsa kes and sab are shown in panels a to h of fig 3 the upper panels a1 to h1 illustrate the observed rainfall intensity r the observed runoff rate qb and the calculated outflow rate from the soil layer bottom u the lower panels a2 to h2 show the observed and calculated ψ values at 10 30 and 50 cm depths the runoff rate qf calculated by sfe with p and k of 0 3 and 27 mm0 7 h0 3 also plotted in fig a4 is inserted to the panel a1 rapid propagation of the pressure head in the soil columns was commonly found in the observed and calculated values and all the calculated hydrographs of outflow rates exhibited similar timescales to the storm runoff hydrographs observed in sl and calculated by sfe fig 3 however the magnitude of the delay and smoothing for the calculated results depended on the soil types and the peak outflow rates in descending order were kes lm lsa pf sb sab cr and sa the observed peak runoff rate and that calculated by sfe were almost the same and located between the peak outflow rates for cr and sa interestingly lm with the lowest ks value produced a high runoff peak although the highest ks value was represented by pf hence the outflow responses never reflected the magnitude of ks but were dependent on the hydraulic characteristics of vuf which were controlled by relationships among ψ θ and k the calculated distributions of ψ for sab in fig 3 h2 compared well with those observations but this is obvious because this combination of these soils was tuned by a trial and error to get a comparatively good result it should be rather noted that the local distributions of hydraulic variables were sensitive to soil hydraulic properties and stratified structures fig 3 lower panels a more important finding derived from this experiment was that temporal changes of u were rapid enough to produce the observed storm runoff response regardless of soil structure the peak of each calculated outflow with the exception of sa was higher than the peak of the observed runoff and its time of occurrence coincided closely to those observed for most of the soil structures fig 3 however both cr and sa exhibited a slightly later time of occurrence because the subsequent lateral flow was added to the vuf for hillslope runoff discharge we have to consider an additional change of the hydrograph through lateral flow nonetheless these results suggest this change may be generally small fig 3 some areas on the sl hillslope have very thin soil and the unsaturated zone may become thinner than the depth of the soil layer near the hillslope toe because the accumulation of water there causes a rise of groundwater table consequently these zones may contribute to the generation of higher outflow peaks and earlier times of occurrence although effects of these heterogeneities on runoff responses are taken into consideration it should be emphasized that the process of pressure head propagation through the vuf fig 3 can substantially contribute to the production of rapid storm runoff responses in a cap this occurs even though various flow components including infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flows and preferential flow in the soil and weathered bedrock layers may also contribute to the generation of storm runoff on a hillslope 3 2 summary of experiments with constant rainfall intensities a large contribution of vuf to storm runoff responses was suggested from our comparison of the results from exp 1 with those observed on a hillslope the next experiments attempted to further investigate the detailed distributions of hydraulic variables within a soil column and to elucidate whether the outflow rate produced through vuf can be generally approximated by the runoff rate qf produced by the sfe consequently exps 2 and 3 focused on responses to simpler rainfall conditions with constant intensities instead of conditions existing in a natural storm i e exp 1 experiment 2 was conducted for a transient increasing stage from an initial steady state with a constant rainfall of 1 mm h 1 to a new steady state with a constant rainfall of 10 mm h 1 this was selected as an example of hydrological responses to an increase in rainfall intensity during a cap after the entire soil layer already became wet during large cumulative rainfall experiment 3 examined the recession stage after a steady state with constant rainfall of 10 mm h 1 soil column length soil type and stratified structure in both exps 2 and 3 were the same as those for exp 1 temporal changes in u calculated for each soil structure and changes in qf calculated by sfe using the same parameter values as exp 1 are plotted in fig 4 temporal and spatial distributions of hydraulic variables including ψ θ k and downward flux fd are illustrated in fig 5 to allow examination of the detailed hydrological behaviour in each soil column with different structures fig 6 shows the relationships of storage s to u where s is defined as the storage l of the column of length of d l 10 s 0 d θ d z sd in fig 6 a represents the storage of transient water defined as 11 s d s s 0 where s 0 is the storage at hydrostatic equilibrium with ψ at the column bottom of zero as 12 s 0 0 d θ ψ z d z the sf for sfe calculated from qf in eq 1 is also plotted in fig 6 a fig 6 b shows the relationship in a log log scale using the dimensionless ratio s of sd to the total storage of transient water defined as 13 s s d s s s 0 where ss is the storage at full saturation of the soil column and defined as 14 s s d θ s both s and u the outflow rate from the soil layer bottom decrease toward zero because evapotranspiration is neglected in our numerical experiments and the maximum of s is unity in response to the maximum of u equal to ks hence this definition of s can provide a useful methodology for a comparison of the calculation results between vuf with sfe during the recession stage in addition to the results from exp 3 the values of s at steady state in response to a constant r intensity obtained from exp 4 are plotted in fig 6 b lines inserted there are the gradients in the power law relationships between qf and sf given by p values in eq 1 3 3 increasing stage from an initial steady state to another with higher rainfall intensity the order of increasing time at which outflow begins to increase called hereinafter increasing start time was lm pf kes cr lsa sb sab and sa fig 4 however the timing to approach a new steady state rate of 10 mm h 1 differed due to differences in the rate of increase for each calculation a relatively rapid increase is shown in the curves of kes lsa sb sab and sa in contrast a gentle rate of increase occurred in lm pf and cr hence hydrographs may reflect differences in the pressure head propagation among various soil structures effects of each soil structure on the distributions of variables ψ θ and k and flux fd are presented in fig 5 in the case of sa where u increased rapidly almost the entire soil column exhibited constant values of ψ θ and k except for a thin zone near the bottom when the column was under the initial and final steady states in response to the two rainfall intensities of 1 and 10 mm h 1 in contrast soil structure lm lacked zones with any constant values of these variables under both steady states and increases in the values of these variables were smoothly transmitted from the surface to the bottom of the soil column resulting in the early increasing start time of u fig 4 however the increasing curve for lm was much gentler than that for sa and the time when it attained the new steady state with 10 mm h 1 was not much different to understand the hydraulic behaviours that depend on soil hydraulic properties as shown for sa and lm we investigated the theoretical structure of eq 3 with a homogeneous soil structure the effects of advection and diffusion on hydraulic behaviours are represented by the first and second terms on the right hand side of darcy s law included in eq 3 and rewritten from eq 5 as 15 f d f k k ψ z because the diffusion term is zero within the zone with constant hydraulic variables that was created in the upper portion of the soil column the constant value of ψ is calculated from r by assigning r to k in eq 15 if the diffusion term can be negligible the richards equation in eq 3 is converted to the following continuity equation 16 θ t c ψ t k z when rainfall intensity increases from r 1 to r 2 the zone with flux r 2 is extended downward with velocity va smith 1983 torres et al 1998 and described as follows 17 v a r 2 r 1 θ k r 2 θ k r 1 when applying the equation to the vuf for sa va is 18 7 cm h 1 because r 1 r 2 θ k r 1 and θ k r 2 are 1 mm h 1 10 mm h 1 0 338 and 0 386 respectively and the propagation time for the 70 cm column was calculated as 3 7 h suggesting the assumption of advection in eq 16 may be acceptable for sa figs 4 and 5 therefore a large delay of the increasing start time of u in fig 4 was caused by a small value of va when each of the variables ψ θ and k are controlled only by the advection term a sharp wetting front below the zone with constant values of hydraulic variables would be delineated as a horizontal line in each of panels a to e of fig 5 however the actual wetting front in each panel was more or less smooth caused by the diffusion term furthermore the value of each hydraulic variable decreased with increasing depth along the wetting front the distribution of ψ near the bottom of the column approached the hydrostatic equilibrium line passing through ψ 0 at the bottom and the value of each variable increased with increasing depth hence the distribution of ψ has an inflection point at ψ z 0 between the two reverse curves fig 5 consequently the distributions of hydraulic variables in the soil column in an increasing stage can be segmented into three zones the near surface zone with constant values for the variables is controlled only by the advection term the second and third zones are divided by the inflection point and both controlled by advection and diffusion terms however u does not begin to increase unless the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under the initial steady state where the downward flux fd remains equal to the initial outflow rate of 1 mm h 1 therefore for soil types such as sa where a large rainwater is absorbed in the first and second zones the inflection point departing from the original distribution is deep and the increasing start time of u is late figs 4a 5a1 after the inflection point departs from its original distribution the increase of ψ at the inflection point is transmitted to the bottom due to an effect of the diffusion term and u rapidly increases from the initial rate to the final steady state on the other hand for soil types such as lm fig 5d1 where the near surface zone controlled by the advection term is hardly produced the inflection point of ψ created at a shallow depth rapidly departs its original distribution hence u rapidly begins to increase but the increasing velocity is low because most of the rainwater supplied from the surface is allocated to storage increase throughout the soil column and only a small portion of the storage increase is discharged as u figs 4a 5d2 accordingly the interdependence between u and storage volume may cause a gradual increase of u indeed fig 4 demonstrates that the runoff rate qf calculated by sfe was the most gradual increase because a large portion of the rainwater was allocated to storage sf from the beginning of increasing stage due to the one to one relationship between qf and sf in eq 1 consequently the vuf in the increasing stage during a cap may produce a different outflow response from the storm runoff response calculated from sfe because a delay for the increasing start time of u is created in the former but not in the latter nonetheless the total time necessary for outflow increase is enough short and similar to that for storm runoff responses not only calculated by sfe but also observed on a hillslope figs 3 and 4 however the short timescale similar to storm runoff responses is generated only during caps but much longer timescale is needed when the initial soil condition is dry this issue will be discussed in section 4 1 next let us compare the behaviours of vuf and their contributions to the outflow responses among soil types fig 6a shows that the increase of sd for each soil type is constructed of two portions represented by a dashed line and dashed dotted line the former represents a vertical line without an increase in u because the inflection point of ψ has not yet departed from its original distribution under the initial steady state on the other hand the latter represents an inclined curve because the inflection point has already departed from the original distribution and the storage increase is accompanied by an increase in u the increasing patterns of u for the homogeneous soil structures in fig 4 are explained by the distributions of volumetric water content in fig 5 as follows the earlier increasing start time for sb compared to sa is caused by its smaller difference of θ between the two steady state conditions panels a2 and b2 resulting in a larger va in eq 17 a comparatively shallow inflection point of ψ panel e1 for pf coincided with a gentle increase of u in fig 4 the curve of u in cr in fig 4 with a late increasing start time and a gentle curve may result from the distribution pattern where the inflection point of ψ departs from the original distribution at an intermediate depth panel c1 unlike homogeneous soil structures the distributions of hydraulic variables ψ θ and k for stratified structures in panels f to h of fig 5 were complex particularly near the borders between layers in both homogeneous and stratified structures however it should be noted that the downward flux fd was constant or monotonically decreased with increasing depth throughout the transient process from one steady state to another in response to increasing rainfall intensity consequently smooth curves of fd compared to the hydraulic variables are illustrated in each of the bottom panels f4 to h4 of fig 5 therefore even though the distributions of variables were varied considerably we believe that their complex shapes resulted from the calculation processes i e eq 3 which ensured that smooth distributions of fd are produced from the boundary conditions for kes the propagation time calculated from va was 1 36 h shorter than that for sa sb and sab this may be caused by the soil structure consisting of soils with relatively small differences between θr and θs fig 2 and table 1c responding to an early increase of u fig 4 the distribution for soil column lsa exhibited an interesting shape due to an immediate transmission in the both side layers with lm and a delay of the transmission was mainly created in the sa layer sandwiched between the lm layers fig 5f2 hence the delay in the transmission through the 30 cm sa zone was calculated as 1 6 h eq 17 matching the timing of the increasing start time for lsa in fig 4 from the distributions of hydraulic variables for three stratified structures fig 5f to h it is apparent that the downward fluxes fd were similar to those found in the homogeneous soil structures consequently we suggest that the dependences of u on the behaviours of vuf may be generally applicable irrespective of whether soil hydraulic properties in the column are homogeneous or heterogeneous 3 4 recession stage from a steady state at the beginning of the recession stage time was required for the transmission of a sudden flux change at the soil layer surface to the bottom fig 4 this is represented by each curve in both panels of fig 6 which exhibited a small region showing a storage decrease accompanied with little decrease of u at the beginning of recession stage however each curve in fig 6 was soon connected to a smooth curve with an intrinsic outflow and storage relationship because the surface boundary condition changed from constant rainfall intensity to zero at the beginning of exp 3 fd always increased with increasing depth throughout the recession stage when soil hydraulic properties were homogeneous panels a to e of fig 5 the variables ψ θ and k increased monotonically with increasing depth these monotonic increases may be reflected in smooth decreasing curves of u without abrupt changes in fig 4 and smooth curves of the distributions of the variables without inflection points in fig 5 although the increasing start time and inflection point were created in an increasing stage section 3 3 the entire column in a recession stage was always included within the zone controlled both by advective and diffusive terms of eq 15 consequently fig 6 shows that relationships between outflow and storage exhibited smooth curves throughout the recession stage and that the gradients of these curves were comparable with the gradient controlled by parameter p of sfe the outflow and storage relationships in the dimensionless scale in fig 6 b demonstrate that all curves in the recession stage from exp 3 were parallel to those in a string of relationships under steady state conditions obtained from exp 4 except near the beginning of the recession stage the parallel curves for all soil structures were slightly upwardly convex and their gradients increased with decreasing outflow rates comparing responses among the five homogeneous soil structures those producing late increasing start time of u arising from the effect of the near surface zone controlled only by the advection term in the increasing stages e g sa and sb tended to have smaller p values in the recession stage whereas those structures characterized by gradually increasing curves e g lm and pf had larger p values intermediate p values were detected for cr which produced an intermediate curve characteristic for u such dependences of p value on soil hydraulic properties are examined in exps 5 and 6 in section 3 5 for each of the three stratified soil structures lsa kes and sab the increase in fd with increasing depth fig 5f4 h4 was similar to that for each of the homogeneous structures even though those for ψ θ and k for each stratified structure were considerably deformed near the layer junctions such a low sensitivity of fd to heterogeneities is reflected in their similar shapes compared to those with homogeneous properties both in hydrographs fig 4 and in the outflow storage relationships fig 6 therefore it is noted that the outflow storage relationship can be approximated by a power law equation in sfe even though the soil structure is heterogeneous 3 5 parameterization of vertical unsaturated flow for the runoff storage relationship in order to determine dependences of p values included in sfe on soil hydraulic properties and soil column lengths additional numerical experiments exps 5 and 6 were conducted for soil columns with hydraulic properties of sb experiment 5 focused on a recession stage similar to exp 3 although the length of the column and the flux intensity for the initial steady state conditions were set as 200 cm and 100 mm h 1 respectively experiment 6 was similar to exp 4 for a string of the steady state responses of vuf to various rainfall intensities but the calculations were made for eight columns with lengths d of 10 20 30 50 70 100 150 and 200 cm the relationships of s to u calculated from the experiments are illustrated in fig 7 the relationship between u and s directly calculated from the hydraulic properties k and θ for sb hereinafter called the θ k base relationship is also plotted in fig 7 by substituting steady state flux u into k and converting θ to s using eqs 6 10 13 fig 8 shows the distributions of θ in the 200 cm soil column at several time points during the recession stage exp 5 and those under the steady state conditions exp 6 producing the same u value as in the recession stage the vertical distribution of θ for steady state conditions obtained from exp 6 was generally segmented into two zones fig 8 vertical lines near the surface were originated from the advection term of darcy s law in eq 15 and k values along these lines were regarded equal to the downward steady state flux fd and rainfall intensity r because ψ z 0 in eq 15 on the other hand our bottom boundary condition ψ 0 enforced higher k values than fd and values of ψ z close to 1 in eq 15 near the bottom consequently both distributions in the recession stage and under steady state conditions approached hydrostatic equilibrium near the bottom the former zone near the surface and the latter zone near the bottom are hereinafter defined as an advection zone az and an asymptotic equilibrium zone ez respectively the gradients of u s relationships were then examined the θ k base relationship can be regarded as the u s relationship for a very long soil column fig 7 where the proportion of ez to the total column length is negligible because most of this column is within az fig 8 therefore u s curves under steady state conditions approach the θ k base relationship as column length increases fig 7 thus we recognize that the smallest p value in response to a given range of u is determined by the θ k base relationship derived from soil hydraulic properties in contrast to long columns the u s relationships for short columns exhibited large p values approaching unity indicating the linear relationship between u and s as column length decreased fig 7 this may reflect the distribution of θ under steady state conditions fig 8 the distribution of a steady state flux is controlled only by the bottom boundary condition but not dependent on the column length consequently the steady state distribution of θ illustrated for depth from the bottom 200 cm to 200 d cm fig 8 may represent the distribution of θ for the soil column with length of d and almost the entire portion of a column with a very small d value may reside within ez for the soil hydraulic properties of sb therefore the range of p may range from unity for a short column residing mostly in ez to a small value for a long column derived from az fig 7 interestingly this dependence of p on the proportion of the az and ez zones is also detected in the dependence on the hydraulic properties in each homogeneous soil fig 6 for example fig 5 d2 shows most of the column lm was covered within ez or a transition zone between ez and az under steady state conditions with u 1 or 10 mm h 1 but vertical lines representing az were not contained in the steady state distributions these distributions may be reflected in the value of p for lm fig 6b that is p 1 for u 1 mm h 1 and a slightly smaller p value for u 10 mm h 1 on the other hand fig 5 a2 shows that most of the column for sa was covered with az under the steady state resulting in the smallest value of p for a local u value in fig 6 b the slightly higher p value for sb compared to sa can be explained by the shorter az for sb compare fig 5b2 and a2 consequently we can conclude that dependences of p values on soil hydraulic properties and soil column lengths are mainly controlled by the vertical distribution of θ in a column with a given length under a steady state condition because this distribution may be controlled by the soil pore size distribution in eqs 6 and 7 kosugi 1996 and ψm is incorporated as a parameter originated from the median pore radius a dimensionless parameter δ was introduced here to parameterize the characteristics of vertical unsaturated flow for the p values 18 δ d ψ m fig 9 shows the dependence of p on δ in response to u 1 mm h 1 based on the results of exp 6 eight plots for sb and a plot for each of other four soil types indicate the results for columns with lengths from 10 to 200 cm and the result for the 70 cm column respectively besides p values for the θ k base relationships of these soils are also plotted at the right side although soil hydraulic properties and column length both involve the dependence the decreasing tendency of p from 1 to a small value given by the θ k base relationship can be consistently detected in response to increasing δ value accordingly δ may play an important role in the hydraulic behaviours of vuf such a dimensionless parameter defined as a ratio of vertical soil column length to representative pressure head was often introduced by similarity analyses of unsaturated flow miller and miller 1956 verma and brutsaert 1970 tani 1982 1985b however the basic hydraulic findings from these studies have been rarely used for the hydrological studies on storm runoff response tani 1985a 2013 it is believed that our finding on parameterization of vuf for the relationship of p to δ may contribute to a new perspective about a coupling of hydrology with soil physics 4 discussion 4 1 effects of soil wetness on outflow response our numerical experiments strongly suggest that vuf may produce rapid outflow responses to storm rainfall regardless of the type of soil structure as long as the entire soil layer is already wet in a cap this suggests the lateral flow receiving outflow from the vertical flow process is so fast that storm flow hydrograph is little deformed through the lateral process in a cap we first discuss the rationale why such rapid responses were produced from vuf the interdependence of outflow and storage was detected in the increasing stage from one steady state to another only after the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under the initial steady state fig 5 resulting in a creation of increasing start time of u fig 4 however the timescale of this increasing start time is significantly different between wet conditions during cap and dry conditions prior to a rainfall event note that the usual range of rainfall intensity r from 1 mm h 1 for a very gentle intensity to 100 mm h 1 for an extraordinarily heavy storm is limited small compared to the full range of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k and that this may cause large effects of soil wetness on the outflow responses because sufficient cumulative rainfall occurs from the start of the event during a cap the range θ at every depth of the soil column is included only in a small wet portion of the full range from θr to θs this small fluctuation range of θ results in a large va eq 17 and may explain why the vuf during a cap can produce a rapid runoff response with an early increasing start time such a rapid response was observed not only in our study hillslope sl fig a4 but also in a small unchanneled watershed cb1 torres et al 1998 ebel and loague 2008 on the other hand we should note that k values for dry soils prior to a rainfall event are several orders of magnitude lower than those during a cap because of the effects of evapotranspiration and infiltration during the previous rainless period consequently remarkably different behaviours are produced from the vuf under different wetness conditions due to the nonlinear relationship of k to θ much rainwater at the beginning of an event is absorbed when the soil column was dry whereas most of the rainwater received during a cap rapidly contributes to outflow even though its increasing start time may be created this large effect of soil wetness on vuf clearly explained the characteristics of the relationships between total storm rainfall and runoff sl and mn fig a2 which were composed of a dependence of storm runoff volume on the initial runoff rate and a large allocation of rainwater volume to storm runoff volume after large cumulative rainfall accordingly threshold responses discussed by previous studies noguchi et al 1997 tani 1997 graham and mcdonnell 2010 ali et al 2013 dusek and vogel 2016 may at least partly be explained by the hydraulic behaviours of vuf as discussed here 4 2 sensitivity of outflow response to spatial heterogeneities next we discuss the dependency of outflow response on spatial heterogeneities that characterize a natural hillslope soil to address this it is important to understand differences in hydraulic characteristics between lateral and vertical water flow systems in the soil groundwater flow in the saturated zone plays a main role in the lateral flow system contributing to storm runoff response tani 2008 dusek et al 2012 because all the pores included in the soil are filled with water due to the positive pressure potential in the saturated zone flow velocity is mainly controlled by large pores with small friction resistances even though most of the soil layer is occupied by the soil matrix flow through a preferential path may play a dominant role in the lateral system where this exists particularly we should note the large difference in the position of the groundwater table during a cap the soil layer without preferential paths may contain a substantial saturated zone due to a large rise of water table in response to heavy rainfall whereas the unsaturated zone coupled with a low water table remains in the layer containing preferential flow paths because of the effective drainage of groundwater through them the hydraulic behaviour in many preferential pathways cannot be described by darcy s law but rather by the manning equation previously derived from measurements of undisturbed soil with natural pipes kitahara 1993 and hydraulic experiments using artificial pipes sidle et al 1995 tsutsumi et al 2005 however the spatial distribution of ks in the soil matrix and the resistance for a preferential flow network are very difficult to estimate due to their large heterogeneous distribution this causes a fundamental problem for evaluating the effects of lateral flow on runoff response because the velocities through preferential flow networks range across several orders of magnitude anderson et al 1997 uchida et al 2003 hence although many observational studies suggest that storm runoff responses were produced through the lateral flow system including preferential flow paths mcdonnell 1990 sidle et al 2001 uchida et al 2005 guo et al 2014 these individual findings can be hardly extended to a general quantification about the roles of the lateral system this is because of the unknown spatial distribution of these paths indeed it is extremely difficult to formulate the necessary generality required for modelling processes within a soil with abundant heterogeneities unlike a homogeneous system sidle et al 2001 mcdonnell et al 2007 troch et al 2009 effects of the heterogeneities on the vuf may be significantly different from those impacting lateral flow systems connecting paths around living or decayed tree roots certainly produce a quick bypass flow in the unsaturated zone noguchi et al 1999 liang et al 2011 ghestem et al 2011 but the contribution of rapid flow through them may be insufficient to allow a large volume of storm runoff that is nearly equivalent to the rainfall volume in a cap the soil matrix surrounding these paths may also play a role in the production of the large runoff volume tsuboyama et al 1994 in addition our analysis on vuf has demonstrated that the propagation of ψ within the soil matrix in a cap has enough impact to produce a quick storm response figs 4 and 5 the effects of heterogeneity on vuf are examined next based on an application of soil physics let us consider a storage change in an unsaturated zone in response to a change in the vertical flux this process follows the continuity equation derived from eqs 3 and 15 as 19 θ t f d z hence a temporal change in θ in a local thin horizontal layer within the unsaturated zone generally arises in response to a change in fd l t 1 passing through it as long as the layer is under a non steady state because such a change from θ to θ δθ occurs at every local layer the local change is extended to a change in storage of a large portion of the soil column such an interdependence between θ and fd does not occur before the inflection point of ψ departs from its original distribution under an initial steady state fig 5 because this isolation of the surface zone from the layer bottom does not occur during a recession stage however it should be emphasized that the interdependence at a local point may strongly support a close relationship of u to the total storage in the entire soil column approximated by sfe as shown in the u s relationships fig 6b note that this interdependence is derived from δθ at each local point in the soil column during a recession stage then the effects of heterogeneities can be easily understood because water is preferentially retained smaller pores by capillary forces compared to larger ones in an unsaturated zone θ can be described by the relationship c d θ d ψ as the pore capillary pressure distribution function kosugi 1994 and thus 20 θ ψ ψ c ψ d ψ because this equation may be generally applied to any soil even for pf with a small amount of fine particles the dependence of the storage change in the entire soil column on δθ occurs in all soil types this common characteristic found in an unsaturated zone is particularly important because the outflow rate and the entire column storage are always interdependent whether the distribution of soil hydraulic properties is homogeneous or not causing that the sensitivity of the interdependence to heterogeneities of soil structure may be generally small this is because preferential paths with large pores that characterize heterogenous soils may play only a limited role in the vuf due to their small capillary forces unlike the lateral flow system we can therefore conclude that the approximation of storm runoff responses by sfe may be commonly acceptable by regarding the vuf as the main mechanism of stormflow generation irrespective whether the soil structure is homogeneous or heterogeneous 4 3 connection between vertical and lateral flow processes vertical flows both in the soil matrix and via preferential paths can produce storm runoff responses fig 1 in a cap however a large magnitude storm runoff must be produced through lateral flow processes from water provided by vertical flow throughout almost the entire slope area because our findings from this paper are limited only to vertical processes it has not been demonstrated what downslope drainage processes produce large magnitude storm runoff responses in caps however some field studies showed that rainfall runoff responses were mainly produced through vuf and lateral flow process gave little deformation to storm flow hydrograph although characteristics of storm runoff responses are qualitatively similar between the watershed mn and the hillslope sl in tatsunokuchi yama experimental watershed see appendix 1 the geology of 96 of the area in mn is different from that of sl instead of a thin soil layer overlying a hard quartz porphyry bedrock at sl hillslopes in mn generally have deep weathered paleozoic sedimentary bedrock and most rainwater infiltrates into this deep zone a recent study by hosoda and tani 2016 monitored the responses of the groundwater table in the weathered bedrock including the formation of clays and joints on a general hillslope in the mn see the location in fig a1 demonstrating that the water table quickly rose and fell after the entire soil layer became sufficiently wet in such wet conditions an analysis of sio2 concentration showed more than half of the stream water was occupied by pre event water the volume of storm runoff for mn was almost the same as that of rainfall in caps fig a2 during these wet periods the conversion of hyetograph to the hydrograph might be created through vertical flow processes because the hydrograph responses were mostly synchronized with groundwater table responses hosoda and tani 2016 such synchronization cannot be explained unless fissures in the bedrock played a role in groundwater drainage as noted in another watershed underlain by sedimentary bedrock onda et al 2001 another field study in a small steep watershed in the rokko mountains japan was conducted based on observations from numerous wells in weathered granite bedrock kosugi et al 2011 this study showed triple peak runoff responses at different timescales controlled by groundwater in two regionalized bedrock aquifers and the soil mantle groundwater although most mountainous watersheds do not show such multiple peak runoff responses kosugi et al suggested that these unique hydrological processes might be affected by diastrophic activities producing many fault lines the synchronization of responses between the groundwater table and stream water may support our argument on the flow mechanism although a large lag time for each of the two slower runoff peaks is not in the range of stormflow responses the results at this site can be understood by our concept that the conversions of hyetograph to hydrograph might be mainly created not through lateral flow processes but through vertical flow processes based on the results obtained from watershed and hillslope observations previously described as well as from our numerical experiments we conclude that vertical flow component not lateral one may play a dominant role in the conversion from the hyetograph to hydrograph in a cap see fig 1 although the spatial scale involved in vertical processes is generally much shorter than for lateral flow processes this tendency provides a novel point for physically based storm runoff models because the rainfall runoff responses may depend more strongly on properties involved in vertical flow than those for lateral flow indeed montgomery and dietrich 2002 showed that the time lag between rainfall and runoff for a steep hillslope depended little on slope gradient but was rather controlled by the soil moisture retention curve suggesting a larger contribution of vuf to rainfall runoff responses some studies proposed runoff models treating vufs independently from the total runoff processes on a hillslope ohta et al 1983 tani 1985a dusek et al 2012 although vertical preferential flow and lateral flow system may also be involved in storm runoff responses as shown in fig 1 our discussion above may suggest a rationality in these models certainly dependences of storm runoff responses on watershed properties might emerge from more sophisticated models based on the three dimensional form of the richards equation vanderkwaak and loague 2001 sudicky et al 2008 mirus and loague 2013 nonetheless we should note that preferential paths constructed of large pores work in effective lateral drainage routes insofar as they are included in the saturated zone section 4 2 this effect derived from strong spatial heterogeneities suggests a serious limitation to any kinds of models based on the richards equation because the modelling method representing such severe heterogeneities has yet to be developed montgomery and dietrich 2002 uchida et al 2005 ebel et al 2007 chifflard et al 2019 consequently storm runoff models not only focusing only on vertical processes but also describing the three dimensional processes suffer from similar problems related to quantifying the effects of heterogeneous preferential flow networks on storm runoff responses a next stage of the runoff model development must specify each effect of the vertical and lateral processes on the responses our study has demonstrated that storm runoff responses in a cap approximated by sfe can be roughly explained by vuf although the effects of the subsequent lateral flow on the hyetograph hydrograph conversion may not be addressed probably preferential paths provide rapid lateral drainage of groundwater anderson et al 1997 montgomery and dietrich 2002 dusek et al 2012 resulting in a small contribution of the lateral flow to hydrograph change however it is a fundamental question whether such a rapid drainage generally occurs on a steep hillslope we assume that subsurface structures including preferential paths are developed through long time scale processes field investigations for steep hillslopes in tectonically active regions have suggested that the subsurface structures producing runoff processes may have evolved through geomorphological processes supported by vegetation effects shimokawa 1984 heimsath et al 1999 roering et al 2002 istanbulluoglu and bras 2005 matsushi and matsuzaki 2010 sidle and bogaard 2016 however the support of vegetation root system is not sufficient to maintain slope stability for this long period against often occurrences of large magnitude storms because a rise of the groundwater table often triggers a landslide occurrence montgomery et al 2009 milledge et al 2014 boggard and greco 2015 consequently it is needed to restrain the rise of the groundwater table by the effective drainage of groundwater preferential flow paths tani 2013 matsushi et al 2016 watakabe and matshushi 2019 further interdisciplinary studies are needed to understand a connection between a short timescale hydrological process producing storm runoff responses and a long timescale geomorphological process creating the subsurface structures 5 conclusions hydrological studies on flood control suggest that the storm runoff response to rainfall in quasi steady state periods when a large constant portion of rainfall is allocated to storm runoff could be simulated by a simple runoff model based on a power law equation between runoff rate and watershed storage our paper examines why this model produces good results using numerical experiments with the one dimensional vertical form of richards equation the findings are summarized as follows 1 the propagation of the pressure head through vertical unsaturated flow could produce a rapid response in the outflow rate from the bottom boundary of the soil column similar to storm runoff response observed on a hillslope regardless of soil hydraulic properties 2 vertical distribution of pressure head in the soil column during an increasing stage from an initial steady state to another with higher rainfall intensity was characterized by the creation of an inflection point below the wetting front above and below which the pressure head decreased and increased with increasing depth respectively the shape of outflow hydrograph was controlled by the depth where the inflection point departed from its original distribution under the initial steady state 3 although the delay of increasing start time of outflow rate in an increasing stage was small enough to produce rapid storm runoff responses during a quasi steady state period the absorption of rainwater within dry soil did not usually contribute to storm runoff response at the beginning of a rainfall event this could partly explain the so called threshold storm runoff response 4 the outflow rate and the total storage in the entire soil column were interdependent throughout the recession stage the outflow storage relationship was approximated by a simple power law equation and such an approximation was originated from a string of relationships of the total storage to constant outflow rate under steady state conditions 5 the exponent of the power law equation reflected the distributions of hydraulic variables in the soil column and was controlled by a ratio of vertical soil column length to representative pressurehead the exponent ranged from unity linear outflow storage relationship for a small ratio to the smallest value for a large ratio originating from the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content for the given soil 6 the reason why the outflow rate and the entire column storage are interdependent was derived from the characteristic of the unsaturated zone where water is preferentially retained in smaller soil pores with large capillary forces compared to larger ones this interdependence occurs irrespective of whether the distributions of soil hydraulic properties are homogeneous or not resulting in a low sensitivity of outflow response to soil heterogeneities this may provide a rationale for applying simple runoff models to storm runoff responses 7 because every runoff model representing three dimensional processes on a hillslope suffers from problems related to quantifying the effects of heterogeneous preferential flow networks on storm runoff responses a next stage of the runoff model development must specify each effect of the vertical and lateral processes on the responses in consideration of the heterogeneities large dependences of storm runoff responses on vertical unsaturated flow processes estimated from this study may encourage the development of innovative physically based runoff models this may also suggest the need for future interdisciplinary studies consisting of

appendix 1 applicability of storage function model to hillslope scale observational results we examine whether the application of sfe to runoff responses in caps at a watershed scale can be applied at a hillslope scale this assessment is made because scale issues derived from spatial differences from hillslopes to watersheds have been widely discussed in hydrology blöschl and sivapalan 1995 sivapalan 2003 mcguire et al 2005 clark et al 2009 asano et al 2009 sidle et al 2017 hence we reanalyze a hydrometric observation on a steep planar hillslope with a thin soil layer a1 1 site description of study hillslope for this examination storm records in july 1987 on a steep planar hillslope without a riparian corridor in the tatsunokuchi yama experimental watershed okayama japan were assessed fig a1 these observations were conducted by the forestry and forest products research institute and the data analysis and site description were reported by tani 1997 a long term hydrological study in a small watershed minamitani mn 22 6 ha in tatsunokuchi yama has continued since 1937 and runoff responses to storms have been assessed by several studies tani and abe 1987 tani et al 2012 hosoda and tani 2016 our study hillslope sl located inside of the mn watershed is underlain by quartz porphyry although about 96 of the watershed is underlain by paleozoic rock formations the topography of the sl is steep 34 6 and short 42 7 m and the soil layer is thin compared with most slopes in mn runoff discharge from a trench at the toe of the slope was monitored using a 6 m long brick wall tightly fixed to the exposed bedrock along the stream channel the contributing area of sl was estimated at 500 m2 average width was 11 7 m and slope length was 42 7 m this width is larger than the bottom width 6 m suggesting that water flow converges from the wider upslope area despite its planar surface topography soil textures are clay loam and sandy loam produced from the bedrock and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated as 1 7 to 6 3 10 3 cm s 1 observations of the soil profile at the trench showed that the mineral soil contained many macropores which preferentially produced much runoff discharge during storms an old landslide scar existed halfway up the slope with bedrock exposed at the headwall of the landslide soil depth varied along the slope with an average depth of about 50 cm in addition to measuring runoff discharge pressure head was monitored at 10 30 and 50 cm depths at t4 11 0 m upslope from the trench these observed values were used to examine the applicability of the richards equation to the pressure head propagation the observations in sl were conducted between january 1986 and november 1987 a1 2 model applicability the basic characteristics of storm runoff responses for sl were similar to those for the entire mn watershed despite different geology topography and spatial scale tani and abe 1987 tani 1997 fig a2 shows relationships of total storm rainfall and runoff at sl and mn the relationships between the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff for our target storm event in july 1987 the total rainfall 137 mm and total runoff from mn and sl 48 mm and 69 mm respectively are plotted in panels fig a2a and fig a2b in addition the relationship for an event in september 1976 in which the total rainfall and storm runoff were 375 and 248 mm respectively one of the largest storms in the 80 year observation periods of mn is also plotted in fig a2 a in both mn and sl when rainfall was small total storm runoff was very low because most of the rainwater was stored in the soil and this storage effect depends on antecedent moisture conditions as indicated by the initial runoff rates of mn before the event in both mn and sl storm runoff occur until a threshold of rainfall was reached although this value depends on the antecedent moisture conditions the rate of increase in storm runoff was similar to that of rainfall during large storms as shown in the cumulative relationship for the storm of 1976 fig a2a although this tendency occurred in both mn and sl fig a2b the steeper increase in storm runoff for sl compared to mn may be caused by a more rapid extension of the stormflow contributing area likely due to the short and steep topography and thin soil layer in sl compared to the averaged slope properties of mn tani 1997 hence when cumulative rainfall is large enough the concept of saturated rainfall in sfm is applicable not only to the small watershed scale mn but also to the planar hillslope sl during the 1976 storm the threshold for runoff increase in mn occurred around 2 00 on september 10 fig a3 and the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff volumes up to this threshold were 67 and 4 mm respectively the cap was achieved around 14 00 on september11 and the cumulative rainfall and storm runoff volumes up to this time were 186 and 54 mm respectively therefore three stages in the runoff generation mechanism can be distinguished as follows 1 initially rainwater falling onto most of the entire watershed was absorbed in the dry soil in the first dry stage 2 then the area contributing to stormflow generation was extended over the entire catchment and 3 finally the contributing area was fixed to the entire watershed because total storm runoff 186 mm in this period was almost equal to total rainfall 189 mm interestingly a similar and constant value 5 4 mm h 1 for both rainfall intensity and runoff rate occurred from 10 00 to 14 00 on september 12 suggesting a steady state response to constant rainfall intensity was achieved in this period for the entire mn watershed to examine the applicability of sfe to the runoff responses this equation set was applied to the storm event by optimizing the parameter values for the hydrograph in the third stage cap using the method of least squares optimized values of p and k are 0 3 and 40 mm0 7 h0 3 respectively fig a3 the comparison between observed and calculated hydrographs clearly demonstrates a distinction in the characteristics of the three stages as well as good agreement between the result calculated by sfe with the observed hydrograph in the third stage runoff responses in mn and sl during a storm in july 1987 were compared with those calculated by sfe where the parameters for mn were the same as those in the 1976 storm fig a3 cap was not fully achieved for mn because the calculated hydrograph was higher than the observed hydrograph but the second transient stage continued until the end of the event for sl however the hydrograph calculated using the optimized k value 27 mm0 7 h0 3 obtained by the method of least squares for the same p value 0 3 agreed with the observed hydrograph in the final stage of this event after 2 00 on july 19 hence the cap may be roughly achieved although the total runoff 47 mm in this duration was somewhat smaller than the total rainfall 60 mm and a small portion of rainfall was not contributing to storm runoff we can therefore conclude that the applicability of sfe is valid for storm runoff responses at a hillslope scale as well at a small watershed scale although the cumulative rainfall necessary to achieve cap was smaller fig a2 and the hydrograph is steeper fig a4 for sl than mn
