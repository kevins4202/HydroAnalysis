13585,activated sludge adsorbs heavy metals in the water during the water treatment process which brings trouble to the subsequent treatment of the waste sludge however the role of bacterial cell and extracellular polymeric substance eps on adsorption of heavy metal remains elusive here we found the anammox sludge possessed the highest cu ii adsorption capacity 14 68 mg g ss followed by the activated sludge and denitrifying sludge the cu ii adsorption capacities of sludges increased when sludge dosages and initial cu ii concentrations increased these sorption processes were all well explained by langmuir isotherms analysis of the cu ii distribution found that cu ii adsorbed by bacterial cells 35 were much higher than the cu ii adsorbed by eps 4 11 this implied that bacterial cells were the most important carrier for the sludge to adsorb cu ii additionally the difference in cu ii adsorption of sludge was due to the inconsistent cu ii content adsorbed by eps correlation analysis showed that the eps content highly positively correlated with the cu ii content adsorbed by eps which indicates that the eps content was crucial factor causing the difference in cu ii adsorption fitr analysis shows that another key factor for disparate cu ii adsorption was functional groups including amide i and amide ii of protein c h from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid this study provides more information for understanding the role of the bacterial cell and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals which might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of heavy metals containing sludge keywords activated sludge heavy metal adsorption copper extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction with the rapid development of mining metallurgy tanneries batteries and chemical industries large amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals are released into the aquatic environment 1 2 heavy metals are hardly biodegradable and accumulate in living tissues which are serious threats to human health include chronic toxicity symptoms kidney injury renal failure and liver damage 3 also they cause serious deterioration of microbial activity 4 microbiological treatment basing on activated sludge is the most commonly used process in wastewater treatment 5 activated sludge possesses a high retention potential for heavy metals 6 8 before activated sludge treatment process typical methods for removing heavy metal from wastewater including ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration has been used which could remove most of the heavy metal 9 but residual heavy metal at very low level still accumulate in activated sludge a survey on wastewater treatment plants showed that activated sludge absorbed up to 10 mg g dry cell of heavy metals which is a huge source of risk and a huge resource 10 the treatment of activated sludge that adsorbed heavy metal first requires researches on the adsorption characteristics of sludge to heavy metals studies have been focused on the adsorption characteristic of bacteria with high tolerance to heavy metal 11 13 for example bacillus cereus 12 2 isolated from lead zinc mine tailings had excellent pb adsorption capacity with a maximum adsorption capacity of 226 mg g dry cell 14 to obtain higher levels of adsorption capacity of bacteria to heavy metals these studies usually focus on certain types of bacteria or some bacteria obtained by long term domestication at high concentrations of heavy metals this makes a deviation in the understanding of the adsorption characteristic of activated sludge furthermore a few researchers have studied the adsorption characteristics of one specific activated sludge to different heavy metals in wastewater treatment 15 ren et al found that the adsorption capacity of activated sludge from a water treatment plant for cr mn cu zn and ni was 1 2 5 9 1 9 2 9 1 0 mg g dry cell respectively 16 however few studies pay attention to the adsorption characteristic of different types of sludges the two key adsorption carriers for activated sludge to adsorb heavy metals are bacteria cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps 17 eps are complex high molecular weight polymers which are produced from bacterial activities and adsorption of organic matter in wastewater 18 19 there is still controversy about the role of bacteria and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals on one hand some studies believed that the adsorption of heavy metals by bacterial cells was more important and directly ignored the role of eps 20 21 these studies were interested in the comparison of heavy metal adsorption in different bacteria for example pseudomonas tlc 3 3 5 1 and bacillus weihenstephanensis showed adsorption ability of zn was 15 9 and 3 4 mg g dry cell respectively 22 on the other hand some studies believed that eps was more important for the adsorption of heavy metals 23 24 heavy metals must pass through the eps before interacting with bacterial cells a part of heavy metal is adsorbed and intercepted by eps thus the amount of heavy metal adsorbed by bacteria is reduced 25 26 these studies were devoted to comparing the adsorption capacity of eps to different heavy metals or comparing the adsorption capacity of eps from different sludges to the same kind of heavy metals take ni as an example li et al 27 revealed that the eps of anaerobic sludge made a higher contribution in adsorbing ni ii than aerobic sludge therefore the role of eps and bacterial cell on the adsorption of heavy metals in different sludge need further exploration cu ii is widely spread in water environment 27 and the allowable amount of cu is as high as 2 mg l in surface water thus it was chosen in this study to reveal the adsorption characteristics of heavy metals on three different types of sludges activated sludge denitrification sludge and anammox sludge the distribution of cu ii in bacterial cell and eps from the three types of sludges was measured to evaluate the importance of bacterial cell and eps in cu ii adsorption the relationship between the content and functional group of eps and cu ii adsorption was analyzed and discussed the study could provide more information for understanding the role of the bacterial cells and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals which might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of heavy metals containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge were selected in this study according to the oxygen demand during the sludge cultivation sludges generally are divided into aerobic sludge and anaerobic sludge activated sludge and denitrifying sludge were typical aerobic sludge and anaerobic sludge respectively anammox sludge was another special anaerobic sludge it was also selected in this research because anammox sludge was reported to have high eps content 28 choosing a sludge with high eps content helps to study the role of eps in cu ii adsorption activated sludge and denitrifying sludge were taken from the aeration tank and anoxic tank of a reclaimed wastewater treatment plant treatment capacity of 4000 m3 day in changsha china respectively the anammox sludge was obtained from a high rate lab scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor from our laboratory which was stably operated for more than 2 years with a nitrogen removal rate higher than 5 kg m3 d 29 before experiments the sludge samples were gently washed three times by using deionized water in order to remove residues 2 2 biosorption experiments of cu ii the adsorption characteristic of cu ii by the sludge was conducted by batch tests the sludge was mixed with cu ii solution in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at ph 6 0 6 5 the ph value chosen in the present study was to avoid copper precipitation in the solution but also to maintain the microbial activity the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm at room temperature 20 25 c no substrate including ammonium nitrite nitrate or organic matter was supplemented during all the batch tests so there was no data about the removal of contaminant including ammonium nitrite nitrate or organic matter firstly the effect of sludge dosage on the adsorption characteristic was investigated the concentration of cu ii solution was set as 50 mg l the sludge dosage was 1 3 5 10 g ss l respectively to ensure the adequate reaction of the sludge and cu ii the reaction time was long enough to 8 h supernatants were harvested after filtration by 0 2 Î¼m cellulose acetate membrane at the end of this batch test for the measure of cu ii concentration secondly the effect of cu ii concentration on the adsorption characteristic was studied according to the results of previous experiment the sludge dosage was chosen to be 5 g ss l the concentration of cu ii solution was 10 20 50 100 150 200 mg l respectively the reaction time was also set as 8 h supernatants were also harvested at the end of this batch test to measure the concentration of cu ii when cu ii solution was 200 mg l the sludge sample was harvested at the beginning and the end of the batch test to conduct scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectrometers sem eds analysis finally the effect of reaction time on the adsorption characteristic was surveyed basing on the test mentioned above the sludge dosage and cu ii concentration were 5 g ss l and 200 mg l respectively supernatants were harvested at 0 10 20 30 40 60 90 120 180 240 360 480 min respectively the sludge sample was harvested at the beginning of the batch test to measure the contents and functional groups in eps the sludge sample was also taken at the end of the batch test to detect the concentration of cu ii in eps and bacteria from the end of the batch test was measured 2 3 eps extraction and analysis to detect the cu ii concentration in eps and to analyze the eps characteristic of different sludges it is necessary to extract eps from the sludge three portions of the eps were extracted separately by high speed centrifugation heating method 30 31 which is a commonly used method to separate bacterial cell and eps in sludges specifically 2 ml sludge was mixed with 5 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs and centrifuged at 2000g 4 c for 5 min the supernatant was harvested as s eps samples the remained sludge was resuspended to 8 ml with pbs the suspension was sheared by a vortex mixer xh c for 4 min followed by centrifugation at 8000g and 4 c for 20 min this supernatant was harvested as lb eps samples after that the remained sludge was resuspended to 8 ml with pbs again and heated to 70 c for 30 min the mixture was then centrifuged at 12 000g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was collected for tb eps determination all the eps samples were filtrated with 0 22 um membrane filter and measured immediately to avoid the degradation of eps during storage the eps content was calculated by the sum of polysaccharide and protein contents the polysaccharides and proteins in eps was carried out using phenol sulfuric acid method and lowry method respectively 32 the functional groups in eps were also analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet is10 thermo scientific co usa with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and scan a range of 400 4000 cm 1 28 eps was freeze drying by a lyophilizer alpha 1 2 ldplus christ germany before ftir determination the infrared spectrum was analyzed by omnic v8 2 operating software and origin 9 0 2 4 detection and quantification of cu ii cu ii amounts adsorbed by eps were directly measured by inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp instrument agilent 5100 svdv icp oes cu ii amounts adsorbed by bacteria eps deprived sludge were measured according to the procedure described by bi et al 33 briefly 0 1 g eps deprived sludge was mixed with nitric acid solution 33 v v for 25 min with a mixing speed of 1 rpm following by centrifugation at 22 000 g for 15 min thus cu ii in bacteria was dissolved in the supernatant the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Î¼m membranes and was then applied to the icp instrument for the determination of cu ii concentration in bacteria the wavelength used for icp analysis of cu ii was 324 754 nm for cu ii quantification standard curves ranging from 0 5 to 200 mg l were constructed 2 5 other chemical analysis and calculation methods ph and partial size were measured with digital ph meter phs 9 v and laser particle size analyzer ls pop omec china respectively the suspended solids ss and settling velocity sv of sludge were determined according to tang et al 34 sem eds analysis of the sludge samples were observed by a jsm 6360lv scanning electron microscope jeol company japan according to jiang et al 35 the sludge samples were fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight after rinsing with pbs the samples were then sequentially dewatered by 50 75 95 100 ethanol for 15 min at last these samples were dried at room temperature for sem analysis the removal efficiency and adsorption capacities of cu ii by sludge samples were calculated from eqs 1 and 2 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0

of cor test 3 results and discussion 3 1 cu ii biosorption performance by different sludges 3 1 1 effect of sludge dosage in this batch test the concentration of cu ii solution was set as 50 mg l and the reaction time was 8 h as shown in fig 1 in terms of overall changes with the increase of sludge dosage the cu ii removal efficiencies increased and the adsorption capacities of sludges decreased the increases in cu ii removal efficiencies could be ascribed to the larger amount of adsorption sites provided by the increasing sludge dosage meanwhile it was reasonable that the adsorption capacities of the sludges decreased with the increasing sludge dosage from the perspective of different types of sludges when the sludge dosages were at a low level 1 5 g ss l the cu ii removal efficiencies of different sludge were different particularly the adsorption capacities of activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge at the sludge dosage of 1 g ss l were 12 2 11 6 and 16 5 mg g ss respectively the anammox sludge presented excellent adsorption capacity as compared to the other sludges when the sludge dosage increased from 5 g ss l to 10 g ss l the cu ii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities of all sludge samples were almost the same this is because a high sludge dosage provided enough adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption so there was nearly no difference in cu ii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities 37 notably when the dosage is 5 gss l the cu ii removal efficiency curve has an inflection points before this inflection point the cu ii removal efficiency increased with the increase of sludge dosage after this inflection points the increase of the sludge dosage did not obviously increase the cu ii removal efficiency thus a sludge dosage of 5 g ss l was applied in the subsequent experiments 3 1 2 effect of initial cu ii concentration the effects of cu ii concentrations varying from 10 to 200 mg l on the adsorption characteristic of cu ii by the sludge were shown in fig 2 overall as the concentration of cu ii increased the cu ii removal efficiencies decreased while the adsorption capacities of sludges increased this is because a higher concentration is positive to facilitate the mass transfer of cu ii from aqueous to biomass 38 39 from the perspective of different types of sludges when the concentration of cu ii was below 50 mg l the adsorption capacities of different sludges were almost the same this suggested the sludge provided excessive adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption at the low level of cu ii concentration when the concentration of cu ii increased from 50 to 200 mg l the cu ii removal efficiencies of different sludge were different the adsorption capacity was the highest for the anammox sludge 14 4 mg g ss followed by activated sludge 13 2 mg g ss and denitrifying sludge 13 0 mg g ss at the cu ii concentration of 200 mg l similar results were also shown in the sem eds analysis the mass fraction and atomic content of cu ii in all sludge samples dramatically increased at the cu ii concentration of 200 mg l which further confirmed the adsorption of cu ii by the sludge fig s1 specifically that in anammox sludge showed the highest increase from 2 7 and 0 6 to 39 0 and 14 2 for mass fraction and atomic content respectively this was consistent with the results above when the cu ii concentration was excessive or the sludge dosage was too low that is when there is no excessive adsorption site for cu ii adsorption the cu ii adsorption capacities of sludges were different among the sludges anammox sludge provides more adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption which requires further analysis of the reasons for this difference 3 1 3 effect of reaction time according to previous batch tests the cu ii concentration and the sludge dosage were selected to be 200 mg l and 5 gss l respectively the changes in removal efficiencies of cu ii were shown in fig 3 the process of cu ii removal and cu ii adsorption by sludges could be divided into two stages in the first rapid adsorption stage 0 20 min the removal efficiencies of activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge quickly increased to 33 4 32 8 and 33 3 respectively this indicated that the utilization of the abundant binding sites on the surface of sludge samples to adsorb cu ii was extremely rapid in the second stage of adsorption equilibrium the cu ii removal efficiency of different sludge basically no longer increased and cu ii removal efficiency of anammox sludge was 36 05 which was higher than that of activated sludge 33 1 and denitrifying sludge 32 2 this also proved that anammox sludge has a stronger cu ii adsorption capacity than the other two types of sludges 40 additionally pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to conduct the adsorption kinetics of sludges in the sorption process to analyze the adsorption mechanism the results were listed in table 1 and were illustrated in fig 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order equation closed to 1 while that of pseudo first order equation was low the calculated qe values in the case of pseudo second order equation were also agreed with the experimental data these results indicated that the removal of cu ii by the sludges may be controlled by chemisorption 27 3 2 adsorption isotherms of different sludges the cu ii adsorption isotherms of different sludge samples was described by classical langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich temkin and toth models table 2 and was illustrated in fig 4 the parameters of these isotherms were compared in this study generally the adsorption process of cu ii on the surface of three sludge can follow all these isotherm models due to high correlation r2 comparing to the correlation coefficients the langmuir isotherms r2 0 996 0 999 had the best fitting effect than the other isotherms r2 0 865 0 993 langmuir isotherm is widely applied to describe monolayer adsorption assuming uniform adsorbent surfaces and no interactions between absorbing molecules 38 39 this suggested that monolayer and uniform adsorptions of cu ii occurred mostly in these sorption processes rl values calculated by eq 4 were between 0 and 1 confirming the adsorption of cu ii onto the three types of sludges were favorable to examine the potential of different sludge for cu ii removal according to the langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity qmax was compared it was noted that the qmax of anammox sludge 14 68 mg g ss was higher than activated sludge and denitrifying sludge 13 25 and 13 08 mg g ss respectively this was consistent with our experimental data the better adsorption capacity of cu ii might be due to the presence of various functional groups at the surface of anammox sludge which can attach with cu ii via physicochemical interactions the specific mechanism will be clarified below the adsorption capacity of other adsorbents was listed in table 3 literature survey showed that the adsorption capacity of activated sludge was the not the highest it s not surprising because the aim of our study is not to obtain the maximum adsorption capacity on the one hand there are a lot of heavy metal in the sewage treatment system the activated sludge in this system definitely adsorb heavy metals in the aqueous solution a survey on wastewater treatment plants showed that activated sludge absorbed up to 10 mg g dry cell of heavy metals 10 therefore it is necessary to study the adsorption characteristic of different sludges on the other hand comparing with other materials activated sludge is not a very good material for adsorption and removal of cu ii in wastewater because the accumulation of cu ii in the activated sludge lead to the decrease of sludge activity thereby decreasing the effect of biological water treatment additionally comparing with bacillus vallismortis sp which was isolated from activated sludge the adsorption capacity of the bacterial cells and eps were also low 41 this phenomenon is easy to comprehend on the one hand although bacillus vallismortis sp was isolated from activated sludge it might only account very low proportion for example hatamoto et al revealed that the ratio for bacillus spp was 0 0 33 in activated sludge samples 42 there is still a large number of other genus of bacteria in active sludge which may not be able to adsorb a large amount of cu ii on the other hand the same bacteria have different adsorption capacity of heavy metals under different cultivated conditions for example the removal of zn and ni from solutions by the anaerobic digested sludge were different under disparate wastewater 43 the pure cultivation of bacillus vallismortis sp in previous research used lb liquid medium 41 lb liquid medium which is totally different from the medium that was used in our study was used in cultivation of bacillus vallismortis sp thus the adsorption capacity of bacillus vallismortis sp in the sludge was different from that under pure cultivation 3 3 distribution of cu ii in different sludges in order to investigate the reasons for the inconsistency in cu ii adsorption capacities of different sludges the cu ii content adsorbed by eps and bacterial cell eps deprived sludge was determined due to cu ii has stronger cell membrane penetration the result does not necessarily represent the adsorption behavior of all heavy metals in the sludge except for the cu ii in the solution the remaining cu ii was adsorbed by the sludge the sludge was divided into two adsorption carriers eps and bacterial cell as shown in fig 5 from the perspective of different adsorption carriers about 35 of cu ii was adsorbed by the bacterial cell which was much higher than that absorbed by the eps 4 11 it concluded that the bacterial cell was an more important cu ii carrier than eps this discovery is of great importance for biological wastewater treatment systems where heavy metals are always accompanied it is essential to remove heavy metals as efficiently as possible before they enter biological treatment systems otherwise the inhibition would be catastrophic from the perspective of different sludge cu ii adsorbed by anammox sludge was the most abundant there was nearly no difference in cu ii content adsorbed by different bacterial cell the difference in the cu ii content of disparate sludge was mainly caused by the different cu ii content of eps that is the eps also played an important role in the adsorption of cu ii after dividing eps into three parts it was found that tb eps adsorbed the most abundant cu ii followed by lb eps and s eps this is deduced that the outer region of eps lb eps and s eps is a loose dispersible and amorphous layer which adsorb cu ii through weak interactions such as van der waals forces while the inner region of eps tb eps which is closely and stably bonded with the cell surface may interact strongly with cu ii through polymer entanglement 44 45 3 4 correlation of eps contents and cu ii adsorbed amounts since eps played an important role in the adsorption of cu ii the eps contents were calculated by the sum of polysaccharide and protein contents and were shown in fig 6 a the eps content of anammox sludge was more than 3 times that of activated sludge and denitrifying sludge after dividing the eps contents into three parts it showed that the contents of tb eps lb eps and s eps in anammox sludge were greater than that in the other two types of sludges additionally regardless of the sludge type the content of tb eps in the sludge was the highest among the three types of eps it was found that anammox sludge with higher eps content adsorbed more cu ii than the other two types of sludges similarly tb eps with high content adsorbed more cu than lb eps and s eps thus it was speculated that cu ii adsorbed amount was related to eps content regression analysis of eps contents from different parts and their cu ii adsorbed amounts was conducted fig 6b it was found that the cu ii adsorbed amounts showed strong positive correlations with the eps contents r 0 943 p 0 001 this suggested that variations in cu ii amount varied with eps content although eps content was not the only factor that changes cu ii amount it was one of the key influencing factors of cu amounts adsorbed by sludge meanwhile eps content was the crucial factor causing the difference in cu ii adsorption basing on the importance of eps the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cu ii by esp in different sludge were also studied pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to conduct the adsorption kinetics of sludges table s1 it was revealed that adsorption kinetics of sludges were well explained by pseudo second order kinetic r2 0 998 0 999 additionally similar to the adsorption isotherms of cu ii by the sludge the langmuir isotherms r2 0 996 0 999 had a better fitting effect than the freundlich isotherm r2 0 872 0 961 which suggested monolayer and uniform adsorptions of cu ii during the sorption processes table s1 according to the langmuir isotherm qmax of anammox sludge was 3 39 mg g ss and was higher than activated sludge and denitrifying sludge this also indicated the importance of high eps content in cu ii adsorption 3 5 relationship of functional groups in eps and cu ii adsorption functional groups in eps are another important factor that influences cu ii adsorption 44 45 the ftir spectra of all sludge samples were illustrated in fig 7 at first glance the profiles of ftir spectra for the three types of sludge before and after cu ii adsorption were similar suggesting that their chemical groups are similar however some differences in the peaks can be found after careful comparison of the six ftir spectra according to previous studies a description of the absorption bands and corresponding functional groups of the ftir spectrum has been listed in table 4 44 45 firstly the three types of sludge showed the same changes after cu ii adsorption that is the peak at 3000 2900 cm 1 changed implying a possible interaction between cu ii and c h from methyl and methylene moreover for anammox sludge the respective intensity of the peaks at about 1650 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 was found to shift and increase after cu ii adsorption this indicated that amide i and amide ii of proteins played a crucial role during cu ii adsorption additionally for anammox sludge the bands ranging from 1460 to 1210 cm 1 changed irregularly after cu ii bonding this implied that those aliphatic c h stretching vibration and oh and co related carboxylic acid also made a great contribution to cu ii adsorption the above results showed that anammox sludge adsorbed more cu ii than the other two types of sludge combining with the variations in functional groups observed above it was deduced that amide i and amide ii of proteins ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid play a more important role in different cu ii adsorption of the sludges activated sludge is consisted of bacterial cell and eps eps was reported to form heavy metal chelate complex in many studies 46 48 sulfhydryl protein and certain functional groups in eps was the most important factor influencing the chelation 41 49 and our results revealed that the eps content and functional groups including amide i and amide ii of protein ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid were important factor for disparate cu ii adsorption amount by the sludges it could be deduced that certain substance and functional groups in eps could coordinate with cu ii to form chelates thereby removing cu ii in aqueous solution additionally cu ii could penetrate the cell membrane and accumulate in the cell some intracellular enzymes and substance could bind to cu ii and trap cu ii in the bacteria cell 50 therefore the removal of cu ii by activated sludge was realized according to the results mentioned above bacterial cell was the most important carrier of heavy metal that is the treatment of heavy metal sludge must focus on the treatment of bacterial cells for example if the purpose is to recycle heavy metals in the sludge the disruption of the bacterial cell is the most important thing additionally different cu ii adsorption was caused by different content and specific functional groups of eps the treatment of heavy metal sludge needs to pay attention to the type of sludge different types of sludge required disparate treatment methods when disposing of activated sludge for example the disposal of sludge with high eps content or specific functional groups could be conducted after the deprivation of eps from sludge 4 conclusions in the present study cu ii adsorption characteristics of three different sludge activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge were evaluated anammox sludge possessed the highest cu ii adsorption capacity 14 2 mg g ss followed by the activated sludge and denitrifying sludge 12 4 and 11 8 mg g ss respectively in all cases the equilibrium was well described both by the langmuir and the freundlich isotherms suggesting that the adsorption of cu ii followed multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface it was found that cu ii adsorbed by bacterial cells 35 were much higher than the cu ii adsorbed by eps 4 11 which implied that bacterial cells were the most important carrier for the sludge to adsorb cu ii additionally the difference in cu ii adsorption of sludge was due to the inconsistent cu ii content adsorbed by eps this suggested that eps also played a vital role in cu ii adsorption on one hand the eps content was highly positively correlated with the cu ii content adsorbed by eps which indicates that the eps content was one of the key factors causing the difference in cu ii adsorption on the other hand another key factor for disparate cu ii adsorption was functional groups including amide i and amide ii of proteins ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid declaration of competing interest the authors

13585,activated sludge adsorbs heavy metals in the water during the water treatment process which brings trouble to the subsequent treatment of the waste sludge however the role of bacterial cell and extracellular polymeric substance eps on adsorption of heavy metal remains elusive here we found the anammox sludge possessed the highest cu ii adsorption capacity 14 68 mg g ss followed by the activated sludge and denitrifying sludge the cu ii adsorption capacities of sludges increased when sludge dosages and initial cu ii concentrations increased these sorption processes were all well explained by langmuir isotherms analysis of the cu ii distribution found that cu ii adsorbed by bacterial cells 35 were much higher than the cu ii adsorbed by eps 4 11 this implied that bacterial cells were the most important carrier for the sludge to adsorb cu ii additionally the difference in cu ii adsorption of sludge was due to the inconsistent cu ii content adsorbed by eps correlation analysis showed that the eps content highly positively correlated with the cu ii content adsorbed by eps which indicates that the eps content was crucial factor causing the difference in cu ii adsorption fitr analysis shows that another key factor for disparate cu ii adsorption was functional groups including amide i and amide ii of protein c h from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid this study provides more information for understanding the role of the bacterial cell and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals which might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of heavy metals containing sludge keywords activated sludge heavy metal adsorption copper extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction with the rapid development of mining metallurgy tanneries batteries and chemical industries large amounts of wastewater containing heavy metals are released into the aquatic environment 1 2 heavy metals are hardly biodegradable and accumulate in living tissues which are serious threats to human health include chronic toxicity symptoms kidney injury renal failure and liver damage 3 also they cause serious deterioration of microbial activity 4 microbiological treatment basing on activated sludge is the most commonly used process in wastewater treatment 5 activated sludge possesses a high retention potential for heavy metals 6 8 before activated sludge treatment process typical methods for removing heavy metal from wastewater including ion exchange adsorption and membrane filtration has been used which could remove most of the heavy metal 9 but residual heavy metal at very low level still accumulate in activated sludge a survey on wastewater treatment plants showed that activated sludge absorbed up to 10 mg g dry cell of heavy metals which is a huge source of risk and a huge resource 10 the treatment of activated sludge that adsorbed heavy metal first requires researches on the adsorption characteristics of sludge to heavy metals studies have been focused on the adsorption characteristic of bacteria with high tolerance to heavy metal 11 13 for example bacillus cereus 12 2 isolated from lead zinc mine tailings had excellent pb adsorption capacity with a maximum adsorption capacity of 226 mg g dry cell 14 to obtain higher levels of adsorption capacity of bacteria to heavy metals these studies usually focus on certain types of bacteria or some bacteria obtained by long term domestication at high concentrations of heavy metals this makes a deviation in the understanding of the adsorption characteristic of activated sludge furthermore a few researchers have studied the adsorption characteristics of one specific activated sludge to different heavy metals in wastewater treatment 15 ren et al found that the adsorption capacity of activated sludge from a water treatment plant for cr mn cu zn and ni was 1 2 5 9 1 9 2 9 1 0 mg g dry cell respectively 16 however few studies pay attention to the adsorption characteristic of different types of sludges the two key adsorption carriers for activated sludge to adsorb heavy metals are bacteria cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps 17 eps are complex high molecular weight polymers which are produced from bacterial activities and adsorption of organic matter in wastewater 18 19 there is still controversy about the role of bacteria and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals on one hand some studies believed that the adsorption of heavy metals by bacterial cells was more important and directly ignored the role of eps 20 21 these studies were interested in the comparison of heavy metal adsorption in different bacteria for example pseudomonas tlc 3 3 5 1 and bacillus weihenstephanensis showed adsorption ability of zn was 15 9 and 3 4 mg g dry cell respectively 22 on the other hand some studies believed that eps was more important for the adsorption of heavy metals 23 24 heavy metals must pass through the eps before interacting with bacterial cells a part of heavy metal is adsorbed and intercepted by eps thus the amount of heavy metal adsorbed by bacteria is reduced 25 26 these studies were devoted to comparing the adsorption capacity of eps to different heavy metals or comparing the adsorption capacity of eps from different sludges to the same kind of heavy metals take ni as an example li et al 27 revealed that the eps of anaerobic sludge made a higher contribution in adsorbing ni ii than aerobic sludge therefore the role of eps and bacterial cell on the adsorption of heavy metals in different sludge need further exploration cu ii is widely spread in water environment 27 and the allowable amount of cu is as high as 2 mg l in surface water thus it was chosen in this study to reveal the adsorption characteristics of heavy metals on three different types of sludges activated sludge denitrification sludge and anammox sludge the distribution of cu ii in bacterial cell and eps from the three types of sludges was measured to evaluate the importance of bacterial cell and eps in cu ii adsorption the relationship between the content and functional group of eps and cu ii adsorption was analyzed and discussed the study could provide more information for understanding the role of the bacterial cells and eps in the adsorption of heavy metals which might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of heavy metals containing sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge were selected in this study according to the oxygen demand during the sludge cultivation sludges generally are divided into aerobic sludge and anaerobic sludge activated sludge and denitrifying sludge were typical aerobic sludge and anaerobic sludge respectively anammox sludge was another special anaerobic sludge it was also selected in this research because anammox sludge was reported to have high eps content 28 choosing a sludge with high eps content helps to study the role of eps in cu ii adsorption activated sludge and denitrifying sludge were taken from the aeration tank and anoxic tank of a reclaimed wastewater treatment plant treatment capacity of 4000 m3 day in changsha china respectively the anammox sludge was obtained from a high rate lab scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor from our laboratory which was stably operated for more than 2 years with a nitrogen removal rate higher than 5 kg m3 d 29 before experiments the sludge samples were gently washed three times by using deionized water in order to remove residues 2 2 biosorption experiments of cu ii the adsorption characteristic of cu ii by the sludge was conducted by batch tests the sludge was mixed with cu ii solution in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks at ph 6 0 6 5 the ph value chosen in the present study was to avoid copper precipitation in the solution but also to maintain the microbial activity the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm at room temperature 20 25 c no substrate including ammonium nitrite nitrate or organic matter was supplemented during all the batch tests so there was no data about the removal of contaminant including ammonium nitrite nitrate or organic matter firstly the effect of sludge dosage on the adsorption characteristic was investigated the concentration of cu ii solution was set as 50 mg l the sludge dosage was 1 3 5 10 g ss l respectively to ensure the adequate reaction of the sludge and cu ii the reaction time was long enough to 8 h supernatants were harvested after filtration by 0 2 Î¼m cellulose acetate membrane at the end of this batch test for the measure of cu ii concentration secondly the effect of cu ii concentration on the adsorption characteristic was studied according to the results of previous experiment the sludge dosage was chosen to be 5 g ss l the concentration of cu ii solution was 10 20 50 100 150 200 mg l respectively the reaction time was also set as 8 h supernatants were also harvested at the end of this batch test to measure the concentration of cu ii when cu ii solution was 200 mg l the sludge sample was harvested at the beginning and the end of the batch test to conduct scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectrometers sem eds analysis finally the effect of reaction time on the adsorption characteristic was surveyed basing on the test mentioned above the sludge dosage and cu ii concentration were 5 g ss l and 200 mg l respectively supernatants were harvested at 0 10 20 30 40 60 90 120 180 240 360 480 min respectively the sludge sample was harvested at the beginning of the batch test to measure the contents and functional groups in eps the sludge sample was also taken at the end of the batch test to detect the concentration of cu ii in eps and bacteria from the end of the batch test was measured 2 3 eps extraction and analysis to detect the cu ii concentration in eps and to analyze the eps characteristic of different sludges it is necessary to extract eps from the sludge three portions of the eps were extracted separately by high speed centrifugation heating method 30 31 which is a commonly used method to separate bacterial cell and eps in sludges specifically 2 ml sludge was mixed with 5 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs and centrifuged at 2000g 4 c for 5 min the supernatant was harvested as s eps samples the remained sludge was resuspended to 8 ml with pbs the suspension was sheared by a vortex mixer xh c for 4 min followed by centrifugation at 8000g and 4 c for 20 min this supernatant was harvested as lb eps samples after that the remained sludge was resuspended to 8 ml with pbs again and heated to 70 c for 30 min the mixture was then centrifuged at 12 000g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was collected for tb eps determination all the eps samples were filtrated with 0 22 um membrane filter and measured immediately to avoid the degradation of eps during storage the eps content was calculated by the sum of polysaccharide and protein contents the polysaccharides and proteins in eps was carried out using phenol sulfuric acid method and lowry method respectively 32 the functional groups in eps were also analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer nicolet is10 thermo scientific co usa with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and scan a range of 400 4000 cm 1 28 eps was freeze drying by a lyophilizer alpha 1 2 ldplus christ germany before ftir determination the infrared spectrum was analyzed by omnic v8 2 operating software and origin 9 0 2 4 detection and quantification of cu ii cu ii amounts adsorbed by eps were directly measured by inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp instrument agilent 5100 svdv icp oes cu ii amounts adsorbed by bacteria eps deprived sludge were measured according to the procedure described by bi et al 33 briefly 0 1 g eps deprived sludge was mixed with nitric acid solution 33 v v for 25 min with a mixing speed of 1 rpm following by centrifugation at 22 000 g for 15 min thus cu ii in bacteria was dissolved in the supernatant the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 Î¼m membranes and was then applied to the icp instrument for the determination of cu ii concentration in bacteria the wavelength used for icp analysis of cu ii was 324 754 nm for cu ii quantification standard curves ranging from 0 5 to 200 mg l were constructed 2 5 other chemical analysis and calculation methods ph and partial size were measured with digital ph meter phs 9 v and laser particle size analyzer ls pop omec china respectively the suspended solids ss and settling velocity sv of sludge were determined according to tang et al 34 sem eds analysis of the sludge samples were observed by a jsm 6360lv scanning electron microscope jeol company japan according to jiang et al 35 the sludge samples were fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight after rinsing with pbs the samples were then sequentially dewatered by 50 75 95 100 ethanol for 15 min at last these samples were dried at room temperature for sem analysis the removal efficiency and adsorption capacities of cu ii by sludge samples were calculated from eqs 1 and 2 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c e c 0

of cor test 3 results and discussion 3 1 cu ii biosorption performance by different sludges 3 1 1 effect of sludge dosage in this batch test the concentration of cu ii solution was set as 50 mg l and the reaction time was 8 h as shown in fig 1 in terms of overall changes with the increase of sludge dosage the cu ii removal efficiencies increased and the adsorption capacities of sludges decreased the increases in cu ii removal efficiencies could be ascribed to the larger amount of adsorption sites provided by the increasing sludge dosage meanwhile it was reasonable that the adsorption capacities of the sludges decreased with the increasing sludge dosage from the perspective of different types of sludges when the sludge dosages were at a low level 1 5 g ss l the cu ii removal efficiencies of different sludge were different particularly the adsorption capacities of activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge at the sludge dosage of 1 g ss l were 12 2 11 6 and 16 5 mg g ss respectively the anammox sludge presented excellent adsorption capacity as compared to the other sludges when the sludge dosage increased from 5 g ss l to 10 g ss l the cu ii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities of all sludge samples were almost the same this is because a high sludge dosage provided enough adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption so there was nearly no difference in cu ii removal efficiencies and adsorption capacities 37 notably when the dosage is 5 gss l the cu ii removal efficiency curve has an inflection points before this inflection point the cu ii removal efficiency increased with the increase of sludge dosage after this inflection points the increase of the sludge dosage did not obviously increase the cu ii removal efficiency thus a sludge dosage of 5 g ss l was applied in the subsequent experiments 3 1 2 effect of initial cu ii concentration the effects of cu ii concentrations varying from 10 to 200 mg l on the adsorption characteristic of cu ii by the sludge were shown in fig 2 overall as the concentration of cu ii increased the cu ii removal efficiencies decreased while the adsorption capacities of sludges increased this is because a higher concentration is positive to facilitate the mass transfer of cu ii from aqueous to biomass 38 39 from the perspective of different types of sludges when the concentration of cu ii was below 50 mg l the adsorption capacities of different sludges were almost the same this suggested the sludge provided excessive adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption at the low level of cu ii concentration when the concentration of cu ii increased from 50 to 200 mg l the cu ii removal efficiencies of different sludge were different the adsorption capacity was the highest for the anammox sludge 14 4 mg g ss followed by activated sludge 13 2 mg g ss and denitrifying sludge 13 0 mg g ss at the cu ii concentration of 200 mg l similar results were also shown in the sem eds analysis the mass fraction and atomic content of cu ii in all sludge samples dramatically increased at the cu ii concentration of 200 mg l which further confirmed the adsorption of cu ii by the sludge fig s1 specifically that in anammox sludge showed the highest increase from 2 7 and 0 6 to 39 0 and 14 2 for mass fraction and atomic content respectively this was consistent with the results above when the cu ii concentration was excessive or the sludge dosage was too low that is when there is no excessive adsorption site for cu ii adsorption the cu ii adsorption capacities of sludges were different among the sludges anammox sludge provides more adsorption sites for cu ii adsorption which requires further analysis of the reasons for this difference 3 1 3 effect of reaction time according to previous batch tests the cu ii concentration and the sludge dosage were selected to be 200 mg l and 5 gss l respectively the changes in removal efficiencies of cu ii were shown in fig 3 the process of cu ii removal and cu ii adsorption by sludges could be divided into two stages in the first rapid adsorption stage 0 20 min the removal efficiencies of activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge quickly increased to 33 4 32 8 and 33 3 respectively this indicated that the utilization of the abundant binding sites on the surface of sludge samples to adsorb cu ii was extremely rapid in the second stage of adsorption equilibrium the cu ii removal efficiency of different sludge basically no longer increased and cu ii removal efficiency of anammox sludge was 36 05 which was higher than that of activated sludge 33 1 and denitrifying sludge 32 2 this also proved that anammox sludge has a stronger cu ii adsorption capacity than the other two types of sludges 40 additionally pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to conduct the adsorption kinetics of sludges in the sorption process to analyze the adsorption mechanism the results were listed in table 1 and were illustrated in fig 3 the correlation coefficients r2 of the pseudo second order equation closed to 1 while that of pseudo first order equation was low the calculated qe values in the case of pseudo second order equation were also agreed with the experimental data these results indicated that the removal of cu ii by the sludges may be controlled by chemisorption 27 3 2 adsorption isotherms of different sludges the cu ii adsorption isotherms of different sludge samples was described by classical langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich temkin and toth models table 2 and was illustrated in fig 4 the parameters of these isotherms were compared in this study generally the adsorption process of cu ii on the surface of three sludge can follow all these isotherm models due to high correlation r2 comparing to the correlation coefficients the langmuir isotherms r2 0 996 0 999 had the best fitting effect than the other isotherms r2 0 865 0 993 langmuir isotherm is widely applied to describe monolayer adsorption assuming uniform adsorbent surfaces and no interactions between absorbing molecules 38 39 this suggested that monolayer and uniform adsorptions of cu ii occurred mostly in these sorption processes rl values calculated by eq 4 were between 0 and 1 confirming the adsorption of cu ii onto the three types of sludges were favorable to examine the potential of different sludge for cu ii removal according to the langmuir isotherm the maximum adsorption capacity qmax was compared it was noted that the qmax of anammox sludge 14 68 mg g ss was higher than activated sludge and denitrifying sludge 13 25 and 13 08 mg g ss respectively this was consistent with our experimental data the better adsorption capacity of cu ii might be due to the presence of various functional groups at the surface of anammox sludge which can attach with cu ii via physicochemical interactions the specific mechanism will be clarified below the adsorption capacity of other adsorbents was listed in table 3 literature survey showed that the adsorption capacity of activated sludge was the not the highest it s not surprising because the aim of our study is not to obtain the maximum adsorption capacity on the one hand there are a lot of heavy metal in the sewage treatment system the activated sludge in this system definitely adsorb heavy metals in the aqueous solution a survey on wastewater treatment plants showed that activated sludge absorbed up to 10 mg g dry cell of heavy metals 10 therefore it is necessary to study the adsorption characteristic of different sludges on the other hand comparing with other materials activated sludge is not a very good material for adsorption and removal of cu ii in wastewater because the accumulation of cu ii in the activated sludge lead to the decrease of sludge activity thereby decreasing the effect of biological water treatment additionally comparing with bacillus vallismortis sp which was isolated from activated sludge the adsorption capacity of the bacterial cells and eps were also low 41 this phenomenon is easy to comprehend on the one hand although bacillus vallismortis sp was isolated from activated sludge it might only account very low proportion for example hatamoto et al revealed that the ratio for bacillus spp was 0 0 33 in activated sludge samples 42 there is still a large number of other genus of bacteria in active sludge which may not be able to adsorb a large amount of cu ii on the other hand the same bacteria have different adsorption capacity of heavy metals under different cultivated conditions for example the removal of zn and ni from solutions by the anaerobic digested sludge were different under disparate wastewater 43 the pure cultivation of bacillus vallismortis sp in previous research used lb liquid medium 41 lb liquid medium which is totally different from the medium that was used in our study was used in cultivation of bacillus vallismortis sp thus the adsorption capacity of bacillus vallismortis sp in the sludge was different from that under pure cultivation 3 3 distribution of cu ii in different sludges in order to investigate the reasons for the inconsistency in cu ii adsorption capacities of different sludges the cu ii content adsorbed by eps and bacterial cell eps deprived sludge was determined due to cu ii has stronger cell membrane penetration the result does not necessarily represent the adsorption behavior of all heavy metals in the sludge except for the cu ii in the solution the remaining cu ii was adsorbed by the sludge the sludge was divided into two adsorption carriers eps and bacterial cell as shown in fig 5 from the perspective of different adsorption carriers about 35 of cu ii was adsorbed by the bacterial cell which was much higher than that absorbed by the eps 4 11 it concluded that the bacterial cell was an more important cu ii carrier than eps this discovery is of great importance for biological wastewater treatment systems where heavy metals are always accompanied it is essential to remove heavy metals as efficiently as possible before they enter biological treatment systems otherwise the inhibition would be catastrophic from the perspective of different sludge cu ii adsorbed by anammox sludge was the most abundant there was nearly no difference in cu ii content adsorbed by different bacterial cell the difference in the cu ii content of disparate sludge was mainly caused by the different cu ii content of eps that is the eps also played an important role in the adsorption of cu ii after dividing eps into three parts it was found that tb eps adsorbed the most abundant cu ii followed by lb eps and s eps this is deduced that the outer region of eps lb eps and s eps is a loose dispersible and amorphous layer which adsorb cu ii through weak interactions such as van der waals forces while the inner region of eps tb eps which is closely and stably bonded with the cell surface may interact strongly with cu ii through polymer entanglement 44 45 3 4 correlation of eps contents and cu ii adsorbed amounts since eps played an important role in the adsorption of cu ii the eps contents were calculated by the sum of polysaccharide and protein contents and were shown in fig 6 a the eps content of anammox sludge was more than 3 times that of activated sludge and denitrifying sludge after dividing the eps contents into three parts it showed that the contents of tb eps lb eps and s eps in anammox sludge were greater than that in the other two types of sludges additionally regardless of the sludge type the content of tb eps in the sludge was the highest among the three types of eps it was found that anammox sludge with higher eps content adsorbed more cu ii than the other two types of sludges similarly tb eps with high content adsorbed more cu than lb eps and s eps thus it was speculated that cu ii adsorbed amount was related to eps content regression analysis of eps contents from different parts and their cu ii adsorbed amounts was conducted fig 6b it was found that the cu ii adsorbed amounts showed strong positive correlations with the eps contents r 0 943 p 0 001 this suggested that variations in cu ii amount varied with eps content although eps content was not the only factor that changes cu ii amount it was one of the key influencing factors of cu amounts adsorbed by sludge meanwhile eps content was the crucial factor causing the difference in cu ii adsorption basing on the importance of eps the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cu ii by esp in different sludge were also studied pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic were used to conduct the adsorption kinetics of sludges table s1 it was revealed that adsorption kinetics of sludges were well explained by pseudo second order kinetic r2 0 998 0 999 additionally similar to the adsorption isotherms of cu ii by the sludge the langmuir isotherms r2 0 996 0 999 had a better fitting effect than the freundlich isotherm r2 0 872 0 961 which suggested monolayer and uniform adsorptions of cu ii during the sorption processes table s1 according to the langmuir isotherm qmax of anammox sludge was 3 39 mg g ss and was higher than activated sludge and denitrifying sludge this also indicated the importance of high eps content in cu ii adsorption 3 5 relationship of functional groups in eps and cu ii adsorption functional groups in eps are another important factor that influences cu ii adsorption 44 45 the ftir spectra of all sludge samples were illustrated in fig 7 at first glance the profiles of ftir spectra for the three types of sludge before and after cu ii adsorption were similar suggesting that their chemical groups are similar however some differences in the peaks can be found after careful comparison of the six ftir spectra according to previous studies a description of the absorption bands and corresponding functional groups of the ftir spectrum has been listed in table 4 44 45 firstly the three types of sludge showed the same changes after cu ii adsorption that is the peak at 3000 2900 cm 1 changed implying a possible interaction between cu ii and c h from methyl and methylene moreover for anammox sludge the respective intensity of the peaks at about 1650 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 was found to shift and increase after cu ii adsorption this indicated that amide i and amide ii of proteins played a crucial role during cu ii adsorption additionally for anammox sludge the bands ranging from 1460 to 1210 cm 1 changed irregularly after cu ii bonding this implied that those aliphatic c h stretching vibration and oh and co related carboxylic acid also made a great contribution to cu ii adsorption the above results showed that anammox sludge adsorbed more cu ii than the other two types of sludge combining with the variations in functional groups observed above it was deduced that amide i and amide ii of proteins ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid play a more important role in different cu ii adsorption of the sludges activated sludge is consisted of bacterial cell and eps eps was reported to form heavy metal chelate complex in many studies 46 48 sulfhydryl protein and certain functional groups in eps was the most important factor influencing the chelation 41 49 and our results revealed that the eps content and functional groups including amide i and amide ii of protein ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid were important factor for disparate cu ii adsorption amount by the sludges it could be deduced that certain substance and functional groups in eps could coordinate with cu ii to form chelates thereby removing cu ii in aqueous solution additionally cu ii could penetrate the cell membrane and accumulate in the cell some intracellular enzymes and substance could bind to cu ii and trap cu ii in the bacteria cell 50 therefore the removal of cu ii by activated sludge was realized according to the results mentioned above bacterial cell was the most important carrier of heavy metal that is the treatment of heavy metal sludge must focus on the treatment of bacterial cells for example if the purpose is to recycle heavy metals in the sludge the disruption of the bacterial cell is the most important thing additionally different cu ii adsorption was caused by different content and specific functional groups of eps the treatment of heavy metal sludge needs to pay attention to the type of sludge different types of sludge required disparate treatment methods when disposing of activated sludge for example the disposal of sludge with high eps content or specific functional groups could be conducted after the deprivation of eps from sludge 4 conclusions in the present study cu ii adsorption characteristics of three different sludge activated sludge denitrifying sludge and anammox sludge were evaluated anammox sludge possessed the highest cu ii adsorption capacity 14 2 mg g ss followed by the activated sludge and denitrifying sludge 12 4 and 11 8 mg g ss respectively in all cases the equilibrium was well described both by the langmuir and the freundlich isotherms suggesting that the adsorption of cu ii followed multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface it was found that cu ii adsorbed by bacterial cells 35 were much higher than the cu ii adsorbed by eps 4 11 which implied that bacterial cells were the most important carrier for the sludge to adsorb cu ii additionally the difference in cu ii adsorption of sludge was due to the inconsistent cu ii content adsorbed by eps this suggested that eps also played a vital role in cu ii adsorption on one hand the eps content was highly positively correlated with the cu ii content adsorbed by eps which indicates that the eps content was one of the key factors causing the difference in cu ii adsorption on the other hand another key factor for disparate cu ii adsorption was functional groups including amide i and amide ii of proteins ch from aliphatic as well as oh and co from carboxylic acid declaration of competing interest the authors

13586,rapid urbanisation and industrialization have made significant increase in demand for water dyes are majorly organic compounds used by various industries as an identifier colorant or for aesthetic purposes effluents discharged by such industries containing dyes may change the physical chemical and biological properties of water in long run which causes adverse impacts on the ecosystem while in humans and other aquatic animals the dyes have toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects the treatment of dyes can be done by various methods like membrane filtration ion exchange photochemical oxidation nanotechnological approaches and various other physicochemical methods plants and microorganisms like algae fungi and bacteria also play a vital role in remediation of dyes through enzymatic processes phytoremediation of dyes takes place under the influence of reductase enzyme which reduces the dye into simpler organic compounds algae are source of carbon sink in oceans and also help in remediation of pollutants present in water algal cells are useful feedstock for various sectors of our economy such as biofuels microalgal biochar nutraceuticals microbial fuel cell for bioelectricity phyconanoparticles for environmental and medical applications this review article aims to discuss dyes sustainability issues and ecotoxicity related to them it will give an insight on various methods of dye removal emphasising phytoremediation and factors responsible in its removal the opportunities associated with the recovery of valuable products from algae would suggest it a sustainable approach in treatment of dyes present in effluents keywords phycoremediation dyes ecotoxicity bioenergy value added products 1 introduction nowadays population growth and its ever increasing demands exacerbates the generation of wastewater while around 80 of total wastewater is discharged into various world waterways which cause potential hazards to living organisms and environment around 3 of total water resources are fresh water which is earth s dwindling resource industrialization has increased at rapid pace since 19th century which causes rise in effluents effluents discharged from different industries consist of dyes organic and inorganic pollutants dyes and its derivatives are used for different purposes such as aesthetic artistic decorative or as an identifier it has been immensely used by various industries such as printing textile paper pharmaceutical food and cosmetics etc 1 annually around 0 4 0 5 million tonnes of industrial effluents containing dyes are discharged which are detrimental to ecosystem 2 3 the use of synthetic dyes causes health hazard to humans like carcinogenicity mutagenicity teratogenicity and non biodegradability ecotoxicity to our ecosystem 4 they contain natural toxins such as benzene pyrene p nitrophenol which can be cancerous to cells there are certain dyes which obstructs light penetration and results in oxygen deficiency caused due to less photosynthesis in such light conditions 5 7 the dyes along with organic pollutants take more time in remediation and hence persist for long time into the environment 8 it is the complex chemical structure and stability of organic pollutants which makes them less prone to remediation 9 there have been several physicochemical methods such as membrane treatment adsorption nanostructures oxidation reduction etc and biological methods reported for dye degradation 10 12 the physical chemical processes for dye removal require less time but are not economical and eco friendly as they produce sludge using different chemical compounds the biological method of dye removal includes plants and microorganisms in which natural enzymatic process results bioremediation of dyes 13 microbes like bacteria algae and fungi through enzymatic activities results in bioremediation of dyes the enzymatic activity remediates dyes by converting the complex structure of dyes into simpler carbon compounds 14 16 however the process of dye remediation depends upon several factors like temperature agitation availability of nutrients ph salt and concentration of dye 17 the higher concentrations of dye are degraded slowly while in more acidic and basic conditions rate of remediation varies 18 19 phycoremediation involves demineralisation of dye with the help of algae which are found to be active both in tropical and temperate regions 20 in wastewater algae use chemical compounds like nitrogen and carbon as a source of nutrient and thus makes waterbodies less harmful for ecosystem in algae both living and dead biomass can be used for remediation of dyes biosorption and biodegradation are some processes that occurs in algal cells while remediating chemical compounds 21 22 dyes and other heavy metallic ions get adsorbed on the surface of algal cells due to the presence of functional groups such as amino phosphate carboxyl etc while bioremediation also involves enzymatic activities various species of microalgae algae has been reported to contributes towards remediation of dyes such as scenedesmus quadricauda remediates rrbr indigo dye was completely degraded by phormidium autumnale utex1580 23 chlorella vulgaris degraded congo red 24 and acid blue 92 dyes has showed 80 degradation by macrophytes lemna minor 25 nanotechnology can be used for pre treatment in order to reduce stress of high concentration of pollutants on algal growth incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps with microalgae has reported increase in the biomass and lipid content 26 while the stress of metallic ions enables algae to undergoes processes like exclusion compartmentalization complex formation and formation of binding proteins like phytochelatins as defence mechanism the unique characteristics of particles at nano scale such as physical thermal optical chemical biological and large surface to volume ratio in comparison to bulk makes them suitable for different environmental applications 27 29 the use of algal extract for the synthesis of nanoparticles is called phyconanotechnology 30 microalgal species has been used for the synthesis of nanoparticles such as silver 31 32 gold 33 iron 34 and palladium nanoparticles 35 it has introduced a newer approach for the remediation of effluents containing dyes 36 chlorella vulgaris used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles agnps has reported photocatalytic decolorization activity up to 96 51 for methylene blue dye 100 ppm within 3 hrs incubation time 37 methyl orange was decolorized using agnps synthesised from microchaete nccu 342 38 the role of algae for the removal of pollutants like heavy metals has been studied widely but dye removal need to be explored more using algae 22 phycoremediation not only reduce toxicity but will also contribute to produce various value added products using algae 39 40 the algal biomass has been used for production of bioplastics biofuels like biodiesel bioethanol biohydrogen etc 41 nutraceuticals bioelectricity using microbial fuel cells feed for cattle manures for agricultural fields and further use of phyconanoparticles for medicinal or biomedical applications 42 44 thus the role of algae microalgae for the removal of dyes and then to produce various valuable products presents an economical and environment friendly approach towards remediation of effluents containing dyes this paper will present a wholistic perspective on dyes such as their types ecotoxicity and health hazards caused due to them the methods of removal and some advancements like bioelectrical system photosynthetic microbial fuel cells and use of artificial neural networking in phycoremediation are also highlighted here it also emphasizes on phycoremediation as well as use of phyconanoparticles for the remediation or treatment of effluents containing dyes and prospects for different valuable products which can be recovered from them the remediation of effluents containing dyes using algae thus makes them a good candidate for carbon sink that can indirectly help in sustainable survival of living organisms 2 dyes and its types dyes are chemical compounds which gives color to a substrate due to the presence of chromophores while these chromophores azo xanthene carbonyl anthraquinone indigoid and nitro etc with the help of auxochromes sulphonate nitro groups amine carboxyl binds to the substrate surface and gives color to the surface 45 47 solubility of dyes in water makes them easy to apply and availability at low cost makes frequent use of them in different industries dyes are generally classified on the basis of their chemical structure and applications the dyes classified based on their applications are basic reactive mordant reactive sulphur disperse and direct etc azo dyes constitute largest class of dyes and used for more than 60 of total demands in various industries such as pharmaceuticals cosmetics food leather and textile 48 49 16 direct dyes are soluble in water and can be easily applied to cellulose fibers and some of its examples are phthalocyanine azo oxazine and stilbene while basic dyes are used for acrylic fibers majorly and its various types includes azo xanthene hemicyanine and cyanine diazahemicyanine acridine oxazine azinediphenylmethane triarylmethane are some of its examples these are mostly used with mordants and soluble in water 50 several varieties of acid dyes are xanthene nitro anthraquinone triphenylmethane and azo premetallized and nitroso these are organic sulphonic acids and used for fiber namely silk wool polyamide polypropylene and improved acrylic 51 52 they can also be used in combination to other different fibers like polyester cotton rayon in reactive dyes reaction takes place between reactive site of dye and functional group present on fiber anthraquinone oxazine azo basic formazan and phthalocyanine are some of its examples 53 55 the anthraquinone have efficient dying quality and available at low costs disperse dyes are not soluble in water and contains groups like azo anthraquinone and nitro these dyes have substantivity towards different fibers such as nylon acrylic cellulose acetate and cellulose fibers this class includes dyes like benzodifuranone azo styryl nitro and anthraquinone and generally used for hydrophobic fibers while the use of vat dyes is frequently associated with natural cellulosic fibers and have good rapidness properties these are used more often in different industries as it can be applied on both natural and synthetic fibers these dyes are not soluble in water and can be made by using sodium hydrogen sulphite indigoids vat blue 4 and anthraquinone are few types of it 56 58 structurally sulphur dyes have aromatic substrates vatted with sodium sulphide and deoxidized to insoluble products containing sulphur present on fiber such dyes are not soluble in water and used for celluloid fibers the dyes are designed as substrate specific and depending upon the affinity between the substrate and dye the improper binding of the substrate and dye causes ineffectiveness in dying and printing process 59 60 57 a desired chemical structure depends upon colorant required for a particular target substrate and its applications so dyes to be designed should have less affinity to water liquid medium permanent under different conditions like expose to sunlight water different ionic concentrations and effective affinity with substrate 61 here different types of dyes are summarized based on the considerations applied during their development for polymeric substrates fig 1 62 2 63 2 1 dyes for proteins and polyamides anionic dyes containing negative charge are used in this case which binds with fibres like proteins silk leather wool and polyamides nylon bearing positive charge the anionic dyes used here are also named as acid dyes the anionic dyes have very less affinity for substrates cellulosic polyester which cannot form ionic bond with them these dyes form ionic bonds with the substrate when applied from a medium containing acid dyes used for polyamides and proteins includes ci acid blue 3 ci acid orange 7 ci acid blue 23 ci acid red 85 etc the acid dyes used with protein and polyamide has small sized dye molecules due to the small size they have weak ionic attraction with fibres and hence cause poor wash fastness 64 65 2 2 dyes for polyesters the dyes used in this case are called disperse dyes these dyes are hydrophobic in nature and are based on the principle of like dissolve like such dyes are not suitable for hydrophilic polymers such as cellulose and hence unable to dye cotton paper and cellophane disperse dyes are named so as these are not often soluble in water and get dispersed during dying procedures the microbial action of remediation on such dyes makes them less toxic to nature which will be discussed later the disperse dyes are tolerant to high temperature 100 good resilience for fastness to perspiration and washing this offers wide use of these dyes such as benzodifuranone azo styryl nitro and anthraquinone 66 2 3 dyes for cationic polymers their name is derived based on the cationic group present in them they form ionic bond with the substrate where polymers such as polyacrylonitrile due to the presence of negative group get interacted and form ionic bond the cationic dyes are also known as basic dyes and these dyes have ability to dye protein fibres mauveine the first synthetic dye used for dying process of silk fibres is one of its type polymers such as polyester polyamide and cellulose are not suitable for cationic dye as they cannot form ionic bond with the dye chitosan and its derivatives obtained from chitin are used specifically for the remediation of cationic dyes the presence of nh2 and oh functional groups in it makes them good adsorbent for such dyes 67 68 2 4 dyes for cellulosic polymers azo dye direct dye vat dye reactive dye and sulphur dye are the dyes used in this class of polymers substrates of cellulose such as paper cellophane rayon cotton linen are hydrophilic in nature which requires water soluble dyes this necessitates that such dyes should have stable affinity with substrate and should maintain stability when exposed to water or water soluble chemicals water insoluble dyes were developed to improve wet fastness while using cellulosic fibres thus sulphur and vat dyes not soluble either in synthetic or natural form were developed to resist change in colour when substrate is exposed to water azoic colourants are naphthol dyes which do not exist initially but get produced in the polymer matrix natural indigo dye is a vat dye the small size of indigo dye cause its easy escape during laundry procedures it s an important dye for denim fabrics which often gets faded appearance after single wash 69 3 ecotoxicity of dyes dyes being made up of aromatic and other non aromatic chemical compounds are often discarded into the environment without proper treatment oxidation dyes used for hair colouring and other dyes used by different industries are toxic in nature the effluent discharged by various industries contains not only dyes but also certain chemicals like acids soaps nitrates and metallic compounds such as heavy metals the combination of all such chemicals along with dye derivatives increase the severity of adverse effects organically bound chlorine which is found in approximately 40 colourants are carcinogenic improper treatment of effluents containing dyes and their non scientific discharge leads to drastic changes in the aquatic ecosystem the changes could be physical chemical and biological which comprises variety of factors like change in surface temperature and colour change in ph reduced photosynthetic activity variations in bod biological oxygen demand level under different natural and anthropogenic conditions the dyes get degraded into chemicals like aromatic compounds naphthalene benzamine which are more toxic and mutagenic 51 49 during interaction with water bodies such compounds may restrict light penetration and reduces dissolved oxygen into them these all processes ultimately impacts the growth of plants and other phytoplankton zooplankton etc living in water or in its vicinity which disrupts the whole food chain of our biome 54 70 in plants it has been reported to cause oxidative stress due to the presence of chromium used in textile dye industries this recalcitrant behaviour of dyes has significant impact on photosynthesis and growth of plants ultimately it affects co2 sink occurs in marine and terrestrial ecosystem 48 71 in case of conventional treatment plants or under aerobic conditions dyes tend to become recalcitrant which causes their bioaccumulation in soil and other resources in proximity to it 72 metallic dyes which are mostly used in textile industries have high tolerance with harsh environmental conditions and has certain composition of heavy metals like cobalt copper chromium and nickel the release of such metallic ions into water bodies is reported to cause recalcitrance of dyes into environment and accumulation of metallic ions into fish gills 73 this allows dyes and its derivatives to enter into food chain and affect human health adversely in humans it was reported that upon contact with dyes it may cause skin irritation dermatitis to disorder in central nervous system 74 6 and bladder cancer particularly due to benzidine and 2 naphthylamine oral ingestion and inhalation have instances of acute toxicity as well irritation to eyes and skin 75 improper handling of reactive dyes and other dye derivatives in industries may results in various diseases such as occupational asthma rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis or other allergic reactions and contact dermatitis 76 70 mutagenicity teratogenicity and genotoxicity related to different dyes will have long lasting impact on human race as well as animal world 77 19 the harmful impacts of synthetic dyes have pushed regulatory bodies to keep a check over proper handling and release of effluents into the environment this requires not only regulatory measures but different factors are need to be considered which are discussed ahead 4 factors affecting bioremediation of dyes the prevalent use of synthetic dyes as a result of their stability towards heat light ionizing agents and exposure to biological has replaced natural dyes at large natural dyes are more prone to environmental conditions and provide less variety of colours at low cost 78 79 despite of health hazards and high toxicity towards flora and fauna synthetic dyes are used globally improper treatment and mishandling during processing and dying procedures makes them more prone to cause ecotoxicity dyes are one of the major pollutants of waterbodies containing other ionic groups as well as heavy metals there are different factors responsible for remediation of dyes carbon and nitrogen sources were reported to play a crucial role in bioremediation of dyes in case of azo dyes deficiency of such sources will hamper removal of dyes and difficult if not supplemented 80 82 some more factors responsible for dye degradation are summarized below in fig 2 4 1 concentration and molecular structure of dye dyes are used in industries at different concentrations while high concentration of dye will be susceptible to block active sites of enzymes photocatalytic activity gets hampered whenever the dyes are present in high concentration in the effluents investigations showed dye degrading bacteria are unable to perceive low concentration of dyes 53 55 the structure and molecular weight of dyes also affect degrading efficiency of industrial effluents 4 2 heavy metals and salts heavy metals are found in the effluents released by dye industries and other sectors use dye in different processes as they are used for some complex metallic dyes the presence of heavy metals above permissible limits is toxic in nature dyes in conjugation with heavy metals become recalcitrant which cannot be removed by simpler remediation techniques in some evaluations these are observed to inhibit bacterial growth and enzymatic activities in microorganisms 83 84 the removal capacity of heavy metals varies with strain types of different microorganisms salts are one of the essential requirements used by industries in conjunction of dyes to maintain stability of colours salts such as nacl na2so4 are important to enhance ionic strength on fabrics therefore salts has to be considered an important factor for remediation as it helps to maintain ph essential for the growth of microorganisms in their culture medium 85 82 4 3 temperature and ph dye degradation is efficient at optimum temperature of 30 40 c required for the growth of mesophilic microbes while thermophilic microorganisms have been investigated to show remediation ability at high temperature 61 dyes and salts are responsible to evaluate the ph of industrial effluents microbial growth also depends upon ph conditions which can be acidic alkaline or neutral it was investigated that at different ph the dye removal efficiency is different decolorization observed using a certain microorganism at ph 3 was 30 56 28 23 at ph 2 and at ph 9 it was 8 3 thus optimum degradation efficiency can be achieved by selecting microorganism suitable to grow by mimicking the ph of dye industry effluent 86 81 21 therefore to achieve maximum dye removal efficiency alterations such as cooling and ph balance best suitable to microorganism can be done at pre treatment procedures 4 4 oxygen and electron balance electron acceptors are essential for microbial metabolism imbalance of electrons thus has indirect impact on remediation of dyes the presence of oxygen has an impact on photocatalysis through separation of electron hole pair such electrons upon interaction with dissolved oxygen produce oxidative sp which are responsible for dye degradation oxygen is an important component of catalysis as aerobic anaerobic and semi aerobic conditions predefine the environmental condition for the growth of microbes carboxylation reductase enzymes is required by anaerobic microbes while oxygenase enzyme in aerobes aerobic microorganisms results in degradation of dyes gradual mixing or shaking offers an even distribution of oxygen in an aerobic activity 87 89 5 methods of removal improper treatment and poor handling in dying procedures causes raise in discharge of effluents with abundance of dyes the adversity of dyes towards nature require to adopt various treatment processes 90 91 there are two methods of treatment namely physicochemical and biological methods of dye removal 25 the physicochemical method of treatment includes different techniques and methods such as membrane filtration electro chemical methods nanotechnological techniques adsorption distillation precipitation and sedimentation 92 93 the biological methods of removal comprise action of plants and microorganisms for decolorization of dyes 94 while methods like photodegradation filtration advanced oxidation process ozonation have been widely used for treatment of dye effluent discharged by industries like textile food and processing pharmaceutical cosmetics here different methods are diagrammatically represented fig 3 and discussed in proceeding section 5 1 physicochemical methods the application of filtration method for dye removal has been reported widely since it is easy to operate ultrafiltration and modified clay matrix membranes are different improved variations of this method various factors like ph ionic concentration temperature and heavy metals etc plays a crucial role in selecting different methods for dye degradation such methods require high pressure and sludge disposal of which may also become a hurdle 95 in case of persistent dyes ozonation method is generally used the decolorization and mineralization efficiency of this method depends upon presence of electrolytes concentration of dyes dosage of ozone and repeated agitation the by products such as nitrate formate acetate and sulphate are generated as a result of ozonation methods while use of certain oxidants can improve the efficiency of this method 96 in photodegradation source of light has a vital role in decolorization of dyes sonophotocatalytic degradation involves use of ultrasound waves which produces cavitation or results in scission of hydrogen peroxide thus more peroxide radicals are available to perform oxidation of dye substrates this method generates highly oxidized products which cannot be degraded biologically 50 photo fenton process has been reported as an effective method for removal of dyes as well as heavy metals and high decolorization efficiency at high volume of effluents 97 the physicochemical methods include multiple designs and different principles of operation it also require a large quantity of chemicals skilled manpower for everyday maintenance and process regulations 98 100 5 2 biological methods the biological approach for dye removal comprises application of plants and microorganisms such bacteria algae and fungi it is eco friendly more effective and generates less sludge in comparison to other methods of dye degradation 5 2 1 bioremediation by plants plants plays a vital role in remediation of dyes and several other types of pollutants 101 they have the ability to extract transform degrade and ultimately detoxify dyes and its derivatives 102 the enzymatic action of plants and allied microorganisms remove the contaminants or dyes from water bodies groundwater air soil and sediments 103 104 plants employ processes of phytoextraction phytoaccumulation phytodegradation rhizofiltration and rhizodegradation which all gives a significant remediation capability to plants the studies on cell suspension callus and hairy root have been done in order to understand the metabolism and tolerance of plants for toxicity of dyes in this hairy root serves as phytochemical factories and source for production of secondary metabolites the plants thus act as biotransformants for the remediation of toxic substances and production of compounds of industrial interests 105 it was reported that hairy root culture of t patula has bioremediation capacity for golden yellow her reactive red m5b methyl orange while stimulated enzymatic production of mn peroxidases azoredutases and tyrosinases helped in bioremediation of red 198 textile dye hydroponics system absence of soil also developed to extract and degrade dyes nasturtium officinale brassicaceae produced under this system was reported to degrade basic red 46 106 the experimentation of above systems at large scale affects the efficiency due to variable environmental conditions 25 15 107 while large phytoreactors were developed in combination of rhizospheric microorganisms here diverse culture of plants and microbes improve the bioremediation efficiency 108 109 the bioremediation of dyes done by plants is economically viable require nutrients and landscape while remediation capacity also depends upon soil properties 5 2 2 bioremediation by microorganisms in general microorganisms perform an important role in degradation of organic inorganic chemical compounds enzymes present in different microbes reduce remove and remediate complex compounds into simpler and less harmful small molecules in some instances where microbes extracted from effluent sites degradation capacity of natural species get enhanced and more effective results will be obtained 77 this was performed in bacterium escherichia coli improved by loading azoredutase enzyme gene extracted from pseudomonas luteola wild variety showed better results in biodegrading azo dyes textile industry 110 bacteria perform the function of bioremediation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 111 reductive cleavage in case of azo dyes is performed through azoreductase enzyme and some other enzymes like tyrosinase peroxidase mg reductase laccase also does so under bacterial remediation 112 113 bacterial bioremediation is based on principle of biosorption adsorption interaction by electric charges on cell surface bioaugmentation or enzymatic degradation 114 pseudomonas aeruginosa can aerobically degrade navitan fast blue s5r azo dye with the help of supplement glucose 115 in some cases it was reported the use of other microbes or hybrid culture in the presence of supplement can improve degradation efficiency aeromonas hydrophila in the presence of yeast extract and sucrose can degrade crystal violet dye under action of laccase enzymes and lignin peroxidase 116 it was reported that yeast can also perform bioremediation such as scheffersomyces spartinae yeast under aerobic conditions at high salinity can degrade acid scarlet 3r dye 117 bacteria acinetobacter sp sw30 as a biogenerator of silver and gold nanoparticles can results in degradation of direct black 22 and reactive yellow 186 dyes 70 however co culture of bacteria can be used for better results like consortia of pseudomonas aeruginosa providencia vermicola and ochrobactrum sp can treat textile effluents of different composition and yields better results than a bacterium sp under inhospitable conditions organisms like extremophiles develop themselves according to the stressful environmental conditions the textile industries consist of stressed condition under extreme temperature ph salinity and toxicity sometimes in such situations and harsh chemical processes the extremophiles halotolerant halophiles thermophiles etc and their extremozymes becomes an attractive candidate of bioremediation 118 70 in nacl medium shewanella aquimarina can decolorize acid red 27 dye 119 120 and thus the presence of various salts is unable to hamper microbial remediation of dyes fungi can produce several extracellular and intracellular enzymes like manganese peroxidase lignin peroxidase and laccase unlike bacteria 58 the process of bioremediation here uses principles of enzymatic degradation biosorption adsorption or combination of both while biomass produced as a result of mycoremediation can treat or biodegrade pollutant at different sites in soil and water fungal bioremediation is an economical and environmental friendly method the positive charge on cell wall originates from the amino acids present in chitosan while negative charges are developed due to the presence of carboxyl and phosphate groups derived from glucuronic acid 121 122 the ionic charges on fungal cell wall allows binding of dyes in order to achieve biosorption living or dead biomass is able to perform remediation of dyes in fungi autoclaving at 121 c provides dead biomass of aspergillus niger at ph between 3 7 it can act as bioabsorber for the direct blue 199 dye 123 the process of autoclaving maximizes biosorption by exposing binding sites of fungal structure and this also increase the interaction of fungal cell with dyes 58 5 bioremediation in fungi is facilitated by enzymes such as mn peroxidase laccases azoreductase and lignin peroxidase 112 the role of peroxidases and laccases in bioremediation of dyes was reported in white rot fungi 77 124 different types of reactors can be used with the white rot fungi for the degradation of reactive blue 4 and reactive red 2 dyes 125 126 but such systems may face problems of clogging in continuous reactor excessive fungal growth and bacterial contamination which can hamper fungal activity endophytic fungi found in the tissues of plants provide protection against q9 pathogens and herbivores can be another tool for mycoremediation 127 fungal remediation is a natural process that can be mimicked to improve the efficiency of dye degradation while certain restrictive factors such as oxygen levels temperature ionic concentration and nutrient need to studied so as to attain enhanced performance while using them 6 phycoremediation of dyes in phycoremediation algae use dyes as a source of nutrient for growth after converting them into simpler carbon compounds algae are ubiquitous in nature reported to remediate and decolorize dyes from effluents they use different mechanism for the remediation of dyes such as adsorption biosorption bioconversion and biodegradation in the process of biosorption algal cells decolorize dyes through its cell wall properties of electrostatic attraction and complexation while in the presence of reductase enzymes algal cells transform complex dye molecules into small molecules 70 enzymes plays a vital role in the reductive cleavage of dyes to make them less harmful to the ecosystem mineralization involves reduction of complex structure of chemicals such as dyes into simpler aromatic compounds the process of degradation by reductase enzyme takes place through direct or indirect method interaction of enzyme with dye occurs by the transfer of electrons under direct process while in indirect process coenzymes adenine dinucleotide fad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad flavin are responsible for electron transfer from an enzyme to dye compound 128 129 the enzymatic action on azo dyes in phycoremediation is shown in fig 4 in case of azo dyes azo reductase enzyme act on dyes in two steps in first step anaerobic reduction of dye bond occurs where double between nitrogen molecule or azo bond reduced to form single bond nitrogen compounds in the second step produced intermediates or aromatic amines convert into minerals under aerobic process 130 chromophores get adsorb on the surface of algal biomass using different mechanism 130 21 the algal biosorption performed by living or dead algal cells plays an important role in the discoloration of textile dyes biosorption process removes dye from water as a liquid phase to solid phase and named them as bioadsorbents 132 124 algae has different types of functional groups on its surface which makes them a good adsorbent for various dyes and other pollutants 130 129 the algal cell wall has relatively high surface area and high binding affinity due to the presence of various functional groups 128 127 the functional groups or ligands present on the cell wall like carboxylate phosphate carbonyl sulfohydryl amino and hydroxyl interact with ions and immobilize them 131 134 in algal remediation of dyes different ions of dyes adhere to the functional groups and some reduced to small organic molecules under action of reductase enzymes 126 125 which makes phycoremediation a viable option for treatment of wastewater containing dyes chlorella vulgaris was reported to decolorize g red fn 3 g basic fuschin basic cationic reactive orange ii methyl red remazol black b remazol red rr remazol golden yellow rnl and congo red 135 136 24 ty2 g tectilon yellow 2 g dye removal involves bioconversion or degradation despite of adsorption on the algal cells of chlorella vulgaris in case of unacclimated algae ty2 g was reported to be converted into aniline proceeded by conversion into simpler organic compounds 137 the functional groups present on ulva lactuca sargassum crassifolium and gracilaria corticate showed high affinity and electrostatic force of attraction towards mg dye in s crassifolium porosity of cell wall allows more permeability to ions and thus provide highest affinity among three algae to make it more potent for removal of mg dye 131 navy blue he22 nbhe22 dye contains phenolic oh groups where phenols acidic resonate with its phenoxide ion structure in normal conditions while alkaline conditions shift the resonation more toward the phenoxide ion this causes the presence of phenoxide ion structure in the dye with negative charge however in algae anionic nature of the functional groups present in the cell wall provides net negative charge to them due to this it seems that divalent metal ions of culture medium are acting like linker between phenoxide oxygen and the cell membrane for removal of dyes 1 stoechospermum marginatum has efficiency to remove acid blue 25 acid orange 7 and acid black 1 from textile wastewater 94 lemna minor macrophytes were investigated to degrade dyes and its derivatives at high concentrations triphenylmethane dye was remediated up to 300 mg l of concentrations and up to 80 of acid blue 92 dye was remediated within six days 138 139 reactive blue 221 and remazol black 5 dyes were reported to be decolorized by chlamydomona reinhardtii 140 20 desmodesmus sp can decolorize up to 98 methylene blue 141 and biosorption decolorization activity of various algal species are listed below in table 1 in case of phycoremediation both dry and wet biomass has potential to remediate dyes while dry biomass was evaluated more advantageous living algal cells can perform self replenishment and has continuous metallic ion uptake ability due to this fact live algal cells are preferred over dead cells algal biomass while dead cells do not require essential nutrients for growth metabolism dependent biosorption is a characteristic of living cells which depends upon mechanism of chelation biosorption or physical adsorption results in decolorization of dyes the physical adsorption is a surface phenomenon occurs through the process of chemisorption result of covalent bonding or physisorption result of weak van der waals forces metabolism independent biosorption occurs mostly in dead cells of algae here adsorption is the main process which includes physiochemical adsorption or ionic interactions algal cells can be used as co culture or hybrid culture for remediation of effluents of dye industries in some observations algae in combination of yeast were used to degrade dyes 46 157 158 thus microbial consortia can also provide favourable results for decolorization of dyes nanotechnology has a wide role not only in physical processes of dye removal but also in bioremediation in conjugation of bacteria and algae polysulphone nanofibrous web based on chlamydomona reinhardtii microalgae can remove dyes such as reactive blue 221 and remazol black 5 57 140 the role of microorganisms in dye removal and pollutants remediation is undeniably extensive the algae can be considered an economical option in comparison to activated carbon in removal of dyes 159 algae are also investigated to play an important role in carbon dioxide sequestration inside marine ecology 160 161 22 it is now essential to explore the significant role played by microalgae algae in the bioremediation 6 1 microalgae algae consortia for dye removal microalgae collected from different effluent containing dyes sites has been reported to perform at higher efficiency such isolated microbes can be cloned and transferred to genes in order to encode degradative enzymes 77 the macroalgae extracted from marine environment namely ulva lactuca sargassum crassifolium and gracilaria corticate were studied for their potential use in decolorization of malachite green in this sargassum crassifolium provided maximum removal efficiency between 95 6 and 98 3 while minimum was observed from 69 77 1 131 147 however in some instances algal consortia have been investigated containing three microalgae chlorella cosmarium and euglena species were studied to bioremediate triphenylmethane dye malachite green mg with the application of artificial neural network ann 87 162 the use of living cells for the recovery of heavy metal ions is one of the major hurdles as the high concentration of ions can endocytose into algal cells cyanobacteria has the potential to degrade dyes in conjugation with algae like indigo dye was degraded completely by phormidium autumnale utex1580 23 insightful research is required in algal technology to perform efficient remediation of dye containing effluents by different species consortia incorporation of other processes for the pre treatment and application of ann in input output modelling is also required in order to explore and establish new potential remediation methods based on algal species 6 2 phyconanotechnological remediation of dyes phyconanotechnology is the confluence of nanotechnology with algae where algae are used for the synthesis of nanoparticles 34 36 163 nanoparticles nps are widely known for their properties in different fields of science and technology the synthesis of nps using physicochemical methods is often costly and its discharge into environment causes toxicity to ecosystem the use of living organisms like plants and microbes for production of nps is environmentally sustainable and economically viable 31 27 algae are largest photoautotrophic microorganism and have immense role in applications such as adsorption accumulation and bioremediation of organic and inorganic chemical compounds heavy metals pharmaceuticals waste radioactive materials and complex dyes 164 165 biosynthesis of nps using algae can be performed in different ways like use of living algal cells exploiting supernatants free of cells from culture media of microalgae and using biomolecules extracted from disrupted cells 166 168 the approach for the synthesis of nps using algae is generally required two methodologies it was investigated that it takes place either intracellular inside the algal cells or extracellular within the cell free environment interacting with extracted biomolecules several reports suggest that algae contain biologically active compounds such as pigments antioxidants as well as secondary metabolites and this makes alage a good source for biosynthesis of nps 169 au nps synthesised using algal cells reported efficient capacity for remediation of dyes such as rhodamine b and sulforhodamine 101 methyl orange was degraded photocatalytically by ulva lactuca fabricated ag nps 170 154 and more such studies are illustrated in the table 2 ag nps can be used for effluent remediation containing dyes as improved photocatalytic activity was reported while using them against dyes microchaete nccu 342 used to synthesise ag nps performed significantly better than cyanobacterial extract when used for remediation of methyl orange 38 169 36 the application of algae for the decolorization remediation of dyes present in effluents will not make it sustainable until we use the biomass to produce valuable products 175 while the algal biomass is reported to be used for extraction of biofuels cattle feedstock biofertilizer bioelectricity nanoparticles for medicinal or biomedical use nutraceuticals such as carbohydrates proteins chlorophyll carotenoids and mab microalgae biochar 176 43 hence the utilization of algae to obtain various useful products after remediation of effluents containing dyes will make them a sustainable option 7 value added products algal cells are potential candidate for bioremediation as they have faster growth rate and photosynthetic ability high lipid productivity and natural source for carbon sink 22 the valuable products reported to be produced by algae microalgae like biofuels nutraceuticals bioplastics feedstock for cattle biofertilizer and bioelectricity etc are discussed here 41 42 the microalgae used for remediation of dyes and effluents has been reported to have application for the production of biofuels 177 178 it was investigated that biofuels obtained from microalgae are ester compounds while petroleum based fuels are hydrocarbons microbial biomass to biofuels takes several conversion routes including biochemical conversion and thermo chemical conversion 179 180 the lipids obtained from algal biomass varies with species such as scenedesmus sp istga1 was reported to produce 452 mg l lipid chlorella vulgaris was evaluated to generate 84 01 biofuel when acid base transesterification was assisted with microwave method for cell disruption 181 183 here as explained in the fig 5 discharged effluents containing dyes after passed through phycoremediation can be used to obtain various value added products 184 microalgae can be used as natural fertilizer as they can improve the carbon fixing capacity of soil improve soil productivity and promote plant growth 134 chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus sp spirogyra sp and chlorophyceae sp etc used for bioremediation have economical values so as to produce biofuels biochar proteins pigments vitamins and pufa polyunsaturated fatty acids 40 185 fig 5 7 1 bioelectricity microbes were investigated to have the ability to produce electrical energy using organic components as a source of chemical energy in effluents bacteria present at anode and algae at cathode through photosynthesis or respiration produce electrons 39 atp adenosine triphosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate are produced as a result of electron transfer through electron transport chain it was evaluated use of microbial fuel cell mfc operated from real dye wastewater has 83 decolorization 790 5 mv voltage output generation and 940 61 5 mw m2 power density hydrothermal gasification constructed wetland microbial fuel cell etc are other technologies can be employed for treatment of effluents containing dyes 186 88 187 7 2 nutraceuticals these are essential elements to supplement the growth and overall development of an individual the microalgae are ubiquitous in nature and are rich with biologically active metabolites widely used in pharmaceutics they comprise of compounds such as chlorophyll proteins carotenoids vitamins and carbohydrates hence algae microalgae have nutritional importance and are potential candidates for various nutraceutical industries 188 190 7 2 1 proteins single cell proteins scp are used for protein supplementation extracted from cultured algal biomass 191 in microorganisms fungi bacteria and algae are the main sources of it in algae spirulina is widely used as protein source even in space explorations it was reported that chlorella sp and spirulina sp of algae estimated to constitute protein content of 70 approx with respect to the toal cell biomass 192 originally algae have vital vitamins such as a and d abundant protein 40 60 which makes them a good source of nutrients 193 these are reported to be excellent source of essential amino acids eaa in microalgae amino acids such as lysine tryptophan histidine methionine threonine isoleucine and valine are present in more comparable quantity than other protein containing sources like soyabeans eggs it has been investigated that protein yield extracted from microalgae as 4 15 tons ha year while for crops such as pulses wheat and soyabean are 1 2 tons ha year 1 1 tons ha year and 0 6 1 2 tons ha year respectively the who fao has recommended microalgal species such as chlorella sp and spirulina sp consists balanced composition of eaa necessary for humans 194 176 7 2 2 pigments chlorophylls are fat soluble pigments in algae 0 5 1 0 of chlorophyll per dry weight is present microalgae have major proportion of chlorophyll a and some amount of chlorophyll b as well as c and chlorophyllin a derivative of chlorophyll is used as anticarcinogenic antimutagenic and dietary supplement carotenoids are also fat soluble pigments and carotenoid content in microalgae varies from 0 2 to 14 on basis of dry weight beta carotene lycopene xanthophylls are some of the types of carotenoids the carotenoids extracted from c ellipsoidea and c vulgaris has been investigated for antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer hct116 cell line lycopene chlorella sp has reported anti proliferative and anti cancer activity to counter prostate cancer cells pc 3 and du 145 lycopene from chlorella sp also performed better than lycopene extracted from tomatoes t 195 as a natural source of pigment and precursor of vitamin a beta carotene they are good source to supplement nutrient in body and have cosmeceutical properties the Î² carotene are highly antioxidant and found effective against skin problems haematococcus pluvialis has reported presence of astaxanthin and can accumulate up to 5 of dry weight they can also be considered as excellent source of carotenoids 195 40 196 197 7 2 3 carbohydrates algal cells originated in marine environment are the rich source of carbohydrates polysaccharides polysaccharides are simple sugar or monosaccharides comprising glycosidic bonds which are used in various applications such as stabilizers emulsifiers thickeners and in various food and beverages industries 198 in different algae these polysaccharides differ in storages components like in green algae sulphated polysaccharides are sulphated xylans and galactan in brown algae it comprises of porphyrin inside intracellular spaces sulphated fucose as fucoidan alginic acids sargassan and in red algae they have floridian starch xylans sulphated galactan agars and carrageenans agar alginate brown sea weeds and carrageenan red sea weeds are important polysaccharides extracted from algal cells thought its applications are also in other pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries 199 200 the carbohydrates in form of cellulose and starch extracted from algae can be used as source for production of bioplastics and bioethanol 201 7 2 4 fatty acids in fatty acids omega 3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha to be used as dietary supplements provides essential benefits 42 in microalgae they are also studied as stress responsive biomarkers in autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions omega 3 is produced using atmospheric co2 as carbon source for photosynthesis microalgae harvested in heterotrophic conditions were studied as good source particularly for dha the dha are long chain of fatty acids pufa useful for the health of human eyes heart and brain epa are precursor for compounds such as thromboxane 3 leukotriene 5 and prostaglandin 3 dha and epa play an important role to prevent coronary heart diseases it helps in reduction of blood cholesterol levels and for the development of cns infants 202 microalgae as a potent source of pufa poly unsaturated fatty acids has been used as supplements for human consumption the major pufa evaluated in species like phaeophyta and rhodophyta are eicosapentaenoic linoleic and arachidonic acids red algal species are reported to be important producer of epa and a source of pufa fatty acids are not only used as nutritional products for human diet but also for food processing and beverage industries 192 7 2 5 vitamins algae are known as good source of nutrients and synthesize compounds like vitamins and minerals in autotrophic conditions vitamins such as vit c vit e and b complexes b1 b2 b3 b6 b9 b12 are studied in microalgae it has been reported that microalgae contain higher amount of vital nutrients than soyabeans and cereals 202 spirulina was investigated to have about 10 times more Î² carotene than other sources of it like carrot the use of algae as a source for vit b12 has revealed higher quantities in comparison to plants and animal food sources isochrysis galbana serve as good source of vitamins such as vit a vit e vit b complex while chlorella stigmatophora dunaliella tertiolecta and tetraselmis suecica also evaluated with same vitamins 203 euglena gracilis reported to contain Î² carotene vit c vit e various studies has reported that almost all microalgal species contains tocopherol ascorbic acid and vitamin a 198 chlorella species were assessed to have vit b12 thus microalgae have potential to become a significant source of anti oxidants 7 3 phyconanoparticles these are biological compounds of algae proved to have wide applications in medical arena and wastewater treatment in case of biomedical purposes they have the ability to replace conventional drug delivery system and other therapies 32 204 the phyconanoparticles are processed biologically with high adsorption capacity in different sizes and shapes such as triangular spherical truncated oval and cubic it was reported that such nanoparticles are made up of metal metal oxides and have anti inflammatory properties antibacterial antifungal antitumor and antioxidant 36 activities as shown in below table 3 7 4 microalgal biochar mab biochar produced from microalgae is useful to improve organic carbon content of soil 215 studies have reported that a rise of about 1 2 in soil organic content oc can reduce atmospheric co2 by 5 mg m3 216 217 mab biochar produced from microalgae is a promising agent for capturing utilization and sequestration of co2 wastewater treatment bioenergy production or biorefinery 218 there are various thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization which can be used to produce it mab containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen can act as potent catalyst for different energy generating applications including transesterification fuel production and fermentation 219 220 it was reported that lipid extracted microalgae biomass can be used to produce biochar the biochar thus obtained was investigated to produce carbon dots cds through thermal conversion while these were produced earlier directly from algal biomass thus it also present certain solutions to utilize biomass produced during algal biofuel production algae based products for mab to cds production and their cds use as sensors for assessing heavy metals in water bodies 221 222 the use of algal biomass is not limited to the above applications it can also be used to produce biofertilizers tar and bioplastics etc in this 21st century we are facing the menace of water scarcity energy crisis and global warming we can find sustainable solutions with microalgae through wastewater treatment and use of it ecological production of biofuels and using it as a source of carbon sink 8 conclusion and opportunities effluents containing dyes are discharged by various industries where metallic ions zn cu hg etc acids bases natural extracts of fibres and various salts are also present the toxicity of such effluents requires imposition of laws regulations this requires necessary measures for treatment at source before discharging into the environment particularly water bodies however the use of physicochemical methods in removal of dyes are generally not economical the use of different chemicals imposes environmental cost by generating sludge in large amount by them biological methods being eco friendly are not new as plants and microbes have been lungs of nature to remediate pollutants present in the environment in last few years the process of isolation of microbes from local effluent sites and use of biotechnological tools to get improved species of them presents a new path towards remediation phycoremediation has huge potential to save our environment and resources from dye derivatives and other pollutants the ligands on algal cells for binding of ionic groups of dyes and large surface area for adsorption made them a potential candidate also for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles the vagaries of nature and other factors permits to use combination of different techniques methods as some of the best approaches for treatment the use of biological treatment in association of conventional or physical chemical techniques will provide effective treatment results like pretreatment with nanofibers before phycoremediation can improve removal efficiency symbiosis of different microorganisms bacteria and algae for bioremediation and bioelectricity generation would improve the removal efficiency and explore a new area of energy in remediation algae as a biological agent in conjugation of immobilization matrix for pre treatment and then for remediation is one such approach which provides avenues for more research the presence of lipids carotenoids proteins and pigments in algal cells and their use to produce biofuels biofertilizers etc would tempt to find more applications of algae and execution at large scale this study contributes towards wider research on algal technology for enviornmenetal remediation and algae for medicinal and energy solutions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

13586,rapid urbanisation and industrialization have made significant increase in demand for water dyes are majorly organic compounds used by various industries as an identifier colorant or for aesthetic purposes effluents discharged by such industries containing dyes may change the physical chemical and biological properties of water in long run which causes adverse impacts on the ecosystem while in humans and other aquatic animals the dyes have toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic effects the treatment of dyes can be done by various methods like membrane filtration ion exchange photochemical oxidation nanotechnological approaches and various other physicochemical methods plants and microorganisms like algae fungi and bacteria also play a vital role in remediation of dyes through enzymatic processes phytoremediation of dyes takes place under the influence of reductase enzyme which reduces the dye into simpler organic compounds algae are source of carbon sink in oceans and also help in remediation of pollutants present in water algal cells are useful feedstock for various sectors of our economy such as biofuels microalgal biochar nutraceuticals microbial fuel cell for bioelectricity phyconanoparticles for environmental and medical applications this review article aims to discuss dyes sustainability issues and ecotoxicity related to them it will give an insight on various methods of dye removal emphasising phytoremediation and factors responsible in its removal the opportunities associated with the recovery of valuable products from algae would suggest it a sustainable approach in treatment of dyes present in effluents keywords phycoremediation dyes ecotoxicity bioenergy value added products 1 introduction nowadays population growth and its ever increasing demands exacerbates the generation of wastewater while around 80 of total wastewater is discharged into various world waterways which cause potential hazards to living organisms and environment around 3 of total water resources are fresh water which is earth s dwindling resource industrialization has increased at rapid pace since 19th century which causes rise in effluents effluents discharged from different industries consist of dyes organic and inorganic pollutants dyes and its derivatives are used for different purposes such as aesthetic artistic decorative or as an identifier it has been immensely used by various industries such as printing textile paper pharmaceutical food and cosmetics etc 1 annually around 0 4 0 5 million tonnes of industrial effluents containing dyes are discharged which are detrimental to ecosystem 2 3 the use of synthetic dyes causes health hazard to humans like carcinogenicity mutagenicity teratogenicity and non biodegradability ecotoxicity to our ecosystem 4 they contain natural toxins such as benzene pyrene p nitrophenol which can be cancerous to cells there are certain dyes which obstructs light penetration and results in oxygen deficiency caused due to less photosynthesis in such light conditions 5 7 the dyes along with organic pollutants take more time in remediation and hence persist for long time into the environment 8 it is the complex chemical structure and stability of organic pollutants which makes them less prone to remediation 9 there have been several physicochemical methods such as membrane treatment adsorption nanostructures oxidation reduction etc and biological methods reported for dye degradation 10 12 the physical chemical processes for dye removal require less time but are not economical and eco friendly as they produce sludge using different chemical compounds the biological method of dye removal includes plants and microorganisms in which natural enzymatic process results bioremediation of dyes 13 microbes like bacteria algae and fungi through enzymatic activities results in bioremediation of dyes the enzymatic activity remediates dyes by converting the complex structure of dyes into simpler carbon compounds 14 16 however the process of dye remediation depends upon several factors like temperature agitation availability of nutrients ph salt and concentration of dye 17 the higher concentrations of dye are degraded slowly while in more acidic and basic conditions rate of remediation varies 18 19 phycoremediation involves demineralisation of dye with the help of algae which are found to be active both in tropical and temperate regions 20 in wastewater algae use chemical compounds like nitrogen and carbon as a source of nutrient and thus makes waterbodies less harmful for ecosystem in algae both living and dead biomass can be used for remediation of dyes biosorption and biodegradation are some processes that occurs in algal cells while remediating chemical compounds 21 22 dyes and other heavy metallic ions get adsorbed on the surface of algal cells due to the presence of functional groups such as amino phosphate carboxyl etc while bioremediation also involves enzymatic activities various species of microalgae algae has been reported to contributes towards remediation of dyes such as scenedesmus quadricauda remediates rrbr indigo dye was completely degraded by phormidium autumnale utex1580 23 chlorella vulgaris degraded congo red 24 and acid blue 92 dyes has showed 80 degradation by macrophytes lemna minor 25 nanotechnology can be used for pre treatment in order to reduce stress of high concentration of pollutants on algal growth incorporation of zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps with microalgae has reported increase in the biomass and lipid content 26 while the stress of metallic ions enables algae to undergoes processes like exclusion compartmentalization complex formation and formation of binding proteins like phytochelatins as defence mechanism the unique characteristics of particles at nano scale such as physical thermal optical chemical biological and large surface to volume ratio in comparison to bulk makes them suitable for different environmental applications 27 29 the use of algal extract for the synthesis of nanoparticles is called phyconanotechnology 30 microalgal species has been used for the synthesis of nanoparticles such as silver 31 32 gold 33 iron 34 and palladium nanoparticles 35 it has introduced a newer approach for the remediation of effluents containing dyes 36 chlorella vulgaris used for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles agnps has reported photocatalytic decolorization activity up to 96 51 for methylene blue dye 100 ppm within 3 hrs incubation time 37 methyl orange was decolorized using agnps synthesised from microchaete nccu 342 38 the role of algae for the removal of pollutants like heavy metals has been studied widely but dye removal need to be explored more using algae 22 phycoremediation not only reduce toxicity but will also contribute to produce various value added products using algae 39 40 the algal biomass has been used for production of bioplastics biofuels like biodiesel bioethanol biohydrogen etc 41 nutraceuticals bioelectricity using microbial fuel cells feed for cattle manures for agricultural fields and further use of phyconanoparticles for medicinal or biomedical applications 42 44 thus the role of algae microalgae for the removal of dyes and then to produce various valuable products presents an economical and environment friendly approach towards remediation of effluents containing dyes this paper will present a wholistic perspective on dyes such as their types ecotoxicity and health hazards caused due to them the methods of removal and some advancements like bioelectrical system photosynthetic microbial fuel cells and use of artificial neural networking in phycoremediation are also highlighted here it also emphasizes on phycoremediation as well as use of phyconanoparticles for the remediation or treatment of effluents containing dyes and prospects for different valuable products which can be recovered from them the remediation of effluents containing dyes using algae thus makes them a good candidate for carbon sink that can indirectly help in sustainable survival of living organisms 2 dyes and its types dyes are chemical compounds which gives color to a substrate due to the presence of chromophores while these chromophores azo xanthene carbonyl anthraquinone indigoid and nitro etc with the help of auxochromes sulphonate nitro groups amine carboxyl binds to the substrate surface and gives color to the surface 45 47 solubility of dyes in water makes them easy to apply and availability at low cost makes frequent use of them in different industries dyes are generally classified on the basis of their chemical structure and applications the dyes classified based on their applications are basic reactive mordant reactive sulphur disperse and direct etc azo dyes constitute largest class of dyes and used for more than 60 of total demands in various industries such as pharmaceuticals cosmetics food leather and textile 48 49 16 direct dyes are soluble in water and can be easily applied to cellulose fibers and some of its examples are phthalocyanine azo oxazine and stilbene while basic dyes are used for acrylic fibers majorly and its various types includes azo xanthene hemicyanine and cyanine diazahemicyanine acridine oxazine azinediphenylmethane triarylmethane are some of its examples these are mostly used with mordants and soluble in water 50 several varieties of acid dyes are xanthene nitro anthraquinone triphenylmethane and azo premetallized and nitroso these are organic sulphonic acids and used for fiber namely silk wool polyamide polypropylene and improved acrylic 51 52 they can also be used in combination to other different fibers like polyester cotton rayon in reactive dyes reaction takes place between reactive site of dye and functional group present on fiber anthraquinone oxazine azo basic formazan and phthalocyanine are some of its examples 53 55 the anthraquinone have efficient dying quality and available at low costs disperse dyes are not soluble in water and contains groups like azo anthraquinone and nitro these dyes have substantivity towards different fibers such as nylon acrylic cellulose acetate and cellulose fibers this class includes dyes like benzodifuranone azo styryl nitro and anthraquinone and generally used for hydrophobic fibers while the use of vat dyes is frequently associated with natural cellulosic fibers and have good rapidness properties these are used more often in different industries as it can be applied on both natural and synthetic fibers these dyes are not soluble in water and can be made by using sodium hydrogen sulphite indigoids vat blue 4 and anthraquinone are few types of it 56 58 structurally sulphur dyes have aromatic substrates vatted with sodium sulphide and deoxidized to insoluble products containing sulphur present on fiber such dyes are not soluble in water and used for celluloid fibers the dyes are designed as substrate specific and depending upon the affinity between the substrate and dye the improper binding of the substrate and dye causes ineffectiveness in dying and printing process 59 60 57 a desired chemical structure depends upon colorant required for a particular target substrate and its applications so dyes to be designed should have less affinity to water liquid medium permanent under different conditions like expose to sunlight water different ionic concentrations and effective affinity with substrate 61 here different types of dyes are summarized based on the considerations applied during their development for polymeric substrates fig 1 62 2 63 2 1 dyes for proteins and polyamides anionic dyes containing negative charge are used in this case which binds with fibres like proteins silk leather wool and polyamides nylon bearing positive charge the anionic dyes used here are also named as acid dyes the anionic dyes have very less affinity for substrates cellulosic polyester which cannot form ionic bond with them these dyes form ionic bonds with the substrate when applied from a medium containing acid dyes used for polyamides and proteins includes ci acid blue 3 ci acid orange 7 ci acid blue 23 ci acid red 85 etc the acid dyes used with protein and polyamide has small sized dye molecules due to the small size they have weak ionic attraction with fibres and hence cause poor wash fastness 64 65 2 2 dyes for polyesters the dyes used in this case are called disperse dyes these dyes are hydrophobic in nature and are based on the principle of like dissolve like such dyes are not suitable for hydrophilic polymers such as cellulose and hence unable to dye cotton paper and cellophane disperse dyes are named so as these are not often soluble in water and get dispersed during dying procedures the microbial action of remediation on such dyes makes them less toxic to nature which will be discussed later the disperse dyes are tolerant to high temperature 100 good resilience for fastness to perspiration and washing this offers wide use of these dyes such as benzodifuranone azo styryl nitro and anthraquinone 66 2 3 dyes for cationic polymers their name is derived based on the cationic group present in them they form ionic bond with the substrate where polymers such as polyacrylonitrile due to the presence of negative group get interacted and form ionic bond the cationic dyes are also known as basic dyes and these dyes have ability to dye protein fibres mauveine the first synthetic dye used for dying process of silk fibres is one of its type polymers such as polyester polyamide and cellulose are not suitable for cationic dye as they cannot form ionic bond with the dye chitosan and its derivatives obtained from chitin are used specifically for the remediation of cationic dyes the presence of nh2 and oh functional groups in it makes them good adsorbent for such dyes 67 68 2 4 dyes for cellulosic polymers azo dye direct dye vat dye reactive dye and sulphur dye are the dyes used in this class of polymers substrates of cellulose such as paper cellophane rayon cotton linen are hydrophilic in nature which requires water soluble dyes this necessitates that such dyes should have stable affinity with substrate and should maintain stability when exposed to water or water soluble chemicals water insoluble dyes were developed to improve wet fastness while using cellulosic fibres thus sulphur and vat dyes not soluble either in synthetic or natural form were developed to resist change in colour when substrate is exposed to water azoic colourants are naphthol dyes which do not exist initially but get produced in the polymer matrix natural indigo dye is a vat dye the small size of indigo dye cause its easy escape during laundry procedures it s an important dye for denim fabrics which often gets faded appearance after single wash 69 3 ecotoxicity of dyes dyes being made up of aromatic and other non aromatic chemical compounds are often discarded into the environment without proper treatment oxidation dyes used for hair colouring and other dyes used by different industries are toxic in nature the effluent discharged by various industries contains not only dyes but also certain chemicals like acids soaps nitrates and metallic compounds such as heavy metals the combination of all such chemicals along with dye derivatives increase the severity of adverse effects organically bound chlorine which is found in approximately 40 colourants are carcinogenic improper treatment of effluents containing dyes and their non scientific discharge leads to drastic changes in the aquatic ecosystem the changes could be physical chemical and biological which comprises variety of factors like change in surface temperature and colour change in ph reduced photosynthetic activity variations in bod biological oxygen demand level under different natural and anthropogenic conditions the dyes get degraded into chemicals like aromatic compounds naphthalene benzamine which are more toxic and mutagenic 51 49 during interaction with water bodies such compounds may restrict light penetration and reduces dissolved oxygen into them these all processes ultimately impacts the growth of plants and other phytoplankton zooplankton etc living in water or in its vicinity which disrupts the whole food chain of our biome 54 70 in plants it has been reported to cause oxidative stress due to the presence of chromium used in textile dye industries this recalcitrant behaviour of dyes has significant impact on photosynthesis and growth of plants ultimately it affects co2 sink occurs in marine and terrestrial ecosystem 48 71 in case of conventional treatment plants or under aerobic conditions dyes tend to become recalcitrant which causes their bioaccumulation in soil and other resources in proximity to it 72 metallic dyes which are mostly used in textile industries have high tolerance with harsh environmental conditions and has certain composition of heavy metals like cobalt copper chromium and nickel the release of such metallic ions into water bodies is reported to cause recalcitrance of dyes into environment and accumulation of metallic ions into fish gills 73 this allows dyes and its derivatives to enter into food chain and affect human health adversely in humans it was reported that upon contact with dyes it may cause skin irritation dermatitis to disorder in central nervous system 74 6 and bladder cancer particularly due to benzidine and 2 naphthylamine oral ingestion and inhalation have instances of acute toxicity as well irritation to eyes and skin 75 improper handling of reactive dyes and other dye derivatives in industries may results in various diseases such as occupational asthma rhinitis allergic conjunctivitis or other allergic reactions and contact dermatitis 76 70 mutagenicity teratogenicity and genotoxicity related to different dyes will have long lasting impact on human race as well as animal world 77 19 the harmful impacts of synthetic dyes have pushed regulatory bodies to keep a check over proper handling and release of effluents into the environment this requires not only regulatory measures but different factors are need to be considered which are discussed ahead 4 factors affecting bioremediation of dyes the prevalent use of synthetic dyes as a result of their stability towards heat light ionizing agents and exposure to biological has replaced natural dyes at large natural dyes are more prone to environmental conditions and provide less variety of colours at low cost 78 79 despite of health hazards and high toxicity towards flora and fauna synthetic dyes are used globally improper treatment and mishandling during processing and dying procedures makes them more prone to cause ecotoxicity dyes are one of the major pollutants of waterbodies containing other ionic groups as well as heavy metals there are different factors responsible for remediation of dyes carbon and nitrogen sources were reported to play a crucial role in bioremediation of dyes in case of azo dyes deficiency of such sources will hamper removal of dyes and difficult if not supplemented 80 82 some more factors responsible for dye degradation are summarized below in fig 2 4 1 concentration and molecular structure of dye dyes are used in industries at different concentrations while high concentration of dye will be susceptible to block active sites of enzymes photocatalytic activity gets hampered whenever the dyes are present in high concentration in the effluents investigations showed dye degrading bacteria are unable to perceive low concentration of dyes 53 55 the structure and molecular weight of dyes also affect degrading efficiency of industrial effluents 4 2 heavy metals and salts heavy metals are found in the effluents released by dye industries and other sectors use dye in different processes as they are used for some complex metallic dyes the presence of heavy metals above permissible limits is toxic in nature dyes in conjugation with heavy metals become recalcitrant which cannot be removed by simpler remediation techniques in some evaluations these are observed to inhibit bacterial growth and enzymatic activities in microorganisms 83 84 the removal capacity of heavy metals varies with strain types of different microorganisms salts are one of the essential requirements used by industries in conjunction of dyes to maintain stability of colours salts such as nacl na2so4 are important to enhance ionic strength on fabrics therefore salts has to be considered an important factor for remediation as it helps to maintain ph essential for the growth of microorganisms in their culture medium 85 82 4 3 temperature and ph dye degradation is efficient at optimum temperature of 30 40 c required for the growth of mesophilic microbes while thermophilic microorganisms have been investigated to show remediation ability at high temperature 61 dyes and salts are responsible to evaluate the ph of industrial effluents microbial growth also depends upon ph conditions which can be acidic alkaline or neutral it was investigated that at different ph the dye removal efficiency is different decolorization observed using a certain microorganism at ph 3 was 30 56 28 23 at ph 2 and at ph 9 it was 8 3 thus optimum degradation efficiency can be achieved by selecting microorganism suitable to grow by mimicking the ph of dye industry effluent 86 81 21 therefore to achieve maximum dye removal efficiency alterations such as cooling and ph balance best suitable to microorganism can be done at pre treatment procedures 4 4 oxygen and electron balance electron acceptors are essential for microbial metabolism imbalance of electrons thus has indirect impact on remediation of dyes the presence of oxygen has an impact on photocatalysis through separation of electron hole pair such electrons upon interaction with dissolved oxygen produce oxidative sp which are responsible for dye degradation oxygen is an important component of catalysis as aerobic anaerobic and semi aerobic conditions predefine the environmental condition for the growth of microbes carboxylation reductase enzymes is required by anaerobic microbes while oxygenase enzyme in aerobes aerobic microorganisms results in degradation of dyes gradual mixing or shaking offers an even distribution of oxygen in an aerobic activity 87 89 5 methods of removal improper treatment and poor handling in dying procedures causes raise in discharge of effluents with abundance of dyes the adversity of dyes towards nature require to adopt various treatment processes 90 91 there are two methods of treatment namely physicochemical and biological methods of dye removal 25 the physicochemical method of treatment includes different techniques and methods such as membrane filtration electro chemical methods nanotechnological techniques adsorption distillation precipitation and sedimentation 92 93 the biological methods of removal comprise action of plants and microorganisms for decolorization of dyes 94 while methods like photodegradation filtration advanced oxidation process ozonation have been widely used for treatment of dye effluent discharged by industries like textile food and processing pharmaceutical cosmetics here different methods are diagrammatically represented fig 3 and discussed in proceeding section 5 1 physicochemical methods the application of filtration method for dye removal has been reported widely since it is easy to operate ultrafiltration and modified clay matrix membranes are different improved variations of this method various factors like ph ionic concentration temperature and heavy metals etc plays a crucial role in selecting different methods for dye degradation such methods require high pressure and sludge disposal of which may also become a hurdle 95 in case of persistent dyes ozonation method is generally used the decolorization and mineralization efficiency of this method depends upon presence of electrolytes concentration of dyes dosage of ozone and repeated agitation the by products such as nitrate formate acetate and sulphate are generated as a result of ozonation methods while use of certain oxidants can improve the efficiency of this method 96 in photodegradation source of light has a vital role in decolorization of dyes sonophotocatalytic degradation involves use of ultrasound waves which produces cavitation or results in scission of hydrogen peroxide thus more peroxide radicals are available to perform oxidation of dye substrates this method generates highly oxidized products which cannot be degraded biologically 50 photo fenton process has been reported as an effective method for removal of dyes as well as heavy metals and high decolorization efficiency at high volume of effluents 97 the physicochemical methods include multiple designs and different principles of operation it also require a large quantity of chemicals skilled manpower for everyday maintenance and process regulations 98 100 5 2 biological methods the biological approach for dye removal comprises application of plants and microorganisms such bacteria algae and fungi it is eco friendly more effective and generates less sludge in comparison to other methods of dye degradation 5 2 1 bioremediation by plants plants plays a vital role in remediation of dyes and several other types of pollutants 101 they have the ability to extract transform degrade and ultimately detoxify dyes and its derivatives 102 the enzymatic action of plants and allied microorganisms remove the contaminants or dyes from water bodies groundwater air soil and sediments 103 104 plants employ processes of phytoextraction phytoaccumulation phytodegradation rhizofiltration and rhizodegradation which all gives a significant remediation capability to plants the studies on cell suspension callus and hairy root have been done in order to understand the metabolism and tolerance of plants for toxicity of dyes in this hairy root serves as phytochemical factories and source for production of secondary metabolites the plants thus act as biotransformants for the remediation of toxic substances and production of compounds of industrial interests 105 it was reported that hairy root culture of t patula has bioremediation capacity for golden yellow her reactive red m5b methyl orange while stimulated enzymatic production of mn peroxidases azoredutases and tyrosinases helped in bioremediation of red 198 textile dye hydroponics system absence of soil also developed to extract and degrade dyes nasturtium officinale brassicaceae produced under this system was reported to degrade basic red 46 106 the experimentation of above systems at large scale affects the efficiency due to variable environmental conditions 25 15 107 while large phytoreactors were developed in combination of rhizospheric microorganisms here diverse culture of plants and microbes improve the bioremediation efficiency 108 109 the bioremediation of dyes done by plants is economically viable require nutrients and landscape while remediation capacity also depends upon soil properties 5 2 2 bioremediation by microorganisms in general microorganisms perform an important role in degradation of organic inorganic chemical compounds enzymes present in different microbes reduce remove and remediate complex compounds into simpler and less harmful small molecules in some instances where microbes extracted from effluent sites degradation capacity of natural species get enhanced and more effective results will be obtained 77 this was performed in bacterium escherichia coli improved by loading azoredutase enzyme gene extracted from pseudomonas luteola wild variety showed better results in biodegrading azo dyes textile industry 110 bacteria perform the function of bioremediation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 111 reductive cleavage in case of azo dyes is performed through azoreductase enzyme and some other enzymes like tyrosinase peroxidase mg reductase laccase also does so under bacterial remediation 112 113 bacterial bioremediation is based on principle of biosorption adsorption interaction by electric charges on cell surface bioaugmentation or enzymatic degradation 114 pseudomonas aeruginosa can aerobically degrade navitan fast blue s5r azo dye with the help of supplement glucose 115 in some cases it was reported the use of other microbes or hybrid culture in the presence of supplement can improve degradation efficiency aeromonas hydrophila in the presence of yeast extract and sucrose can degrade crystal violet dye under action of laccase enzymes and lignin peroxidase 116 it was reported that yeast can also perform bioremediation such as scheffersomyces spartinae yeast under aerobic conditions at high salinity can degrade acid scarlet 3r dye 117 bacteria acinetobacter sp sw30 as a biogenerator of silver and gold nanoparticles can results in degradation of direct black 22 and reactive yellow 186 dyes 70 however co culture of bacteria can be used for better results like consortia of pseudomonas aeruginosa providencia vermicola and ochrobactrum sp can treat textile effluents of different composition and yields better results than a bacterium sp under inhospitable conditions organisms like extremophiles develop themselves according to the stressful environmental conditions the textile industries consist of stressed condition under extreme temperature ph salinity and toxicity sometimes in such situations and harsh chemical processes the extremophiles halotolerant halophiles thermophiles etc and their extremozymes becomes an attractive candidate of bioremediation 118 70 in nacl medium shewanella aquimarina can decolorize acid red 27 dye 119 120 and thus the presence of various salts is unable to hamper microbial remediation of dyes fungi can produce several extracellular and intracellular enzymes like manganese peroxidase lignin peroxidase and laccase unlike bacteria 58 the process of bioremediation here uses principles of enzymatic degradation biosorption adsorption or combination of both while biomass produced as a result of mycoremediation can treat or biodegrade pollutant at different sites in soil and water fungal bioremediation is an economical and environmental friendly method the positive charge on cell wall originates from the amino acids present in chitosan while negative charges are developed due to the presence of carboxyl and phosphate groups derived from glucuronic acid 121 122 the ionic charges on fungal cell wall allows binding of dyes in order to achieve biosorption living or dead biomass is able to perform remediation of dyes in fungi autoclaving at 121 c provides dead biomass of aspergillus niger at ph between 3 7 it can act as bioabsorber for the direct blue 199 dye 123 the process of autoclaving maximizes biosorption by exposing binding sites of fungal structure and this also increase the interaction of fungal cell with dyes 58 5 bioremediation in fungi is facilitated by enzymes such as mn peroxidase laccases azoreductase and lignin peroxidase 112 the role of peroxidases and laccases in bioremediation of dyes was reported in white rot fungi 77 124 different types of reactors can be used with the white rot fungi for the degradation of reactive blue 4 and reactive red 2 dyes 125 126 but such systems may face problems of clogging in continuous reactor excessive fungal growth and bacterial contamination which can hamper fungal activity endophytic fungi found in the tissues of plants provide protection against q9 pathogens and herbivores can be another tool for mycoremediation 127 fungal remediation is a natural process that can be mimicked to improve the efficiency of dye degradation while certain restrictive factors such as oxygen levels temperature ionic concentration and nutrient need to studied so as to attain enhanced performance while using them 6 phycoremediation of dyes in phycoremediation algae use dyes as a source of nutrient for growth after converting them into simpler carbon compounds algae are ubiquitous in nature reported to remediate and decolorize dyes from effluents they use different mechanism for the remediation of dyes such as adsorption biosorption bioconversion and biodegradation in the process of biosorption algal cells decolorize dyes through its cell wall properties of electrostatic attraction and complexation while in the presence of reductase enzymes algal cells transform complex dye molecules into small molecules 70 enzymes plays a vital role in the reductive cleavage of dyes to make them less harmful to the ecosystem mineralization involves reduction of complex structure of chemicals such as dyes into simpler aromatic compounds the process of degradation by reductase enzyme takes place through direct or indirect method interaction of enzyme with dye occurs by the transfer of electrons under direct process while in indirect process coenzymes adenine dinucleotide fad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad flavin are responsible for electron transfer from an enzyme to dye compound 128 129 the enzymatic action on azo dyes in phycoremediation is shown in fig 4 in case of azo dyes azo reductase enzyme act on dyes in two steps in first step anaerobic reduction of dye bond occurs where double between nitrogen molecule or azo bond reduced to form single bond nitrogen compounds in the second step produced intermediates or aromatic amines convert into minerals under aerobic process 130 chromophores get adsorb on the surface of algal biomass using different mechanism 130 21 the algal biosorption performed by living or dead algal cells plays an important role in the discoloration of textile dyes biosorption process removes dye from water as a liquid phase to solid phase and named them as bioadsorbents 132 124 algae has different types of functional groups on its surface which makes them a good adsorbent for various dyes and other pollutants 130 129 the algal cell wall has relatively high surface area and high binding affinity due to the presence of various functional groups 128 127 the functional groups or ligands present on the cell wall like carboxylate phosphate carbonyl sulfohydryl amino and hydroxyl interact with ions and immobilize them 131 134 in algal remediation of dyes different ions of dyes adhere to the functional groups and some reduced to small organic molecules under action of reductase enzymes 126 125 which makes phycoremediation a viable option for treatment of wastewater containing dyes chlorella vulgaris was reported to decolorize g red fn 3 g basic fuschin basic cationic reactive orange ii methyl red remazol black b remazol red rr remazol golden yellow rnl and congo red 135 136 24 ty2 g tectilon yellow 2 g dye removal involves bioconversion or degradation despite of adsorption on the algal cells of chlorella vulgaris in case of unacclimated algae ty2 g was reported to be converted into aniline proceeded by conversion into simpler organic compounds 137 the functional groups present on ulva lactuca sargassum crassifolium and gracilaria corticate showed high affinity and electrostatic force of attraction towards mg dye in s crassifolium porosity of cell wall allows more permeability to ions and thus provide highest affinity among three algae to make it more potent for removal of mg dye 131 navy blue he22 nbhe22 dye contains phenolic oh groups where phenols acidic resonate with its phenoxide ion structure in normal conditions while alkaline conditions shift the resonation more toward the phenoxide ion this causes the presence of phenoxide ion structure in the dye with negative charge however in algae anionic nature of the functional groups present in the cell wall provides net negative charge to them due to this it seems that divalent metal ions of culture medium are acting like linker between phenoxide oxygen and the cell membrane for removal of dyes 1 stoechospermum marginatum has efficiency to remove acid blue 25 acid orange 7 and acid black 1 from textile wastewater 94 lemna minor macrophytes were investigated to degrade dyes and its derivatives at high concentrations triphenylmethane dye was remediated up to 300 mg l of concentrations and up to 80 of acid blue 92 dye was remediated within six days 138 139 reactive blue 221 and remazol black 5 dyes were reported to be decolorized by chlamydomona reinhardtii 140 20 desmodesmus sp can decolorize up to 98 methylene blue 141 and biosorption decolorization activity of various algal species are listed below in table 1 in case of phycoremediation both dry and wet biomass has potential to remediate dyes while dry biomass was evaluated more advantageous living algal cells can perform self replenishment and has continuous metallic ion uptake ability due to this fact live algal cells are preferred over dead cells algal biomass while dead cells do not require essential nutrients for growth metabolism dependent biosorption is a characteristic of living cells which depends upon mechanism of chelation biosorption or physical adsorption results in decolorization of dyes the physical adsorption is a surface phenomenon occurs through the process of chemisorption result of covalent bonding or physisorption result of weak van der waals forces metabolism independent biosorption occurs mostly in dead cells of algae here adsorption is the main process which includes physiochemical adsorption or ionic interactions algal cells can be used as co culture or hybrid culture for remediation of effluents of dye industries in some observations algae in combination of yeast were used to degrade dyes 46 157 158 thus microbial consortia can also provide favourable results for decolorization of dyes nanotechnology has a wide role not only in physical processes of dye removal but also in bioremediation in conjugation of bacteria and algae polysulphone nanofibrous web based on chlamydomona reinhardtii microalgae can remove dyes such as reactive blue 221 and remazol black 5 57 140 the role of microorganisms in dye removal and pollutants remediation is undeniably extensive the algae can be considered an economical option in comparison to activated carbon in removal of dyes 159 algae are also investigated to play an important role in carbon dioxide sequestration inside marine ecology 160 161 22 it is now essential to explore the significant role played by microalgae algae in the bioremediation 6 1 microalgae algae consortia for dye removal microalgae collected from different effluent containing dyes sites has been reported to perform at higher efficiency such isolated microbes can be cloned and transferred to genes in order to encode degradative enzymes 77 the macroalgae extracted from marine environment namely ulva lactuca sargassum crassifolium and gracilaria corticate were studied for their potential use in decolorization of malachite green in this sargassum crassifolium provided maximum removal efficiency between 95 6 and 98 3 while minimum was observed from 69 77 1 131 147 however in some instances algal consortia have been investigated containing three microalgae chlorella cosmarium and euglena species were studied to bioremediate triphenylmethane dye malachite green mg with the application of artificial neural network ann 87 162 the use of living cells for the recovery of heavy metal ions is one of the major hurdles as the high concentration of ions can endocytose into algal cells cyanobacteria has the potential to degrade dyes in conjugation with algae like indigo dye was degraded completely by phormidium autumnale utex1580 23 insightful research is required in algal technology to perform efficient remediation of dye containing effluents by different species consortia incorporation of other processes for the pre treatment and application of ann in input output modelling is also required in order to explore and establish new potential remediation methods based on algal species 6 2 phyconanotechnological remediation of dyes phyconanotechnology is the confluence of nanotechnology with algae where algae are used for the synthesis of nanoparticles 34 36 163 nanoparticles nps are widely known for their properties in different fields of science and technology the synthesis of nps using physicochemical methods is often costly and its discharge into environment causes toxicity to ecosystem the use of living organisms like plants and microbes for production of nps is environmentally sustainable and economically viable 31 27 algae are largest photoautotrophic microorganism and have immense role in applications such as adsorption accumulation and bioremediation of organic and inorganic chemical compounds heavy metals pharmaceuticals waste radioactive materials and complex dyes 164 165 biosynthesis of nps using algae can be performed in different ways like use of living algal cells exploiting supernatants free of cells from culture media of microalgae and using biomolecules extracted from disrupted cells 166 168 the approach for the synthesis of nps using algae is generally required two methodologies it was investigated that it takes place either intracellular inside the algal cells or extracellular within the cell free environment interacting with extracted biomolecules several reports suggest that algae contain biologically active compounds such as pigments antioxidants as well as secondary metabolites and this makes alage a good source for biosynthesis of nps 169 au nps synthesised using algal cells reported efficient capacity for remediation of dyes such as rhodamine b and sulforhodamine 101 methyl orange was degraded photocatalytically by ulva lactuca fabricated ag nps 170 154 and more such studies are illustrated in the table 2 ag nps can be used for effluent remediation containing dyes as improved photocatalytic activity was reported while using them against dyes microchaete nccu 342 used to synthesise ag nps performed significantly better than cyanobacterial extract when used for remediation of methyl orange 38 169 36 the application of algae for the decolorization remediation of dyes present in effluents will not make it sustainable until we use the biomass to produce valuable products 175 while the algal biomass is reported to be used for extraction of biofuels cattle feedstock biofertilizer bioelectricity nanoparticles for medicinal or biomedical use nutraceuticals such as carbohydrates proteins chlorophyll carotenoids and mab microalgae biochar 176 43 hence the utilization of algae to obtain various useful products after remediation of effluents containing dyes will make them a sustainable option 7 value added products algal cells are potential candidate for bioremediation as they have faster growth rate and photosynthetic ability high lipid productivity and natural source for carbon sink 22 the valuable products reported to be produced by algae microalgae like biofuels nutraceuticals bioplastics feedstock for cattle biofertilizer and bioelectricity etc are discussed here 41 42 the microalgae used for remediation of dyes and effluents has been reported to have application for the production of biofuels 177 178 it was investigated that biofuels obtained from microalgae are ester compounds while petroleum based fuels are hydrocarbons microbial biomass to biofuels takes several conversion routes including biochemical conversion and thermo chemical conversion 179 180 the lipids obtained from algal biomass varies with species such as scenedesmus sp istga1 was reported to produce 452 mg l lipid chlorella vulgaris was evaluated to generate 84 01 biofuel when acid base transesterification was assisted with microwave method for cell disruption 181 183 here as explained in the fig 5 discharged effluents containing dyes after passed through phycoremediation can be used to obtain various value added products 184 microalgae can be used as natural fertilizer as they can improve the carbon fixing capacity of soil improve soil productivity and promote plant growth 134 chlorella vulgaris scenedesmus sp spirogyra sp and chlorophyceae sp etc used for bioremediation have economical values so as to produce biofuels biochar proteins pigments vitamins and pufa polyunsaturated fatty acids 40 185 fig 5 7 1 bioelectricity microbes were investigated to have the ability to produce electrical energy using organic components as a source of chemical energy in effluents bacteria present at anode and algae at cathode through photosynthesis or respiration produce electrons 39 atp adenosine triphosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate are produced as a result of electron transfer through electron transport chain it was evaluated use of microbial fuel cell mfc operated from real dye wastewater has 83 decolorization 790 5 mv voltage output generation and 940 61 5 mw m2 power density hydrothermal gasification constructed wetland microbial fuel cell etc are other technologies can be employed for treatment of effluents containing dyes 186 88 187 7 2 nutraceuticals these are essential elements to supplement the growth and overall development of an individual the microalgae are ubiquitous in nature and are rich with biologically active metabolites widely used in pharmaceutics they comprise of compounds such as chlorophyll proteins carotenoids vitamins and carbohydrates hence algae microalgae have nutritional importance and are potential candidates for various nutraceutical industries 188 190 7 2 1 proteins single cell proteins scp are used for protein supplementation extracted from cultured algal biomass 191 in microorganisms fungi bacteria and algae are the main sources of it in algae spirulina is widely used as protein source even in space explorations it was reported that chlorella sp and spirulina sp of algae estimated to constitute protein content of 70 approx with respect to the toal cell biomass 192 originally algae have vital vitamins such as a and d abundant protein 40 60 which makes them a good source of nutrients 193 these are reported to be excellent source of essential amino acids eaa in microalgae amino acids such as lysine tryptophan histidine methionine threonine isoleucine and valine are present in more comparable quantity than other protein containing sources like soyabeans eggs it has been investigated that protein yield extracted from microalgae as 4 15 tons ha year while for crops such as pulses wheat and soyabean are 1 2 tons ha year 1 1 tons ha year and 0 6 1 2 tons ha year respectively the who fao has recommended microalgal species such as chlorella sp and spirulina sp consists balanced composition of eaa necessary for humans 194 176 7 2 2 pigments chlorophylls are fat soluble pigments in algae 0 5 1 0 of chlorophyll per dry weight is present microalgae have major proportion of chlorophyll a and some amount of chlorophyll b as well as c and chlorophyllin a derivative of chlorophyll is used as anticarcinogenic antimutagenic and dietary supplement carotenoids are also fat soluble pigments and carotenoid content in microalgae varies from 0 2 to 14 on basis of dry weight beta carotene lycopene xanthophylls are some of the types of carotenoids the carotenoids extracted from c ellipsoidea and c vulgaris has been investigated for antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer hct116 cell line lycopene chlorella sp has reported anti proliferative and anti cancer activity to counter prostate cancer cells pc 3 and du 145 lycopene from chlorella sp also performed better than lycopene extracted from tomatoes t 195 as a natural source of pigment and precursor of vitamin a beta carotene they are good source to supplement nutrient in body and have cosmeceutical properties the Î² carotene are highly antioxidant and found effective against skin problems haematococcus pluvialis has reported presence of astaxanthin and can accumulate up to 5 of dry weight they can also be considered as excellent source of carotenoids 195 40 196 197 7 2 3 carbohydrates algal cells originated in marine environment are the rich source of carbohydrates polysaccharides polysaccharides are simple sugar or monosaccharides comprising glycosidic bonds which are used in various applications such as stabilizers emulsifiers thickeners and in various food and beverages industries 198 in different algae these polysaccharides differ in storages components like in green algae sulphated polysaccharides are sulphated xylans and galactan in brown algae it comprises of porphyrin inside intracellular spaces sulphated fucose as fucoidan alginic acids sargassan and in red algae they have floridian starch xylans sulphated galactan agars and carrageenans agar alginate brown sea weeds and carrageenan red sea weeds are important polysaccharides extracted from algal cells thought its applications are also in other pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries 199 200 the carbohydrates in form of cellulose and starch extracted from algae can be used as source for production of bioplastics and bioethanol 201 7 2 4 fatty acids in fatty acids omega 3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha to be used as dietary supplements provides essential benefits 42 in microalgae they are also studied as stress responsive biomarkers in autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions omega 3 is produced using atmospheric co2 as carbon source for photosynthesis microalgae harvested in heterotrophic conditions were studied as good source particularly for dha the dha are long chain of fatty acids pufa useful for the health of human eyes heart and brain epa are precursor for compounds such as thromboxane 3 leukotriene 5 and prostaglandin 3 dha and epa play an important role to prevent coronary heart diseases it helps in reduction of blood cholesterol levels and for the development of cns infants 202 microalgae as a potent source of pufa poly unsaturated fatty acids has been used as supplements for human consumption the major pufa evaluated in species like phaeophyta and rhodophyta are eicosapentaenoic linoleic and arachidonic acids red algal species are reported to be important producer of epa and a source of pufa fatty acids are not only used as nutritional products for human diet but also for food processing and beverage industries 192 7 2 5 vitamins algae are known as good source of nutrients and synthesize compounds like vitamins and minerals in autotrophic conditions vitamins such as vit c vit e and b complexes b1 b2 b3 b6 b9 b12 are studied in microalgae it has been reported that microalgae contain higher amount of vital nutrients than soyabeans and cereals 202 spirulina was investigated to have about 10 times more Î² carotene than other sources of it like carrot the use of algae as a source for vit b12 has revealed higher quantities in comparison to plants and animal food sources isochrysis galbana serve as good source of vitamins such as vit a vit e vit b complex while chlorella stigmatophora dunaliella tertiolecta and tetraselmis suecica also evaluated with same vitamins 203 euglena gracilis reported to contain Î² carotene vit c vit e various studies has reported that almost all microalgal species contains tocopherol ascorbic acid and vitamin a 198 chlorella species were assessed to have vit b12 thus microalgae have potential to become a significant source of anti oxidants 7 3 phyconanoparticles these are biological compounds of algae proved to have wide applications in medical arena and wastewater treatment in case of biomedical purposes they have the ability to replace conventional drug delivery system and other therapies 32 204 the phyconanoparticles are processed biologically with high adsorption capacity in different sizes and shapes such as triangular spherical truncated oval and cubic it was reported that such nanoparticles are made up of metal metal oxides and have anti inflammatory properties antibacterial antifungal antitumor and antioxidant 36 activities as shown in below table 3 7 4 microalgal biochar mab biochar produced from microalgae is useful to improve organic carbon content of soil 215 studies have reported that a rise of about 1 2 in soil organic content oc can reduce atmospheric co2 by 5 mg m3 216 217 mab biochar produced from microalgae is a promising agent for capturing utilization and sequestration of co2 wastewater treatment bioenergy production or biorefinery 218 there are various thermochemical processes such as pyrolysis hydrothermal liquefaction torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization which can be used to produce it mab containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen can act as potent catalyst for different energy generating applications including transesterification fuel production and fermentation 219 220 it was reported that lipid extracted microalgae biomass can be used to produce biochar the biochar thus obtained was investigated to produce carbon dots cds through thermal conversion while these were produced earlier directly from algal biomass thus it also present certain solutions to utilize biomass produced during algal biofuel production algae based products for mab to cds production and their cds use as sensors for assessing heavy metals in water bodies 221 222 the use of algal biomass is not limited to the above applications it can also be used to produce biofertilizers tar and bioplastics etc in this 21st century we are facing the menace of water scarcity energy crisis and global warming we can find sustainable solutions with microalgae through wastewater treatment and use of it ecological production of biofuels and using it as a source of carbon sink 8 conclusion and opportunities effluents containing dyes are discharged by various industries where metallic ions zn cu hg etc acids bases natural extracts of fibres and various salts are also present the toxicity of such effluents requires imposition of laws regulations this requires necessary measures for treatment at source before discharging into the environment particularly water bodies however the use of physicochemical methods in removal of dyes are generally not economical the use of different chemicals imposes environmental cost by generating sludge in large amount by them biological methods being eco friendly are not new as plants and microbes have been lungs of nature to remediate pollutants present in the environment in last few years the process of isolation of microbes from local effluent sites and use of biotechnological tools to get improved species of them presents a new path towards remediation phycoremediation has huge potential to save our environment and resources from dye derivatives and other pollutants the ligands on algal cells for binding of ionic groups of dyes and large surface area for adsorption made them a potential candidate also for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles the vagaries of nature and other factors permits to use combination of different techniques methods as some of the best approaches for treatment the use of biological treatment in association of conventional or physical chemical techniques will provide effective treatment results like pretreatment with nanofibers before phycoremediation can improve removal efficiency symbiosis of different microorganisms bacteria and algae for bioremediation and bioelectricity generation would improve the removal efficiency and explore a new area of energy in remediation algae as a biological agent in conjugation of immobilization matrix for pre treatment and then for remediation is one such approach which provides avenues for more research the presence of lipids carotenoids proteins and pigments in algal cells and their use to produce biofuels biofertilizers etc would tempt to find more applications of algae and execution at large scale this study contributes towards wider research on algal technology for enviornmenetal remediation and algae for medicinal and energy solutions declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

13587,in the metropolitan region of buenos aires the load of nutrients discharged to urban rivers and shores is producing a severe eutrophication problem in the estuary of la plata river that problem could be alleviated by recovering nitrogen n and phosphorus p through the production of fertilizer products in the existing activated sludge treatment plants four nutrient recovery options were considered struvite precipitation in the centrate line acidic leaching of the sludge followed by struvite precipitation of the centrate ion exchange in the centrate line and a combination of struvite precipitation in the centrate line plus an ion exchange unit to further polish the secondary effluent those options were compared with basis on their economic sustainability and their capacity to reduce the load of n and p discharged to the coastal waters and rivers the economic assessment indicated that producing fertilizer products in the existing facilities using the four considered options would be unprofitable in the best case which is struvite precipitation in the centrate line the potential revenues would only cover 38 5 of the operational expenses environmental benefits could justify that cost as in some urban rivers the load of p could be reduced by 42 5 by struvite precipitation regarding the load of nutrients that is discharged to the estuary the impact of the considered nutrient recovery options ranges from a decrease in 0 5 n and 3 7 p struvite precipitation to a decrease in 8 2 n and 4 4 p combination of struvite precipitation ion exchange keywords nutrient recovery phosphorous eutrophication struvite fertilizer wastewater 1 introduction 1 1 nutrient recovery from urban wastewater urban wastewater is nowadays regarded as a source of resources those can be recovered in the different processes that occur in a wastewater treatment facility during the primary treatment cellulose can be recovered with the use of some technologies in the form of bio composites 1 2 following the wastewater undergoes aerobic treatment where the organic matter degrades and an activated sludge is produced that sludge undergoes anaerobic digestion producing biogas which can be used to produce electricity or thermal energy to dry the resulting waste sludge that waste sludge is typically dumped in landfills but can be a source of valuable resources too some of these resources are polyhydroxyalkanoates phas which are a form of biodegradable polyesters 3 acetylsalicylic and salicylic acids 4 or bio char for soil amendment 5 meanwhile the secondary effluent that leaves a wastewater treatment plant can be used as reclaimed or recycled water for non drinkable purposes as an additional step the secondary effluent can undergo tertiary treatment which further reduces the content of phosphorus and nitrogen and even reach drinkable standards 6 103 phosphorus p and nitrogen n can also be recovered from wastewater and used as fertilizers both are essential nutrients for plant growing and urban wastewaters are rich on them particularly urine which contributes to 80 of the total load of n and 45 of the total load of p in wastewater 7 most of the nutrient recovery systems are intended for municipal facilities 8 although some proposals regard smaller units that use urine as input in buildings with source separation of urine from faeces 9 recovering n and p for agriculture reduces the need of industrial fertilizers whose production is energy intensive and depends on mineral resources those are natural gas in the case of n fertilizers and rock phosphate in the case of p fertilizers some countries that lack of those mineral resources have set as a priority the recovery of nutrients from wastewater such is the case of germany where p recovery is mandatory in wastewater treatment plants larger than 50 000 person equivalents since its sewage sludge ordinance of 2017 10 in addition recovering those nutrients from wastewater alleviates an important environmental problem that affects aquatic ecosystems around urban areas the discharge of wastewater with a high load of p and n causes the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae leading to the eutrophication of water bodies eutrophication causes oxygen depletion in water bodies generating hypoxia and even anoxia very low oxygen zones known as dead zones 11 12 eutrophication is an environmental challenge that threats urban rivers and coastal waters worldwide most large cities in south america present this problem where it is aggravated by uncontrolled urbanization that leads to the discharge of raw sewage into water bodies severe eutrophication has been reported in the metropolitan regions of bogota 13 lima 14 buenos aires 15 montevideo 16 sÃ£o paulo 17 and rio de janeiro 18 20 1 2 nutrient recovery from urban wastewater in argentina and brazil in argentina and brazil the recovery of nutrients from urban wastewater has been limited to the direct application of biosolid which is the sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants biosolid has some fertilizer properties and can be applied in agriculture soils pasture lands or tree plantations in argentina a recent norm fosters the sustainable use of biosolids from wastewater plants resolution 410 18 the metropolitan region of buenos aires dumps each year 4351 tons of waste sludge into the city s landfills and only reuses a very small fraction of that amount exclusively for landfill coverage 21 in brazil there has been extensive research regarding the direct application of sewage sludge in soils 22 29 however recent research has showed that sewage sludge generated in brazilian cities can contain heavy metals and other harmful pollutants that can affect soil and aquatic biota 28 30 two approaches have been proposed in the region to produce a fertilizer that is free of potential pollutants using wastewater the first one is the cultivation of microalgae in the anaerobically digested effluent 31 the algae biomass can be later dried up and used as an organic fertilizer the second one is the precipitation of salts containing p and n such as struvite those salts are produced in the form of granulated fertilizers that have a standardized composition and are free of potential soil pollutants heavy metals and other hazardous compounds don t precipitate and remain in the sludge which can be later disposed safely in appropriate landfills the production of struvite granules with a content of 5 wt n and 14 wt p has been proposed for sÃ£o paulo metropolitan region that city which is the largest of the americas could produce 38 tons day of struvite from its main wastewater facilities and consequently reduce the load of phosphorus reaching its urban rivers by 5 3 tons day 17 struvite crystallizer units can be easily applied to the most common type of wastewater facilities in south america the activated sludge plants it uses a technology whose efficiency has been proven worldwide 32 33 although it has not yet been implemented in south america this research focuses on the opportunities that the sewerage system of buenos aires presents for this technology this metropolitan region 17 5 million inhabitants provides a significant concentration of domestic wastewater in large treatment facilities the region also has a well stablished local market for fertilizers any struvite fertilizer produced in those facilities would be easily marketed as there is a deficit of fertilizers in this agricultural country in particular argentina imports 76 of all the phosphatic fertilizers that consumes 34 the production of struvite fertilizer in buenos aires seems as a promising option to alleviate the eutrophication in the region s urban rivers and coastal waters the potential of this technology in the region deserves a detailed discussion that should consider environmental benefits technical feasibility and economic viability 1 3 content of this study this work assesses the applicability of technologies that recover nutrients from wastewater in the metropolitan region of buenos aires the objective is to 1 explore the technological options that would allow the existing wastewater facilities in the region to remove nutrients in the form of fertilizing products 2 select a set of technological options that best suits the characteristics of the region s treatment facilities 3 assess the economic sustainability of upgrading the existing facilities with nutrient recovery units for each of the selected options 4 quantify the potential impact that each technological option would cause in the coastal waters and rivers measured by the reduction in the load of p and n discharged to them section 2 presents a review of the available nutrient recovery alternatives for urban wastewater the processes that are reviewed are able to recover p and n from waste liquid streams digested sludge and sludge ashes in activated sludge plants section 3 contextualizes the study by presenting the problematic caused by the excessive release of nutrients to the la plata river estuary which is the final receiver of the region s wastewaters in section 4 this study addresses the characteristics of the sewerage system in the region to select those existing activated sludge facilities that could be upgraded with nutrient recovery units section 5 details the four technological options that are considered and the methods for the calculations section 6 presents the results of both the economic assessment and the impact on the discharge of n and p and discusses the most suitable option according to the results 2 technologies for the recovery of n and p municipal wastewaters are rich in nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k due to the high content of organic matter in addition to organic matter soaps and detergents can also be a source of n and p the average load in raw household wastewater has been estimated as 13 5 g n 2 1 g p and 4 0 g k per person per day 35 anaerobic and aerobic treatments of wastewater allow microorganisms to degrade the organic matter the n is converted into ammonia nh4 n while phosphate po4 3 is largely converted into orthophosphate the dominant forms of orthophosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 at the initial stages of the wastewater treatment process in which ph remains at a range around 7 as the ph increases in further treatment stages hpo4 2 becomes the dominant form of orthophosphate 2 1 precipitation of phosphate phosphate can precipitate in the form of struvite with mg or in the form of other salts by adding al ca or fe the removal of n and p from wastewater by adding mg ca and fe in fluidified bed stirred or aerated reactors has been tested in large treatment plants showing up as an economically viable and robust technology 36 38 through the addition of ca to the wastewater p can be recovered as calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 and hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh as shown in the following reactions 3ca2 2po4 3 ca3 po4 2 calcium phosphate h3po4 ca oh 2 cahpo4 dicalcium phosphate 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh hydroxyapatite hap ca can be added as hydrated lime at a ca p ratio of 2 39 meanwhile fe can be added before anaerobic fermentation at a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 40 to recover as vivianite fe2 2po4 3 fe 3 po4 2 8h2o vivianite the addition of fe is an efficient way to remove p from the sludge with removal rates as high as 82 6 from waste activated sludge was in anaerobic reactors 40 the precipitation of p with mg occurs naturally in most wastewater facilities and deserves special attention orthophosphate reacts with ammonia and magnesium ions to form magnesium ammonium phosphate map known as struvite mg2 nh4 po4 3 nh4 mg po4 6h2o struvite orthophosphate can also react with potassium instead of ammonium in that case potassium replaces ammonium in the struvite crystal lattice forming magnesium potassium phosphate mpp mg2 k po4 3 mgkpo4 6h2o potassium struvite struvite deposition in pipes and aerators is a common problem in wastewater plants particularly in those regions where water is hard and as a consequence there is a high content of magnesium in the wastewater struvite scale formation must be inhibited in order to prevent operational issues that is typically done though the injection of chemicals which increases the operational costs of treatment facilities instead the precipitation of the struvite can be fostered inside a fluidified bed or stirred reactor where it can be easily removed the struvite crystals that precipitate in the reactor are a concentrated and homogeneous source of n and p and have a commercial value as a fertilizer thus the controlled precipitation of struvite in a reactor brings a double benefit it avoids the unwanted scale formation in pipes and at the same time produces valuable fertilizer any liquid stream containing phosphate can be a suitable input for a struvite crystallizer the most common ones are municipal wastewater and effluents from food processing plants and pig farms 41 from the total p carried in the raw wastewater that enters a municipal treatment facility 80 of it is carried by the was stream while 10 of it is carried in the sludge that leaves the primary clarifiers 42 therefore both streams are critical for any p recovering process the majority of struvite crystallizing systems focus on the was stream first was undergoes anaerobic digestion where some struvite formation can occur depending on the hardness of the water magnesium content then the digested was typically undergoes thickening and dewatering in those two latter stages the dewatering sludge liquors are produced thickening produces liquor from the output of centrifuges and the supernatant of gravity thickening vessels the final dewatering of digested sludges is generally performed in a filter press and produces a liquor named filtrate or centrate those sludge liquors combined or not with the one from the primary clarifiers constitute the p rich input stream for the struvite crystallizing reactor other systems such as the airprex airlift reactor are installed between the anaerobic digester and the dewatering equipment but most of them use sludge dewatering liquors some commercial systems such as the veolia irstea s opalix system performs heavy metal adsorption in the sludge liquor before it enters the struvite crystallizer in order to avoid the presence of those substances in the final fertilizer product once in the struvite crystallizing reactor an external source of mg is provided mgcl2 mgo or mg oh 2 which is cheaper and also raises the ph the crystallization occurs at a ph range of 7 11 in order to raise the ph and promote the precipitation of struvite some systems add sodium hydroxide naoh 43 whilst others use air stripping of dissolved carbon dioxide from the sludge or instead vacuum degassing elovac in the elophos system the crystalline struvite drills grow for several days in the reactor until they reach the desired size then the granules are separated from the effluent which is easy as struvite has a 1 7 specific density the harvested granules are dried and stocked in silos ready to be commercialized as fertilizer after the precipitation of p and n as struvite the effluent that leaves the reactor is conducted back to the process this return liquor has a low p and n content and can be recirculated to the was digesters as in fig 1 or else to the primary clarifiers as in fig 2 figs 1 and 2 illustrate the two main arrangements for inserting a struvite crystallizing system within an activated sludge plant 2 2 ion exchange iex processes ion exchange iex is the process of reciprocal transfer of ions between a solution and a resin ammonia and phosphate are selectively removed from the wastewater with specific iex resin iex resins containing hydrous ferric oxide have a good selectivity for phosphate 44 other interesting selective sorbents of p are iron doped zeolites 45 46 and resins based on zirconium and lanthanum 47 the interaction mechanisms between the phosphate and sorbent are categorized as hydrogen bonding shape complementarity and inner sphere complexation based on those interaction mechanisms the key physicochemical properties of a sorption material to achieve a high phosphate selectivity regard its difference with phosphate in acid base properties geometric shapes and metal complexing abilities 48 meanwhile ammonia can be removed from aqueous solutions through various adsorbent materials such as bentonite zeolite clay biochar activated carbon or metal organic framework 107 cation exchange resins of the sulfonated polystyrene type have also proven to be effective in removing ammonia from synthetic and real wastewaters 108 110 in iex processes zeolites have received significant attention as are very effective in removing ammonia from wastewaters 49 50 zeolite minerals have the ability to hydrate dehydrate reversibly and to exchange some of their constituent cations with aqueous solutions both without a major change in structure 111 the structure of zeolites is characterized by a framework of linked tetrahedra each consisting of four oxygen atoms surrounding a silicon or aluminum cation this three dimensional network has open cavities in the forms of channels and cages which can lodge water molecules as well as non framework cations such as na ca2 k and mg2 that can be exchanged with the surrounding solution if the solution is rich in ammonium nh4 n is exchanged with the cations present in the framework the exchange capacity of the zeolite depends on the negative charge of its framework structure due to si al ratio as well as size concentration and charge of the exchange ions 113 natural zeolite clinoptilolite is one of the most used ion exchange media for ammonium removal in aqueous solutions 108 112 meanwhile mesolite a synthetically produced zeolite has been gaining traction as an effective ammonium adsorber in digested sludge liquors 114 the better performance of mesolite and other synthetic zeolites is attributed to the increased consistency si al ratios of 1 1 defining a high cation exchange capacity 113 pabalan and bertetti 111 reported adsorption values of 4 6 and 4 9 meq g for mesolite compared with 2 0 meq g for clinoptilolite for solutions with the same initial concentration of nh4 n in an iex process the transfer capacity of the resin is regularly restored by regeneration solutions where the n and p accumulate those nutrients are then removed from the regenerants with an ammonia stripper or through a combined precipitation and filtration process the regenerant solution can be reused multiple times which helps to make economically viable the process iex nutrient recovery processes are not yet being implemented in large wastewater treatment plants however a small iex unit is being commissioned at a municipal facility in cranfield uk 39 51 that unit is projected to remove n with mesolite media and p with hybrid ion exchange resin haix containing ferric oxide nanoparticles the final stage of the iex process at cranfield is the recovery of the nutrients that have been adsorbed by the media n is recovered as ammonium sulfate through a liquid liquid membrane process in a hollow fiber membrane chamber hfmc whilst p is precipitated as hap hydroxyapatite fig 3 illustrates the process flow chart of an iex unit showing the continuous flow of effluent passing through the mesolite media first and then through the hiax as well as the batch processes that regenerate the iex resin and recover the nutrients another application for such iex process is the pre treatment of impaired water before its filtration with reverse osmose membranes as proposed by dong et al 52 that configuration consists in three types of ion exchangers first a polystyrene strong base anion exchanger pssba that removes hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds followed by a shallow shell weak acid cation exchanger sswac that decreases ph and finally a hybrid anion exchanger haix for p recovery similar as the one illustrated in fig 3 an iex nutrient recovery unit can be inserted in the centrate line or else after the wastewater treatment plant treating the final effluent that leaves the facility if inserted after an activated sludge plant the iex unit can polish the effluent to ultra low levels of n and p to avoid eutrophication effluents with concentrations of 11 mg l nh4 n and 3 2 mg l po4 p can be lowered to less than 1 mg l nh4 n and 0 5 mg l po4 p 39 53 2 3 sludge treatments to release n and p to the liquid fraction any system that recovers nutrients from wastewater sludge can be enhanced with the addition of a specific unit that maximizes the amount of p and n released to the liquid fraction of the sludge more p and n available in the sludge liquors means more potential production of precipitated salts such as struvite and therefore a higher recovery rate of nutrients such unit acts as a pre treatment stage before the digestion and further thickening and dewatering of the sludges it can perform biological thermal or chemical treatments to release p and n from the primary sludge or the was the most prominent of these treatments are thermal pressure hydrolysis thp stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms bio acidification of sludge thp combines high pressure boiling followed by a rapid decompression its main objective is acting as a pre treatment stage that sterilizes the sludge and makes it more biodegradable thus improving the performance of the anaerobic digestion that follows 54 however it also increases the concentration of phosphate and ammonium in the centrate water obtained after the digestion of the sludge another option to enhance nutrient recovery systems is the use of stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms those microorganisms release p from the sludge as consume vfas volatile fat acids from organic matter 55 a retention time of around 10 h in the tank is enough to release much of the p to the liquid fraction of the sludge 70 in the case of ostara s wasstrip 56 and 50 in the case of the scepphar process 57 another treatment to release p from the was and produce a p rich liquor consists in the bio acidification of the sludge to solubilize phosphorus that bio acidification can be performed by adding easily degradable carbohydrate source under anaerobic conditions 58 an example of such treatment is veolia irstea s metaphos process in operation in a wastewater treatment plant in lille france 2 4 acidic leaching of the digested sludge and sludge ashes as discussed above n and p can be recovered from the liquid fraction of sludge liquors by precipitating salts such as struvite hap map or vivianite or else through iex processes that recovery can be maximized with the use of sludge treatments that release n and p to the liquid fraction however there is another technological alternative that instead of focusing on the liquid fraction of the sludge aims the recovery of p from the dried sludge that remains after the dewatering of digested was that alternative is the leaching of the digested sludge with the use of acid or base which solubilizes the p that is fixed in the solid sludge phase the p that is dissolved into the leach can then be recovered from the supernatant after liquid solid separation after the filtration adding mg to the p rich supernatant can allow the recovery of p as struvite the recovery rates of p are higher than 90 59 to 95 60 the efficiency of p recovery depends on several factors such as sludge composition type and concentration of the leaching agent ph and contact time 61 the dissolution of the chemically and or biologically bound p is superior at strong acidic conditions semerci et al 62 achieved a dissolution of p of 91 1 from dried sludge by using hcl whilst when using naoh the dissolution of p was 60 3 the p released from the sludge follows different mechanisms in acidic and alkaline leaching in the acidic ph range first the chemically bound p is released into solution and then the biologically bound p is dissolved while in the alkaline range it is the opposite 59 it is noticeable that during the acidic leaching process metal phosphates and other metal compounds dissociate so the solution contains metal ions mostly fe al ca and mg ions and depending on the leaching ph even heavy metal ions such as cu zn pb ni cd cr 60 the precipitation of these metal ions must be avoided to obtain a high quality struvite product citric acid forms a stable complex with the metal ions that stays in the solution in processes such as the stuttgart process 60 citric acid is added in the struvite precipitation chamber together with mgo and with naoh to raise the ph a pilot scale plant following the stuttgart process that uses sulfuric acid for the leaching of digested sludge has achieved 90 of p removal efficiency the opex of the plant is 24 usd per kg of p recovered as struvite 60 acidic leaching can also be applied to the ashes that result from incinerating the dry cake of sludge that sludge cake is produced in the mechanical dewatering of the was the sludge cake must be transported and dumped in landfills which is costly so in order to further reduce its volume some wastewater treatment plants use thermal processes to reduce it to ashes sludge ashes are mainly composed of five elements p ca fe al and si in the form of oxides and other inorganic forms in almost all ash leaching processes the recovery rate of p is higher than 70 and reaches 95 in some of them ashdec 63 the output of processes such as ashdec leachphos and mephrec has a p content between 5 and 20 making them suitable as fertilizer products however the acidic leaching of incinerated sludge also leads to high heavy metal co extraction 64 therefore systems that capture heavy metals from the ashes through adsorption or any other mean would be necessary to preserve the quality of the final fertilizer product 3 eutrophication of rio de la plata estuary the rio de la plata is the estuary formed by the confluence of the uruguay and the paranÃ¡ rivers from that confluence the river forms a 290 km long bay that widens progressively to 220 km until reaching the south atlantic ocean the estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america carrying an enormous amount of sediments that make the waters look naturally brown as can be observed in fig 4 their coasts comprehend the most densely populated areas of uruguay and argentina buenos aires the capital city of argentina is located in the southern shore while montevideo the capital city of uruguay is located in the opposite shore the metropolitan region of buenos aires has 17 5 million people which turns it the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the americas its main source of drinking water is the inner part of la plata estuary particularly 86 of the city s water supply depends on only two water treatment plants whose intake is located at 1 8 km and 2 5 km offshore therefore the region s water supply is very sensitive to the pollution of the city s shores and urban rivers which discharge all in the estuary the brackish area harbors sandy beaches that provide ecosystem services mainly associated with fishing recreation leisure and tourism coastal deterioration pollution and overfishing are main threats that need to be more strictly regulated to maintain both the health status and functional ecosystem services 65 buenos aires has municipal laws that ban swimming in its beaches due to water quality concerns from dates as early as 1975 66 meanwhile in the opposite shore of the river montevideo managed to improve the water quality of its shores and nowadays its beaches are one of the region s main tourist attractions the main beaches are subjected to continuous monitoring however consistent data reveals that all the coastal waters of montevideo are subjected to some degree of eutrophication with average concentrations of total phosphorous and total nitrogen higher than 0 075 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively 67 69 16 one of the causes of the eutrophication of the uruguayan coast of the estuary is its low capacity to dilute nutrients 70 nitrogen and phosphorus are the two nutrients that have a key role in the formation of cyanobacterial blooms events of bloom forming cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins have become increasingly frequent and raised concerns in the population of the estuary 71 the last one happened in summer 2019 lasting 3 months and causing the closure of montevideo s beaches a detailed assessment identified the source of this bloom in the uruguay river strong rainy events caused the opening of the dam spillways of the upstream reservoirs releasing a massive amount of nutrients into the estuary 72 the presence of phosphates in la plata estuarine ecosystem has been studied through sediment analysis 73 and through monitoring phytoplankton species as bioindicators 15 that latter strategy was used previously to monitor the quality of the lujÃ¡n river an urban stream that borders the northern part of buenos aires 74 in the inner part of la plata estuary the major source of n and p pollution is the metropolitan region of buenos aires there is a small fraction of nitrogen pollution that is due to the contribution of aerial deposition in the water 75 a significant fraction of nitrogen and phosphorous pollution up to 20 comes from the direct discharge of untreated wastewater in coastal areas but the main source of pollution are the urban rivers of buenos aires more than 80 of total nitrogen and total phosphorous present in the waters of the inner part of the estuary come from them 76 4 the urban rivers and sewerage system of buenos aires the urban rivers of the metropolitan region of buenos aires are polluted by the uncontrolled discharge of industrial wastewater and raw domestic wastewater the metropolitan region of buenos aires has four river basins two of them are particularly polluted the matanza riachuelo and the reconquista basins the matanza riachuelo river basin is considered as the most polluted river in south america it flows for 40 km across a very urbanized region to its mouth in the la plata estuary there are several industries on the banks of the river in particular slaughterhouses food processing industries and tanneries 77 heavy metals such as mercury and lead have been found in the river 78 irregular urbanization has stablished across the basin forming a number of neighborhoods that lack access to water supply and sewerage system as a consequence untreated human waste and sewage polluted the brooks that fed into the river the sewerage system is slowly being expanded to cover those irregular areas some studies have proposed small decentralized solutions to provide sanitation to those communities highlighting the opportunities that decentralized systems offer to recycle p and other nutrients 79 raw concentrated blackwater for instance is a good source for struvite production with p recovery rates exceeding 90 80 meanwhile the reconquista is the second most polluted river in argentina 81 its basin borders that of the matanza riachuelo heavy pollution of this river was already reported 20 years ago 82 and since then the conditions of its waters have been worsening currently parts of the river are dead as present anoxic stretches and damaged aquatic ecosystem 83 the reconquista flows to the lower course of the lujÃ¡n river through a series of waterworks and natural channels forming the interconnected reconquista lujÃ¡n basin untreated domestic wastewater is the main source of nutrients that pollute the region s urban rivers and consequently the inner part of la plata estuary as 41 of the population does not have access to the sewerage system 1 6 million m3 of raw domestic wastewater are discharged into urban rivers reaching the estuary without being treated 21 in addition stormwater runoff transports the organic load from urban surfaces to the shore and during extreme rainy events the sewerage system commonly gets overload causing spills of raw wastewater that end up in the urban rivers only a part of the wastewater that is collected and transported by the sewerage system undergoes proper treatment to neutralize the organic load of the effluent primary treatment of wastewater consists in screen and grit removal and it is followed by a secondary treatment that neutralizes the organic load and reduces the content of nutrients in buenos aires secondary treatment is only applied for the wastewater that is discharged in the region s urban rivers it is provided by 19 activated sludge plants that treat altogether 1 6 million m3 of wastewater per day traditionally the city had relied on the dilution capacity of the la plata estuary to discharge raw wastewater through sewers that went deeper into the river 84 that is still the destination of a significant part of the wastewater that is collected in the region s sewerage system back in 2006 the argentinian government and aysa the municipal water and wastewater utility set a plan to increase in 3 5 million the population with access to the sewerage system in the region 85 the plan kept relying in the dilution capacity of the la plata estuary by discharging more volume of raw wastewater through outfalls right before the outfalls two new facilities bicentenario and riachuelo would provide primary treatment to remove gross solids oils and sand from the wastewater the bicentenario facility was inaugurated in 2014 it serves 4 million people and has an average flow of 120 600 m3 h its effluent is diluted through the existing berazategui outfall which was enlarged from 2 5 km to 7 5 km the riachuelo plant is under construction and is to be inaugurated in 2021 it will serve 4 3 million people and treat an average flow of 97 200 m3 h a new 12 km outfall will discharge the effluent into la plata estuary through 34 diffusers the high extension of both the new and the existing outfalls 12 km and 7 5 km intends to preserve the water quality of the city s coastline it is noteworthy to mention that the intakes of two water treatment plants which produce drinkable water for most of the metropolitan region are located along that coastline fig 5 shows the four basins of the metropolitan region of buenos aires and the two outfalls that discharge the primary treated wastewater to the estuary in the uruguayan side of the estuary the solution that has been adopted in the metropolitan region of montevideo is similar of that of buenos aires a significant part of the wastewater generated in montevideo undergoes primary treatment and is then diluted in la plata estuary through an outfall the extension of that outfall is 2 5 km and a second one is currently under construction a characteristic of buenos aires metropolitan region is that the discharge of nutrients to the estuary is very concentrated in a few points 86 the berazategui outfall is by far the largest source of nutrient release the new riachuelo outfall will soon become the second source as intends to alleviate the load of berazategui outfall and most importantly to transport deep into the estuary all the nutrients and organic load that are currently released in the mouth of the matanza riachuelo river once completed that river mouth will only release 1 6 tons day of ammoniacal nitrogen and 0 6 tons day of phosphorous by 2021 the two outfalls will be releasing daily almost 84 tons of n and 34 tons of p following the reconquista lujÃ¡n basin appears as the second source of nutrients 25 tons day of n and 9 tons day of p the rest of the nutrient discharge from the metropolitan region correspond to coastal brooks which release altogether 28 tons day of n and 9 5 tons day of p fig 6 illustrates this situation the main source of nutrients are the outfalls of the primary treatment plants bicentenario inaugurated in 2014 and riachuelo planned for 2021 they are out of the scope of this work as practically all the nutrient recovery systems are planned for activated sludge plants that provide secondary treatment meanwhile 19 activated sludge plants are in operation in the metropolitan region nine of them are medium size plants treating 14 000 to 77 000 m3 of wastewater per day and two of them are very large 155 000 and 237 000 m3 day those activated sludge plants offer a good opportunity for the installation of modular nutrient recovery facilities table 1 shows the characteristics of these facilities the selected activated sludge plants account for a release of 12 62 ton day of n and 4 98 ton day of p the total amount of nutrients discharged into the region s water bodies is 146 0 ton day of n and 57 4 ton day of p 5 comparison method of options eleven activated sludge plants were selected according to their characteristics to potentially host nutrient recovery units four nutrient recovery options are considered for them option 1 struvite precipitation in the centrate line option 2 iex unit in the centrate line option 3 struvite precipitation in the centrate line iex unit to treat the secondary effluent that leaves the activated sludge plant as shown in fig 2 option 4 acidic leaching of was followed by struvite precipitation in the centrate line 5 1 efficiency in the removal of n and p for each option literature review and data from commercial systems were used to assess the potential of nutrient recovery for each option regarding option 1 there is a large quantity of information available for commercial systems that produce struvite granules and operate in large wastewater facilities worldwide the performance of those systems has been verified during past years offering reliable data regarding the yield of fertilizer product its average composition efficiency in the removal of p and operational expenses opex regarding option 2 the efficiency of p and n removal iex was estimated from the reviewed scientific literature and from the pilot plant in operation in cranfield uk 39 51 option 3 is a combination of the previous two struvite precipitation iex therefore it was considered the same efficiency as option 1 for the struvite precipitation unit and the same efficiency as option 2 for the iex unit however in this option the amount of p that can be removed by the iex unit decreases considerably the reason is that the iex unit treats the secondary effluent that leaves the facility which is a stream with only 15 of the initial p load much of the p content leaves the facility as was finally for the efficiency considered for option 4 it was taken as reference a pilot plant performing the stuttgart process 60 table 2 shows the efficiency in the removal of p and n for each of the four options 5 2 capital expenditures and operational expenses the four nutrient recovery options are compared with basis on their economic viability costs and potential revenues and their impact on the decrease of n and p discharged to the region water bodies capital expenditure capex and operational expenses opex for each option were calculated with base on data from previous studies 8 60 87 88 17 39 capex and opex estimates from those previous economic assessment were adapted to the local prices of equipment electric power chemicals and workforce the considered opex also include 2 5 of capex per year due to maintenance expenses in the appendices section at the end of the article it is detailed the requirements of equipment chemicals and energy considered for each option 5 3 potential revenues in the iex units n is recovered as ammonia solution while p is recovered as hap in the struvite precipitation units both n and p are recovered as struvite by adding mg it was considered a content of 5 wt in n and 14 wt in p in the struvite that average composition is based on state of the art systems as shown on table 3 a review of literature and of the local market allowed to set a realistic sale price for the fertilizer product in this study the sale price of struvite was estimated as 300 usd ton after local market research the sale price of struvite considered in previous economic assessment varies significantly from 55 usd ton in the netherlands 89 to 131 usd ton in south africa 8 150 usd ton in australia 88 and even 462 usd ton in india 90 as a reference the price of map monoammonium phosphate a fertilizer whose content of n and p doubles that of struvite was between 460 and 490 usd ton in the argentinian retail market 91 for iex units the sale price for hap was considered as 550 usd ton and that of ammonia solution was considered as 250 usd ton for hap it was considered as reference the local price of triple superphosphate cah4p2o8 or a 0 46 0 commercial fertilizer ammonia solution would lay in the market niche of foliar fertilizers competing with a 21 0 0 24s fertilizer another revenue stream would come from the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake which has a cost of 1 400 usd per ton that needs to be transported and dumped into the city s landfills a recovery unit with an efficiency of 30 in the removal of p from the raw wastewater stream reduces 10 the volume of dry sludge cake that is produced in the activated sludge plant for instance in option 1 the sale of struvite fertilizer would represent 82 of revenues while the rest 18 would be the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake 5 4 calculation of the decrease in the load of n and p that reach the estuary the amount of n and p recovered as fertilizer products was calculated by applying the efficiency in the removal for each option presented in table 2 to the load of n and p in the raw wastewater then it was assessed the impact on the load of nutrients that reach the estuary after upgrading the treatment plants with nutrient recovery facilities therefore it was necessary to determine the load of n and p in the raw wastewater as well as the load released in each discharge point presented in fig 6 data from the laboratory of hydraulics of the national institute of water of argentina ina was used to identify the discharge points along buenos aires shores and as a base to assess the amount of n released to the estuary 86 92 data from previous 2012 assessment was updated according to the current load of domestic wastewater processed by the municipal utility aysa which has increased substantially since that year 21 another key source was the water quality reports of the matanza riachuelo urban river 93 those reports are released each three months presenting the analytics of samples from the river and underground water in that basin and comprehensively cover the period 2016 onwards the load of p released to the estuary was more difficult to assess than in the case of n data regarding the concentration of p in the effluents that reach the estuary suggest a per capita production around 1 8 g p person day ina 2012 that value is consistent with the range of 1 7 2 1 g p person day commonly found in urban wastewater worldwide 17 35 39 60 94 assuming 1 8 g p person day the average concentration of p in buenos aires raw wastewater was calculated as 13 9 mg l that value is coherent with the ones found in literature which refer to concentrations of p in urban wastewaters between 4 0 and 16 0 mg l 95 6 results potential for nutrients recovery in buenos aires treatment plants 6 1 economic assessment of the four considered options table 4 shows for each option the calculated capex opex and potential revenues profit is calculated as revenue minus opex and is expressed in million usd per year all the four options are not profitable option 1 appears to be the least unfavorable of the four from an economic perspective in that option the production of struvite has opex of 1 125 usd ton and a revenue of 386 usd ton the sale of struvite fertilizer estimated as 300 usd ton represents 82 of that revenue the remaining 18 are the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake that needs to be dumped in the landfills meanwhile the opex in option 1 are shared as follows 75 chemicals 0 6 kg mgcl2 and 0 07 kg naoh per mÂ³centrate 16 electricity 0 35 kwh per mÂ³centrate and 9 maintenance option 1 would remain unprofitable for the current price of chemicals and electrical energy unless the sale price of struvite rises to usd 1039 ton the total expenditures totex are the capital cost capex plus the net present value of the operating cost opex for the life of the asset considering 3 5 interest rates and 30 years of project s life span the totex for option 1 are 103 9 m meanwhile the expected revenues for that life span would only be 30 7 m in net present value 6 2 impact on the discharge of n and p for each option for each of the four options it was quantified the amount of n and p that would be removed as fertilizers in the treatment plants then it was calculated the impact in the load of n and p that would be discharged in each basin and finally reach the estuary table 5 shows the results of that calculation for each option struvite precipitation in the centrate line option 1 achieves a high decrease in the p load that reaches the estuary if combined with acidic leaching of the sludge option 4 the removal of that pollutant is maximized however options 1 and 4 aren t effective in decreasing the amount of n that reaches the estuary meanwhile iex systems are effective in the decreasing the load of n option 2 and 3 the combination of struvite precipitation and iex systems option 3 achieves the highest decrease in the load of n and also a high decrease in the load of p option 3 would have a significative impact on the degree of eutrophication in the estuary and therefore seems the most convenient alternative from an environmental perspective 6 3 discussion of results the first remarkable result is the feasibility of implementing the four considered arrangements options 1 4 in the treatment facilities of the region from the existing activated sludge treatment plants 11 of them present characteristics that make them suitable for its upgrade with nutrient recovery units without the need for major alterations in their lay out they have a medium to large size ranging from 14 to 237 thousand m3 of processed wastewater per day only the two largest ones have anaerobic digesters all of them have a was treatment line that reduces the volume of the sludge mechanic means gravity and band belt thickeners centrifuges and produces a stream of concentrate sludge liquor centrate that process is suitable for the production of struvite granules from the centrate by adding magnesium in a crystallizer option 1 instead of the crystallizer an iex unit can be installed in the centrate line option 2 a combined option consisting in a struvite precipitator for the centrate line and an iex system for the secondary system option 3 is also feasible for the existing activated sludge facilities the amount of struvite than can be precipitated increases significantly by leaching the was with acid which releases more p to the centrate option 4 the acidic leaching of the sludge can also be combined with option 2 and option 3 which has not been considered in this study upgrading the selected treatment plants with nutrient recovery facilities can reduce the load of nutrients discharged to the inner part of la plata estuary the four considered options would decrease the total load of p that is discharged to the estuary by 3 7 4 8 it was found that options that only consider struvite precipitation produce a slight decrease in the total load of n that is discharged 0 5 0 7 achieving a highest removal of n can be reached by precipitating a high grade struvite or by the use of iex units with the use of iex units the discharge of n can decrease by around 8 options 2 and 3 offer a good removal of both n and p option 3 stands out has the one that would contribute the most to alleviating the eutrophication of the estuary the results of the economic assessment indicate that the four considered options lack of profitability particularly the options with iex present very high capex and opex up to now iex technology has not been implemented in large facilities previous studies have estimated a capex of 2 m usd for iex units that can complement activated sludge plants of 10 000 people equivalent 39 with base on that reference value the capex of the iex alternatives options 2 and 3 result to be around 20 times higher than the capex of options 1 and 4 in addition it was found that the prices of the required chemical inputs h2so4 naoh kcl are particularly high in the metropolitan region of buenos aires which weighs heavily on the opex for the iex units the recovery of the regenerants in iex units is critical to ensure economic feasibility as reduces both the costs of chemicals input and the disposal cost of the spent regenerant iex systems can reduce those costs by enhancing the clean up and reuse of the spent regenerant whilst recovering the nutrients another approach to minimize chemical inputs is electrifying the regeneration it reduces the input of strong acid and base as the resin ph sensitivity enables using more diluted solutions electro assisted regeneration focuses on producing electrochemically mild electrolytes ph 3 and ph 11 which are 100 1000 times less concentrated than typical regenerants 53 the options that precipitate struvite from the centrate are the least costly leaching the was to increase the production of struvite option 4 would improve the removal of p from 3 7 to 4 8 but at a very high cost opex would quadruple again due to the high local prices of the required chemical inputs mainly h2so4 therefore options 2 3 and 4 appear to be too expensive for the removal of nutrients they provide in comparison option 1 can provide an acceptable decrease in the load of nutrients that are discharged at an annual cost of 2 66 m usd revenues for that option only cover 38 5 of the opex the implementation of option 1 could only be justified by its environmental benefits that is the decrease in the load of nutrients discharged to the urban rivers that would alleviate eutrophication in option 1 0 76 tons day of n and 2 12 tons day of p would be removed from wastewater and captured in the form of struvite although that represents a small fraction of the total nutrients released to the estuary the impact would be notable in the river mouth of the heavily polluted riachuelo matanza as shown in table 6 it must be noticed that this study focused on the existing activated sludge plants that could be easily upgraded with nutrient recovery systems the two largest facilities in the region bicentenario and riachuelo provide only primary treatment to the wastewater and were left out of the assessment if those facilities were upgraded to activated sludge facilities and then equipped with struvite precipitation units such as in option 1 the amount of n and p released to the estuary would be further reduced by 4 1 and 28 8 respectively the content of p considered in the struvite granules was set in 14 wt for this study however there are crystallizing systems that produce struvite granules with a content of p of 28 wt crystalgreen and naskeo for example therefore the capture of p and consequent reduction of its discharge to water bodies could likely double by adopting crystallizing systems that produce struvite of higher grade the opex required to produce a higher grade struvite would likely double as well 8 in option 1 the considered treatment plants would produce 15 11 tons day of struvite granules it is fair to question how well that yield of struvite would integrate within the existing distribution channels for fertilizers and if the local market would be able to absorb that volume of product the production of struvite in the considered treatment plants would have a smallimpact on the local fertilizer s market to put it into perspective that amount of struvite would represent 2 1 of the consumption of phosphate fertilizers in the province of buenos aires 96 and 1 3 of the national production of phosphate fertilizers 34 regarding logistics the region presents unbeatable distribution channels for the commercialization of the product the metropolitan region of buenos aires is located in the epicenter of the market of fertilizers in the country the province of buenos aires accounts for 41 of argentina s fertilizers consumption and concentrates most of the industry of fertilizers of the nation 97 the ports of this region also concentrate most of the imports of fertilizers of the country regarding the marketability of the product struvite granules are unknown by local consumers however this type of fertilizer presents key characteristics in terms of size it is produced as powder granules or pellets and in composition which makes it very suitable for the local market struvite would be commercialized as a low grade form of phosphorus fertilizer competing with monoammonium phosphate map and diammonium phosphate dap map has a typical content of 11 n and 50 61 p whilst dap has typically 18 n and 46 p in contrast struvite fertilizers obtained from municipal wastewaters have 5 n and can achieve a content of 28 6 p more details on previous table 1 struvite fertilizers with higher contents of p would compete with the more concentrate and much more expensive map and dap in the market niche of phosphorous fertilizers that is a growing and profitable market in this agricultural country 34 phosphorous fertilizers are particularly suitable for soy whose cultivation has a huge importance in the economy of argentina 98 102 soy requires a fertilizer that is more concentrated in p and has less content of n as it has the capacity of synthesizing its own nitrogen from its symbiosis with rhizobacteria 99 meanwhile struvite fertilizers with lower contents of p could be enriched with p2o5 or blended with n urea and potassium k2o to achieve a more balanced n p k formula the blending of struvite with dap seems to increase the absorbance in agricultural soils resulting in a slow release effective fertilizer 100 struvite may also be blended with sulphur or calcium sources forming complex fertilizers if it is intended a np fertilizer that contains ca there is the possibility to adapt the nutrient recovery process to precipitate phosphate with ca instead of mg producing calcium phosphate dicalcium phosphate or hap besides the environmental benefits producing struvite from buenos aires wastewater would reduce the needs of importing raw materials ammonia rock phosphate and sulfuric acid that are required by the nation s chemical fertilizers industry or else importing finished phosphate fertilizers 7 conclusion the discharge of both raw and treated wastewaters from the metropolitan region of buenos aires is causing the eutrophication of the inner part of la plata estuary the recovery of nutrients from wastewater in the form of fertilizing products should be taken into consideration among the technical alternatives to combat that problem this metropolitan region presents 11 activated sludge plants that could be upgraded with nutrient recovery units that use struvite precipitation acidic leaching of the sludge or iex systems using those technologies insert well within the lay out of the existing facilities and can be combined in different options the four options considered in this work can decrease the total load of p that is discharged to the estuary by 3 7 4 8 options with iex showed more capacity of decreasing the discharge of n to the estuary around 8 when compared with options that only rely on struvite precipitation 0 5 0 7 the economic assessment indicated that for all the considered options recovering nutrients in the existing activated sludge plants would be unprofitable therefore the implementation of those nutrient recovery options could only be justified by the decrease in the load of nutrients discharged to the urban rivers of the four considered options the precipitation of struvite from the centrate was the least costly in that option potential revenues would only cover 38 5 of the opex producing net losses of 2 66 m per year for that cost the load of nutrients discharged to the inner part of la plata estuary would decrease by 0 5 n and 3 7 p however it was found that the decrease in nutrients would be significant in the river mouth of the riachuelo matanza where the load of p would be reduced by 42 5 that is interesting as this particular river is considered as the most polluted of south america and is heavily eutrophicated that potential environmental gain leaves room for discussing if struvite precipitation could be contemplated at least for the four activated sludge plants located in the basin of that river declaration of competing interest the

13587,in the metropolitan region of buenos aires the load of nutrients discharged to urban rivers and shores is producing a severe eutrophication problem in the estuary of la plata river that problem could be alleviated by recovering nitrogen n and phosphorus p through the production of fertilizer products in the existing activated sludge treatment plants four nutrient recovery options were considered struvite precipitation in the centrate line acidic leaching of the sludge followed by struvite precipitation of the centrate ion exchange in the centrate line and a combination of struvite precipitation in the centrate line plus an ion exchange unit to further polish the secondary effluent those options were compared with basis on their economic sustainability and their capacity to reduce the load of n and p discharged to the coastal waters and rivers the economic assessment indicated that producing fertilizer products in the existing facilities using the four considered options would be unprofitable in the best case which is struvite precipitation in the centrate line the potential revenues would only cover 38 5 of the operational expenses environmental benefits could justify that cost as in some urban rivers the load of p could be reduced by 42 5 by struvite precipitation regarding the load of nutrients that is discharged to the estuary the impact of the considered nutrient recovery options ranges from a decrease in 0 5 n and 3 7 p struvite precipitation to a decrease in 8 2 n and 4 4 p combination of struvite precipitation ion exchange keywords nutrient recovery phosphorous eutrophication struvite fertilizer wastewater 1 introduction 1 1 nutrient recovery from urban wastewater urban wastewater is nowadays regarded as a source of resources those can be recovered in the different processes that occur in a wastewater treatment facility during the primary treatment cellulose can be recovered with the use of some technologies in the form of bio composites 1 2 following the wastewater undergoes aerobic treatment where the organic matter degrades and an activated sludge is produced that sludge undergoes anaerobic digestion producing biogas which can be used to produce electricity or thermal energy to dry the resulting waste sludge that waste sludge is typically dumped in landfills but can be a source of valuable resources too some of these resources are polyhydroxyalkanoates phas which are a form of biodegradable polyesters 3 acetylsalicylic and salicylic acids 4 or bio char for soil amendment 5 meanwhile the secondary effluent that leaves a wastewater treatment plant can be used as reclaimed or recycled water for non drinkable purposes as an additional step the secondary effluent can undergo tertiary treatment which further reduces the content of phosphorus and nitrogen and even reach drinkable standards 6 103 phosphorus p and nitrogen n can also be recovered from wastewater and used as fertilizers both are essential nutrients for plant growing and urban wastewaters are rich on them particularly urine which contributes to 80 of the total load of n and 45 of the total load of p in wastewater 7 most of the nutrient recovery systems are intended for municipal facilities 8 although some proposals regard smaller units that use urine as input in buildings with source separation of urine from faeces 9 recovering n and p for agriculture reduces the need of industrial fertilizers whose production is energy intensive and depends on mineral resources those are natural gas in the case of n fertilizers and rock phosphate in the case of p fertilizers some countries that lack of those mineral resources have set as a priority the recovery of nutrients from wastewater such is the case of germany where p recovery is mandatory in wastewater treatment plants larger than 50 000 person equivalents since its sewage sludge ordinance of 2017 10 in addition recovering those nutrients from wastewater alleviates an important environmental problem that affects aquatic ecosystems around urban areas the discharge of wastewater with a high load of p and n causes the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae leading to the eutrophication of water bodies eutrophication causes oxygen depletion in water bodies generating hypoxia and even anoxia very low oxygen zones known as dead zones 11 12 eutrophication is an environmental challenge that threats urban rivers and coastal waters worldwide most large cities in south america present this problem where it is aggravated by uncontrolled urbanization that leads to the discharge of raw sewage into water bodies severe eutrophication has been reported in the metropolitan regions of bogota 13 lima 14 buenos aires 15 montevideo 16 sÃ£o paulo 17 and rio de janeiro 18 20 1 2 nutrient recovery from urban wastewater in argentina and brazil in argentina and brazil the recovery of nutrients from urban wastewater has been limited to the direct application of biosolid which is the sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants biosolid has some fertilizer properties and can be applied in agriculture soils pasture lands or tree plantations in argentina a recent norm fosters the sustainable use of biosolids from wastewater plants resolution 410 18 the metropolitan region of buenos aires dumps each year 4351 tons of waste sludge into the city s landfills and only reuses a very small fraction of that amount exclusively for landfill coverage 21 in brazil there has been extensive research regarding the direct application of sewage sludge in soils 22 29 however recent research has showed that sewage sludge generated in brazilian cities can contain heavy metals and other harmful pollutants that can affect soil and aquatic biota 28 30 two approaches have been proposed in the region to produce a fertilizer that is free of potential pollutants using wastewater the first one is the cultivation of microalgae in the anaerobically digested effluent 31 the algae biomass can be later dried up and used as an organic fertilizer the second one is the precipitation of salts containing p and n such as struvite those salts are produced in the form of granulated fertilizers that have a standardized composition and are free of potential soil pollutants heavy metals and other hazardous compounds don t precipitate and remain in the sludge which can be later disposed safely in appropriate landfills the production of struvite granules with a content of 5 wt n and 14 wt p has been proposed for sÃ£o paulo metropolitan region that city which is the largest of the americas could produce 38 tons day of struvite from its main wastewater facilities and consequently reduce the load of phosphorus reaching its urban rivers by 5 3 tons day 17 struvite crystallizer units can be easily applied to the most common type of wastewater facilities in south america the activated sludge plants it uses a technology whose efficiency has been proven worldwide 32 33 although it has not yet been implemented in south america this research focuses on the opportunities that the sewerage system of buenos aires presents for this technology this metropolitan region 17 5 million inhabitants provides a significant concentration of domestic wastewater in large treatment facilities the region also has a well stablished local market for fertilizers any struvite fertilizer produced in those facilities would be easily marketed as there is a deficit of fertilizers in this agricultural country in particular argentina imports 76 of all the phosphatic fertilizers that consumes 34 the production of struvite fertilizer in buenos aires seems as a promising option to alleviate the eutrophication in the region s urban rivers and coastal waters the potential of this technology in the region deserves a detailed discussion that should consider environmental benefits technical feasibility and economic viability 1 3 content of this study this work assesses the applicability of technologies that recover nutrients from wastewater in the metropolitan region of buenos aires the objective is to 1 explore the technological options that would allow the existing wastewater facilities in the region to remove nutrients in the form of fertilizing products 2 select a set of technological options that best suits the characteristics of the region s treatment facilities 3 assess the economic sustainability of upgrading the existing facilities with nutrient recovery units for each of the selected options 4 quantify the potential impact that each technological option would cause in the coastal waters and rivers measured by the reduction in the load of p and n discharged to them section 2 presents a review of the available nutrient recovery alternatives for urban wastewater the processes that are reviewed are able to recover p and n from waste liquid streams digested sludge and sludge ashes in activated sludge plants section 3 contextualizes the study by presenting the problematic caused by the excessive release of nutrients to the la plata river estuary which is the final receiver of the region s wastewaters in section 4 this study addresses the characteristics of the sewerage system in the region to select those existing activated sludge facilities that could be upgraded with nutrient recovery units section 5 details the four technological options that are considered and the methods for the calculations section 6 presents the results of both the economic assessment and the impact on the discharge of n and p and discusses the most suitable option according to the results 2 technologies for the recovery of n and p municipal wastewaters are rich in nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k due to the high content of organic matter in addition to organic matter soaps and detergents can also be a source of n and p the average load in raw household wastewater has been estimated as 13 5 g n 2 1 g p and 4 0 g k per person per day 35 anaerobic and aerobic treatments of wastewater allow microorganisms to degrade the organic matter the n is converted into ammonia nh4 n while phosphate po4 3 is largely converted into orthophosphate the dominant forms of orthophosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 at the initial stages of the wastewater treatment process in which ph remains at a range around 7 as the ph increases in further treatment stages hpo4 2 becomes the dominant form of orthophosphate 2 1 precipitation of phosphate phosphate can precipitate in the form of struvite with mg or in the form of other salts by adding al ca or fe the removal of n and p from wastewater by adding mg ca and fe in fluidified bed stirred or aerated reactors has been tested in large treatment plants showing up as an economically viable and robust technology 36 38 through the addition of ca to the wastewater p can be recovered as calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 and hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh as shown in the following reactions 3ca2 2po4 3 ca3 po4 2 calcium phosphate h3po4 ca oh 2 cahpo4 dicalcium phosphate 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh hydroxyapatite hap ca can be added as hydrated lime at a ca p ratio of 2 39 meanwhile fe can be added before anaerobic fermentation at a fe p molar ratio of 1 5 40 to recover as vivianite fe2 2po4 3 fe 3 po4 2 8h2o vivianite the addition of fe is an efficient way to remove p from the sludge with removal rates as high as 82 6 from waste activated sludge was in anaerobic reactors 40 the precipitation of p with mg occurs naturally in most wastewater facilities and deserves special attention orthophosphate reacts with ammonia and magnesium ions to form magnesium ammonium phosphate map known as struvite mg2 nh4 po4 3 nh4 mg po4 6h2o struvite orthophosphate can also react with potassium instead of ammonium in that case potassium replaces ammonium in the struvite crystal lattice forming magnesium potassium phosphate mpp mg2 k po4 3 mgkpo4 6h2o potassium struvite struvite deposition in pipes and aerators is a common problem in wastewater plants particularly in those regions where water is hard and as a consequence there is a high content of magnesium in the wastewater struvite scale formation must be inhibited in order to prevent operational issues that is typically done though the injection of chemicals which increases the operational costs of treatment facilities instead the precipitation of the struvite can be fostered inside a fluidified bed or stirred reactor where it can be easily removed the struvite crystals that precipitate in the reactor are a concentrated and homogeneous source of n and p and have a commercial value as a fertilizer thus the controlled precipitation of struvite in a reactor brings a double benefit it avoids the unwanted scale formation in pipes and at the same time produces valuable fertilizer any liquid stream containing phosphate can be a suitable input for a struvite crystallizer the most common ones are municipal wastewater and effluents from food processing plants and pig farms 41 from the total p carried in the raw wastewater that enters a municipal treatment facility 80 of it is carried by the was stream while 10 of it is carried in the sludge that leaves the primary clarifiers 42 therefore both streams are critical for any p recovering process the majority of struvite crystallizing systems focus on the was stream first was undergoes anaerobic digestion where some struvite formation can occur depending on the hardness of the water magnesium content then the digested was typically undergoes thickening and dewatering in those two latter stages the dewatering sludge liquors are produced thickening produces liquor from the output of centrifuges and the supernatant of gravity thickening vessels the final dewatering of digested sludges is generally performed in a filter press and produces a liquor named filtrate or centrate those sludge liquors combined or not with the one from the primary clarifiers constitute the p rich input stream for the struvite crystallizing reactor other systems such as the airprex airlift reactor are installed between the anaerobic digester and the dewatering equipment but most of them use sludge dewatering liquors some commercial systems such as the veolia irstea s opalix system performs heavy metal adsorption in the sludge liquor before it enters the struvite crystallizer in order to avoid the presence of those substances in the final fertilizer product once in the struvite crystallizing reactor an external source of mg is provided mgcl2 mgo or mg oh 2 which is cheaper and also raises the ph the crystallization occurs at a ph range of 7 11 in order to raise the ph and promote the precipitation of struvite some systems add sodium hydroxide naoh 43 whilst others use air stripping of dissolved carbon dioxide from the sludge or instead vacuum degassing elovac in the elophos system the crystalline struvite drills grow for several days in the reactor until they reach the desired size then the granules are separated from the effluent which is easy as struvite has a 1 7 specific density the harvested granules are dried and stocked in silos ready to be commercialized as fertilizer after the precipitation of p and n as struvite the effluent that leaves the reactor is conducted back to the process this return liquor has a low p and n content and can be recirculated to the was digesters as in fig 1 or else to the primary clarifiers as in fig 2 figs 1 and 2 illustrate the two main arrangements for inserting a struvite crystallizing system within an activated sludge plant 2 2 ion exchange iex processes ion exchange iex is the process of reciprocal transfer of ions between a solution and a resin ammonia and phosphate are selectively removed from the wastewater with specific iex resin iex resins containing hydrous ferric oxide have a good selectivity for phosphate 44 other interesting selective sorbents of p are iron doped zeolites 45 46 and resins based on zirconium and lanthanum 47 the interaction mechanisms between the phosphate and sorbent are categorized as hydrogen bonding shape complementarity and inner sphere complexation based on those interaction mechanisms the key physicochemical properties of a sorption material to achieve a high phosphate selectivity regard its difference with phosphate in acid base properties geometric shapes and metal complexing abilities 48 meanwhile ammonia can be removed from aqueous solutions through various adsorbent materials such as bentonite zeolite clay biochar activated carbon or metal organic framework 107 cation exchange resins of the sulfonated polystyrene type have also proven to be effective in removing ammonia from synthetic and real wastewaters 108 110 in iex processes zeolites have received significant attention as are very effective in removing ammonia from wastewaters 49 50 zeolite minerals have the ability to hydrate dehydrate reversibly and to exchange some of their constituent cations with aqueous solutions both without a major change in structure 111 the structure of zeolites is characterized by a framework of linked tetrahedra each consisting of four oxygen atoms surrounding a silicon or aluminum cation this three dimensional network has open cavities in the forms of channels and cages which can lodge water molecules as well as non framework cations such as na ca2 k and mg2 that can be exchanged with the surrounding solution if the solution is rich in ammonium nh4 n is exchanged with the cations present in the framework the exchange capacity of the zeolite depends on the negative charge of its framework structure due to si al ratio as well as size concentration and charge of the exchange ions 113 natural zeolite clinoptilolite is one of the most used ion exchange media for ammonium removal in aqueous solutions 108 112 meanwhile mesolite a synthetically produced zeolite has been gaining traction as an effective ammonium adsorber in digested sludge liquors 114 the better performance of mesolite and other synthetic zeolites is attributed to the increased consistency si al ratios of 1 1 defining a high cation exchange capacity 113 pabalan and bertetti 111 reported adsorption values of 4 6 and 4 9 meq g for mesolite compared with 2 0 meq g for clinoptilolite for solutions with the same initial concentration of nh4 n in an iex process the transfer capacity of the resin is regularly restored by regeneration solutions where the n and p accumulate those nutrients are then removed from the regenerants with an ammonia stripper or through a combined precipitation and filtration process the regenerant solution can be reused multiple times which helps to make economically viable the process iex nutrient recovery processes are not yet being implemented in large wastewater treatment plants however a small iex unit is being commissioned at a municipal facility in cranfield uk 39 51 that unit is projected to remove n with mesolite media and p with hybrid ion exchange resin haix containing ferric oxide nanoparticles the final stage of the iex process at cranfield is the recovery of the nutrients that have been adsorbed by the media n is recovered as ammonium sulfate through a liquid liquid membrane process in a hollow fiber membrane chamber hfmc whilst p is precipitated as hap hydroxyapatite fig 3 illustrates the process flow chart of an iex unit showing the continuous flow of effluent passing through the mesolite media first and then through the hiax as well as the batch processes that regenerate the iex resin and recover the nutrients another application for such iex process is the pre treatment of impaired water before its filtration with reverse osmose membranes as proposed by dong et al 52 that configuration consists in three types of ion exchangers first a polystyrene strong base anion exchanger pssba that removes hydrophobic ionizable organic compounds followed by a shallow shell weak acid cation exchanger sswac that decreases ph and finally a hybrid anion exchanger haix for p recovery similar as the one illustrated in fig 3 an iex nutrient recovery unit can be inserted in the centrate line or else after the wastewater treatment plant treating the final effluent that leaves the facility if inserted after an activated sludge plant the iex unit can polish the effluent to ultra low levels of n and p to avoid eutrophication effluents with concentrations of 11 mg l nh4 n and 3 2 mg l po4 p can be lowered to less than 1 mg l nh4 n and 0 5 mg l po4 p 39 53 2 3 sludge treatments to release n and p to the liquid fraction any system that recovers nutrients from wastewater sludge can be enhanced with the addition of a specific unit that maximizes the amount of p and n released to the liquid fraction of the sludge more p and n available in the sludge liquors means more potential production of precipitated salts such as struvite and therefore a higher recovery rate of nutrients such unit acts as a pre treatment stage before the digestion and further thickening and dewatering of the sludges it can perform biological thermal or chemical treatments to release p and n from the primary sludge or the was the most prominent of these treatments are thermal pressure hydrolysis thp stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms bio acidification of sludge thp combines high pressure boiling followed by a rapid decompression its main objective is acting as a pre treatment stage that sterilizes the sludge and makes it more biodegradable thus improving the performance of the anaerobic digestion that follows 54 however it also increases the concentration of phosphate and ammonium in the centrate water obtained after the digestion of the sludge another option to enhance nutrient recovery systems is the use of stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms those microorganisms release p from the sludge as consume vfas volatile fat acids from organic matter 55 a retention time of around 10 h in the tank is enough to release much of the p to the liquid fraction of the sludge 70 in the case of ostara s wasstrip 56 and 50 in the case of the scepphar process 57 another treatment to release p from the was and produce a p rich liquor consists in the bio acidification of the sludge to solubilize phosphorus that bio acidification can be performed by adding easily degradable carbohydrate source under anaerobic conditions 58 an example of such treatment is veolia irstea s metaphos process in operation in a wastewater treatment plant in lille france 2 4 acidic leaching of the digested sludge and sludge ashes as discussed above n and p can be recovered from the liquid fraction of sludge liquors by precipitating salts such as struvite hap map or vivianite or else through iex processes that recovery can be maximized with the use of sludge treatments that release n and p to the liquid fraction however there is another technological alternative that instead of focusing on the liquid fraction of the sludge aims the recovery of p from the dried sludge that remains after the dewatering of digested was that alternative is the leaching of the digested sludge with the use of acid or base which solubilizes the p that is fixed in the solid sludge phase the p that is dissolved into the leach can then be recovered from the supernatant after liquid solid separation after the filtration adding mg to the p rich supernatant can allow the recovery of p as struvite the recovery rates of p are higher than 90 59 to 95 60 the efficiency of p recovery depends on several factors such as sludge composition type and concentration of the leaching agent ph and contact time 61 the dissolution of the chemically and or biologically bound p is superior at strong acidic conditions semerci et al 62 achieved a dissolution of p of 91 1 from dried sludge by using hcl whilst when using naoh the dissolution of p was 60 3 the p released from the sludge follows different mechanisms in acidic and alkaline leaching in the acidic ph range first the chemically bound p is released into solution and then the biologically bound p is dissolved while in the alkaline range it is the opposite 59 it is noticeable that during the acidic leaching process metal phosphates and other metal compounds dissociate so the solution contains metal ions mostly fe al ca and mg ions and depending on the leaching ph even heavy metal ions such as cu zn pb ni cd cr 60 the precipitation of these metal ions must be avoided to obtain a high quality struvite product citric acid forms a stable complex with the metal ions that stays in the solution in processes such as the stuttgart process 60 citric acid is added in the struvite precipitation chamber together with mgo and with naoh to raise the ph a pilot scale plant following the stuttgart process that uses sulfuric acid for the leaching of digested sludge has achieved 90 of p removal efficiency the opex of the plant is 24 usd per kg of p recovered as struvite 60 acidic leaching can also be applied to the ashes that result from incinerating the dry cake of sludge that sludge cake is produced in the mechanical dewatering of the was the sludge cake must be transported and dumped in landfills which is costly so in order to further reduce its volume some wastewater treatment plants use thermal processes to reduce it to ashes sludge ashes are mainly composed of five elements p ca fe al and si in the form of oxides and other inorganic forms in almost all ash leaching processes the recovery rate of p is higher than 70 and reaches 95 in some of them ashdec 63 the output of processes such as ashdec leachphos and mephrec has a p content between 5 and 20 making them suitable as fertilizer products however the acidic leaching of incinerated sludge also leads to high heavy metal co extraction 64 therefore systems that capture heavy metals from the ashes through adsorption or any other mean would be necessary to preserve the quality of the final fertilizer product 3 eutrophication of rio de la plata estuary the rio de la plata is the estuary formed by the confluence of the uruguay and the paranÃ¡ rivers from that confluence the river forms a 290 km long bay that widens progressively to 220 km until reaching the south atlantic ocean the estuary drains the second largest river basin of south america carrying an enormous amount of sediments that make the waters look naturally brown as can be observed in fig 4 their coasts comprehend the most densely populated areas of uruguay and argentina buenos aires the capital city of argentina is located in the southern shore while montevideo the capital city of uruguay is located in the opposite shore the metropolitan region of buenos aires has 17 5 million people which turns it the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the americas its main source of drinking water is the inner part of la plata estuary particularly 86 of the city s water supply depends on only two water treatment plants whose intake is located at 1 8 km and 2 5 km offshore therefore the region s water supply is very sensitive to the pollution of the city s shores and urban rivers which discharge all in the estuary the brackish area harbors sandy beaches that provide ecosystem services mainly associated with fishing recreation leisure and tourism coastal deterioration pollution and overfishing are main threats that need to be more strictly regulated to maintain both the health status and functional ecosystem services 65 buenos aires has municipal laws that ban swimming in its beaches due to water quality concerns from dates as early as 1975 66 meanwhile in the opposite shore of the river montevideo managed to improve the water quality of its shores and nowadays its beaches are one of the region s main tourist attractions the main beaches are subjected to continuous monitoring however consistent data reveals that all the coastal waters of montevideo are subjected to some degree of eutrophication with average concentrations of total phosphorous and total nitrogen higher than 0 075 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively 67 69 16 one of the causes of the eutrophication of the uruguayan coast of the estuary is its low capacity to dilute nutrients 70 nitrogen and phosphorus are the two nutrients that have a key role in the formation of cyanobacterial blooms events of bloom forming cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins have become increasingly frequent and raised concerns in the population of the estuary 71 the last one happened in summer 2019 lasting 3 months and causing the closure of montevideo s beaches a detailed assessment identified the source of this bloom in the uruguay river strong rainy events caused the opening of the dam spillways of the upstream reservoirs releasing a massive amount of nutrients into the estuary 72 the presence of phosphates in la plata estuarine ecosystem has been studied through sediment analysis 73 and through monitoring phytoplankton species as bioindicators 15 that latter strategy was used previously to monitor the quality of the lujÃ¡n river an urban stream that borders the northern part of buenos aires 74 in the inner part of la plata estuary the major source of n and p pollution is the metropolitan region of buenos aires there is a small fraction of nitrogen pollution that is due to the contribution of aerial deposition in the water 75 a significant fraction of nitrogen and phosphorous pollution up to 20 comes from the direct discharge of untreated wastewater in coastal areas but the main source of pollution are the urban rivers of buenos aires more than 80 of total nitrogen and total phosphorous present in the waters of the inner part of the estuary come from them 76 4 the urban rivers and sewerage system of buenos aires the urban rivers of the metropolitan region of buenos aires are polluted by the uncontrolled discharge of industrial wastewater and raw domestic wastewater the metropolitan region of buenos aires has four river basins two of them are particularly polluted the matanza riachuelo and the reconquista basins the matanza riachuelo river basin is considered as the most polluted river in south america it flows for 40 km across a very urbanized region to its mouth in the la plata estuary there are several industries on the banks of the river in particular slaughterhouses food processing industries and tanneries 77 heavy metals such as mercury and lead have been found in the river 78 irregular urbanization has stablished across the basin forming a number of neighborhoods that lack access to water supply and sewerage system as a consequence untreated human waste and sewage polluted the brooks that fed into the river the sewerage system is slowly being expanded to cover those irregular areas some studies have proposed small decentralized solutions to provide sanitation to those communities highlighting the opportunities that decentralized systems offer to recycle p and other nutrients 79 raw concentrated blackwater for instance is a good source for struvite production with p recovery rates exceeding 90 80 meanwhile the reconquista is the second most polluted river in argentina 81 its basin borders that of the matanza riachuelo heavy pollution of this river was already reported 20 years ago 82 and since then the conditions of its waters have been worsening currently parts of the river are dead as present anoxic stretches and damaged aquatic ecosystem 83 the reconquista flows to the lower course of the lujÃ¡n river through a series of waterworks and natural channels forming the interconnected reconquista lujÃ¡n basin untreated domestic wastewater is the main source of nutrients that pollute the region s urban rivers and consequently the inner part of la plata estuary as 41 of the population does not have access to the sewerage system 1 6 million m3 of raw domestic wastewater are discharged into urban rivers reaching the estuary without being treated 21 in addition stormwater runoff transports the organic load from urban surfaces to the shore and during extreme rainy events the sewerage system commonly gets overload causing spills of raw wastewater that end up in the urban rivers only a part of the wastewater that is collected and transported by the sewerage system undergoes proper treatment to neutralize the organic load of the effluent primary treatment of wastewater consists in screen and grit removal and it is followed by a secondary treatment that neutralizes the organic load and reduces the content of nutrients in buenos aires secondary treatment is only applied for the wastewater that is discharged in the region s urban rivers it is provided by 19 activated sludge plants that treat altogether 1 6 million m3 of wastewater per day traditionally the city had relied on the dilution capacity of the la plata estuary to discharge raw wastewater through sewers that went deeper into the river 84 that is still the destination of a significant part of the wastewater that is collected in the region s sewerage system back in 2006 the argentinian government and aysa the municipal water and wastewater utility set a plan to increase in 3 5 million the population with access to the sewerage system in the region 85 the plan kept relying in the dilution capacity of the la plata estuary by discharging more volume of raw wastewater through outfalls right before the outfalls two new facilities bicentenario and riachuelo would provide primary treatment to remove gross solids oils and sand from the wastewater the bicentenario facility was inaugurated in 2014 it serves 4 million people and has an average flow of 120 600 m3 h its effluent is diluted through the existing berazategui outfall which was enlarged from 2 5 km to 7 5 km the riachuelo plant is under construction and is to be inaugurated in 2021 it will serve 4 3 million people and treat an average flow of 97 200 m3 h a new 12 km outfall will discharge the effluent into la plata estuary through 34 diffusers the high extension of both the new and the existing outfalls 12 km and 7 5 km intends to preserve the water quality of the city s coastline it is noteworthy to mention that the intakes of two water treatment plants which produce drinkable water for most of the metropolitan region are located along that coastline fig 5 shows the four basins of the metropolitan region of buenos aires and the two outfalls that discharge the primary treated wastewater to the estuary in the uruguayan side of the estuary the solution that has been adopted in the metropolitan region of montevideo is similar of that of buenos aires a significant part of the wastewater generated in montevideo undergoes primary treatment and is then diluted in la plata estuary through an outfall the extension of that outfall is 2 5 km and a second one is currently under construction a characteristic of buenos aires metropolitan region is that the discharge of nutrients to the estuary is very concentrated in a few points 86 the berazategui outfall is by far the largest source of nutrient release the new riachuelo outfall will soon become the second source as intends to alleviate the load of berazategui outfall and most importantly to transport deep into the estuary all the nutrients and organic load that are currently released in the mouth of the matanza riachuelo river once completed that river mouth will only release 1 6 tons day of ammoniacal nitrogen and 0 6 tons day of phosphorous by 2021 the two outfalls will be releasing daily almost 84 tons of n and 34 tons of p following the reconquista lujÃ¡n basin appears as the second source of nutrients 25 tons day of n and 9 tons day of p the rest of the nutrient discharge from the metropolitan region correspond to coastal brooks which release altogether 28 tons day of n and 9 5 tons day of p fig 6 illustrates this situation the main source of nutrients are the outfalls of the primary treatment plants bicentenario inaugurated in 2014 and riachuelo planned for 2021 they are out of the scope of this work as practically all the nutrient recovery systems are planned for activated sludge plants that provide secondary treatment meanwhile 19 activated sludge plants are in operation in the metropolitan region nine of them are medium size plants treating 14 000 to 77 000 m3 of wastewater per day and two of them are very large 155 000 and 237 000 m3 day those activated sludge plants offer a good opportunity for the installation of modular nutrient recovery facilities table 1 shows the characteristics of these facilities the selected activated sludge plants account for a release of 12 62 ton day of n and 4 98 ton day of p the total amount of nutrients discharged into the region s water bodies is 146 0 ton day of n and 57 4 ton day of p 5 comparison method of options eleven activated sludge plants were selected according to their characteristics to potentially host nutrient recovery units four nutrient recovery options are considered for them option 1 struvite precipitation in the centrate line option 2 iex unit in the centrate line option 3 struvite precipitation in the centrate line iex unit to treat the secondary effluent that leaves the activated sludge plant as shown in fig 2 option 4 acidic leaching of was followed by struvite precipitation in the centrate line 5 1 efficiency in the removal of n and p for each option literature review and data from commercial systems were used to assess the potential of nutrient recovery for each option regarding option 1 there is a large quantity of information available for commercial systems that produce struvite granules and operate in large wastewater facilities worldwide the performance of those systems has been verified during past years offering reliable data regarding the yield of fertilizer product its average composition efficiency in the removal of p and operational expenses opex regarding option 2 the efficiency of p and n removal iex was estimated from the reviewed scientific literature and from the pilot plant in operation in cranfield uk 39 51 option 3 is a combination of the previous two struvite precipitation iex therefore it was considered the same efficiency as option 1 for the struvite precipitation unit and the same efficiency as option 2 for the iex unit however in this option the amount of p that can be removed by the iex unit decreases considerably the reason is that the iex unit treats the secondary effluent that leaves the facility which is a stream with only 15 of the initial p load much of the p content leaves the facility as was finally for the efficiency considered for option 4 it was taken as reference a pilot plant performing the stuttgart process 60 table 2 shows the efficiency in the removal of p and n for each of the four options 5 2 capital expenditures and operational expenses the four nutrient recovery options are compared with basis on their economic viability costs and potential revenues and their impact on the decrease of n and p discharged to the region water bodies capital expenditure capex and operational expenses opex for each option were calculated with base on data from previous studies 8 60 87 88 17 39 capex and opex estimates from those previous economic assessment were adapted to the local prices of equipment electric power chemicals and workforce the considered opex also include 2 5 of capex per year due to maintenance expenses in the appendices section at the end of the article it is detailed the requirements of equipment chemicals and energy considered for each option 5 3 potential revenues in the iex units n is recovered as ammonia solution while p is recovered as hap in the struvite precipitation units both n and p are recovered as struvite by adding mg it was considered a content of 5 wt in n and 14 wt in p in the struvite that average composition is based on state of the art systems as shown on table 3 a review of literature and of the local market allowed to set a realistic sale price for the fertilizer product in this study the sale price of struvite was estimated as 300 usd ton after local market research the sale price of struvite considered in previous economic assessment varies significantly from 55 usd ton in the netherlands 89 to 131 usd ton in south africa 8 150 usd ton in australia 88 and even 462 usd ton in india 90 as a reference the price of map monoammonium phosphate a fertilizer whose content of n and p doubles that of struvite was between 460 and 490 usd ton in the argentinian retail market 91 for iex units the sale price for hap was considered as 550 usd ton and that of ammonia solution was considered as 250 usd ton for hap it was considered as reference the local price of triple superphosphate cah4p2o8 or a 0 46 0 commercial fertilizer ammonia solution would lay in the market niche of foliar fertilizers competing with a 21 0 0 24s fertilizer another revenue stream would come from the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake which has a cost of 1 400 usd per ton that needs to be transported and dumped into the city s landfills a recovery unit with an efficiency of 30 in the removal of p from the raw wastewater stream reduces 10 the volume of dry sludge cake that is produced in the activated sludge plant for instance in option 1 the sale of struvite fertilizer would represent 82 of revenues while the rest 18 would be the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake 5 4 calculation of the decrease in the load of n and p that reach the estuary the amount of n and p recovered as fertilizer products was calculated by applying the efficiency in the removal for each option presented in table 2 to the load of n and p in the raw wastewater then it was assessed the impact on the load of nutrients that reach the estuary after upgrading the treatment plants with nutrient recovery facilities therefore it was necessary to determine the load of n and p in the raw wastewater as well as the load released in each discharge point presented in fig 6 data from the laboratory of hydraulics of the national institute of water of argentina ina was used to identify the discharge points along buenos aires shores and as a base to assess the amount of n released to the estuary 86 92 data from previous 2012 assessment was updated according to the current load of domestic wastewater processed by the municipal utility aysa which has increased substantially since that year 21 another key source was the water quality reports of the matanza riachuelo urban river 93 those reports are released each three months presenting the analytics of samples from the river and underground water in that basin and comprehensively cover the period 2016 onwards the load of p released to the estuary was more difficult to assess than in the case of n data regarding the concentration of p in the effluents that reach the estuary suggest a per capita production around 1 8 g p person day ina 2012 that value is consistent with the range of 1 7 2 1 g p person day commonly found in urban wastewater worldwide 17 35 39 60 94 assuming 1 8 g p person day the average concentration of p in buenos aires raw wastewater was calculated as 13 9 mg l that value is coherent with the ones found in literature which refer to concentrations of p in urban wastewaters between 4 0 and 16 0 mg l 95 6 results potential for nutrients recovery in buenos aires treatment plants 6 1 economic assessment of the four considered options table 4 shows for each option the calculated capex opex and potential revenues profit is calculated as revenue minus opex and is expressed in million usd per year all the four options are not profitable option 1 appears to be the least unfavorable of the four from an economic perspective in that option the production of struvite has opex of 1 125 usd ton and a revenue of 386 usd ton the sale of struvite fertilizer estimated as 300 usd ton represents 82 of that revenue the remaining 18 are the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried sludge cake that needs to be dumped in the landfills meanwhile the opex in option 1 are shared as follows 75 chemicals 0 6 kg mgcl2 and 0 07 kg naoh per mÂ³centrate 16 electricity 0 35 kwh per mÂ³centrate and 9 maintenance option 1 would remain unprofitable for the current price of chemicals and electrical energy unless the sale price of struvite rises to usd 1039 ton the total expenditures totex are the capital cost capex plus the net present value of the operating cost opex for the life of the asset considering 3 5 interest rates and 30 years of project s life span the totex for option 1 are 103 9 m meanwhile the expected revenues for that life span would only be 30 7 m in net present value 6 2 impact on the discharge of n and p for each option for each of the four options it was quantified the amount of n and p that would be removed as fertilizers in the treatment plants then it was calculated the impact in the load of n and p that would be discharged in each basin and finally reach the estuary table 5 shows the results of that calculation for each option struvite precipitation in the centrate line option 1 achieves a high decrease in the p load that reaches the estuary if combined with acidic leaching of the sludge option 4 the removal of that pollutant is maximized however options 1 and 4 aren t effective in decreasing the amount of n that reaches the estuary meanwhile iex systems are effective in the decreasing the load of n option 2 and 3 the combination of struvite precipitation and iex systems option 3 achieves the highest decrease in the load of n and also a high decrease in the load of p option 3 would have a significative impact on the degree of eutrophication in the estuary and therefore seems the most convenient alternative from an environmental perspective 6 3 discussion of results the first remarkable result is the feasibility of implementing the four considered arrangements options 1 4 in the treatment facilities of the region from the existing activated sludge treatment plants 11 of them present characteristics that make them suitable for its upgrade with nutrient recovery units without the need for major alterations in their lay out they have a medium to large size ranging from 14 to 237 thousand m3 of processed wastewater per day only the two largest ones have anaerobic digesters all of them have a was treatment line that reduces the volume of the sludge mechanic means gravity and band belt thickeners centrifuges and produces a stream of concentrate sludge liquor centrate that process is suitable for the production of struvite granules from the centrate by adding magnesium in a crystallizer option 1 instead of the crystallizer an iex unit can be installed in the centrate line option 2 a combined option consisting in a struvite precipitator for the centrate line and an iex system for the secondary system option 3 is also feasible for the existing activated sludge facilities the amount of struvite than can be precipitated increases significantly by leaching the was with acid which releases more p to the centrate option 4 the acidic leaching of the sludge can also be combined with option 2 and option 3 which has not been considered in this study upgrading the selected treatment plants with nutrient recovery facilities can reduce the load of nutrients discharged to the inner part of la plata estuary the four considered options would decrease the total load of p that is discharged to the estuary by 3 7 4 8 it was found that options that only consider struvite precipitation produce a slight decrease in the total load of n that is discharged 0 5 0 7 achieving a highest removal of n can be reached by precipitating a high grade struvite or by the use of iex units with the use of iex units the discharge of n can decrease by around 8 options 2 and 3 offer a good removal of both n and p option 3 stands out has the one that would contribute the most to alleviating the eutrophication of the estuary the results of the economic assessment indicate that the four considered options lack of profitability particularly the options with iex present very high capex and opex up to now iex technology has not been implemented in large facilities previous studies have estimated a capex of 2 m usd for iex units that can complement activated sludge plants of 10 000 people equivalent 39 with base on that reference value the capex of the iex alternatives options 2 and 3 result to be around 20 times higher than the capex of options 1 and 4 in addition it was found that the prices of the required chemical inputs h2so4 naoh kcl are particularly high in the metropolitan region of buenos aires which weighs heavily on the opex for the iex units the recovery of the regenerants in iex units is critical to ensure economic feasibility as reduces both the costs of chemicals input and the disposal cost of the spent regenerant iex systems can reduce those costs by enhancing the clean up and reuse of the spent regenerant whilst recovering the nutrients another approach to minimize chemical inputs is electrifying the regeneration it reduces the input of strong acid and base as the resin ph sensitivity enables using more diluted solutions electro assisted regeneration focuses on producing electrochemically mild electrolytes ph 3 and ph 11 which are 100 1000 times less concentrated than typical regenerants 53 the options that precipitate struvite from the centrate are the least costly leaching the was to increase the production of struvite option 4 would improve the removal of p from 3 7 to 4 8 but at a very high cost opex would quadruple again due to the high local prices of the required chemical inputs mainly h2so4 therefore options 2 3 and 4 appear to be too expensive for the removal of nutrients they provide in comparison option 1 can provide an acceptable decrease in the load of nutrients that are discharged at an annual cost of 2 66 m usd revenues for that option only cover 38 5 of the opex the implementation of option 1 could only be justified by its environmental benefits that is the decrease in the load of nutrients discharged to the urban rivers that would alleviate eutrophication in option 1 0 76 tons day of n and 2 12 tons day of p would be removed from wastewater and captured in the form of struvite although that represents a small fraction of the total nutrients released to the estuary the impact would be notable in the river mouth of the heavily polluted riachuelo matanza as shown in table 6 it must be noticed that this study focused on the existing activated sludge plants that could be easily upgraded with nutrient recovery systems the two largest facilities in the region bicentenario and riachuelo provide only primary treatment to the wastewater and were left out of the assessment if those facilities were upgraded to activated sludge facilities and then equipped with struvite precipitation units such as in option 1 the amount of n and p released to the estuary would be further reduced by 4 1 and 28 8 respectively the content of p considered in the struvite granules was set in 14 wt for this study however there are crystallizing systems that produce struvite granules with a content of p of 28 wt crystalgreen and naskeo for example therefore the capture of p and consequent reduction of its discharge to water bodies could likely double by adopting crystallizing systems that produce struvite of higher grade the opex required to produce a higher grade struvite would likely double as well 8 in option 1 the considered treatment plants would produce 15 11 tons day of struvite granules it is fair to question how well that yield of struvite would integrate within the existing distribution channels for fertilizers and if the local market would be able to absorb that volume of product the production of struvite in the considered treatment plants would have a smallimpact on the local fertilizer s market to put it into perspective that amount of struvite would represent 2 1 of the consumption of phosphate fertilizers in the province of buenos aires 96 and 1 3 of the national production of phosphate fertilizers 34 regarding logistics the region presents unbeatable distribution channels for the commercialization of the product the metropolitan region of buenos aires is located in the epicenter of the market of fertilizers in the country the province of buenos aires accounts for 41 of argentina s fertilizers consumption and concentrates most of the industry of fertilizers of the nation 97 the ports of this region also concentrate most of the imports of fertilizers of the country regarding the marketability of the product struvite granules are unknown by local consumers however this type of fertilizer presents key characteristics in terms of size it is produced as powder granules or pellets and in composition which makes it very suitable for the local market struvite would be commercialized as a low grade form of phosphorus fertilizer competing with monoammonium phosphate map and diammonium phosphate dap map has a typical content of 11 n and 50 61 p whilst dap has typically 18 n and 46 p in contrast struvite fertilizers obtained from municipal wastewaters have 5 n and can achieve a content of 28 6 p more details on previous table 1 struvite fertilizers with higher contents of p would compete with the more concentrate and much more expensive map and dap in the market niche of phosphorous fertilizers that is a growing and profitable market in this agricultural country 34 phosphorous fertilizers are particularly suitable for soy whose cultivation has a huge importance in the economy of argentina 98 102 soy requires a fertilizer that is more concentrated in p and has less content of n as it has the capacity of synthesizing its own nitrogen from its symbiosis with rhizobacteria 99 meanwhile struvite fertilizers with lower contents of p could be enriched with p2o5 or blended with n urea and potassium k2o to achieve a more balanced n p k formula the blending of struvite with dap seems to increase the absorbance in agricultural soils resulting in a slow release effective fertilizer 100 struvite may also be blended with sulphur or calcium sources forming complex fertilizers if it is intended a np fertilizer that contains ca there is the possibility to adapt the nutrient recovery process to precipitate phosphate with ca instead of mg producing calcium phosphate dicalcium phosphate or hap besides the environmental benefits producing struvite from buenos aires wastewater would reduce the needs of importing raw materials ammonia rock phosphate and sulfuric acid that are required by the nation s chemical fertilizers industry or else importing finished phosphate fertilizers 7 conclusion the discharge of both raw and treated wastewaters from the metropolitan region of buenos aires is causing the eutrophication of the inner part of la plata estuary the recovery of nutrients from wastewater in the form of fertilizing products should be taken into consideration among the technical alternatives to combat that problem this metropolitan region presents 11 activated sludge plants that could be upgraded with nutrient recovery units that use struvite precipitation acidic leaching of the sludge or iex systems using those technologies insert well within the lay out of the existing facilities and can be combined in different options the four options considered in this work can decrease the total load of p that is discharged to the estuary by 3 7 4 8 options with iex showed more capacity of decreasing the discharge of n to the estuary around 8 when compared with options that only rely on struvite precipitation 0 5 0 7 the economic assessment indicated that for all the considered options recovering nutrients in the existing activated sludge plants would be unprofitable therefore the implementation of those nutrient recovery options could only be justified by the decrease in the load of nutrients discharged to the urban rivers of the four considered options the precipitation of struvite from the centrate was the least costly in that option potential revenues would only cover 38 5 of the opex producing net losses of 2 66 m per year for that cost the load of nutrients discharged to the inner part of la plata estuary would decrease by 0 5 n and 3 7 p however it was found that the decrease in nutrients would be significant in the river mouth of the riachuelo matanza where the load of p would be reduced by 42 5 that is interesting as this particular river is considered as the most polluted of south america and is heavily eutrophicated that potential environmental gain leaves room for discussing if struvite precipitation could be contemplated at least for the four activated sludge plants located in the basin of that river declaration of competing interest the

13588,presently photocatalytic degradation has emerged as an attractive and efficient technology for water and wastewater treatment many photocatalysts have been introduced and applied to treat organic pollutants in an aqueous system such as dyes antibiotics pharmaceuticals and oily wastes however several hurdles such as difficulty in the suspended photocatalyst segregation from the aqueous system and low reutilization rate urgently need to be addressed for photocatalytic degradation to be independently implemented in wastewater treatment the suspended photocatalyst in wastewater needs to be separated to enable the recovery of the spent photocatalyst efficiently the spent photocatalyst can be regenerated and reused to reduce the operational cost therefore extensive studies have been carried out targeting photocatalyst immobilization in the nanofibrous membrane to promote the photocatalyst s practical usage in natural wastewater treatment this review aims to comprehensively discuss the recent progress of the developed nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane emphasizing advancements in physical and morphological structure towards exhibiting high performance in wastewater treatment performance evaluation challenges and future directions regarding the utilization of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes in wastewater treatment are comprehensively reviewed keywords electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane enpm electrospinning wastewater treatment organic pollutant photocatalytic degradation 1 introduction rapid industrialization has created many serious problems for the water ecosystem leading to the destruction of the climate and human health due to the dumping of chemicals which has caused pollution of lakes rivers oceans and groundwater aquifers several exactor contaminants such as surfactants textile dyes heavy metals insecticides and pesticides are known in the aquatic environment many researchers have focused on removing toxic pollutants from contaminated waters and reducing their dangerous impact on ecosystems various conventional methods such as sedimentation adsorption biological and chemical coagulation have been used extensively for the decontamination of water 1 6 however the effectiveness of these technologies is not sufficient for wastewater treatment besides these methods only transform pollutants into other forms and are not eliminated and destroyed completely among available methods for organic polluted wastewater treatment photocatalytic degradation by nanosized photocatalysts was discovered as the most promising technique this is because of the organic pollutants will be entirely degraded by photocatalyst in the aqueous system photocatalyst has the capability to generate reactive oxygen species such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 which are responsible to mineralize organic pollutants yielding co2 and h2o as harmless end product 7 the generation of reactive oxygen species was mainly initiated by three factors which are 1 energy sources such as visible light ultraviolet uv light ultrasonic and heat 2 primary oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide and 3 catalyst such as titania zinc oxide or other semiconductors when the catalyst is irradiated by an energy source eg uv light the electrons at the valence band are excited to the conductance band leaving positive charge holes in the valence band the electrons and hole pairs then move to the surface of the photocatalyst to involve in a series of redox reactions with the presence of oxygen the electrons reduce the photocatalyst and subsequently react with the oxygen to form superoxide radical anions then electrons and hole pairs further react in water molecules to generate reactive oxygen species organic pollutants can be oxidized by the generated reactive oxygen species to form harmless carbon dioxide and water recently there are various nanosized photocatalyst and their composites were synthesized such as tio2 zno graphitic carbon nitride silver tungsten oxide copper oxide and stanum for wastewater application 8 13 they have a large specific surface area and a functional group that exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance however for photocatalytic degradation to be independently implemented in wastewater treatment several obstacles such as difficulty in the segregation of the suspended photocatalyst from solution and low reutilization rate need to be addressed urgently the powdery formed and suspended nanosized photocatalysts must be extracted before the treated water is reused or released into the environment due to the potential toxicity that resulted from the nanosized dimension photocatalysts and photocatalyst that functionalized with other carcinogen substances they also can be more toxic if the released photocatalyst has not undergone a complete reaction in which degradation not yet happen where the photocatalyst carries the adsorbed pollutant besides the nanosized photocatalyst also unstable and tend to aggregation in the real water application the separation of suspended photocatalyst from wastewater is a challenge which if solved properly would enable regeneration of the spent photocatalyst efficiently to address the above limitation many studies have been carried out targeting to immobilize the nanosized photocatalyst in the substrate such as membranes or floating materials to support the photocatalyst in the solution 7 14 immobilizing photocatalyst into porous membrane is also recognized as photocatalytic membrane 9 photocatalytic membranes can minimize the loss of photocatalyst and maintain efficient photocatalytic degradation 15 the photocatalytic membranes that successfully fabricated for wastewater treatment including polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf titania tio2 16 pvdf titania nanotube tnt 15 polysulfone psf fe tio2 17 psf cu2o 18 and etc however the current photocatalytic membranes require further improvement in the dispersion of photocatalyst and light utilization this is due to conventional photocatalytic membranes commonly were fabricated via simple coating the photocatalyst on the membrane surface or blending the photocatalyst in the membrane substrate then followed by casting 19 21 in terms of separation and photocatalytic degradation this technique may limit the efficiency of these photocatalytic membranes the photocatalysts appear to agglomerate on the membrane surface for the photocatalyst coated membrane thus reducing the effective catalytic region after many activity cycles the coated photocatalyst on the membrane surface often appears to fall off due to poor adhesion while most of the photocatalysts were incorporated in the membrane matrix for the photocatalyst blended membrane resulting in the low implementation of catalysts due to agglomeration within the membrane structure the membrane matrix also can be degraded by undifferentiated photocatalytic reactions thus slowly decreasing the photocatalytic membrane s mechanical stability in addition a small amount of photocatalyst was spread over the top surface of the membrane could reduce photodegradation performance due to the formation of agglomerates a higher dosage of the photocatalyst had induced membrane pore blockage and degradation of the continuous porous structure which had significantly decreased the permeability of the membrane 14 thus it is highly desirable to explore a new approach to tackle this challenging but extremely critical issue it is noteworthy that electrospinning offers a convenient approach to the preparation of nanofibrous substrates with a wide specific area and porosity which displays enormous potential in wastewater treatment nanofibrous membranes with nanoscale diameters give a multitude of fascinating features such as excellent mechanical activity and large surface area to volume ratio high potential for functionalization and remarkable porosity leads to a greater emphasis on water treatment most recently there are several published works highlighted on the progress of the preparation of electrospun nanofibrous membranes and other methods for the removal of contaminants from wastewater 22 27 these published works supported that nanofibrous membranes significantly utilized as promising solution in wastewater treatment there are many techniques relevant to nanofibers production some of which are template synthesis drawing phase separation self assembly and electrospinning 28 29 among these electrospinning is emerging as an easy and reliable technique for preparing smooth nanofibers from a variety of materials with controllable morphology electrospinning applying a high electric field to produce nanofibers from a charged or melting polymer solution in brief the common precursor solution in electrospinning includes the inorganic precursor polymer additive and volatile solvent that should be carefully prepared so that the solution can be easily electrospun electrospinning can be used to generate various morphologies by changing the electrospinning parameters and polymer solution properties on the other hand the electrospinning process tends to be the most effective approach in the manufacture of very small diameter continuous nanofibers and ultrafine fibers it should be noted that fiber with a small diameter is preferred because it can contribute to the superior mechanical efficiency due to its rigidity and tensile strength electrospun nanofibrous membranes are also an excellent substrate to deposit grow functional nanoparticles for various applications like degradation of dyes 30 32 adsorption of heavy metal ions 33 35 membrane distillation 36 38 oily water separation 27 36 and microbial disinfection 30 39 40 in recent decades there has been an increasing trend in research into the development of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes enpm the development of enpm by integrating photocatalyst into the nanofibrous membrane presented a promising solution for pollutant degradation in wastewater via an advanced oxidation process this is due to their advancements in physical and morphological structure towards high performance in wastewater treatment benefited from the larger specific surface area and higher porosity contributes to an increase of available photocatalytic reaction sites simultaneously promote the efficiency of electron hole pair separation for the first time this review focused on the development of electrospun nanofibrous membranes with photocatalytic properties for wastewater treatment applications this review aims to present the recent progress of the enpm with an emphasis on advancements in physical and morphological structure towards high performance in wastewater treatment importantly the contributions had been made to investigate systematically between the various preparation approaches and the influence of chemical and thermal treatment on the properties and photocatalytic performance of enpm were discussed in this review also the performance evaluation challenges as well as future directions regarding utilization of enpm in wastewater treatment is presented to provide the guidance for researchers in this area 2 advancements in the physical and morphological structure of enpm enpm has offered advancement in term of physical and morphological structure for use in photocatalytic and filtration applications this trend can be based on the following reasons first larger specific surface area due to their uniform diameter and large aspect ratio length to diameter contribute to an increase of available photocatalytic reaction sites simultaneously promote the efficiency of electron hole pair separation 41 second the unique electrospinning process can offer opportunities to fine tune the surface functionality through polymer chemistry 42 blending and nanoparticle incorporation during processing which can effectively uniformly disperse photocatalyst into a polymer based nanofiber this condition contributes to the maximum source light irradiation toward photocatalyst which enhances the photocatalytic performance third because of the three dimensional 3 d interconnected pore framework of electrospun nanofiber membranes and their superior porosity relative to typical polymeric membranes with the two dimensional 2 d framework 43 44 the separation mechanism is triplicate such a multi target separation mechanism is beneficial when the objective is the removal of impurity from the feed stream finally the enpms have high pores interconnectivity with uniform pore sizes and excellent porosity over 80 compared to conventional membranes that fabricated by phase inversion technique which have a porosity around 5 35 45 these properties promote the water permeability of the membrane thus enhance the water filtration performance herein enpm has attracted enormous interest for its great potential in the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater however the common issue of nanofibrous materials is increasing the operating pressure resulted in the deformation of the pore structure and declining the flux this behavior is typical of electrospun mats under hydraulic flow as pressure induced compression causes porosity and hence permeability of the membrane to decrease therefore many efforts and attempts have been taken to tackle these issues 46 researchers came out by varying the fabrication techniques and conducted modifications on photocatalytic membranes to utilize advancement in morphological and physical structure to enhance the photocatalytic and filtration performance 47 50 the details were discussed and reviewed in the following sections 2 1 electrospinning in the late 16th century william gilbert s discovery of electrostatic force in liquids began the development of nanofibrous materials by electrospinning 51 when a piece of charged amber was brought near a spherical drop of water on a dry surface william gilbert believed that the water had deformed into a cone due to an electrostatic attraction now called the taylor cone later in the 20th century electrospinning technology was increasingly evolving into a range of applications electrospinning is an electrohydrodynamic process in which a high potential electric field directly spun the polymeric dope solution to generate nanofibrous materials electrospinning also requires rapid evaporation of solvents and fiber forming droplet solidification 52 in particular the electrospinning device includes four essential components including 1 a metallic or capillary needle 2 a syringe pump 3 a ground conductive collector and 4 a high voltage source 1 30 kv as shown in the fig 1 the polymeric dope processing solution consists of a mixture of photocatalyst nanoparticles polymer powder e g polyacrylonitrile pan pvdf cellulose acetate ca and solvent e g n n dimethylformamide dmf the composition of the dope solution should be based on the desired total solid concentration by changing the ratio of the photocatalyst nanoparticles to the polymer before the electrospinning phase the dope solution must be completely dissolved and homogeneously dispersed by ultrasound with the desired operating frequency the prepared heroin solution was then injected into a hypodermic syringe and placed inside the electrospinning chamber when high enough voltage is applied the dope solution is transferred to elongated fibers spun fibers produced may be collected on a rotating drum or a targeted substrate electrospinning parameters such as flow rate needle diameter tip to collector size and voltage were typically manipulated to the desired application 52 different electrospinning parameters influence the form of the fiber the average diameter and distribution these parameters can be divided into three main categories 1 the properties of the solution molecular weight polymer solvent properties viscosity 2 the parameters of the jet formation needle diameter flow rate humidity temperature and electrical application and 3 the method of collection rotation static disc collector rotation speed as a result the number of parameters affecting the fiber diameter and the average distribution is very high and the experimental design is an efficient method of measuring the parameters with the greatest impact on the fiber properties as a result the researcher used a mathematical method to design multi level experiments to select the best parameters for developing a photocatalytic membrane by electrospinning 53 vild et al built an orthogonal experiment to investigate the effect of electrospinning processing parameters on the distribution and average diameter of poly methyl methacrylate pmma fibers to determine the best electrospinning conditions for smooth fibers without the presence of beads and a small average diameter 53 these fiber characteristics enhance the position of the photocatalyst ceramic particles on the surface of the fiber based on this analysis the increase in the applied electrical field from 0 8 ekv 1 cm 1 to 1 4 ekv 1 cm 1 did not affect the average fiber diameter however the higher average fiber diameter is obtained when the flow rate increases from 1 mlh 1 to 8 ml h 1 they also reported that the content of photocatalysts increased from 10 to 40 wt reducing the average fiber diameter of enpm tio2 pmma from 2 0 to 1 2 mm however the photocatalyst content was not affected by membrane hydrophobicity there are different types of materials that could be used for electrospinning and depending on their application individual material properties should be considered the electrospinning process can be adjusted with the desired morphology and electrospinning properties fig 2 shows the groups of materials used in the electrospinning process 2 1 1 coaxial electrospinning approximately in 2003 coaxial electrospinning technology was introduced to produce core shell engineered fibers with different material properties 54 the coaxial electrospinning technique may be used to combine two different types of polymers into the development of core shell formed micro nanometer scale fibers the creation of core shell structured fibers through coaxial electrospinning has become more critical as it could improve material property profiles for potential applications in particular for environmental purification the coaxial electrospinning method is looking ahead to be fast enough to avoid any mixing of core and shell polymers as well as any compounds from tainting them this technique also provides high mechanical properties porosity hydrophilicity and prevents swelling of the membrane 54 this is due to the synergistic effect produced by a mixture of two different polymers where the strength of the other polymer may overcome the weakness of the polymer the enpm which has been developed by the coaxial electrospinning technique retains good photocatalytic properties by allowing a strong adhesion of photocatalyst to the fiber surface for example xie et al developed carbon quantum dots cqds bi20tio32 pan fiber membrane by preparing a core and sheath solution with different concentrations of pan polymer 55 the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalyst was loaded into the sheath solution to be deposited on the outer surface of the fabricated membrane their results showed that the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalysts were uniformly anchored to the composite fiber surfaces this condition exposes the photocatalyst to source light thus enhancing photocatalytic efficiency however as the loading of photocatalyst increased the average fiber diameter gradually increased and the fiber surface became much rougher this may be due to the higher viscosity of the sheath solution which prevents the extension of the fiber during the electrospinning process the creation of the enpm by coaxial electrospinning technique offers the advancement of the morphological structure by creating a novel design of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane a recent study reported by tang et al has successfully developed a novel tio2 micro nano sphere structure on the surface of nanofiber via coaxial electrospinning technique 56 the core solution consists of polyvinyl acetate butyl titanate acetic acid and tert butyl alcohol and the shell solution consists of polyvinylpyrrolidone butyl titanate acetic acid and ethanol both solutions were put in the heart and shell micropumps of the electrospinning apparatus fig 3 using this approach the resulting scanning electron microscope sem images showed two structures of fabricated membranes a bead structure and an embossed structure having been calcined at 550 c in particular the designs were created by electrical field power where the spherical products were not individually expelled but were firmly embedded to the surface of the nanofiber after drying and calcining in terms of efficiency methylene blue mb was used as a model pollutant to compare the photocatalytic degradation of the different epnm morphological structures involving 1 tio2 nanofiber 2 tio2 micro nano spheres and 3 tio2 micro nanospheres embedded in nanofibers all the membranes were produced in the same process the sem images the primary surface area and the rate of degradation of mb by the fabricated membrane were shown in fig 4 a e as well the degradation rate of tio2 micro nano spheres embedded in nanofibers is higher than that of tio2 micro nano spheres and tio2 nanofibers due to a higher effective surface area of 23 852 m2 g compared to tio2 micro nano spheres 22 270 m2 g and tio2 nanofibers 18 463 m2 g this result may be linked to the novel structure of tio2 micro nano spheres embedded in nanofibers combined with the advantages of the two structural types of nanofibers and micro nano spheres besides tio2 micro nanosphere embedded nanofibers display larger nanofiber gaps that are advantageous for uv light utilization and could increase photocatalytic performance 56 2 1 2 electrospinning and electrospraying the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying is another promising technique for the development of polymeric based enpm that attracted the researcher s attention the electrospraying technique uses electrical forces to atomize liquid material under high electrical potential coulombic s repulsion between the surface charge disperses the dope solution ejected from the needle nozzle into finely charged droplets the size of the droplet can be regulated by the feed rate and the voltage parameters previous studies indicated that the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying has been shown to be effective in the manufacture of flexible photoelectrodes for solar cells 57 and fuel cells 58 the combination of these two strategies may therefore lead to the creation of a versatile and effective enpm ramasundaram et al have recently manufactured highly versatile and porous paper like poly vinylidenefluoride tio2 membranes using sequential electrospinning and electrospraying techniques for photocatalytic applications 59 technically the photocatalyst dispersion of tio2 was electro sprayed on the surface of the electrospun pvdf mat developed by the electrospinning technique the subsequent morphological study indicated that the electrosprayed tio2 is deposited as clusters in a single pot on the pvdf mat the photocatalytic behavior of the electrosprayed tio2 pvdf mat is compared to the non porous pvdf tio2 film generated by solution casting with a similar amount of photocatalyst pvdf tio2 mat was found to have significantly higher photocatalytic activity compared to pvdf tio2 film this finding is mainly due to the porous structure of the electrospun pvdf tio2 mat that promotes larger photocatalyst activation sites allowing higher photocatalytic efficiency however the formation of photocatalyst clusters on the upper surface of the pvdf mat will increase the detachment from the substrate during actual operation additionally this method requires two distinct electrospinning and electrospraying methods which work separately and entail additional costs and time consuming costs since electrospinning and electrospraying are essentially the same electrohydrodynamic based process they can be combined into a single unit called simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying see system pahasup et al used the see method to generate and interlock microscopic tio2 photocatalyst clusters inside the non woven nylon 6 electrospun membrane network as shown in fig 5 60 anatase tio2 suspensions were produced at a concentration of 2 5 5 and 10 wt the nylon 6 solution and the tio2 suspension were fed into separate syringe pumps and ejected via the respective metallic needle connected to a high voltage supply with opposite polarity the base layer of the membrane was initially formed by electrospinning nylon 6 solution for 15 min using 25 kv of the applied voltage the nylon 6 nanofibrous network and the tio2 suspension at concentrations of 2 5 5 and 10 tn 2 5 tn 5 and tn 10 respectively were electrospun and electrosprayed at the same time to create a nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane for 4 h before drying in the oven at 80 c for 24 h the corresponding xrd spectra showed that the range of the developed membranes is well aligned with the anatase tio2 content which confirmed that the tio2 nanoparticles were successfully integrated into the nylon 6 membrane using see the resulting uv vis transmittance spectra showed that the formation of tio2 microclusters in the enpm produced using this technique did not interfere with the optical properties of anatase tio2 particles having almost identical photocatalytic activity within the same wavelength at 390 393 nm by using mb as a model pollutant all nylon 6 tio2 enpm fabricated using see technology recorded almost 99 removal after 120 min 60 these results have shown that the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying contributes to an efficient and simple technique for reducing the detachment of nanoparticle photocatalysts from the nanocomposite membrane however after 5 cycles of photocatalytic treatment the highest loaded membrane the tn 10 membrane experienced a weight loss of about 10 due to the degradation of photocatalyst microclusters as shown in fig 6 the results suggested that the mechanical strength of the current state of the nylon 6 tio2 enpm was moderate further improvement in the mechanical stability of the enpm produced by ees is therefore needed to withstand the severe conditions of the real application of water treatment 2 1 3 melt phase separation recently the manufacture of large scale photocatalytic nanofibrous membranes was conducted using a simple and easy process known as the process of melt phase separation and suspension coating 31 commonly previous research on nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes focused mainly on the individual performance of photocatalytic and filtration while only a few works were done on their synergistic performance this is due to their poor mechanical stability low reusability and very high porosity that can result in the weak interface between the photocatalyst and the support of the membrane the melt phase separation technique may therefore give advancement in terms of the membrane s morphological and physical structure which are the critical criteria for the efficiency of membrane filtration just as seen in fig 7 a this technique involved the preparation of mixed composite pellets by dispersing the tio2 photocatalyst into polyvinyl alcohol co ethylene pva co pe before being combined with cellulose acetate butyrate cab for the melt extrusion method the temperature of processing ranged from 190 to 230 c another research was conducted using the same method and the composite suspension cab pva co pe tio2 was sprayed onto the polyproline substratum to form a nanofibrous membrane for photocatalytic degradation and filtration of mb three concentrations of tio2 were used to enhance photocatalytic activity and filtration efficiency which are 1 3 and 5 they reported no significant difference in the water contact angles of the synthesized membranes due to varying the loading of tio2 this finding suggested that most of the photocatalysts were successfully impregnated in the interior part of the nanofibers as seen in the transmission electron microscope tem picture fig 7 b the hybrid membrane ftir spectrum becomes sharper than the pristine sample after tio2 loading has indicated an interaction between tio2 nanoparticles and polymer molecule due to hydrogen bond formation inside the fabricated membrane fig 7 c the formation of a new hydrogen bond between the alkyl group hydrogen in the polymer chain and abundant hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface may characterize these potential affections 2 1 4 electrospinning and precipitation process bai et al manufactured a new stand alone p n nanoheterojunction photocatalyst with yttrium stabilized zirconia ysz nanofibers as the backbone to support the tio2 nanoparticles and ag2o nanocrystals through a combination of electrospinning technique and precipitation method as shown in fig 8 61 initially the ysz tio2 nanofibers backbone was fabricated through the electrospinning technique and calcined at 800 c then the fabricated ysz tio2 membranes were immersed into the alkaline agno3 solution then irradiated for 1 h by a 24 w uv lamp to develop the ag2o ysz tio2 p n nanoheterojunction enpm through the precipitation process the weight ratio of agno3 and ysz tio2 membranes was adjusted from 0 1 1 0 3 1 to 0 5 1 and named as azt 1 azt 3 and azt 5 respectively the optimum weight ratio of agno3 and ysz tio2 was 0 3 1 azt 3 which recorded the smallest bandgap energy of 2 89 ev as estimated from the kubelka munk equation fig 9 a b showed the fesem images and surface area of the ysz tio2 membrane before and after precipitation of ag2o3 azt 3 after the precipitation process the color of the membrane was changed from white to grey which confirmed the attachment of ag2o the results also revealed the precipitation process not only increased the total surface of the membrane it also retains the flexibility of the membranes before the small size of the ag2o2 grain precipitated in the resultant membrane fabrication of enpm through the combination of electrospinning and precipitation method gives a new insight into the designation of flexible enpm for wastewater treatment as compared to conventional electrospinning this method can be facilitated to develop high efficiency nanoheterojunction nanocrystalline photocatalyst membranes to meet high performance photocatalytic membrane 2 2 chemical modification modification of enpm 2 2 1 surface modification in the method of wet chemical treatment the moderately inert polymer nanofiber is treated with a chemical that provides reactive functional groups like amine carboxyl hydroxyl or nitrile groups it depends on whether the polymer molecule sites are susceptible to nuclear or electrophilic attack nanofiber material is commonly soaked into an alkaline medium to form a hydroxyl or carboxylic group on the nanofiber surface surface modification of the polymeric nanofibrous membrane substrate could enhance the interaction or deposition of photocatalyst particles onto the surface of the substrate for instance panthi et al reported ag3po4 pan composite nanofibers were developed by a straightforward and flexible method which is electrospinning and followed by surface modification of pan nanofibers by treating with nh2oh aqueous solution for 15 min at 65 c 62 as illustrated in fig 10 during the treatment the nitrile groups of pan were transformed into amidoxime groups which were employed to anchor ag ions on the surface of pan nanofibers then the ag ions further reacted with po4 3 ions to form ag3po4 nanoparticles to achieve enhanced efficiency the combination of amidoxime functional groups with ag3po4 nanoparticles in the system was expected to be an effective technique for proper attachment of nanoparticles to further enhance the attachment of photocatalyst nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibrous polymeric substrate additional treatment like hydrothermal was proposed kim et al successfully developed polydopamine assisted zno nanorods pdopa znrs polyurethane pu enpm by integrating electrospinning surface functionalization and hydrothermal treatment 40 firstly after the pu nanofibers were electrospun the fibers were immersed in dopamine hydrochloride solution mixed with a tris hcl buffer for 12 h as reported by kim et al the immersion process enables the functionalization of nanofibers with the polydopamine where the surface of the nanofibers will significantly be altered then enabling the interaction with nanoparticles this is a novel strategy to impregnate the photocatalyst nanoparticles into the surface of the nanofibers without deteriorating their mechanical properties later to attach the photocatalyst the resulting polydopamine coated pu nanofibrous mat was immersed in aqueous zno nanoparticles solution then the hydrothermal process took place to grow the zno nanorods on the surface of the nanofibers the fabrication flow path was demonstrated in fig 11 they found the zno nanorods strongly adhered to the surface of the polydopamine functionalized nanofibers in terms of performance at low intensity uv led devices this resulting polydopamine znrs pu nanofibers had strong photocatalytic antimicrobial activity with good reusability the catechol group in polydopamine not only induces adhesion of zno nanostructures but also serves as an electron trap preventing the recombination of e h pairs and thereby enhancing the photocatalytic effectiveness of the resulting enpm qayum et al designed and fabricated multifunctional pan agbr ag fibrous membranes by using electrospinning and wet chemical methods 63 they fabricated pan agbr ag fibrous membrane through four main steps and the fabricated samples were labeled as fm1 fm2 fm3 and fm 4 respectively as illustrated in fig 12 a sem images revealed the growth of the photocatalyst on the pan fiber from each step starting from electrospinning heat treatment febr3 treatment and followed by uv light irradiation fig 12 b e the growth of ag nanoparticles on the surface of agbr that is embedded in the pan fiber was observed at the end of the process as shown in fig 12 f these findings indicated the formation of agbr ag schottky junction could enhance the photocatalytic performance due to the improvement of the electron density of agbr due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of ag nanoparticles and narrow bandgap of agbr 64 it also could efficiently inhibit the exfoliation of the photocatalyst nanoparticles from pan nanofibrous membrane during real application 2 2 2 in situ polymerization due to the issue of nanofibrous photocatalysts which are commonly breakable and have small recoverable deformation an innovative approach is highly desirable for the development of flexible stronger and stable nanofibrous photocatalyst coupling the electrospinning and the in situ polymerization has been proven as an adequate method for the fabrication of inorganic based enpm for pollutant degradation this method was believed could maintain the structural integrity upon large deformation of the nanofibrous photocatalyst zhang et al developed the flexible and hierarchical mesoporous tio2 nanoparticles modified tio2 nanofibers tinfnp composites by the combination of the electrospinning and the in situ polymerization 32 in this technique the tio2 photocatalyst nanoparticles were decorated on the pristine electrospun titanium dioxide nanofibers tinf that served as a template the white electrospun tinf then was immersed into the solution that contained tio2 nanoparticle bifunctional benzoxazine and acetone before dried and transferred into a vacuum at 200 c for 1 h to process with in situ polymerizations of bifunctional benzoxazine ba a monomers which led to the generation of the polybenzoxazine pbz layer on the surface of tinf the color of the fabricated pbz tinf was yellow the pbz was employed as a carrier and fixative to prevent the agglomeration of photocatalyst nanoparticles then the membrane was calcined at 550 c for 2 h under n2 flow and generated a black tio2 nanofibrous membrane the schematic diagram of the fabrication process and the resulted membranes were illustrated in fig 13 the fabricated enpm was tested for degradation of mb they found the mb was degraded within 30 min the photodegradation performance of the fabricated membrane also greater than commercial catalysts like p25 crucially the efficient synthesis of these fascinating materials may provide a favorable platform for further production of photoreactors based on the nanofibrous membrane to treat water and air pollutants 2 3 effect of thermal treatment 2 3 1 calcination thermal treatment was conducted on inorganic materials to strengthen and advance their morphological and physical structure through improvement in durability and crystallinity recently the development of inorganic based enpm has widely attracted attention among researchers this is due to their high mechanical and thermal stability the inorganic membrane could overcome the limitation of the organic membranes as they can be easily deteriorated by photocatalytic degradation due to long term exposure to the source light like uv rays in the fabrication of enpm thermal treatment was executed to enhance the intrinsic properties of membranes such as wettability mechanical thermal and distribution of pore size thermal treatment of nanofibrous membrane including heating calcination and hydrothermal calcination is defined as a process of heating a substance to high temperatures under controlled temperature and in a controlled environment commonly calcination is applied to treat inorganic or ceramic materials to improve their mechanical and thermal stability gao et al fabricated a novel electrospun inorganic based enpm through electrospinning and calcination methods 65 they prepared the electrospun reduced graphene oxide titanium dioxide nanofibrous rgo tif membrane for photocatalytic degradation of propranolol in wastewater the optimum calcination temperature was found out to be 450 c and the ideal rgo tio2 loading ratio was 2 fig 14 a b show sem images of rgo tif membranes before and after calcination the found the diameter of fiber decreased and an obvious shrinkage was noticed for all membranes after calcined at 450 c these changes could have resulted in the mass loss of residual solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as pore former during the calcination process the mechanical properties of the fabricated membrane also good and matched the requirement for filtration application purposes fig 14 c e besides that the average pore size of the calcined membranes significantly increased from 0 167 to 0 175 Î¼m in terms of photocatalytic and filtration performance after calcination the rgo tif membrane achieved up to 100 removal of propranolol and reported high water permeability attributed to their highly porous properties respectively apart from metal oxides utilization of metal organic framework mof as a precursor for the development of enpm has come to the forefront 66 enpm that developed by mof could be benefitted from their unique crossed network connection exceptionally large surface area and highly porous structure 1 calcination treatment is compulsory for the fabrication of mof based enpm to retain their unique morphology structures for instance hou et al developed c doped coupled tio2 zno enpm by manipulated the morphology and catalytic properties of the membrane by the growth of one of the subclasses of the mof which is zif 8 that has cube structures 66 the c doped tio2 zno enpm was fabricated by combining electrospinning and two step calcination of zif 8 nanocrystals as shown in fig 15 the first step calcination at 350 c to obtain composite fiber tio2 zif 8 n in the air for 2 h then the second calcination at 400 c for the transformation of tio2 zif 8 to c doped tio2 zno n at 400 c for 1 h after zno cubes were introduced the composite membrane with optimized zno cubes exhibited greater specific surface area 30 2475 m2 g compared to pristine tio2 nanofibers 11 4341 m2 g the morphological study showed zno cubes and tio2 nanofibers attached to each other and formed a cross sectional network in sample c doped tio2 zno creating further opportunities for the photocatalysis of organic contaminants for photogenerated holes and electrons to participate besides the cross network link between tio2 and zno cubes is propitious to increase the heterojunction synergy and thereby effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons taking advantage of the trinomial synergistic effect of carbon doping zno and tio2 the as designed composite membrane showed excellent photocatalytic performance by reached 92 which is nearly 3 times higher compared to pure tio2 nanofibers in rhb degradation furthermore the prepared membrane exhibited lower emission intensity relative to pure tio2 nanofibers suggesting successful inhibition of the recombination of holes and electrons chen et al developed graphene oxide polyacrylonitrile go pan nanofibrous membranes through electrospinning followed by calcination and solvothermal as shown in fig 16 a 67 firstly electrospinning was carried out to prepare the go pan nanofibrous membrane then the membrane was calcined at 550 c for 3 h in n2 to obtain the intermediate product called go carbon nanofibers cnfs membrane the calcined membrane then was covered by zinc sulfide zns nanoparticles to form go zn s cnfs via the solvothermal method the specific surface area of the resultant membrane was significantly higher than the go pan membrane before calcination due to the addition of zns nanoparticles while the mean pore diameter of the prepared membrane dropped from 72 87 to 40 86 nm the surface area increased significantly from 7 60 to 22 31 m2 g when tested for the conversion of 4 aminotoluene into 4 nitrotoluene under uv light the conversion percent reached to 90 this is because of the synergistic effect between the zns photocatalytic activity and the excellent go cnf adsorption ability the resulting go zn s cnfs membrane also demonstrated excellent mechanical strength allowing them to retain their original structure even after crushing and folding as depicted in fig 16 b c 2 3 2 calcination and rapid heating in previous work meng et al successfully fabricated a high efficiency microfluidic based photocatalytic microreactor by using electrospun nanofibrous tio2 as a photocatalyst 68 firstly the nanofibrous tio2 was developed by the electrospinning of the tio2 precursor then the tio2 precursor was transformed into the tio2 nanofiber via calcination the calcined electrospun photocatalyst then was sealed in the glass by using pdms that functioning as glue however the thick layer of glue will cover the photocatalytic fiber hence reduce photocatalytic efficiency later the same research group innovated the method by introducing a simple heating technique by melting the bottom layer of the nanofibers to adhere to them on the surface of carriers such as a copper plate or glass fig 17 a 69 the heating treatment took only 5 10 s via a cassette flamethrower as illustrated in fig 17 b the resultant tio2 nanofibers were composed of three layers which are upper middle and bottom layer fig 17 c k show the sem images of the layers of tio2 nanofibers before and after heating for 5 and 10 s respectively by heating the nanofiber for 10 s it was found that the porous structure of three layer nanofibrous gradually shrunk until closing the pores however the porous structure of the top layer of the membrane remains to exist even the heating duration was 5 s therefore 5 s was chosen as the optimum heating time as the nanofiber would adhere on the carrier without damaging the porous and fibrous structure furthermore the xrd pattern of the top layer of nanofibers remains unchanged and no rutile phase characteristic peak observed after flame calcination due to the rapid heating process this indicated the tio2 on the top layer of nanofibers was pure anatase phase even after calcination this method could be a potential technique in the preparation of the photocatalytic based product 2 3 3 coating and heating treatment thermal treatment is crucial for enpm that is fabricated via the coating process the thermal treatment was believed could prevent the leakage of photocatalyst nanoparticles from the porous structure of the enpm and enhance the mechanical stability of the robust structure of enpm for instance alias et al fabricated an enpm by coating nanosheet graphitic carbon nitride gcn embedded pan nanofiber on top of asymmetric alumina al2o3 hollow fiber membrane surface by using direct electrospinning technique and followed by thermal treatment 14 to overcome the robust issues of electrospun membrane and leaching of photocatalyst from the substrate the as fabricated membrane was subjected to continuous heating at 120 c for 15 min the thermal treatment greatly improved the adhesion of the nanofiber coating to the al2o3 membrane fig 18 shows the digital images of the as prepared and heat treated membrane after immersed and ultrasonicated in ro water for 60 min they found the membrane that was not exposed to thermal treatment exhibited wrinkles texture and deformed shape while the heat treated membrane executed a fine and flat as an original rectangular shape this observation supported the thermal treatment improved the mechanical stability of the enpm when tested on oilfield produced water the highly porous coating made of smooth hydrophilic nanofibers facilitated water permeation and the coating effectively captured oil droplets in its opening resulting in improved oil contaminant rejection efficiency the fabricated membrane recorded excellent permeate flux of 640 lm 2 h 1 and an oil rejection percentage of 99 for 180 min crossflow filtration of oil produced water at 2 bars this is due to its sparse mesh morphology which prevented oil pollutants from forming dense fouling film on the surface of the membrane and retained high permeate flux the membrane s excellent fouling resistance and cleaning efficiency are considered beneficial for a repeated long term filtration process 2 3 4 blended electrospinning and carbonization blended electrospinning is defined as blending the photocatalyst into the polymeric substrate while carbonization is defined as heating at high temperature with the presence of nitrogen gas as reported by xu et al they managed to fabricate inorganic based enpm which was carbon nanofibers decorated by tio2 cnfs tio2 by a combination of blended electrospinning and carbonization technique as depicted in fig 19 typically the polymeric substrate pan was dissolved in dmf with vigorous stirring for 12 h to prepare the precursor solution after that the titanium sol containing tetrabutyl titanate and a certain amount of acetic acid was stirred for 1 h before added to the precursor solution by dropwise and vigorously stirred for another 12 h this final spinning solution then was electrospun at an applied voltage of 25 kv a controllable feed rate of 1 ml h and a collecting distance of 20 cm then the as prepared pan blend fibers were vacuum dried at 60 c then the obtained fibers were carbonized in a tube furnace at 500 600 700 800 900 1100 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the resultant cnfs tio2 fibers that fabricated by electrospinning and carbonization showed rougher surface compared to pristine cnf this is due to the addition of tetrabutyl titanate and the carbonization process could improve the grain growth and the transformation of the tio2 crystalline phase however only a little photocatalyst which is tio2 exposed on the surface of cnfs carrier while most of the tio2 nanoparticles were enclosed in the carriers this condition could inhibit the direct irradiation of source light hence reduce the photocatalytic activity however as carbonization temperature increased up to 1100 c the photocatalytic activity of the fibers showed improvement these findings suggested that the effect of temperature of heat treatment on photocatalytic activities depended on the synergistic effect between the adsorptive properties of cnfs the loading amount of tio2 and the phase content of anatases furthermore the blended spinning method could also suppress the transformation of tio2 in the carbonization process from anatase to a rutile stage 2 3 5 hydrothermal and carbonization inorganic based enpm can be fabricated by a combination of electrospinning hydrothermal and heat treatment techniques according to xu et al cnfs tio2 composite with high photocatalytic activity was successfully fabricated by hydrothermal technique 70 as depicted in fig 20 they reported after the pan blend fiber was electrospun the blend fibers were located into 250 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave that was filled with distilled water the temperature of the autoclave remained at 120 c for 12 h before cooled to room temperature naturally this step is crucial to make the surface of the fiber rougher to deposit the photocatalyst then the rough fiber was immersed and stirred in tetrabutyl titanate solution before transferred into the autoclave the second hydrothermal treatment was at 180 c for 12 h the as prepared pan tio2 fibers were rinsed with n butanol and distilled water under ultrasound before dried at 60 c under vacuum overnight to generate dimensional stability of the carbon nanofibers the dried as prepared fibers were stabilized in an air atmosphere at 280 c for 4 h afterward the stabilized fibers were carbonized in a furnace at a high temperature of 500 1100 c for 2 h under nitrogen in terms of morphological carbonization prevents the phase transformation of anatase tio2 into the rutile phase due to the usage of nitrogen gas during the process the anatase phase of tio2 in the composite is an important factor to improve photocatalytic degradation instead of the rutile phase the degree of graphitization of cnfs was improved as the heat treatment temperature increased from 500 1100 c the graphitization representing the conversion of disordered carbon into graphitic carbon this conversion is crucial to improve the adsorptive property of the cnfs therefore fabrication of enpm with high photocatalyst loading and has strong interfacial interaction could be envisioned through hydrothermal with a carbonization technique 3 application of enpm on degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater organic pollutants are defined as a type of chemical pollutant that is primarily composed of carbon hydrogen and potentially other elements 71 the presence of organic pollutants could increase water turbidity and results in eutrophication that reduces the quantity of dissolved oxygen in the water system organic pollutants include dye herbicides humic substances pharmaceutical petroleum pesticides and phenolic are hazardous to the environment 72 commonly organic pollutants in water are caused by anthropogenic activities either from the residential agricultural animal husbandry and industrial wastewater one of the main sources of water pollution is the dye containing wastewater dyes are widely utilized as a colorant in food painting paper cosmetics leather and textile industries traditionally the manufacturing of dyes are extracted from natural plant and insect source and then rapidly turned to synthetic manufacturing processes 73 regrettably some of the dyes have been known are mutagenic and toxic to living organisms therefore innovation remediation approaches need to be explored researchers strongly supported that development of photocatalysts via electrospinning is considered as the most favorable technique to improve photocatalytic performance 41 74 75 this is due to the enhanced specific surface area and minimized electron hole recombination which speeds up the migration of electrons mb is widely utilized as a model compound for organic dyes to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the enpm for instance vild et al reported nearly 100 of mb was successfully degraded after 100 min by the tio2 pmma electrospun nanocomposites fiber 53 to quantitatively determine the reaction kinetics the langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order kinetic models were used however they found the reaction rate constant for the photodegradation of mb by tio2 nanoparticles suspension is three times larger than the tio2 pmma electrospun membrane which is 0 082 min 1 and 0 030 min 1 respectively despite the photodegradation rate of mb by the electrospun membrane is much slower than tio2 suspension the immobilization of the photocatalyst could skip the step to collect the photocatalyst suspension from the aqueous system furthermore the loss of photocatalyst during the treatment could be reduced efficiently panthi et al found almost 100 degradation of mb dye was obtained by immobilized 0 02 m silver phosphate ag3po4 nanoparticles on electrospun pan nanofibers within 60 min 62 as shown in fig 21 a ag3po4 nanoparticles attached densely in agglomerated forms on the surface of the nanofiber the ag3po4 nanoparticles have been acknowledged as a promising visible light driven photocatalyst for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants this is attributed to the low recombination of photogenerated holes h and electrons e the mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of ag3po4 pan composite nanofibers towards mb can be interpreted by the production of reactive oxygen species as explained in fig 21 b with the presence of visible light irradiation ag3po4 released electrons from the valence band vb promoted to its conduction band cb leaving photogenerated holes behind the excited electrons are captured by dissolved o2 in solution to produce o 2 radicals which then react with h to form h2o2 leading to the production of o h radicals at the same time the photogenerated holes also counter with h2o or oh ions to produce o h radicals the presence of these radicals is responsible for the photodegradation performance of agpo4 towards mb the illustration of the mb degradation mechanism can be proposed in fig 21 c briefly with the bombardment of o h radicals the alkyl groups in n ch3 attached to c 7 and c 12 were dissociated and get oxidized into hcooh and hcoh next with the bombardment of o h the bond between cs and cn of the remaining structure of mb also gets broken finally other simpler organic molecules are formed which later continuing oxidized until they are converted into harmless inorganic species such as cl co2 h2o no3 and so4 2 azo dyes have been banned throughout the world owing to their toxicity and mutagenicity effect azo dyes containing azo function n n and have vivid colors like red oranges and yellow the example of azo dyes including aniline yellow bismarck brown congo red direct black 38 and methyl orange mo 73 mo has been extensively utilized as a model compound of azo dyes for the photodegradation analysis 76 77 li et al claimed tungstosilicic acid hydrate h4siw12o40 siw12 cellulose acetate composite nanofibrous membrane exhibited better photocatalytic performance in the degradation of mo dye and tetracycline antibiotic rather than neat siw12 photocatalyst under uv irradiation 78 they found the optimal mass ratio of siw12 to ca was 1 4 and the corresponding degradation efficiency for mo and tetracycline was 94 6 and 63 8 respectively the mo was degraded more efficiently than tetracycline under the same conditions might be attributed to the additional function of cellulose acetate nanofibrous membrane which donated electrons to siw12 during mo degradation this reaction has enhanced the degradation rate of mo rather than tetracycline furthermore the incorporation of siw12 photocatalyst in electrospun cellulose acetate substrate provided more efficient and larger contact area between pollutant and siw12 photocatalyst to enhance performance qayum et al evaluated the photocatalytic activity of pan agbr ag fibrous membrane towards salicylic acid under visible light irradiation 63 they reported approximately 97 of salicylic acid was photodegraded by the fabricated membrane within 5 h they also reported the cycling stability of pan agbr ag membrane up to 96 of degradation efficiency was reserved even after the fifth cycle lian and meng successfully developed tio2 wallpaper made of electrospun tio2 bioglass hybrid nanofiber for discoloration of mb dye solution they compared the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated tio2 wallpaper membrane and tio2 film they investigated the photocatalytic performance of the membrane by varied the thicknesses of the top layer of the tio2 wallpaper the membrane with the thickest top layer 0 051 mm showed mb discoloration of about 60 which is higher than the tio2 film that recorded 33 5 degradation within 120 min this finding revealed that by increasing the thickness of the tio2 wallpaper the porous structure of the nanofibrous still retains to ensure the enlargement of the surface area of the photocatalyst hence the discoloration reaction could be more efficient while as the layer of tio2 film was added up to 4 layers the porous structure of the film could not be maintained and might be closed hence reduce the photocatalytic performance therefore the fabrication of multi layered photocatalyst wallpaper could have potentially adhered to other types of carriers through the heating process recently the usage of polyoxometalates poms as photocatalyst for organic pollutant decomposition has attracted extensive interest among researchers 78 80 poms are defined as transition metal oxygen clusters that are high charge density non toxic controllable size and photostability unfortunately poms are soluble in water and organic solvent which makes the recovery and reusability is challenging furthermore the specific surface area of poms also small therefore there is an urgency to establish convenient host materials for poms which could make them recoverable and improve the contact area for practical applications one of the poms that most studied for photocatalytic degradation was silicotungstic acid h4siw12o40 siw12 this is due to its keggin structure w o w that contributed to the excellent photocatalytic activity and good chemical stability 79 the growth of the agricultural sector worldwide is devoted to the extensive usage of herbicide to control and inhibit the growth of unwanted plants like weeds and grass the herbicides can be absorbed in the ground and released into the groundwater for this reason herbicides are commonly found in agricultural wastewater and need to be treated before consumed by humans and livestock according to xie et al enpm not only could degraded dyes but also very efficient to degrade phenylurea herbicide with low toxicity like isoproturon 55 fig 22 shows the process of isoproturon degradation by cqds bi20tio32 pan electrospun fiber membranes isoproturone removal involved mainly the following three typical stages 1 the cqds bi20tio32 pan electrospun fiber membranes with a hierarchical macro and mesoporous structure encouraged the accumulation of isoproturon molecules on the fiber surface 2 the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalysts on the surface of the fiber absorbed visible light energy to produce electron in the conduction band ecb and photon in the valence band hvb the ecb would migrate to the cqds and react with oxygen to generate radical o 2 3 the active species o 2 and hvb fully degraded the isoproturon molecules to form harmless co2 and h2o enhanced oil recovery eor technology boosts oil production in pressure depleted reservoir by reducing the mobility ratio between in place and pumped fluids and reducing the interfacial and capillary forces recently various eor techniques were introduced such as surfactant and polymer flooding gas flooding microbial modification and steam injection 81 84 polymer flooding was proven as one of the most effective and economic techniques in the eor application 85 however the discharge of untreated polymers as injected fluid into water bodies subsequently leads to serious environmental impacts and affects aquatic life and human health this is due to their complex structure that makes the degradation capability of the polymers in the environment and the aqueous system is very slow photodegradation of these polymers could be more complex by generated several intermediate products before completely degraded into harmless co2 and h2o on the report of hashimah et al photodegradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile hpam by gcn pan nanofibers produced several intermediate products as illustrated in fig 23 86 under uv irradiation the gcn generated hydroxyl radicals to degrade hpam into intermediate such as propionamide before removal of the alkyl group to produce another intermediate product of acetamide in another segment of hpam the alkyl group reacts with h to generate acetic acid at the same time during the degradation of hpam ammonia also formed then photocatalytically converted into nitrite ion before further degraded to nitrate the photodegradation of hpam by gcn pan nanofibers was 90 2 after 180 min of exposure under uv light irradiation additionally the loading of gcn in pan nanofibers was only 10 wt is sufficient to perform an excellent photocatalytic activity this excellent photodegradation performance was contributed by the synergistic effects of adsorption by pan nanofibers and photocatalytic degradation by gcn that impregnated in the pan nanofibers generally photodegradation of organic pollutants from pharmaceutical antibiotic and oilfield wastewater generates harmful intermediate byproducts before they were removed entirely from the water the generation of the intermediate byproducts was reflected by the complex reaction mechanism in the degradation of the organic pollutants for example phenol contains a highly stable structure of the benzene ring which is decomposition resistance photodegradation of phenol by tio2 involved two main phases which are the intermediate phase and mineralization phase 87 in the intermediate phase phenol can convert into several intermediate compounds such as benzoquinone catechol or resorinone by the addition of hydroxyl group at para or ortho position in the phenol structure consequently the ring structure of the phenol was opened which leads to the formation of hydrocarbon chains subsequently these weak and short hydrocarbon chains will be easily oxidized by reactive oxygen species such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 to form co2 and h2o which considered as complete mineralization phase of phenol as depicted in fig 24 besides that the occurrence of the pharmaceutical compound like paracetamol in the environment has drawn attention as a potential contaminant for waters paracetamol also named 4 hydroxyacetanilide is commonly used as an analgesic and antipyretic agent to reduce pain and fever however the excess usage of paracetamol could cause liver failure and even death several researchers reported the complete degradation of paracetamol is difficult to achieve due to the presence of a stable aromatic ring in the structure of paracetamol 88 89 moctezuma et al reported the photodegradation of paracetamol by tio2 under uv irradiation was monitored by total organic carbon toc uv vis high performance liquid chromatography hplc and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis 89 they found there are several intermediate aromatic byproducts such as p aminophenol p nitrophenol which are formed and eventually mineralized they also revealed that oxidation of paracetamol also can happen through an alternative diacylation mechanism involving the development of easily oxidized p aminophenol into p nitrophenol which is transformed to hydroquinone and nitrocatechol in turn the hydroquinone and benzoquinone then are oxidized to low molecular weight carboxylic acids with some hydrocarbon features before completely degraded into simpler molecules like co2 and h2o partial or incomplete degradation of organic pollutants might result in potential secondary pollution in extreme conditions therefore the complete photodegradation of organic pollutants by photocatalyst is crucial before release into the water bodies enpm offers the complete degradation of organic pollutants by providing support to the photocatalyst to allow adsorption of pollutants on the photocatalyst surface before photodegradation however over loaded of the photocatalyst in the membrane support might result in photocatalyst sorbed pollutant leakage with incomplete degradation which contributes to secondary pollution hence the optimization of photocatalyst loading on the enpm is urgently crucial to optimize the performance of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes without deteriorating the physicochemical properties of the membranes 4 challenges and future perspective the impressive degradation performance of enpm as illustrated in table 1 has evidenced the capability of enpm for a wide range of applications for the degradation of harmful organic pollutants however several challenges were identified in the development of enpm such as low mechanical stability filtration properties were neglected high energy consumption and low throughput as well as leaking of photocatalyst from the substrate it is broadly acknowledged that electrospun nanofiber photocatalytic membranes are usually quite fragile brittle and easy to collapse into small pieces due to the large pore size because of that the enpm is commonly used in the form of the mat and simply submerged in the polluted water however this approach requires additional treatment to separate the mat from the treated water the sedimentation of enpm in the treated water engendered generation of secondary pollution therefore the incorporation of enpm on the rigid and robust substrate is highly recommended to improve the mechanical strength and flexibility of the membranes at the same time it also contributed to the easiness of handling and recycling based on our survey most research works demonstrated the fabricated electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes were directly submerged in the polluted solution for photocatalytic degradation while the main function of the membrane which is filtration was neglected this condition restricts the photocatalytic degradation performance of the fabricated nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane there are very limited research works reported on the significance and contribution of filtration toward photocatalytic degradation of pollutants by nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes 65 furthermore the mechanism behind the coupling of filtration and photocatalytic degradation remains unclear there also a scientific question that desperately needs to be addressed through further research such as why filtration can increase the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation therefore there is a need for systematic studies that aimed at studying this mechanism which will promisingly direct future study and practical application of nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane materials another major limitation for enpm fabrication including high voltage utilization high electric field dependency and low throughput therefore it is urgently important to enhance the current fabrication technique of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane there are several emerging solutions of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane that can be proposed such as 1 solution blow spinning 2 plasma induced synthesis 3 centrifugal spinning and 4 melting electrospinning the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane can be proposed to fabricate by solution blow spinning that utilized compressed air for fiber formation solution blow spinning could overcome the limitation of traditional electrospinning especially the utilization of high electrical potential and the complexity in the in situ fabrication of nanofibers this process applied both electrospinning and melt blowing techniques with a greater production rate another scalable technique for the development of enpm is through plasma induced synthesis in this technique the enpm could be fabricated with the assistance of the plasma generated between the electrodes the plasma will be generated underwater without the utilization of any chemical or gas the enpm could be fabricated by the fast bombardment of exceedingly energetic radicals on the surface of electrodes instead of utilizing the electrical field centrifugal spinning can be proposed to fabricate enpm by utilizing centrifugal force to accomplish the promising production of nanofibrous membranes the centrifugal force is generated by a rotating reservoir to extrude the nanofiber generally the depletion of polymer jet into nanofibers is achieved using the controlled monitoring of centrifugal force viscoelasticity and mass transfer features of the spinning solutions the production of nanofibrous membranes through centrifugal force was estimated to be around 500 times greater relative to the conventional electrospinning technique generally the fabrication of enpm employed solution or solvent based electrospinning this technique could result in the leaking of photocatalyst nanoparticles from the substrate and solvent on the contrary another attractive method for the fabrication of enpm is through melt electrospinning in 1936 the concept of melt electrospinning was introduced in norton and truly executed in the 20th century 92 melt electrospinning also known as thermal induced phase inversion utilized hot air oil bath electricity laser to melt the materials 93 this technique is beneficial to fabricate the rigid and insoluble polymers that are difficult to dissolve by a solvent such as polytetrafluoroethylene polyethylene and polypropylene besides that the advantages of melt electrospinning are cleaner and environmentally friendly manufacturing due to the usage of harmful solvents could be forbidden thus post treatment of the residual solvent as usually employed by the solution based electrospinning process is significantly unnecessary fig 25 shows the proposed schematic diagram of the melt electrospinning system that utilized a laser as a heating source the main components of the melt electrospinning setup include 1 feeding system nozzle and feeder 2 high voltage system 3 laser system beam splitter reflector beam baffle laser transmitter and 4 grounded collecting target in this technique the molten electrospun photocatalytic membrane can be formed as larger fiber due to the higher viscosity melt electrospinning offered advancement in terms of immobilization of photocatalyst nanoparticles into the polymeric substrate therefore these proposed solutions were expected could significantly tackle the major limitation of enpm in real wastewater treatment especially in specific restrictions like the agglomeration of photocatalyst solvent recovery consumption of higher voltage lower mechanical stability 5 conclusion the rising need to address water and energy shortage has prompted considerable efforts to deal with the problem currently the implementation of nanotechnology for water treatment is gaining tremendous attention globally nanomaterials fascinated characteristics and their combination with existing technologies pose a promising future for the revolution of existing wastewater treatment therefore researchers in the science and engineering field have been extensively studying the integration of photocatalytic and nanofiber technology to treat the polluted water throughout this review the current status and potential developments throughout photocatalytic nanofibrous technology are addressed with specific attention to their synthesis structural and morphological advancement along with their application in water treatment the current technique like electrospinning coaxial electrospinning electrospraying melt phase separation and precipitation was elaborated in this review we also present the post treatment of enpm through chemical and thermal treatment like surface modification in situ polymerization

13588,presently photocatalytic degradation has emerged as an attractive and efficient technology for water and wastewater treatment many photocatalysts have been introduced and applied to treat organic pollutants in an aqueous system such as dyes antibiotics pharmaceuticals and oily wastes however several hurdles such as difficulty in the suspended photocatalyst segregation from the aqueous system and low reutilization rate urgently need to be addressed for photocatalytic degradation to be independently implemented in wastewater treatment the suspended photocatalyst in wastewater needs to be separated to enable the recovery of the spent photocatalyst efficiently the spent photocatalyst can be regenerated and reused to reduce the operational cost therefore extensive studies have been carried out targeting photocatalyst immobilization in the nanofibrous membrane to promote the photocatalyst s practical usage in natural wastewater treatment this review aims to comprehensively discuss the recent progress of the developed nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane emphasizing advancements in physical and morphological structure towards exhibiting high performance in wastewater treatment performance evaluation challenges and future directions regarding the utilization of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes in wastewater treatment are comprehensively reviewed keywords electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane enpm electrospinning wastewater treatment organic pollutant photocatalytic degradation 1 introduction rapid industrialization has created many serious problems for the water ecosystem leading to the destruction of the climate and human health due to the dumping of chemicals which has caused pollution of lakes rivers oceans and groundwater aquifers several exactor contaminants such as surfactants textile dyes heavy metals insecticides and pesticides are known in the aquatic environment many researchers have focused on removing toxic pollutants from contaminated waters and reducing their dangerous impact on ecosystems various conventional methods such as sedimentation adsorption biological and chemical coagulation have been used extensively for the decontamination of water 1 6 however the effectiveness of these technologies is not sufficient for wastewater treatment besides these methods only transform pollutants into other forms and are not eliminated and destroyed completely among available methods for organic polluted wastewater treatment photocatalytic degradation by nanosized photocatalysts was discovered as the most promising technique this is because of the organic pollutants will be entirely degraded by photocatalyst in the aqueous system photocatalyst has the capability to generate reactive oxygen species such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 which are responsible to mineralize organic pollutants yielding co2 and h2o as harmless end product 7 the generation of reactive oxygen species was mainly initiated by three factors which are 1 energy sources such as visible light ultraviolet uv light ultrasonic and heat 2 primary oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide and 3 catalyst such as titania zinc oxide or other semiconductors when the catalyst is irradiated by an energy source eg uv light the electrons at the valence band are excited to the conductance band leaving positive charge holes in the valence band the electrons and hole pairs then move to the surface of the photocatalyst to involve in a series of redox reactions with the presence of oxygen the electrons reduce the photocatalyst and subsequently react with the oxygen to form superoxide radical anions then electrons and hole pairs further react in water molecules to generate reactive oxygen species organic pollutants can be oxidized by the generated reactive oxygen species to form harmless carbon dioxide and water recently there are various nanosized photocatalyst and their composites were synthesized such as tio2 zno graphitic carbon nitride silver tungsten oxide copper oxide and stanum for wastewater application 8 13 they have a large specific surface area and a functional group that exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance however for photocatalytic degradation to be independently implemented in wastewater treatment several obstacles such as difficulty in the segregation of the suspended photocatalyst from solution and low reutilization rate need to be addressed urgently the powdery formed and suspended nanosized photocatalysts must be extracted before the treated water is reused or released into the environment due to the potential toxicity that resulted from the nanosized dimension photocatalysts and photocatalyst that functionalized with other carcinogen substances they also can be more toxic if the released photocatalyst has not undergone a complete reaction in which degradation not yet happen where the photocatalyst carries the adsorbed pollutant besides the nanosized photocatalyst also unstable and tend to aggregation in the real water application the separation of suspended photocatalyst from wastewater is a challenge which if solved properly would enable regeneration of the spent photocatalyst efficiently to address the above limitation many studies have been carried out targeting to immobilize the nanosized photocatalyst in the substrate such as membranes or floating materials to support the photocatalyst in the solution 7 14 immobilizing photocatalyst into porous membrane is also recognized as photocatalytic membrane 9 photocatalytic membranes can minimize the loss of photocatalyst and maintain efficient photocatalytic degradation 15 the photocatalytic membranes that successfully fabricated for wastewater treatment including polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf titania tio2 16 pvdf titania nanotube tnt 15 polysulfone psf fe tio2 17 psf cu2o 18 and etc however the current photocatalytic membranes require further improvement in the dispersion of photocatalyst and light utilization this is due to conventional photocatalytic membranes commonly were fabricated via simple coating the photocatalyst on the membrane surface or blending the photocatalyst in the membrane substrate then followed by casting 19 21 in terms of separation and photocatalytic degradation this technique may limit the efficiency of these photocatalytic membranes the photocatalysts appear to agglomerate on the membrane surface for the photocatalyst coated membrane thus reducing the effective catalytic region after many activity cycles the coated photocatalyst on the membrane surface often appears to fall off due to poor adhesion while most of the photocatalysts were incorporated in the membrane matrix for the photocatalyst blended membrane resulting in the low implementation of catalysts due to agglomeration within the membrane structure the membrane matrix also can be degraded by undifferentiated photocatalytic reactions thus slowly decreasing the photocatalytic membrane s mechanical stability in addition a small amount of photocatalyst was spread over the top surface of the membrane could reduce photodegradation performance due to the formation of agglomerates a higher dosage of the photocatalyst had induced membrane pore blockage and degradation of the continuous porous structure which had significantly decreased the permeability of the membrane 14 thus it is highly desirable to explore a new approach to tackle this challenging but extremely critical issue it is noteworthy that electrospinning offers a convenient approach to the preparation of nanofibrous substrates with a wide specific area and porosity which displays enormous potential in wastewater treatment nanofibrous membranes with nanoscale diameters give a multitude of fascinating features such as excellent mechanical activity and large surface area to volume ratio high potential for functionalization and remarkable porosity leads to a greater emphasis on water treatment most recently there are several published works highlighted on the progress of the preparation of electrospun nanofibrous membranes and other methods for the removal of contaminants from wastewater 22 27 these published works supported that nanofibrous membranes significantly utilized as promising solution in wastewater treatment there are many techniques relevant to nanofibers production some of which are template synthesis drawing phase separation self assembly and electrospinning 28 29 among these electrospinning is emerging as an easy and reliable technique for preparing smooth nanofibers from a variety of materials with controllable morphology electrospinning applying a high electric field to produce nanofibers from a charged or melting polymer solution in brief the common precursor solution in electrospinning includes the inorganic precursor polymer additive and volatile solvent that should be carefully prepared so that the solution can be easily electrospun electrospinning can be used to generate various morphologies by changing the electrospinning parameters and polymer solution properties on the other hand the electrospinning process tends to be the most effective approach in the manufacture of very small diameter continuous nanofibers and ultrafine fibers it should be noted that fiber with a small diameter is preferred because it can contribute to the superior mechanical efficiency due to its rigidity and tensile strength electrospun nanofibrous membranes are also an excellent substrate to deposit grow functional nanoparticles for various applications like degradation of dyes 30 32 adsorption of heavy metal ions 33 35 membrane distillation 36 38 oily water separation 27 36 and microbial disinfection 30 39 40 in recent decades there has been an increasing trend in research into the development of electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes enpm the development of enpm by integrating photocatalyst into the nanofibrous membrane presented a promising solution for pollutant degradation in wastewater via an advanced oxidation process this is due to their advancements in physical and morphological structure towards high performance in wastewater treatment benefited from the larger specific surface area and higher porosity contributes to an increase of available photocatalytic reaction sites simultaneously promote the efficiency of electron hole pair separation for the first time this review focused on the development of electrospun nanofibrous membranes with photocatalytic properties for wastewater treatment applications this review aims to present the recent progress of the enpm with an emphasis on advancements in physical and morphological structure towards high performance in wastewater treatment importantly the contributions had been made to investigate systematically between the various preparation approaches and the influence of chemical and thermal treatment on the properties and photocatalytic performance of enpm were discussed in this review also the performance evaluation challenges as well as future directions regarding utilization of enpm in wastewater treatment is presented to provide the guidance for researchers in this area 2 advancements in the physical and morphological structure of enpm enpm has offered advancement in term of physical and morphological structure for use in photocatalytic and filtration applications this trend can be based on the following reasons first larger specific surface area due to their uniform diameter and large aspect ratio length to diameter contribute to an increase of available photocatalytic reaction sites simultaneously promote the efficiency of electron hole pair separation 41 second the unique electrospinning process can offer opportunities to fine tune the surface functionality through polymer chemistry 42 blending and nanoparticle incorporation during processing which can effectively uniformly disperse photocatalyst into a polymer based nanofiber this condition contributes to the maximum source light irradiation toward photocatalyst which enhances the photocatalytic performance third because of the three dimensional 3 d interconnected pore framework of electrospun nanofiber membranes and their superior porosity relative to typical polymeric membranes with the two dimensional 2 d framework 43 44 the separation mechanism is triplicate such a multi target separation mechanism is beneficial when the objective is the removal of impurity from the feed stream finally the enpms have high pores interconnectivity with uniform pore sizes and excellent porosity over 80 compared to conventional membranes that fabricated by phase inversion technique which have a porosity around 5 35 45 these properties promote the water permeability of the membrane thus enhance the water filtration performance herein enpm has attracted enormous interest for its great potential in the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater however the common issue of nanofibrous materials is increasing the operating pressure resulted in the deformation of the pore structure and declining the flux this behavior is typical of electrospun mats under hydraulic flow as pressure induced compression causes porosity and hence permeability of the membrane to decrease therefore many efforts and attempts have been taken to tackle these issues 46 researchers came out by varying the fabrication techniques and conducted modifications on photocatalytic membranes to utilize advancement in morphological and physical structure to enhance the photocatalytic and filtration performance 47 50 the details were discussed and reviewed in the following sections 2 1 electrospinning in the late 16th century william gilbert s discovery of electrostatic force in liquids began the development of nanofibrous materials by electrospinning 51 when a piece of charged amber was brought near a spherical drop of water on a dry surface william gilbert believed that the water had deformed into a cone due to an electrostatic attraction now called the taylor cone later in the 20th century electrospinning technology was increasingly evolving into a range of applications electrospinning is an electrohydrodynamic process in which a high potential electric field directly spun the polymeric dope solution to generate nanofibrous materials electrospinning also requires rapid evaporation of solvents and fiber forming droplet solidification 52 in particular the electrospinning device includes four essential components including 1 a metallic or capillary needle 2 a syringe pump 3 a ground conductive collector and 4 a high voltage source 1 30 kv as shown in the fig 1 the polymeric dope processing solution consists of a mixture of photocatalyst nanoparticles polymer powder e g polyacrylonitrile pan pvdf cellulose acetate ca and solvent e g n n dimethylformamide dmf the composition of the dope solution should be based on the desired total solid concentration by changing the ratio of the photocatalyst nanoparticles to the polymer before the electrospinning phase the dope solution must be completely dissolved and homogeneously dispersed by ultrasound with the desired operating frequency the prepared heroin solution was then injected into a hypodermic syringe and placed inside the electrospinning chamber when high enough voltage is applied the dope solution is transferred to elongated fibers spun fibers produced may be collected on a rotating drum or a targeted substrate electrospinning parameters such as flow rate needle diameter tip to collector size and voltage were typically manipulated to the desired application 52 different electrospinning parameters influence the form of the fiber the average diameter and distribution these parameters can be divided into three main categories 1 the properties of the solution molecular weight polymer solvent properties viscosity 2 the parameters of the jet formation needle diameter flow rate humidity temperature and electrical application and 3 the method of collection rotation static disc collector rotation speed as a result the number of parameters affecting the fiber diameter and the average distribution is very high and the experimental design is an efficient method of measuring the parameters with the greatest impact on the fiber properties as a result the researcher used a mathematical method to design multi level experiments to select the best parameters for developing a photocatalytic membrane by electrospinning 53 vild et al built an orthogonal experiment to investigate the effect of electrospinning processing parameters on the distribution and average diameter of poly methyl methacrylate pmma fibers to determine the best electrospinning conditions for smooth fibers without the presence of beads and a small average diameter 53 these fiber characteristics enhance the position of the photocatalyst ceramic particles on the surface of the fiber based on this analysis the increase in the applied electrical field from 0 8 ekv 1 cm 1 to 1 4 ekv 1 cm 1 did not affect the average fiber diameter however the higher average fiber diameter is obtained when the flow rate increases from 1 mlh 1 to 8 ml h 1 they also reported that the content of photocatalysts increased from 10 to 40 wt reducing the average fiber diameter of enpm tio2 pmma from 2 0 to 1 2 mm however the photocatalyst content was not affected by membrane hydrophobicity there are different types of materials that could be used for electrospinning and depending on their application individual material properties should be considered the electrospinning process can be adjusted with the desired morphology and electrospinning properties fig 2 shows the groups of materials used in the electrospinning process 2 1 1 coaxial electrospinning approximately in 2003 coaxial electrospinning technology was introduced to produce core shell engineered fibers with different material properties 54 the coaxial electrospinning technique may be used to combine two different types of polymers into the development of core shell formed micro nanometer scale fibers the creation of core shell structured fibers through coaxial electrospinning has become more critical as it could improve material property profiles for potential applications in particular for environmental purification the coaxial electrospinning method is looking ahead to be fast enough to avoid any mixing of core and shell polymers as well as any compounds from tainting them this technique also provides high mechanical properties porosity hydrophilicity and prevents swelling of the membrane 54 this is due to the synergistic effect produced by a mixture of two different polymers where the strength of the other polymer may overcome the weakness of the polymer the enpm which has been developed by the coaxial electrospinning technique retains good photocatalytic properties by allowing a strong adhesion of photocatalyst to the fiber surface for example xie et al developed carbon quantum dots cqds bi20tio32 pan fiber membrane by preparing a core and sheath solution with different concentrations of pan polymer 55 the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalyst was loaded into the sheath solution to be deposited on the outer surface of the fabricated membrane their results showed that the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalysts were uniformly anchored to the composite fiber surfaces this condition exposes the photocatalyst to source light thus enhancing photocatalytic efficiency however as the loading of photocatalyst increased the average fiber diameter gradually increased and the fiber surface became much rougher this may be due to the higher viscosity of the sheath solution which prevents the extension of the fiber during the electrospinning process the creation of the enpm by coaxial electrospinning technique offers the advancement of the morphological structure by creating a novel design of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane a recent study reported by tang et al has successfully developed a novel tio2 micro nano sphere structure on the surface of nanofiber via coaxial electrospinning technique 56 the core solution consists of polyvinyl acetate butyl titanate acetic acid and tert butyl alcohol and the shell solution consists of polyvinylpyrrolidone butyl titanate acetic acid and ethanol both solutions were put in the heart and shell micropumps of the electrospinning apparatus fig 3 using this approach the resulting scanning electron microscope sem images showed two structures of fabricated membranes a bead structure and an embossed structure having been calcined at 550 c in particular the designs were created by electrical field power where the spherical products were not individually expelled but were firmly embedded to the surface of the nanofiber after drying and calcining in terms of efficiency methylene blue mb was used as a model pollutant to compare the photocatalytic degradation of the different epnm morphological structures involving 1 tio2 nanofiber 2 tio2 micro nano spheres and 3 tio2 micro nanospheres embedded in nanofibers all the membranes were produced in the same process the sem images the primary surface area and the rate of degradation of mb by the fabricated membrane were shown in fig 4 a e as well the degradation rate of tio2 micro nano spheres embedded in nanofibers is higher than that of tio2 micro nano spheres and tio2 nanofibers due to a higher effective surface area of 23 852 m2 g compared to tio2 micro nano spheres 22 270 m2 g and tio2 nanofibers 18 463 m2 g this result may be linked to the novel structure of tio2 micro nano spheres embedded in nanofibers combined with the advantages of the two structural types of nanofibers and micro nano spheres besides tio2 micro nanosphere embedded nanofibers display larger nanofiber gaps that are advantageous for uv light utilization and could increase photocatalytic performance 56 2 1 2 electrospinning and electrospraying the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying is another promising technique for the development of polymeric based enpm that attracted the researcher s attention the electrospraying technique uses electrical forces to atomize liquid material under high electrical potential coulombic s repulsion between the surface charge disperses the dope solution ejected from the needle nozzle into finely charged droplets the size of the droplet can be regulated by the feed rate and the voltage parameters previous studies indicated that the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying has been shown to be effective in the manufacture of flexible photoelectrodes for solar cells 57 and fuel cells 58 the combination of these two strategies may therefore lead to the creation of a versatile and effective enpm ramasundaram et al have recently manufactured highly versatile and porous paper like poly vinylidenefluoride tio2 membranes using sequential electrospinning and electrospraying techniques for photocatalytic applications 59 technically the photocatalyst dispersion of tio2 was electro sprayed on the surface of the electrospun pvdf mat developed by the electrospinning technique the subsequent morphological study indicated that the electrosprayed tio2 is deposited as clusters in a single pot on the pvdf mat the photocatalytic behavior of the electrosprayed tio2 pvdf mat is compared to the non porous pvdf tio2 film generated by solution casting with a similar amount of photocatalyst pvdf tio2 mat was found to have significantly higher photocatalytic activity compared to pvdf tio2 film this finding is mainly due to the porous structure of the electrospun pvdf tio2 mat that promotes larger photocatalyst activation sites allowing higher photocatalytic efficiency however the formation of photocatalyst clusters on the upper surface of the pvdf mat will increase the detachment from the substrate during actual operation additionally this method requires two distinct electrospinning and electrospraying methods which work separately and entail additional costs and time consuming costs since electrospinning and electrospraying are essentially the same electrohydrodynamic based process they can be combined into a single unit called simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying see system pahasup et al used the see method to generate and interlock microscopic tio2 photocatalyst clusters inside the non woven nylon 6 electrospun membrane network as shown in fig 5 60 anatase tio2 suspensions were produced at a concentration of 2 5 5 and 10 wt the nylon 6 solution and the tio2 suspension were fed into separate syringe pumps and ejected via the respective metallic needle connected to a high voltage supply with opposite polarity the base layer of the membrane was initially formed by electrospinning nylon 6 solution for 15 min using 25 kv of the applied voltage the nylon 6 nanofibrous network and the tio2 suspension at concentrations of 2 5 5 and 10 tn 2 5 tn 5 and tn 10 respectively were electrospun and electrosprayed at the same time to create a nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane for 4 h before drying in the oven at 80 c for 24 h the corresponding xrd spectra showed that the range of the developed membranes is well aligned with the anatase tio2 content which confirmed that the tio2 nanoparticles were successfully integrated into the nylon 6 membrane using see the resulting uv vis transmittance spectra showed that the formation of tio2 microclusters in the enpm produced using this technique did not interfere with the optical properties of anatase tio2 particles having almost identical photocatalytic activity within the same wavelength at 390 393 nm by using mb as a model pollutant all nylon 6 tio2 enpm fabricated using see technology recorded almost 99 removal after 120 min 60 these results have shown that the combination of electrospinning and electrospraying contributes to an efficient and simple technique for reducing the detachment of nanoparticle photocatalysts from the nanocomposite membrane however after 5 cycles of photocatalytic treatment the highest loaded membrane the tn 10 membrane experienced a weight loss of about 10 due to the degradation of photocatalyst microclusters as shown in fig 6 the results suggested that the mechanical strength of the current state of the nylon 6 tio2 enpm was moderate further improvement in the mechanical stability of the enpm produced by ees is therefore needed to withstand the severe conditions of the real application of water treatment 2 1 3 melt phase separation recently the manufacture of large scale photocatalytic nanofibrous membranes was conducted using a simple and easy process known as the process of melt phase separation and suspension coating 31 commonly previous research on nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes focused mainly on the individual performance of photocatalytic and filtration while only a few works were done on their synergistic performance this is due to their poor mechanical stability low reusability and very high porosity that can result in the weak interface between the photocatalyst and the support of the membrane the melt phase separation technique may therefore give advancement in terms of the membrane s morphological and physical structure which are the critical criteria for the efficiency of membrane filtration just as seen in fig 7 a this technique involved the preparation of mixed composite pellets by dispersing the tio2 photocatalyst into polyvinyl alcohol co ethylene pva co pe before being combined with cellulose acetate butyrate cab for the melt extrusion method the temperature of processing ranged from 190 to 230 c another research was conducted using the same method and the composite suspension cab pva co pe tio2 was sprayed onto the polyproline substratum to form a nanofibrous membrane for photocatalytic degradation and filtration of mb three concentrations of tio2 were used to enhance photocatalytic activity and filtration efficiency which are 1 3 and 5 they reported no significant difference in the water contact angles of the synthesized membranes due to varying the loading of tio2 this finding suggested that most of the photocatalysts were successfully impregnated in the interior part of the nanofibers as seen in the transmission electron microscope tem picture fig 7 b the hybrid membrane ftir spectrum becomes sharper than the pristine sample after tio2 loading has indicated an interaction between tio2 nanoparticles and polymer molecule due to hydrogen bond formation inside the fabricated membrane fig 7 c the formation of a new hydrogen bond between the alkyl group hydrogen in the polymer chain and abundant hydroxyl groups on the tio2 surface may characterize these potential affections 2 1 4 electrospinning and precipitation process bai et al manufactured a new stand alone p n nanoheterojunction photocatalyst with yttrium stabilized zirconia ysz nanofibers as the backbone to support the tio2 nanoparticles and ag2o nanocrystals through a combination of electrospinning technique and precipitation method as shown in fig 8 61 initially the ysz tio2 nanofibers backbone was fabricated through the electrospinning technique and calcined at 800 c then the fabricated ysz tio2 membranes were immersed into the alkaline agno3 solution then irradiated for 1 h by a 24 w uv lamp to develop the ag2o ysz tio2 p n nanoheterojunction enpm through the precipitation process the weight ratio of agno3 and ysz tio2 membranes was adjusted from 0 1 1 0 3 1 to 0 5 1 and named as azt 1 azt 3 and azt 5 respectively the optimum weight ratio of agno3 and ysz tio2 was 0 3 1 azt 3 which recorded the smallest bandgap energy of 2 89 ev as estimated from the kubelka munk equation fig 9 a b showed the fesem images and surface area of the ysz tio2 membrane before and after precipitation of ag2o3 azt 3 after the precipitation process the color of the membrane was changed from white to grey which confirmed the attachment of ag2o the results also revealed the precipitation process not only increased the total surface of the membrane it also retains the flexibility of the membranes before the small size of the ag2o2 grain precipitated in the resultant membrane fabrication of enpm through the combination of electrospinning and precipitation method gives a new insight into the designation of flexible enpm for wastewater treatment as compared to conventional electrospinning this method can be facilitated to develop high efficiency nanoheterojunction nanocrystalline photocatalyst membranes to meet high performance photocatalytic membrane 2 2 chemical modification modification of enpm 2 2 1 surface modification in the method of wet chemical treatment the moderately inert polymer nanofiber is treated with a chemical that provides reactive functional groups like amine carboxyl hydroxyl or nitrile groups it depends on whether the polymer molecule sites are susceptible to nuclear or electrophilic attack nanofiber material is commonly soaked into an alkaline medium to form a hydroxyl or carboxylic group on the nanofiber surface surface modification of the polymeric nanofibrous membrane substrate could enhance the interaction or deposition of photocatalyst particles onto the surface of the substrate for instance panthi et al reported ag3po4 pan composite nanofibers were developed by a straightforward and flexible method which is electrospinning and followed by surface modification of pan nanofibers by treating with nh2oh aqueous solution for 15 min at 65 c 62 as illustrated in fig 10 during the treatment the nitrile groups of pan were transformed into amidoxime groups which were employed to anchor ag ions on the surface of pan nanofibers then the ag ions further reacted with po4 3 ions to form ag3po4 nanoparticles to achieve enhanced efficiency the combination of amidoxime functional groups with ag3po4 nanoparticles in the system was expected to be an effective technique for proper attachment of nanoparticles to further enhance the attachment of photocatalyst nanoparticles within the electrospun nanofibrous polymeric substrate additional treatment like hydrothermal was proposed kim et al successfully developed polydopamine assisted zno nanorods pdopa znrs polyurethane pu enpm by integrating electrospinning surface functionalization and hydrothermal treatment 40 firstly after the pu nanofibers were electrospun the fibers were immersed in dopamine hydrochloride solution mixed with a tris hcl buffer for 12 h as reported by kim et al the immersion process enables the functionalization of nanofibers with the polydopamine where the surface of the nanofibers will significantly be altered then enabling the interaction with nanoparticles this is a novel strategy to impregnate the photocatalyst nanoparticles into the surface of the nanofibers without deteriorating their mechanical properties later to attach the photocatalyst the resulting polydopamine coated pu nanofibrous mat was immersed in aqueous zno nanoparticles solution then the hydrothermal process took place to grow the zno nanorods on the surface of the nanofibers the fabrication flow path was demonstrated in fig 11 they found the zno nanorods strongly adhered to the surface of the polydopamine functionalized nanofibers in terms of performance at low intensity uv led devices this resulting polydopamine znrs pu nanofibers had strong photocatalytic antimicrobial activity with good reusability the catechol group in polydopamine not only induces adhesion of zno nanostructures but also serves as an electron trap preventing the recombination of e h pairs and thereby enhancing the photocatalytic effectiveness of the resulting enpm qayum et al designed and fabricated multifunctional pan agbr ag fibrous membranes by using electrospinning and wet chemical methods 63 they fabricated pan agbr ag fibrous membrane through four main steps and the fabricated samples were labeled as fm1 fm2 fm3 and fm 4 respectively as illustrated in fig 12 a sem images revealed the growth of the photocatalyst on the pan fiber from each step starting from electrospinning heat treatment febr3 treatment and followed by uv light irradiation fig 12 b e the growth of ag nanoparticles on the surface of agbr that is embedded in the pan fiber was observed at the end of the process as shown in fig 12 f these findings indicated the formation of agbr ag schottky junction could enhance the photocatalytic performance due to the improvement of the electron density of agbr due to the surface plasmon resonance effect of ag nanoparticles and narrow bandgap of agbr 64 it also could efficiently inhibit the exfoliation of the photocatalyst nanoparticles from pan nanofibrous membrane during real application 2 2 2 in situ polymerization due to the issue of nanofibrous photocatalysts which are commonly breakable and have small recoverable deformation an innovative approach is highly desirable for the development of flexible stronger and stable nanofibrous photocatalyst coupling the electrospinning and the in situ polymerization has been proven as an adequate method for the fabrication of inorganic based enpm for pollutant degradation this method was believed could maintain the structural integrity upon large deformation of the nanofibrous photocatalyst zhang et al developed the flexible and hierarchical mesoporous tio2 nanoparticles modified tio2 nanofibers tinfnp composites by the combination of the electrospinning and the in situ polymerization 32 in this technique the tio2 photocatalyst nanoparticles were decorated on the pristine electrospun titanium dioxide nanofibers tinf that served as a template the white electrospun tinf then was immersed into the solution that contained tio2 nanoparticle bifunctional benzoxazine and acetone before dried and transferred into a vacuum at 200 c for 1 h to process with in situ polymerizations of bifunctional benzoxazine ba a monomers which led to the generation of the polybenzoxazine pbz layer on the surface of tinf the color of the fabricated pbz tinf was yellow the pbz was employed as a carrier and fixative to prevent the agglomeration of photocatalyst nanoparticles then the membrane was calcined at 550 c for 2 h under n2 flow and generated a black tio2 nanofibrous membrane the schematic diagram of the fabrication process and the resulted membranes were illustrated in fig 13 the fabricated enpm was tested for degradation of mb they found the mb was degraded within 30 min the photodegradation performance of the fabricated membrane also greater than commercial catalysts like p25 crucially the efficient synthesis of these fascinating materials may provide a favorable platform for further production of photoreactors based on the nanofibrous membrane to treat water and air pollutants 2 3 effect of thermal treatment 2 3 1 calcination thermal treatment was conducted on inorganic materials to strengthen and advance their morphological and physical structure through improvement in durability and crystallinity recently the development of inorganic based enpm has widely attracted attention among researchers this is due to their high mechanical and thermal stability the inorganic membrane could overcome the limitation of the organic membranes as they can be easily deteriorated by photocatalytic degradation due to long term exposure to the source light like uv rays in the fabrication of enpm thermal treatment was executed to enhance the intrinsic properties of membranes such as wettability mechanical thermal and distribution of pore size thermal treatment of nanofibrous membrane including heating calcination and hydrothermal calcination is defined as a process of heating a substance to high temperatures under controlled temperature and in a controlled environment commonly calcination is applied to treat inorganic or ceramic materials to improve their mechanical and thermal stability gao et al fabricated a novel electrospun inorganic based enpm through electrospinning and calcination methods 65 they prepared the electrospun reduced graphene oxide titanium dioxide nanofibrous rgo tif membrane for photocatalytic degradation of propranolol in wastewater the optimum calcination temperature was found out to be 450 c and the ideal rgo tio2 loading ratio was 2 fig 14 a b show sem images of rgo tif membranes before and after calcination the found the diameter of fiber decreased and an obvious shrinkage was noticed for all membranes after calcined at 450 c these changes could have resulted in the mass loss of residual solvent and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as pore former during the calcination process the mechanical properties of the fabricated membrane also good and matched the requirement for filtration application purposes fig 14 c e besides that the average pore size of the calcined membranes significantly increased from 0 167 to 0 175 Î¼m in terms of photocatalytic and filtration performance after calcination the rgo tif membrane achieved up to 100 removal of propranolol and reported high water permeability attributed to their highly porous properties respectively apart from metal oxides utilization of metal organic framework mof as a precursor for the development of enpm has come to the forefront 66 enpm that developed by mof could be benefitted from their unique crossed network connection exceptionally large surface area and highly porous structure 1 calcination treatment is compulsory for the fabrication of mof based enpm to retain their unique morphology structures for instance hou et al developed c doped coupled tio2 zno enpm by manipulated the morphology and catalytic properties of the membrane by the growth of one of the subclasses of the mof which is zif 8 that has cube structures 66 the c doped tio2 zno enpm was fabricated by combining electrospinning and two step calcination of zif 8 nanocrystals as shown in fig 15 the first step calcination at 350 c to obtain composite fiber tio2 zif 8 n in the air for 2 h then the second calcination at 400 c for the transformation of tio2 zif 8 to c doped tio2 zno n at 400 c for 1 h after zno cubes were introduced the composite membrane with optimized zno cubes exhibited greater specific surface area 30 2475 m2 g compared to pristine tio2 nanofibers 11 4341 m2 g the morphological study showed zno cubes and tio2 nanofibers attached to each other and formed a cross sectional network in sample c doped tio2 zno creating further opportunities for the photocatalysis of organic contaminants for photogenerated holes and electrons to participate besides the cross network link between tio2 and zno cubes is propitious to increase the heterojunction synergy and thereby effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons taking advantage of the trinomial synergistic effect of carbon doping zno and tio2 the as designed composite membrane showed excellent photocatalytic performance by reached 92 which is nearly 3 times higher compared to pure tio2 nanofibers in rhb degradation furthermore the prepared membrane exhibited lower emission intensity relative to pure tio2 nanofibers suggesting successful inhibition of the recombination of holes and electrons chen et al developed graphene oxide polyacrylonitrile go pan nanofibrous membranes through electrospinning followed by calcination and solvothermal as shown in fig 16 a 67 firstly electrospinning was carried out to prepare the go pan nanofibrous membrane then the membrane was calcined at 550 c for 3 h in n2 to obtain the intermediate product called go carbon nanofibers cnfs membrane the calcined membrane then was covered by zinc sulfide zns nanoparticles to form go zn s cnfs via the solvothermal method the specific surface area of the resultant membrane was significantly higher than the go pan membrane before calcination due to the addition of zns nanoparticles while the mean pore diameter of the prepared membrane dropped from 72 87 to 40 86 nm the surface area increased significantly from 7 60 to 22 31 m2 g when tested for the conversion of 4 aminotoluene into 4 nitrotoluene under uv light the conversion percent reached to 90 this is because of the synergistic effect between the zns photocatalytic activity and the excellent go cnf adsorption ability the resulting go zn s cnfs membrane also demonstrated excellent mechanical strength allowing them to retain their original structure even after crushing and folding as depicted in fig 16 b c 2 3 2 calcination and rapid heating in previous work meng et al successfully fabricated a high efficiency microfluidic based photocatalytic microreactor by using electrospun nanofibrous tio2 as a photocatalyst 68 firstly the nanofibrous tio2 was developed by the electrospinning of the tio2 precursor then the tio2 precursor was transformed into the tio2 nanofiber via calcination the calcined electrospun photocatalyst then was sealed in the glass by using pdms that functioning as glue however the thick layer of glue will cover the photocatalytic fiber hence reduce photocatalytic efficiency later the same research group innovated the method by introducing a simple heating technique by melting the bottom layer of the nanofibers to adhere to them on the surface of carriers such as a copper plate or glass fig 17 a 69 the heating treatment took only 5 10 s via a cassette flamethrower as illustrated in fig 17 b the resultant tio2 nanofibers were composed of three layers which are upper middle and bottom layer fig 17 c k show the sem images of the layers of tio2 nanofibers before and after heating for 5 and 10 s respectively by heating the nanofiber for 10 s it was found that the porous structure of three layer nanofibrous gradually shrunk until closing the pores however the porous structure of the top layer of the membrane remains to exist even the heating duration was 5 s therefore 5 s was chosen as the optimum heating time as the nanofiber would adhere on the carrier without damaging the porous and fibrous structure furthermore the xrd pattern of the top layer of nanofibers remains unchanged and no rutile phase characteristic peak observed after flame calcination due to the rapid heating process this indicated the tio2 on the top layer of nanofibers was pure anatase phase even after calcination this method could be a potential technique in the preparation of the photocatalytic based product 2 3 3 coating and heating treatment thermal treatment is crucial for enpm that is fabricated via the coating process the thermal treatment was believed could prevent the leakage of photocatalyst nanoparticles from the porous structure of the enpm and enhance the mechanical stability of the robust structure of enpm for instance alias et al fabricated an enpm by coating nanosheet graphitic carbon nitride gcn embedded pan nanofiber on top of asymmetric alumina al2o3 hollow fiber membrane surface by using direct electrospinning technique and followed by thermal treatment 14 to overcome the robust issues of electrospun membrane and leaching of photocatalyst from the substrate the as fabricated membrane was subjected to continuous heating at 120 c for 15 min the thermal treatment greatly improved the adhesion of the nanofiber coating to the al2o3 membrane fig 18 shows the digital images of the as prepared and heat treated membrane after immersed and ultrasonicated in ro water for 60 min they found the membrane that was not exposed to thermal treatment exhibited wrinkles texture and deformed shape while the heat treated membrane executed a fine and flat as an original rectangular shape this observation supported the thermal treatment improved the mechanical stability of the enpm when tested on oilfield produced water the highly porous coating made of smooth hydrophilic nanofibers facilitated water permeation and the coating effectively captured oil droplets in its opening resulting in improved oil contaminant rejection efficiency the fabricated membrane recorded excellent permeate flux of 640 lm 2 h 1 and an oil rejection percentage of 99 for 180 min crossflow filtration of oil produced water at 2 bars this is due to its sparse mesh morphology which prevented oil pollutants from forming dense fouling film on the surface of the membrane and retained high permeate flux the membrane s excellent fouling resistance and cleaning efficiency are considered beneficial for a repeated long term filtration process 2 3 4 blended electrospinning and carbonization blended electrospinning is defined as blending the photocatalyst into the polymeric substrate while carbonization is defined as heating at high temperature with the presence of nitrogen gas as reported by xu et al they managed to fabricate inorganic based enpm which was carbon nanofibers decorated by tio2 cnfs tio2 by a combination of blended electrospinning and carbonization technique as depicted in fig 19 typically the polymeric substrate pan was dissolved in dmf with vigorous stirring for 12 h to prepare the precursor solution after that the titanium sol containing tetrabutyl titanate and a certain amount of acetic acid was stirred for 1 h before added to the precursor solution by dropwise and vigorously stirred for another 12 h this final spinning solution then was electrospun at an applied voltage of 25 kv a controllable feed rate of 1 ml h and a collecting distance of 20 cm then the as prepared pan blend fibers were vacuum dried at 60 c then the obtained fibers were carbonized in a tube furnace at 500 600 700 800 900 1100 c for 2 h under n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the resultant cnfs tio2 fibers that fabricated by electrospinning and carbonization showed rougher surface compared to pristine cnf this is due to the addition of tetrabutyl titanate and the carbonization process could improve the grain growth and the transformation of the tio2 crystalline phase however only a little photocatalyst which is tio2 exposed on the surface of cnfs carrier while most of the tio2 nanoparticles were enclosed in the carriers this condition could inhibit the direct irradiation of source light hence reduce the photocatalytic activity however as carbonization temperature increased up to 1100 c the photocatalytic activity of the fibers showed improvement these findings suggested that the effect of temperature of heat treatment on photocatalytic activities depended on the synergistic effect between the adsorptive properties of cnfs the loading amount of tio2 and the phase content of anatases furthermore the blended spinning method could also suppress the transformation of tio2 in the carbonization process from anatase to a rutile stage 2 3 5 hydrothermal and carbonization inorganic based enpm can be fabricated by a combination of electrospinning hydrothermal and heat treatment techniques according to xu et al cnfs tio2 composite with high photocatalytic activity was successfully fabricated by hydrothermal technique 70 as depicted in fig 20 they reported after the pan blend fiber was electrospun the blend fibers were located into 250 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave that was filled with distilled water the temperature of the autoclave remained at 120 c for 12 h before cooled to room temperature naturally this step is crucial to make the surface of the fiber rougher to deposit the photocatalyst then the rough fiber was immersed and stirred in tetrabutyl titanate solution before transferred into the autoclave the second hydrothermal treatment was at 180 c for 12 h the as prepared pan tio2 fibers were rinsed with n butanol and distilled water under ultrasound before dried at 60 c under vacuum overnight to generate dimensional stability of the carbon nanofibers the dried as prepared fibers were stabilized in an air atmosphere at 280 c for 4 h afterward the stabilized fibers were carbonized in a furnace at a high temperature of 500 1100 c for 2 h under nitrogen in terms of morphological carbonization prevents the phase transformation of anatase tio2 into the rutile phase due to the usage of nitrogen gas during the process the anatase phase of tio2 in the composite is an important factor to improve photocatalytic degradation instead of the rutile phase the degree of graphitization of cnfs was improved as the heat treatment temperature increased from 500 1100 c the graphitization representing the conversion of disordered carbon into graphitic carbon this conversion is crucial to improve the adsorptive property of the cnfs therefore fabrication of enpm with high photocatalyst loading and has strong interfacial interaction could be envisioned through hydrothermal with a carbonization technique 3 application of enpm on degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater organic pollutants are defined as a type of chemical pollutant that is primarily composed of carbon hydrogen and potentially other elements 71 the presence of organic pollutants could increase water turbidity and results in eutrophication that reduces the quantity of dissolved oxygen in the water system organic pollutants include dye herbicides humic substances pharmaceutical petroleum pesticides and phenolic are hazardous to the environment 72 commonly organic pollutants in water are caused by anthropogenic activities either from the residential agricultural animal husbandry and industrial wastewater one of the main sources of water pollution is the dye containing wastewater dyes are widely utilized as a colorant in food painting paper cosmetics leather and textile industries traditionally the manufacturing of dyes are extracted from natural plant and insect source and then rapidly turned to synthetic manufacturing processes 73 regrettably some of the dyes have been known are mutagenic and toxic to living organisms therefore innovation remediation approaches need to be explored researchers strongly supported that development of photocatalysts via electrospinning is considered as the most favorable technique to improve photocatalytic performance 41 74 75 this is due to the enhanced specific surface area and minimized electron hole recombination which speeds up the migration of electrons mb is widely utilized as a model compound for organic dyes to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the enpm for instance vild et al reported nearly 100 of mb was successfully degraded after 100 min by the tio2 pmma electrospun nanocomposites fiber 53 to quantitatively determine the reaction kinetics the langmuir hinshelwood pseudo first order kinetic models were used however they found the reaction rate constant for the photodegradation of mb by tio2 nanoparticles suspension is three times larger than the tio2 pmma electrospun membrane which is 0 082 min 1 and 0 030 min 1 respectively despite the photodegradation rate of mb by the electrospun membrane is much slower than tio2 suspension the immobilization of the photocatalyst could skip the step to collect the photocatalyst suspension from the aqueous system furthermore the loss of photocatalyst during the treatment could be reduced efficiently panthi et al found almost 100 degradation of mb dye was obtained by immobilized 0 02 m silver phosphate ag3po4 nanoparticles on electrospun pan nanofibers within 60 min 62 as shown in fig 21 a ag3po4 nanoparticles attached densely in agglomerated forms on the surface of the nanofiber the ag3po4 nanoparticles have been acknowledged as a promising visible light driven photocatalyst for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants this is attributed to the low recombination of photogenerated holes h and electrons e the mechanism for photocatalytic degradation of ag3po4 pan composite nanofibers towards mb can be interpreted by the production of reactive oxygen species as explained in fig 21 b with the presence of visible light irradiation ag3po4 released electrons from the valence band vb promoted to its conduction band cb leaving photogenerated holes behind the excited electrons are captured by dissolved o2 in solution to produce o 2 radicals which then react with h to form h2o2 leading to the production of o h radicals at the same time the photogenerated holes also counter with h2o or oh ions to produce o h radicals the presence of these radicals is responsible for the photodegradation performance of agpo4 towards mb the illustration of the mb degradation mechanism can be proposed in fig 21 c briefly with the bombardment of o h radicals the alkyl groups in n ch3 attached to c 7 and c 12 were dissociated and get oxidized into hcooh and hcoh next with the bombardment of o h the bond between cs and cn of the remaining structure of mb also gets broken finally other simpler organic molecules are formed which later continuing oxidized until they are converted into harmless inorganic species such as cl co2 h2o no3 and so4 2 azo dyes have been banned throughout the world owing to their toxicity and mutagenicity effect azo dyes containing azo function n n and have vivid colors like red oranges and yellow the example of azo dyes including aniline yellow bismarck brown congo red direct black 38 and methyl orange mo 73 mo has been extensively utilized as a model compound of azo dyes for the photodegradation analysis 76 77 li et al claimed tungstosilicic acid hydrate h4siw12o40 siw12 cellulose acetate composite nanofibrous membrane exhibited better photocatalytic performance in the degradation of mo dye and tetracycline antibiotic rather than neat siw12 photocatalyst under uv irradiation 78 they found the optimal mass ratio of siw12 to ca was 1 4 and the corresponding degradation efficiency for mo and tetracycline was 94 6 and 63 8 respectively the mo was degraded more efficiently than tetracycline under the same conditions might be attributed to the additional function of cellulose acetate nanofibrous membrane which donated electrons to siw12 during mo degradation this reaction has enhanced the degradation rate of mo rather than tetracycline furthermore the incorporation of siw12 photocatalyst in electrospun cellulose acetate substrate provided more efficient and larger contact area between pollutant and siw12 photocatalyst to enhance performance qayum et al evaluated the photocatalytic activity of pan agbr ag fibrous membrane towards salicylic acid under visible light irradiation 63 they reported approximately 97 of salicylic acid was photodegraded by the fabricated membrane within 5 h they also reported the cycling stability of pan agbr ag membrane up to 96 of degradation efficiency was reserved even after the fifth cycle lian and meng successfully developed tio2 wallpaper made of electrospun tio2 bioglass hybrid nanofiber for discoloration of mb dye solution they compared the photocatalytic performance of the fabricated tio2 wallpaper membrane and tio2 film they investigated the photocatalytic performance of the membrane by varied the thicknesses of the top layer of the tio2 wallpaper the membrane with the thickest top layer 0 051 mm showed mb discoloration of about 60 which is higher than the tio2 film that recorded 33 5 degradation within 120 min this finding revealed that by increasing the thickness of the tio2 wallpaper the porous structure of the nanofibrous still retains to ensure the enlargement of the surface area of the photocatalyst hence the discoloration reaction could be more efficient while as the layer of tio2 film was added up to 4 layers the porous structure of the film could not be maintained and might be closed hence reduce the photocatalytic performance therefore the fabrication of multi layered photocatalyst wallpaper could have potentially adhered to other types of carriers through the heating process recently the usage of polyoxometalates poms as photocatalyst for organic pollutant decomposition has attracted extensive interest among researchers 78 80 poms are defined as transition metal oxygen clusters that are high charge density non toxic controllable size and photostability unfortunately poms are soluble in water and organic solvent which makes the recovery and reusability is challenging furthermore the specific surface area of poms also small therefore there is an urgency to establish convenient host materials for poms which could make them recoverable and improve the contact area for practical applications one of the poms that most studied for photocatalytic degradation was silicotungstic acid h4siw12o40 siw12 this is due to its keggin structure w o w that contributed to the excellent photocatalytic activity and good chemical stability 79 the growth of the agricultural sector worldwide is devoted to the extensive usage of herbicide to control and inhibit the growth of unwanted plants like weeds and grass the herbicides can be absorbed in the ground and released into the groundwater for this reason herbicides are commonly found in agricultural wastewater and need to be treated before consumed by humans and livestock according to xie et al enpm not only could degraded dyes but also very efficient to degrade phenylurea herbicide with low toxicity like isoproturon 55 fig 22 shows the process of isoproturon degradation by cqds bi20tio32 pan electrospun fiber membranes isoproturone removal involved mainly the following three typical stages 1 the cqds bi20tio32 pan electrospun fiber membranes with a hierarchical macro and mesoporous structure encouraged the accumulation of isoproturon molecules on the fiber surface 2 the cqds bi20tio32 photocatalysts on the surface of the fiber absorbed visible light energy to produce electron in the conduction band ecb and photon in the valence band hvb the ecb would migrate to the cqds and react with oxygen to generate radical o 2 3 the active species o 2 and hvb fully degraded the isoproturon molecules to form harmless co2 and h2o enhanced oil recovery eor technology boosts oil production in pressure depleted reservoir by reducing the mobility ratio between in place and pumped fluids and reducing the interfacial and capillary forces recently various eor techniques were introduced such as surfactant and polymer flooding gas flooding microbial modification and steam injection 81 84 polymer flooding was proven as one of the most effective and economic techniques in the eor application 85 however the discharge of untreated polymers as injected fluid into water bodies subsequently leads to serious environmental impacts and affects aquatic life and human health this is due to their complex structure that makes the degradation capability of the polymers in the environment and the aqueous system is very slow photodegradation of these polymers could be more complex by generated several intermediate products before completely degraded into harmless co2 and h2o on the report of hashimah et al photodegradation of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile hpam by gcn pan nanofibers produced several intermediate products as illustrated in fig 23 86 under uv irradiation the gcn generated hydroxyl radicals to degrade hpam into intermediate such as propionamide before removal of the alkyl group to produce another intermediate product of acetamide in another segment of hpam the alkyl group reacts with h to generate acetic acid at the same time during the degradation of hpam ammonia also formed then photocatalytically converted into nitrite ion before further degraded to nitrate the photodegradation of hpam by gcn pan nanofibers was 90 2 after 180 min of exposure under uv light irradiation additionally the loading of gcn in pan nanofibers was only 10 wt is sufficient to perform an excellent photocatalytic activity this excellent photodegradation performance was contributed by the synergistic effects of adsorption by pan nanofibers and photocatalytic degradation by gcn that impregnated in the pan nanofibers generally photodegradation of organic pollutants from pharmaceutical antibiotic and oilfield wastewater generates harmful intermediate byproducts before they were removed entirely from the water the generation of the intermediate byproducts was reflected by the complex reaction mechanism in the degradation of the organic pollutants for example phenol contains a highly stable structure of the benzene ring which is decomposition resistance photodegradation of phenol by tio2 involved two main phases which are the intermediate phase and mineralization phase 87 in the intermediate phase phenol can convert into several intermediate compounds such as benzoquinone catechol or resorinone by the addition of hydroxyl group at para or ortho position in the phenol structure consequently the ring structure of the phenol was opened which leads to the formation of hydrocarbon chains subsequently these weak and short hydrocarbon chains will be easily oxidized by reactive oxygen species such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 to form co2 and h2o which considered as complete mineralization phase of phenol as depicted in fig 24 besides that the occurrence of the pharmaceutical compound like paracetamol in the environment has drawn attention as a potential contaminant for waters paracetamol also named 4 hydroxyacetanilide is commonly used as an analgesic and antipyretic agent to reduce pain and fever however the excess usage of paracetamol could cause liver failure and even death several researchers reported the complete degradation of paracetamol is difficult to achieve due to the presence of a stable aromatic ring in the structure of paracetamol 88 89 moctezuma et al reported the photodegradation of paracetamol by tio2 under uv irradiation was monitored by total organic carbon toc uv vis high performance liquid chromatography hplc and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis 89 they found there are several intermediate aromatic byproducts such as p aminophenol p nitrophenol which are formed and eventually mineralized they also revealed that oxidation of paracetamol also can happen through an alternative diacylation mechanism involving the development of easily oxidized p aminophenol into p nitrophenol which is transformed to hydroquinone and nitrocatechol in turn the hydroquinone and benzoquinone then are oxidized to low molecular weight carboxylic acids with some hydrocarbon features before completely degraded into simpler molecules like co2 and h2o partial or incomplete degradation of organic pollutants might result in potential secondary pollution in extreme conditions therefore the complete photodegradation of organic pollutants by photocatalyst is crucial before release into the water bodies enpm offers the complete degradation of organic pollutants by providing support to the photocatalyst to allow adsorption of pollutants on the photocatalyst surface before photodegradation however over loaded of the photocatalyst in the membrane support might result in photocatalyst sorbed pollutant leakage with incomplete degradation which contributes to secondary pollution hence the optimization of photocatalyst loading on the enpm is urgently crucial to optimize the performance of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes without deteriorating the physicochemical properties of the membranes 4 challenges and future perspective the impressive degradation performance of enpm as illustrated in table 1 has evidenced the capability of enpm for a wide range of applications for the degradation of harmful organic pollutants however several challenges were identified in the development of enpm such as low mechanical stability filtration properties were neglected high energy consumption and low throughput as well as leaking of photocatalyst from the substrate it is broadly acknowledged that electrospun nanofiber photocatalytic membranes are usually quite fragile brittle and easy to collapse into small pieces due to the large pore size because of that the enpm is commonly used in the form of the mat and simply submerged in the polluted water however this approach requires additional treatment to separate the mat from the treated water the sedimentation of enpm in the treated water engendered generation of secondary pollution therefore the incorporation of enpm on the rigid and robust substrate is highly recommended to improve the mechanical strength and flexibility of the membranes at the same time it also contributed to the easiness of handling and recycling based on our survey most research works demonstrated the fabricated electrospun nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes were directly submerged in the polluted solution for photocatalytic degradation while the main function of the membrane which is filtration was neglected this condition restricts the photocatalytic degradation performance of the fabricated nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane there are very limited research works reported on the significance and contribution of filtration toward photocatalytic degradation of pollutants by nanofibrous photocatalytic membranes 65 furthermore the mechanism behind the coupling of filtration and photocatalytic degradation remains unclear there also a scientific question that desperately needs to be addressed through further research such as why filtration can increase the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation therefore there is a need for systematic studies that aimed at studying this mechanism which will promisingly direct future study and practical application of nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane materials another major limitation for enpm fabrication including high voltage utilization high electric field dependency and low throughput therefore it is urgently important to enhance the current fabrication technique of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane there are several emerging solutions of the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane that can be proposed such as 1 solution blow spinning 2 plasma induced synthesis 3 centrifugal spinning and 4 melting electrospinning the nanofibrous photocatalytic membrane can be proposed to fabricate by solution blow spinning that utilized compressed air for fiber formation solution blow spinning could overcome the limitation of traditional electrospinning especially the utilization of high electrical potential and the complexity in the in situ fabrication of nanofibers this process applied both electrospinning and melt blowing techniques with a greater production rate another scalable technique for the development of enpm is through plasma induced synthesis in this technique the enpm could be fabricated with the assistance of the plasma generated between the electrodes the plasma will be generated underwater without the utilization of any chemical or gas the enpm could be fabricated by the fast bombardment of exceedingly energetic radicals on the surface of electrodes instead of utilizing the electrical field centrifugal spinning can be proposed to fabricate enpm by utilizing centrifugal force to accomplish the promising production of nanofibrous membranes the centrifugal force is generated by a rotating reservoir to extrude the nanofiber generally the depletion of polymer jet into nanofibers is achieved using the controlled monitoring of centrifugal force viscoelasticity and mass transfer features of the spinning solutions the production of nanofibrous membranes through centrifugal force was estimated to be around 500 times greater relative to the conventional electrospinning technique generally the fabrication of enpm employed solution or solvent based electrospinning this technique could result in the leaking of photocatalyst nanoparticles from the substrate and solvent on the contrary another attractive method for the fabrication of enpm is through melt electrospinning in 1936 the concept of melt electrospinning was introduced in norton and truly executed in the 20th century 92 melt electrospinning also known as thermal induced phase inversion utilized hot air oil bath electricity laser to melt the materials 93 this technique is beneficial to fabricate the rigid and insoluble polymers that are difficult to dissolve by a solvent such as polytetrafluoroethylene polyethylene and polypropylene besides that the advantages of melt electrospinning are cleaner and environmentally friendly manufacturing due to the usage of harmful solvents could be forbidden thus post treatment of the residual solvent as usually employed by the solution based electrospinning process is significantly unnecessary fig 25 shows the proposed schematic diagram of the melt electrospinning system that utilized a laser as a heating source the main components of the melt electrospinning setup include 1 feeding system nozzle and feeder 2 high voltage system 3 laser system beam splitter reflector beam baffle laser transmitter and 4 grounded collecting target in this technique the molten electrospun photocatalytic membrane can be formed as larger fiber due to the higher viscosity melt electrospinning offered advancement in terms of immobilization of photocatalyst nanoparticles into the polymeric substrate therefore these proposed solutions were expected could significantly tackle the major limitation of enpm in real wastewater treatment especially in specific restrictions like the agglomeration of photocatalyst solvent recovery consumption of higher voltage lower mechanical stability 5 conclusion the rising need to address water and energy shortage has prompted considerable efforts to deal with the problem currently the implementation of nanotechnology for water treatment is gaining tremendous attention globally nanomaterials fascinated characteristics and their combination with existing technologies pose a promising future for the revolution of existing wastewater treatment therefore researchers in the science and engineering field have been extensively studying the integration of photocatalytic and nanofiber technology to treat the polluted water throughout this review the current status and potential developments throughout photocatalytic nanofibrous technology are addressed with specific attention to their synthesis structural and morphological advancement along with their application in water treatment the current technique like electrospinning coaxial electrospinning electrospraying melt phase separation and precipitation was elaborated in this review we also present the post treatment of enpm through chemical and thermal treatment like surface modification in situ polymerization

13589,a strategy of directly recovering organics for the production of volatile fatty acids vfas was introduced to make wastewater treatment profitable a sludge adsorption section was proposed to add before the conventional wastewater process for adsorbing the organics in wastewater by the excess activated sludge which was produced during biological wastewater treatment and returned from the secondary settling tank then the excess activated sludge combining wastewater organics called organics enriched sludge was anaerobically fermented for the production of high value added vfas results indicated about 70 of wastewater organics could be source recovered within 30 min most of the organics in wastewater could avoid being lost via carbon dioxide or synthesized into bacterial organisms therefore the total amount and overall bioavailability of the organics recovered from wastewater were greatly improved pilot scale tests indicated vfas production from wastewater organics was enhanced by 62 2 mass balance analysis indicated 46 8 of wastewater organics could be finally transferred into vfas only 12 in conventional processes economic evaluations indicated source recovering wastewater organics for vfas production was a promising alternative to make wastewater treatment plants wwtps profitable finally an idealized organics transformation route for wastewater treatment was proposed based on this concept to make wastewater treatment profitable keywords wastewater treatment organics transformation organics enriched sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production source recovery 1 introduction besides pollutants removal efficiencies economic benefits from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been attracting more and more attentions 1 3 however technologies based on conventional activated sludge process are still widely applied on wastewater treatment nowadays resulting in large energy consumptions and carbon footprints 4 5 a wastewater plant with flow of 1 0 105 m3 d would consume as much electricity as a chinese town with population of 5000 and emit as much co2 as 6000 cars per day 2 therefore how to save energy and generate resources from wastewater has become a hot and meaningful topic recent attempts for making wwtps profitable are mainly focused on 1 how to optimize operation controlling for wastewater treatment which is still based on conventional processes yet for example 10 20 of the total electricity consumption could be reduced by precisely controlling aeration amounts 6 7 2 how to enhance the resources exploitation from excess activated sludge for example pretreatments were widely applied on sludge digestion and 40 70 of biogas production was reported to be able to be enhanced 8 10 however although recent practical applications have partially offset the high cost of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment by developing sludge derived products or optimizing operation controlling those recoveries are usually very limited in most occasions no more than 30 of the energy consumed in wastewater treatment could be recovered via sludge anaerobic fermentation for biogas production 2 aeration to provide sufficient or even excessive dissolved oxygen for organic matters removal is widely used in conventional wastewater treatment processes which often consumes 60 70 of the total energy consumption in wastewater plants 7 moreover during this process about 50 of the total carbon in wastewater would be lost in the form of co2 simultaneously promoting the emissions of greenhouse gas 5 11 and about 30 50 of the total carbon in wastewater would be transformed into organic matters in the form of excess activated sludge 12 which has poor bioavailability and would waste energy once again during sludge pretreatment for anaerobic digestion 13 15 therefore no more than 25 of the total carbon in wastewater could be finally resource based used in the forms of biogas visibly only when the transformation routes of the carbon source in conventional processes were fundamentally changed it would be possible for wwtps to obtain net profits thus based on the insufficiencies of existing wwtps mentioned above in this study an advanced concept was proposed to systematically regulate the transformation routes of organics for wastewater treatment that is a sludge adsorption section was added before the conventional wastewater process for adsorbing the organics in wastewater by the excess activated sludge which was produced during biological wastewater treatment and returned from the secondary settling tank moreover the excess activated sludge combining wastewater organics organics enriched sludge was suggested to be fermented for vfas production therefore 1 the transformation routes of organics could be simplified which would thus reduce aeration energy consumption 2 as most of the organics in wastewater could avoid being lost via carbon dioxide or synthesized into bacterial organisms therefore the total amount and overall bioavailability of the organics recovered from wastewater were improved 3 the profitability from the recovered organics could be maximized by substituting biogas production with vfas production the latter was confirmed to be more valuable and applicable than former liu et al 16 directly applied the produced vfa as the external carbon source on denitrification and phosphorus removals in wastewater treatment in the process of which vfas was not needed to separation concentration or purification and reported the net profits of vfas production from sludge fermentation was 2 5 times of that of biogas production furthermore separating waste at the source is also the mainstream thinking of current pollutant prevention and treatment which has been proved to be able to directly support material recovery by producing more homogeneous and higher value products 17 18 the objective of this study was to present a feasible approach for shifting wastewater plant into profitable factory directly recovery efficiency of organics from wastewater via the adsorption of excess activated sludge was investigated then the enhanced vfa production from anaerobic fermentation of the recovered organics was examined the fundamental reasons of which were also expounded via analyzing the amount bioavailability and composition of the organics enriched sludge moreover the inputs and outputs of the modified wastewater treatment process were weighed based on mass balance analysis and economic evaluation finally an idealized transformation route of organics for wastewater treatment was proposed based on this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum wastewater used in this test was the effluent of the rotational flow grit chamber of the wwtps in wuxi city china the wastewater was with chemical oxygen demand cod of 113 0 684 0 mg l 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of 46 6 147 4 mg l total nitrogen tn of 15 1 65 6 mg l total phosphorus tp of 0 9 18 5 mg l and ph of 7 0 8 0 common excess sludge was the activated sludge with volatile suspended solids vss of 10 0 15 0 g l collected from the secondary settling tank following the aeration tank of this wwtps the organics enriched sludge was the common excess sludge adsorbing wastewater organics that is common excess sludge was added into the container with wastewater in which the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was adjusted into 3 0 g l stirring speed was 30 0 rpm and hydraulic retention time hrt was 30 0 min organics enriched sludge was then obtained by settling separation of the mixture after centrifugally concentrated to 30 g vss l common excess sludge and organics enriched sludge were used to anaerobic fermentation for vfas production inoculum to sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production was harvested from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb of a brewery wastewater treatment plant in order to enrich acetogenic bacteria the anaerobic biomass was firstly cultivated according to the method reported by liu et al 19 before inoculating the fermenters the seeding biomass was rinsed three times by physiological salt solution to remove acids on it 2 2 strategy of directly recovering wastewater organics for vfas production a modified activated sludge process for wastewater treatment mas was proposed by adding a sludge adsorption section and a organics enriched sludge fermentation section in the conventional process as shown in fig 1 the modified activated sludge process could be divided into three sections namely the organics recovery section i biological wastewater treatment section ii and sludge fermentation for vfas production section iii wastewater firstly entered into section i where most of the organics in the wastewater was recovered by the adsorption of excess activated sludge then in the settling tank the mixed liquid was divided into the supernatant with residual wastes and the sludge combing with abundant organic matters organics enriched sludge the supernatant was further treated in section ii to be the final effluent by biological processes excess activated sludge produced in section ii could be used in section i organics enriched sludge was pretreated and then fermented for vfas production in section iii therefore 1 the total amount of the recycling organics was enhanced since most of organics avoided being aerobically degraded during wastewater disposal 2 the quality of the recovered organics was improved organics in sludge was composed of extracellular and intracellular organics and the former had much better biodegradability 19 as the organic load of section ii was greatly reduced via the directly recovering of organics in section i so excess sludge production was suppressed in section ii and the total the content of intracellular organics would be reduced in organics enriched sludge 3 dioxide carbon production could be greatly decreased due to the reduced organics in the influent of section ii corresponding with lowered energy consumption for aeration 4 comparing with biogas vfas as higher added values product were produced 2 3 organics recovery from wastewater by sludge adsorption the potentials of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was measured by batch tests three flasks of 1000 ml were filled with 800 ml wastewater respectively then different amounts of concentrated common excess sludge with vss of 30 g l were added into the three flasks where the mlss were adjusted to 1500 3000 and 6000 mg l respectively moreover the temperature was 20 c and magnetic stirring speed was 30 rpm samples collected at intervals were measured including the concentrations of cod tn tp and nh4 n in the supernatant all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates and data were treated by variance analysis long term performance of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was measured by pilot scale test in a reactor with effective volume of 30 l which was continuously fed and discharged a mechanical stirring device with speed of 30 rpm was used to ensure the excess activated sludge and wastewater mixed quickly and completely mlss and hrt were controlled at 3 0 g l and 30 min respectively pilot scale tests were operated under normal temperature of 15 25 c indoor and most of the data was obtained at temperature of about 20 c organics enriched sludge was intermittently discharged from the settling tank that followed the organics recovery reactor 2 4 sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production the fermentation method for vfas production from sludge and operational conditions were referred to the previous study 19 firstly sludge was pretreated at 70 c and ph of 11 for 2 0 h then the pretreated sludge was pumped into beaker flasks and adjusted to ph of 6 5 7 5 dissolved oxygen in was and gaseous in the headspace of flasks were removed by sparging gaseous nitrogen for about 30 min to maintain strict anaerobic condition in the whole process of anaerobic fermentation for vfas production flasks were placed in orbital shaker with rotation speed of 120 rpm temperature was kept at about 35 c and ph was kept at 6 5 7 5 samples taken from beaker flasks at certain intervals were analyzed all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates 2 5 sampling of carbon sources distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge stepwise hydrolysis was implemented to release and recovery the organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge 19 during which mild methods were chose to relieve the decomposition of those recovering organic matters organics in organics enriched sludge were roughly classified as those in the slime c1 adsorbed on the surface of sludge floc c2 in extracellular polymeric substances eps c3 and inside of sludge cell c4 respectively c1 was obtained from the supernatant of the organics enriched sludge 20 c2 c3 and c4 were successively obtained by mild hydrolysis of stirring for 30 min at 60 c 21 2 edta for 3 0 h at 4 c 22 and ultrasound of 800 w for 30 min at 20 c 23 respectively the biodegradability of organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge was evaluated by measuring their bod5 cod b c 2 6 analytical methods conventional indices including ph cod bod5 nh4 n tn tp vs vss total solids ts mlss were measured according to the standard methods 24 vfas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with an auto injector aoc 20i shimadzu which referred to the previously reported method 14 to measure vfas samples were firstly centrifuged at 9500 g for 10 min and then filtered with 0 22 Î¼m syringe filters excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra and fluorescence regional integration fri techniques were used to assess the components of organic matters distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge which were referred to the previous study 25 3 results 3 1 performances of excess activated sludge in directly recovering organics from sewage wastewater by adsorption excess activated sludge presented strong potential in directly recovering carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage wastewater by adsorption fig 2 the concentration of mlss showed significant influences on the efficiencies of organics recovery high concentration mlss resulting in good performance by simultaneously considering the sustainability of excess activated sludge supply and the performances of organics recovery mlss concentration of 3 0 g l was adopted in this test under which the removal efficiencies of cod tp and even tn could reach as high as 73 65 44 57 and 17 30 respectively in batch tests fig 2a b and c moreover the concentrations of organics in the wastewater would continuously decrease with the test proceeding and reach the lowest on the 30th min it is known that in the activated sludge system the biological removals of organic matters in wastewater could be divided into two stages namely adsorption and degradation pollutants were firstly adsorbed onto activated sludge within a short time and then slowly degraded into small molecular compounds therefore results implied that the removed organics in this test were just enriched in the excess sludge but not degraded up due to the very short hrt of 30 min which thus provided an opportunity to recovery organics from wastewater furthermore the performance of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was further confirmed in the pilot scale reactor which continuously operated for about 500 days as shown in fig 2d although cod concentration in influent fluctuated greatly cod concentration in effluent could be kept at 100 200 mg l in most time yielding average cod removal of about 60 slightly lower than that of the batch operations the performances of activated sludge in the batch tests were listed in table 1 results indicated the adoption of activated sludge under low mlss concentration could fully exert its potential in organics recovery but the removals of organics in wastewater were not complete therefore the concentration of mlss should be as high as possible to recovery more organics in case that the supply of excess activated sludge permitted furthermore the adsorption of activated sludge to organics presented selectivity more tending to recovery organics containing carbon and phosphorus than nitrogen which was conducive to the purity of vfas produced from the anaerobic fermentation of organics enriched sludge results indicated the same as ordinary adsorbents activated sludge was also more likely to adsorb particulate or solid pollutants and macromolecular substances phosphorus in sewage generally existed in the form of solids obtaining a high adsorption performance while nitrogen mainly existed in the form of ammonia resulting in low adsorption performance 3 2 enhanced vfa production from anaerobic fermentation of organics enriched sludge vfas production from anaerobic fermentation was significantly improved by using the organics enriched sludge as substrate as shown in fig 3 a although the ts both of the common sludge and organics enriched sludge were controlled at 30 g l vfas production of the latter was 30 higher than that of the former and vfas concentration was increased from 4 5 6 0 g l the improved bioavailability of the organics enriched sludge should be one of the most important contributors to the enhanced vfa production in sewage sludge the organic matters distributing inside of sludge flocs is structurally protected by eps and bio cell wall 26 27 and thus difficult to be utilized by fermentative bacteria however the proportion of the extracellular organics in organics enriched sludge was efficiently increased by adsorbing organic matters from sewage wastewater furthermore the compositions of the vfas from anaerobic fermentations of organics enriched and common sludge did not present any significant differences fig 3b though compared with common excess sludge the proportions of acetate and isovalerate in the vfas produced from organics enriched sludge slightly increased and reduced respectively acetate was still the main component and accounted for about 60 of the total vfas followed by isovalerate and then propionate the increased amount of total organics in organics enriched sludge would be another most important contributor to the enhanced vfa production results indicated the adsorption capacity of excess activated sludge to organic matters in wastewater was about 0 117 g g ss as shown in table 2 when organics enriched sludge with mlss of 33 5 g l consisting of 30 g l common excess sludge and 3 5 g l organic matters adsorbed from wastewater was used as the substrate for anaerobic fermentation the concentration of the produced vfas could theoretically reach 7 3 g l however when only common excess sludge with mlss of 30 g l was used the vfas concentration was just 4 5 g l indicating that the vfas production from sludge fermentation could be enhanced by about 62 in total by using excess activated sludge to recovery organics in wastewater before its fermentation 1 y c vfa c ss 1 p y c ss p where y and y are the vfas yields of carbon enriched and common sludge g vfa g ss respectively cvfa and css are the concentrations of the produced vfas and suspended solids g l respectively and p is the mass proportion of the adsorbed matters in carbon enriched sludge about 10 5 3 3 biodegradability of organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge visibly the biodegradability of the organics from outside to inside of sludge flocs also reduced by themselves fig 4 which should be another important reason to the low utilization of the organics in sewage sludge besides the structural protection of sludge flocs the factors that determinate the biodegradability of sludge organics mainly come from two aspects firstly the structural protection of sludge flocs such as the protection of the sludge cell wall makes intracellular organic matters difficult to be used by hydrolytic bacteria secondly organic matters distributed in different parts of the sludge flocs such as adsorbed organics eps and intracellular organics would also present difference in biodegradability due to their difference in compositions in this study the obtained difference in biodegradability of organics should belong to the second reason because organics was firstly extracted out from sludge during the process of which the structural protection had also been destroyed before detection the values of bod5 cod b c of the organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge were measured to evaluate their biodegradability as shown in fig 4 although the organic matters in the wastewater represented by the organics outside of the sludge flocs showed very good biodegradability with b c of 0 89 in the slime and 0 86 on the surface of sludge floc their biodegradability would be greatly reduced by the biotransformation during wastewater treatment process organics with b c of 0 76 in the eps and 0 64 inside of sludge cell therefore it further proved the regulation of organics transformation routes during wastewater treatment processes was very significant for resources recovery 3 4 compositions of the organic matters distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge from the outside to the inside of the organics enriched sludge flocs the increased contents of refractory matters should be the reason to their reduced bioavailability it is known that organic matters in sludge could be divided into five types based on their excitation emission ex em wavelengths namely tyrosine like protein i tryptophan like protein ii fulvic acid like organics iii soluble microbial by product iv and humic acid like organics v the ex em wavelengths of which were 200 250 200 330 200 250 330 380 200 250 380 500 250 400 200 380 and 250 400 380 500 respectively and the fluorescence regions of i and iv presented the organic matters with good biodegradability 25 as shown in fig 5 the biodegradable matters i and iv dominated the organics outside of sludge flocs fig 5a accounting for over 80 while their contents reduced in eps and intracellular substances fig 5b and c only accounting for about 25 and 15 respectively moreover the proportion of non biodegradable materials ii iii and v was much high in the organics of eps and intracellular substances especially the concentrations of fulvic and humic acid like organics increased greatly which were the typically residual matters in the fermented sludge 4 discussion 4 1 mass balance and energy consumption of the modified wastewater treatment process compared with conventional wastewater treatment process the modified process presented significant superiorities in vfa production and energy saving in conventional processes about half of the total organics in wastewater is often removed in the form of carbon dioxide by aerobic bacteria though there are somewhat divergences between different wastewater treatment processes fig 6 a 11 therefore high power aeration is commonly implemented which would consume 70 of the total energy demand in wwtps 7 moreover besides the serious loss of organics a large part of the residual organics would be transformed into refractory matters in the form of sludge fig 4 resulting that the vfas yield is often less than 0 3 g g cod in the anaerobic fermentation of common excess sludge 16 finally only about 12 of the total organics calculated by cod in the wastewater could be converted into vfas however in this modified process about 60 70 of the organic matters in wastewater could be directly recovered by sludge adsorption from wastewater fig 2 and only about 20 of them are lost in the form of carbon dioxide the total energy consumption of wastewater treatment could be reduced by 35 from about 1 0 7 to 0 65 kwh kg cod furthermore due to the good biodegradability of the organics enriched sludge and vfas yield of about 0 67 g g cod almost half 46 8 of organic carbon in wastewater could be finally converted into vfas therefore results indicate the application of the modified wastewater treatment process would greatly save energy and enhance vfas production 4 2 economic evaluation in order to investigate the economic potential of the modified activated sludge wastewater process mas its running costs input and incomes output were calculated and compared with the conventional activated sludge processes in which the excess sludge was treated by digestion for biogas production cas1 or fermentation for vfas production cas2 respectively the amount and cod concentration of the treated wastewater were set as 100 000 m3 d and 300 350 mg l respectively the running cost of the wwtps included electricity fee chemical fee staff and administration costs maintenance and replacement costs sludge disposal fee 28 but excluded the depreciation cost the electricity fee was calculated based on the amount of cod removal about 1 0 kwh kg cod 7 which was reduced by 35 due to the directly recovered cod in the mas process the energy consumption of sludge hydrolysis was provided by high temperature steam which satisfied the demand of sludge heated from 20 to 70 c under heat recovery rate of 70 chemical fee was based on the consumptions of polyaluminum chloride pac cl2 and sodium hydroxide accounting for 57 3 38 2 and 4 5 of the total chemical fee respectively pac and cl2 were often used for sludge dewatering and effluent disinfection respectively sodium hydroxide was used for sludge hydrolysis therefore chemical fee of the mas process would be enhanced due to the increased excess sludge amount compared with digestion for biogas production in cas1 the costs of sludge fermentations for vfas production in cas2 and mas could be reduced by two thirds due to the shortened sludge reaction time from 30 days reduced to 10 days finally in this study the costs of staff and administration maintenance and replacement as well as sludge transport and disposal were set to the same in the three processes though there are surely some minor differences results indicate the mas presents the lowest inputs cas2 lower than cas1 table 3 the income of wastewater treatment process was mainly from the produced vfas or ch4 by directly recovering the organics from wastewater in mas the amount and biodegradability of the excess sludge were enhanced greatly which resulted in the increased vfas production over 2 times of cas2 moreover due to the higher price of vfas than that of biogas 16 the final income of the modified process mas could obtain 5504 usd day which was 2 86 and 2 13 times of those of cas1 and cas2 respectively furthermore by comprehensively considering the inputs and outputs the net profits of cas1 cas2 and mas were 4575 3620 and 89 6 usd day respectively therefore results indicate that it seems difficult for wwtps to make net profits in the absence of government subsidies however the adoption of sludge fermentation for vfas production could greatly increase the inputs of wwtps in particular small benefit could be obtained by the implements of direct organics recovery from wastewater and sludge fermentation for vfa production which possibly provided a promising research direction for shifting wwtps into profitable factories 4 3 idealized organics transformation route during wastewater treatment in order to successfully shift wwtps into profitable factories necessary achievements in three aspects should be realized namely 1 a certain recovery rate of the organics from wastewater should be reached to ensure enough amount of available organics 2 the quality of the recovered organics should be good enough to obtain an acceptable conversion rate of organics into products e g vfas 3 the added value of the products should be as high as possible to realize positive net profits therefore an idealized transformation route of organics for wastewater treatment was mapped out based on a series of recently developed technologies fig 7 firstly as mentioned above about 70 of the organics in wastewater could be directly recovered by the adsorption of excess activated sludge similar performances were also reported by dynamic membrane separation or flocculants additions wang et al 29 found 80 of the total organic matters in wastewater could be quickly recovered under continuous operation by the dynamic membrane separation those technologies could not only reduce the generations of carbon dioxide and refractory organics but also improve organics biodegradability and cut down the energy consumption for wastewater treatment which is the key factor to improve the profitability of wwtps most importantly the concentration of organics from wastewater could also be greatly increased through the dewatering process of organics enriched sludge which provides the possibility for the organics from wastewater to be commercially utilized then to assure high conversion rate of the recovered organics efficient hydrolysis are often necessary by which complex organic matters from wastewater mainly protein polysaccharide fat cellulose and lignin could be degraded into simple molecules e g amino acids monosaccharide moreover it is worth to mention that almost all of the bioavailable organics in sludge could be driven into the liquid phase during the hydrolysis process and the residual solids are actually useless therefore liquid fermentation for vfas production was proposed in this transformation route of organics that is residual solids in the pretreated sludge were advised to be separated for final disposal before entering into fermenter finally as far as the wastewater treatment process is concerned the production of commercial products is the sole or main income of wastewater plants based on the carboxylic platform producing high added value chemicals e g fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel and biodegradable plastic are the most promising approaches to shift wwtps into profitable factory moreover the concentration purity and productivity of vfas are

13589,a strategy of directly recovering organics for the production of volatile fatty acids vfas was introduced to make wastewater treatment profitable a sludge adsorption section was proposed to add before the conventional wastewater process for adsorbing the organics in wastewater by the excess activated sludge which was produced during biological wastewater treatment and returned from the secondary settling tank then the excess activated sludge combining wastewater organics called organics enriched sludge was anaerobically fermented for the production of high value added vfas results indicated about 70 of wastewater organics could be source recovered within 30 min most of the organics in wastewater could avoid being lost via carbon dioxide or synthesized into bacterial organisms therefore the total amount and overall bioavailability of the organics recovered from wastewater were greatly improved pilot scale tests indicated vfas production from wastewater organics was enhanced by 62 2 mass balance analysis indicated 46 8 of wastewater organics could be finally transferred into vfas only 12 in conventional processes economic evaluations indicated source recovering wastewater organics for vfas production was a promising alternative to make wastewater treatment plants wwtps profitable finally an idealized organics transformation route for wastewater treatment was proposed based on this concept to make wastewater treatment profitable keywords wastewater treatment organics transformation organics enriched sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production source recovery 1 introduction besides pollutants removal efficiencies economic benefits from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been attracting more and more attentions 1 3 however technologies based on conventional activated sludge process are still widely applied on wastewater treatment nowadays resulting in large energy consumptions and carbon footprints 4 5 a wastewater plant with flow of 1 0 105 m3 d would consume as much electricity as a chinese town with population of 5000 and emit as much co2 as 6000 cars per day 2 therefore how to save energy and generate resources from wastewater has become a hot and meaningful topic recent attempts for making wwtps profitable are mainly focused on 1 how to optimize operation controlling for wastewater treatment which is still based on conventional processes yet for example 10 20 of the total electricity consumption could be reduced by precisely controlling aeration amounts 6 7 2 how to enhance the resources exploitation from excess activated sludge for example pretreatments were widely applied on sludge digestion and 40 70 of biogas production was reported to be able to be enhanced 8 10 however although recent practical applications have partially offset the high cost of activated sludge process for wastewater treatment by developing sludge derived products or optimizing operation controlling those recoveries are usually very limited in most occasions no more than 30 of the energy consumed in wastewater treatment could be recovered via sludge anaerobic fermentation for biogas production 2 aeration to provide sufficient or even excessive dissolved oxygen for organic matters removal is widely used in conventional wastewater treatment processes which often consumes 60 70 of the total energy consumption in wastewater plants 7 moreover during this process about 50 of the total carbon in wastewater would be lost in the form of co2 simultaneously promoting the emissions of greenhouse gas 5 11 and about 30 50 of the total carbon in wastewater would be transformed into organic matters in the form of excess activated sludge 12 which has poor bioavailability and would waste energy once again during sludge pretreatment for anaerobic digestion 13 15 therefore no more than 25 of the total carbon in wastewater could be finally resource based used in the forms of biogas visibly only when the transformation routes of the carbon source in conventional processes were fundamentally changed it would be possible for wwtps to obtain net profits thus based on the insufficiencies of existing wwtps mentioned above in this study an advanced concept was proposed to systematically regulate the transformation routes of organics for wastewater treatment that is a sludge adsorption section was added before the conventional wastewater process for adsorbing the organics in wastewater by the excess activated sludge which was produced during biological wastewater treatment and returned from the secondary settling tank moreover the excess activated sludge combining wastewater organics organics enriched sludge was suggested to be fermented for vfas production therefore 1 the transformation routes of organics could be simplified which would thus reduce aeration energy consumption 2 as most of the organics in wastewater could avoid being lost via carbon dioxide or synthesized into bacterial organisms therefore the total amount and overall bioavailability of the organics recovered from wastewater were improved 3 the profitability from the recovered organics could be maximized by substituting biogas production with vfas production the latter was confirmed to be more valuable and applicable than former liu et al 16 directly applied the produced vfa as the external carbon source on denitrification and phosphorus removals in wastewater treatment in the process of which vfas was not needed to separation concentration or purification and reported the net profits of vfas production from sludge fermentation was 2 5 times of that of biogas production furthermore separating waste at the source is also the mainstream thinking of current pollutant prevention and treatment which has been proved to be able to directly support material recovery by producing more homogeneous and higher value products 17 18 the objective of this study was to present a feasible approach for shifting wastewater plant into profitable factory directly recovery efficiency of organics from wastewater via the adsorption of excess activated sludge was investigated then the enhanced vfa production from anaerobic fermentation of the recovered organics was examined the fundamental reasons of which were also expounded via analyzing the amount bioavailability and composition of the organics enriched sludge moreover the inputs and outputs of the modified wastewater treatment process were weighed based on mass balance analysis and economic evaluation finally an idealized transformation route of organics for wastewater treatment was proposed based on this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum wastewater used in this test was the effluent of the rotational flow grit chamber of the wwtps in wuxi city china the wastewater was with chemical oxygen demand cod of 113 0 684 0 mg l 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 of 46 6 147 4 mg l total nitrogen tn of 15 1 65 6 mg l total phosphorus tp of 0 9 18 5 mg l and ph of 7 0 8 0 common excess sludge was the activated sludge with volatile suspended solids vss of 10 0 15 0 g l collected from the secondary settling tank following the aeration tank of this wwtps the organics enriched sludge was the common excess sludge adsorbing wastewater organics that is common excess sludge was added into the container with wastewater in which the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was adjusted into 3 0 g l stirring speed was 30 0 rpm and hydraulic retention time hrt was 30 0 min organics enriched sludge was then obtained by settling separation of the mixture after centrifugally concentrated to 30 g vss l common excess sludge and organics enriched sludge were used to anaerobic fermentation for vfas production inoculum to sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production was harvested from an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb of a brewery wastewater treatment plant in order to enrich acetogenic bacteria the anaerobic biomass was firstly cultivated according to the method reported by liu et al 19 before inoculating the fermenters the seeding biomass was rinsed three times by physiological salt solution to remove acids on it 2 2 strategy of directly recovering wastewater organics for vfas production a modified activated sludge process for wastewater treatment mas was proposed by adding a sludge adsorption section and a organics enriched sludge fermentation section in the conventional process as shown in fig 1 the modified activated sludge process could be divided into three sections namely the organics recovery section i biological wastewater treatment section ii and sludge fermentation for vfas production section iii wastewater firstly entered into section i where most of the organics in the wastewater was recovered by the adsorption of excess activated sludge then in the settling tank the mixed liquid was divided into the supernatant with residual wastes and the sludge combing with abundant organic matters organics enriched sludge the supernatant was further treated in section ii to be the final effluent by biological processes excess activated sludge produced in section ii could be used in section i organics enriched sludge was pretreated and then fermented for vfas production in section iii therefore 1 the total amount of the recycling organics was enhanced since most of organics avoided being aerobically degraded during wastewater disposal 2 the quality of the recovered organics was improved organics in sludge was composed of extracellular and intracellular organics and the former had much better biodegradability 19 as the organic load of section ii was greatly reduced via the directly recovering of organics in section i so excess sludge production was suppressed in section ii and the total the content of intracellular organics would be reduced in organics enriched sludge 3 dioxide carbon production could be greatly decreased due to the reduced organics in the influent of section ii corresponding with lowered energy consumption for aeration 4 comparing with biogas vfas as higher added values product were produced 2 3 organics recovery from wastewater by sludge adsorption the potentials of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was measured by batch tests three flasks of 1000 ml were filled with 800 ml wastewater respectively then different amounts of concentrated common excess sludge with vss of 30 g l were added into the three flasks where the mlss were adjusted to 1500 3000 and 6000 mg l respectively moreover the temperature was 20 c and magnetic stirring speed was 30 rpm samples collected at intervals were measured including the concentrations of cod tn tp and nh4 n in the supernatant all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates and data were treated by variance analysis long term performance of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was measured by pilot scale test in a reactor with effective volume of 30 l which was continuously fed and discharged a mechanical stirring device with speed of 30 rpm was used to ensure the excess activated sludge and wastewater mixed quickly and completely mlss and hrt were controlled at 3 0 g l and 30 min respectively pilot scale tests were operated under normal temperature of 15 25 c indoor and most of the data was obtained at temperature of about 20 c organics enriched sludge was intermittently discharged from the settling tank that followed the organics recovery reactor 2 4 sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas production the fermentation method for vfas production from sludge and operational conditions were referred to the previous study 19 firstly sludge was pretreated at 70 c and ph of 11 for 2 0 h then the pretreated sludge was pumped into beaker flasks and adjusted to ph of 6 5 7 5 dissolved oxygen in was and gaseous in the headspace of flasks were removed by sparging gaseous nitrogen for about 30 min to maintain strict anaerobic condition in the whole process of anaerobic fermentation for vfas production flasks were placed in orbital shaker with rotation speed of 120 rpm temperature was kept at about 35 c and ph was kept at 6 5 7 5 samples taken from beaker flasks at certain intervals were analyzed all the experiments were carried out independently in triplicates 2 5 sampling of carbon sources distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge stepwise hydrolysis was implemented to release and recovery the organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge 19 during which mild methods were chose to relieve the decomposition of those recovering organic matters organics in organics enriched sludge were roughly classified as those in the slime c1 adsorbed on the surface of sludge floc c2 in extracellular polymeric substances eps c3 and inside of sludge cell c4 respectively c1 was obtained from the supernatant of the organics enriched sludge 20 c2 c3 and c4 were successively obtained by mild hydrolysis of stirring for 30 min at 60 c 21 2 edta for 3 0 h at 4 c 22 and ultrasound of 800 w for 30 min at 20 c 23 respectively the biodegradability of organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge was evaluated by measuring their bod5 cod b c 2 6 analytical methods conventional indices including ph cod bod5 nh4 n tn tp vs vss total solids ts mlss were measured according to the standard methods 24 vfas were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with an auto injector aoc 20i shimadzu which referred to the previously reported method 14 to measure vfas samples were firstly centrifuged at 9500 g for 10 min and then filtered with 0 22 Î¼m syringe filters excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra and fluorescence regional integration fri techniques were used to assess the components of organic matters distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge which were referred to the previous study 25 3 results 3 1 performances of excess activated sludge in directly recovering organics from sewage wastewater by adsorption excess activated sludge presented strong potential in directly recovering carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage wastewater by adsorption fig 2 the concentration of mlss showed significant influences on the efficiencies of organics recovery high concentration mlss resulting in good performance by simultaneously considering the sustainability of excess activated sludge supply and the performances of organics recovery mlss concentration of 3 0 g l was adopted in this test under which the removal efficiencies of cod tp and even tn could reach as high as 73 65 44 57 and 17 30 respectively in batch tests fig 2a b and c moreover the concentrations of organics in the wastewater would continuously decrease with the test proceeding and reach the lowest on the 30th min it is known that in the activated sludge system the biological removals of organic matters in wastewater could be divided into two stages namely adsorption and degradation pollutants were firstly adsorbed onto activated sludge within a short time and then slowly degraded into small molecular compounds therefore results implied that the removed organics in this test were just enriched in the excess sludge but not degraded up due to the very short hrt of 30 min which thus provided an opportunity to recovery organics from wastewater furthermore the performance of excess activated sludge in organics recovery from wastewater was further confirmed in the pilot scale reactor which continuously operated for about 500 days as shown in fig 2d although cod concentration in influent fluctuated greatly cod concentration in effluent could be kept at 100 200 mg l in most time yielding average cod removal of about 60 slightly lower than that of the batch operations the performances of activated sludge in the batch tests were listed in table 1 results indicated the adoption of activated sludge under low mlss concentration could fully exert its potential in organics recovery but the removals of organics in wastewater were not complete therefore the concentration of mlss should be as high as possible to recovery more organics in case that the supply of excess activated sludge permitted furthermore the adsorption of activated sludge to organics presented selectivity more tending to recovery organics containing carbon and phosphorus than nitrogen which was conducive to the purity of vfas produced from the anaerobic fermentation of organics enriched sludge results indicated the same as ordinary adsorbents activated sludge was also more likely to adsorb particulate or solid pollutants and macromolecular substances phosphorus in sewage generally existed in the form of solids obtaining a high adsorption performance while nitrogen mainly existed in the form of ammonia resulting in low adsorption performance 3 2 enhanced vfa production from anaerobic fermentation of organics enriched sludge vfas production from anaerobic fermentation was significantly improved by using the organics enriched sludge as substrate as shown in fig 3 a although the ts both of the common sludge and organics enriched sludge were controlled at 30 g l vfas production of the latter was 30 higher than that of the former and vfas concentration was increased from 4 5 6 0 g l the improved bioavailability of the organics enriched sludge should be one of the most important contributors to the enhanced vfa production in sewage sludge the organic matters distributing inside of sludge flocs is structurally protected by eps and bio cell wall 26 27 and thus difficult to be utilized by fermentative bacteria however the proportion of the extracellular organics in organics enriched sludge was efficiently increased by adsorbing organic matters from sewage wastewater furthermore the compositions of the vfas from anaerobic fermentations of organics enriched and common sludge did not present any significant differences fig 3b though compared with common excess sludge the proportions of acetate and isovalerate in the vfas produced from organics enriched sludge slightly increased and reduced respectively acetate was still the main component and accounted for about 60 of the total vfas followed by isovalerate and then propionate the increased amount of total organics in organics enriched sludge would be another most important contributor to the enhanced vfa production results indicated the adsorption capacity of excess activated sludge to organic matters in wastewater was about 0 117 g g ss as shown in table 2 when organics enriched sludge with mlss of 33 5 g l consisting of 30 g l common excess sludge and 3 5 g l organic matters adsorbed from wastewater was used as the substrate for anaerobic fermentation the concentration of the produced vfas could theoretically reach 7 3 g l however when only common excess sludge with mlss of 30 g l was used the vfas concentration was just 4 5 g l indicating that the vfas production from sludge fermentation could be enhanced by about 62 in total by using excess activated sludge to recovery organics in wastewater before its fermentation 1 y c vfa c ss 1 p y c ss p where y and y are the vfas yields of carbon enriched and common sludge g vfa g ss respectively cvfa and css are the concentrations of the produced vfas and suspended solids g l respectively and p is the mass proportion of the adsorbed matters in carbon enriched sludge about 10 5 3 3 biodegradability of organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge visibly the biodegradability of the organics from outside to inside of sludge flocs also reduced by themselves fig 4 which should be another important reason to the low utilization of the organics in sewage sludge besides the structural protection of sludge flocs the factors that determinate the biodegradability of sludge organics mainly come from two aspects firstly the structural protection of sludge flocs such as the protection of the sludge cell wall makes intracellular organic matters difficult to be used by hydrolytic bacteria secondly organic matters distributed in different parts of the sludge flocs such as adsorbed organics eps and intracellular organics would also present difference in biodegradability due to their difference in compositions in this study the obtained difference in biodegradability of organics should belong to the second reason because organics was firstly extracted out from sludge during the process of which the structural protection had also been destroyed before detection the values of bod5 cod b c of the organics distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge were measured to evaluate their biodegradability as shown in fig 4 although the organic matters in the wastewater represented by the organics outside of the sludge flocs showed very good biodegradability with b c of 0 89 in the slime and 0 86 on the surface of sludge floc their biodegradability would be greatly reduced by the biotransformation during wastewater treatment process organics with b c of 0 76 in the eps and 0 64 inside of sludge cell therefore it further proved the regulation of organics transformation routes during wastewater treatment processes was very significant for resources recovery 3 4 compositions of the organic matters distributing at different parts of organics enriched sludge from the outside to the inside of the organics enriched sludge flocs the increased contents of refractory matters should be the reason to their reduced bioavailability it is known that organic matters in sludge could be divided into five types based on their excitation emission ex em wavelengths namely tyrosine like protein i tryptophan like protein ii fulvic acid like organics iii soluble microbial by product iv and humic acid like organics v the ex em wavelengths of which were 200 250 200 330 200 250 330 380 200 250 380 500 250 400 200 380 and 250 400 380 500 respectively and the fluorescence regions of i and iv presented the organic matters with good biodegradability 25 as shown in fig 5 the biodegradable matters i and iv dominated the organics outside of sludge flocs fig 5a accounting for over 80 while their contents reduced in eps and intracellular substances fig 5b and c only accounting for about 25 and 15 respectively moreover the proportion of non biodegradable materials ii iii and v was much high in the organics of eps and intracellular substances especially the concentrations of fulvic and humic acid like organics increased greatly which were the typically residual matters in the fermented sludge 4 discussion 4 1 mass balance and energy consumption of the modified wastewater treatment process compared with conventional wastewater treatment process the modified process presented significant superiorities in vfa production and energy saving in conventional processes about half of the total organics in wastewater is often removed in the form of carbon dioxide by aerobic bacteria though there are somewhat divergences between different wastewater treatment processes fig 6 a 11 therefore high power aeration is commonly implemented which would consume 70 of the total energy demand in wwtps 7 moreover besides the serious loss of organics a large part of the residual organics would be transformed into refractory matters in the form of sludge fig 4 resulting that the vfas yield is often less than 0 3 g g cod in the anaerobic fermentation of common excess sludge 16 finally only about 12 of the total organics calculated by cod in the wastewater could be converted into vfas however in this modified process about 60 70 of the organic matters in wastewater could be directly recovered by sludge adsorption from wastewater fig 2 and only about 20 of them are lost in the form of carbon dioxide the total energy consumption of wastewater treatment could be reduced by 35 from about 1 0 7 to 0 65 kwh kg cod furthermore due to the good biodegradability of the organics enriched sludge and vfas yield of about 0 67 g g cod almost half 46 8 of organic carbon in wastewater could be finally converted into vfas therefore results indicate the application of the modified wastewater treatment process would greatly save energy and enhance vfas production 4 2 economic evaluation in order to investigate the economic potential of the modified activated sludge wastewater process mas its running costs input and incomes output were calculated and compared with the conventional activated sludge processes in which the excess sludge was treated by digestion for biogas production cas1 or fermentation for vfas production cas2 respectively the amount and cod concentration of the treated wastewater were set as 100 000 m3 d and 300 350 mg l respectively the running cost of the wwtps included electricity fee chemical fee staff and administration costs maintenance and replacement costs sludge disposal fee 28 but excluded the depreciation cost the electricity fee was calculated based on the amount of cod removal about 1 0 kwh kg cod 7 which was reduced by 35 due to the directly recovered cod in the mas process the energy consumption of sludge hydrolysis was provided by high temperature steam which satisfied the demand of sludge heated from 20 to 70 c under heat recovery rate of 70 chemical fee was based on the consumptions of polyaluminum chloride pac cl2 and sodium hydroxide accounting for 57 3 38 2 and 4 5 of the total chemical fee respectively pac and cl2 were often used for sludge dewatering and effluent disinfection respectively sodium hydroxide was used for sludge hydrolysis therefore chemical fee of the mas process would be enhanced due to the increased excess sludge amount compared with digestion for biogas production in cas1 the costs of sludge fermentations for vfas production in cas2 and mas could be reduced by two thirds due to the shortened sludge reaction time from 30 days reduced to 10 days finally in this study the costs of staff and administration maintenance and replacement as well as sludge transport and disposal were set to the same in the three processes though there are surely some minor differences results indicate the mas presents the lowest inputs cas2 lower than cas1 table 3 the income of wastewater treatment process was mainly from the produced vfas or ch4 by directly recovering the organics from wastewater in mas the amount and biodegradability of the excess sludge were enhanced greatly which resulted in the increased vfas production over 2 times of cas2 moreover due to the higher price of vfas than that of biogas 16 the final income of the modified process mas could obtain 5504 usd day which was 2 86 and 2 13 times of those of cas1 and cas2 respectively furthermore by comprehensively considering the inputs and outputs the net profits of cas1 cas2 and mas were 4575 3620 and 89 6 usd day respectively therefore results indicate that it seems difficult for wwtps to make net profits in the absence of government subsidies however the adoption of sludge fermentation for vfas production could greatly increase the inputs of wwtps in particular small benefit could be obtained by the implements of direct organics recovery from wastewater and sludge fermentation for vfa production which possibly provided a promising research direction for shifting wwtps into profitable factories 4 3 idealized organics transformation route during wastewater treatment in order to successfully shift wwtps into profitable factories necessary achievements in three aspects should be realized namely 1 a certain recovery rate of the organics from wastewater should be reached to ensure enough amount of available organics 2 the quality of the recovered organics should be good enough to obtain an acceptable conversion rate of organics into products e g vfas 3 the added value of the products should be as high as possible to realize positive net profits therefore an idealized transformation route of organics for wastewater treatment was mapped out based on a series of recently developed technologies fig 7 firstly as mentioned above about 70 of the organics in wastewater could be directly recovered by the adsorption of excess activated sludge similar performances were also reported by dynamic membrane separation or flocculants additions wang et al 29 found 80 of the total organic matters in wastewater could be quickly recovered under continuous operation by the dynamic membrane separation those technologies could not only reduce the generations of carbon dioxide and refractory organics but also improve organics biodegradability and cut down the energy consumption for wastewater treatment which is the key factor to improve the profitability of wwtps most importantly the concentration of organics from wastewater could also be greatly increased through the dewatering process of organics enriched sludge which provides the possibility for the organics from wastewater to be commercially utilized then to assure high conversion rate of the recovered organics efficient hydrolysis are often necessary by which complex organic matters from wastewater mainly protein polysaccharide fat cellulose and lignin could be degraded into simple molecules e g amino acids monosaccharide moreover it is worth to mention that almost all of the bioavailable organics in sludge could be driven into the liquid phase during the hydrolysis process and the residual solids are actually useless therefore liquid fermentation for vfas production was proposed in this transformation route of organics that is residual solids in the pretreated sludge were advised to be separated for final disposal before entering into fermenter finally as far as the wastewater treatment process is concerned the production of commercial products is the sole or main income of wastewater plants based on the carboxylic platform producing high added value chemicals e g fatty acid methyl ester biodiesel and biodegradable plastic are the most promising approaches to shift wwtps into profitable factory moreover the concentration purity and productivity of vfas are vital to the manufacture of commercial products therefore advanced fermenter development precise microbial regulation and high load fermentation will be the research trends in future in this study the anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor andmbr was proposed to be used for sludge liquid fermentation under high organic loading rate previous results 30 indicated the concentration and productivity of the produced vfas from andmbr could reach as high as 60 g l and 7 8 kg vfa cod m3 d respectively and the proportion of acetate in total vfas reached as high as approximately 95 5 conclusion the strategy of directly recovering wastes for vfas production could make wwtps profitable about 70 of organics in wastewater could be directly separated by activated sludge adsorption within 30 min vfas produced from wastewater was enhanced by 62 2 46 8 of the total organics in wastewater could be finally transferred into vfas in the modified process which was only about 12 in conventional processes
