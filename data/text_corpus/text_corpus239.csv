1195,being a resourceful ecosystem mangrove estuaries have always been subjected to trace elements tes contamination and therefore the biomonitoring approach holds immense potential for surveilling the aquatic environment to investigate the potentiality of mangrove macroalgae as biomonitors estuarine water intertidal sediment and macroalgal samples were collected from the pasur river estuary of sundarbans mangrove ecosystem bangladesh and afterward studied through atomic absorption spectrometer to quantify the levels of six concerned tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd this study utilized the geo environmental and ecological indices and sediment characterization approaches sediment quality guidelines sqgs for assessing the contamination scenario of the adjacent environment to macroalgae whereas the performance of studied algal groups was evaluated using bio contamination factor comprehensive bio concentration index and metal accumulation index metal occurrence scheme in the water followed the order of fe zn mn pb cd while fe mn zn cu pb cd for both sediment and macroalgae both pb and cd exceeded the guideline limit in estuarine water and the indices approach manifested low to moderate contamination with enrichment from anthropogenic origin of mn zn and cu in sediment moreover the sqgs revealed rare biological effects of cu on an aquatic community within algal samples chlorophyta contributed the highest biomass production followed by phaeophyta and rhodophyta statistical relationship disclosed the influence of environmental variables on te s accumulation in chlorophyta by contrast hydrochemical s association showed prevalence over the tes accumulation process for phaeophyta and rhodophyta bioaccumulation performance analysis revealed that the ability to accumulate tes in macroalgal groups varied with seasons therefore biomonitoring with macroalgae for the region of interest might require further temporal considerations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal accumulation mangrove macroalgae environmental parameters seasonality sub tropical estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mangrove ecosystem and adjacent estuaries are considered as world s most dynamic and productive ecosystem through facilitating numerous ecological and economical services such as breeding ground for fishery resources biogeochemical cycling carbon sequestration shorelines stabilization wood production and many more arofah et al 2021 gani et al 2023 kamal et al 2022 saifullah et al 2019 however areas adjacent to mangrove estuaries have always been favorable sites for extensive urban and industrial activities making this vulnerable ecosystem a reservoir for several organic and inorganic contaminants boerema and meire 2017 hermabessiere et al 2019 uddin et al 2022a among them trace elements tes contamination in mangrove ecosystems has become a contemporary environmental issue due to prosperous industrialization urbanization and overpopulation al solaimani et al 2022 rajaram et al 2020 sultana et al 2022 uddin et al 2021 2018 primarily agricultural runoff domestic waste industrial discharge oil spills and pollution from tourism and boat anchorage are the diverse anthropogenic sources of tes contamination in the mangrove estuarine ecosystem nazneen et al 2019 ourgaud et al 2018 unlike some organic pollutants tes are non degradable highly toxic and persistent in nature consequently tes tend to accumulate easily in organisms and even have the potentiality to bio magnify to superior trophic levels through the food chain ultimately posing potential threats to the aquatic ecosystem and human health bonanno and raccuia 2018 hu et al 2019 said et al 2022 even though some of the tes are natural components of the environment and are regarded as micronutrients fe mn zn and cu they have proven to be toxic above a certain threshold level of bioavailability fernandes et al 2020 furthermore many studies have found that non essential elements e g as cd cr co hg ni and pb can be noxious to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations especially pb and cd are considered as major markers of anthropogenic influence in the marine ecosystem for having a variety of emission sources e g atmospheric deposition effluent discharge agrochemical s runoff etc alam et al 2021 bonanno et al 2020a islam et al 2023 lakshmanna et al 2022 for monitoring the tes contamination in an aquatic ecosystem water column sediment and biota are widely utilized bonanno et al 2020a conti et al 2022 garcía seoane et al 2018 hossain et al 2023 masangkay et al 2022 evaluation of tes contamination through water and sediment is a classical approach nevertheless they do not reflect the absolute state of eco toxicologically available fractions since they depend on several factors bonanno et al 2020b usually the solubility bioavailability and toxicity of tes in water and sediment are influenced by physicochemical parameters e g dissolved oxygen ph salinity suspended particles and dissolved organic matter and hydrodynamic factors currents freshwater input tides and winds billah et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2014 uddin et al 2023a d such complications generate a stochastic pattern which is arduous for assessing the health impact on the surrounding organisms caused by the accumulation suspension and mobilization of sediments chuan and yunus 2019 ghosn et al 2020 hence aquatic biota has been increasingly used as biomonitors for monitoring local tes contamination as it can accumulate tes levels greater than that of corresponding water and sediments diop et al 2016 however for being considered as potential biomonitors they must i have a sessile lifestyle ii be easy to identify iii ensure relevance in terms of the food chain iv have widespread geographic distribution and v be able to accumulate elevated levels of contaminants without being deceased rainbow and phillips 1993 zhou et al 2008 to this date crustaceans macrophytes and mollusks have been found to be valuable for biomonitoring by fulfilling the required criteria whereas macroalgae are one of the widely used biomonitors for environmental contaminants especially for tes contamination bonsignore et al 2018 boutahar et al 2019 outa et al 2020 rouane hacene et al 2015 to date biomonitoring of metals by macroalgae has successfully been carried out in various geographic locations including todos os santos bay brazil brito et al 2012 indian coast chakraborty et al 2014 thermaikos gulf greece malea et al 2015 aughinish bay ireland reis et al 2016 miri estuary malaysia billah et al 2017 north west wales uk chalkley et al 2019 the eastern coast of the shandong peninsula china hu et al 2019 eastern sicily italy bonanno et al 2020a moín costa rica méndez et al 2021 and king george island antarctica lavergne et al 2022 naturally mangrove estuarine ecosystems are the habitat for diverse macroalgal assemblages that grow epiphytically on aerial roots or in the intertidal and subtidal portion of trees such as pneumatophores prop roots branches and other hard substrates billah et al 2016b the ecological connectivity of macroalgae along with epibiotic faunal assemblages including arthropods ascidians crustaceans and sponges create an intricate food network that supports the food chain of various trophic levels mishra and farooq 2022 based on thallus color macroalgae belong to three different groups green algae chlorophyta brown algae phaeophyta and red algae rhodophyta rakib et al 2021 being at the forefront of transitional ecosystems epiphytic macroalgae are continuously exposed to a wide range of contaminants nazneen et al 2022 however the cell wall of macroalgae is predominantly composed of peptidoglycan polysaccharides proteins and uronic acid some of them contain anionic carboxyl sulfate or phosphate groups which are known to be excellent binding sites for metal retention cunha and grenha 2016 davis et al 2003 these enable macroalgae to accumulate metals actively or passively by their thallus from adhering to the water column and sediment billah et al 2014 in the southwestern part of bangladesh the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem is the harbor of macroalgal diversity islam et al 2019 like other mangrove estuaries in the world the sundarbans is also experiencing elevated levels of tes in its river water intertidal sediments and organisms crustaceans fish macrobenthos plants and zooplankton via the loading from domestic and industrial discharges shipping and seaport activity and from the huge number of shrimp and agricultural farms situated in nearby areas borrell et al 2016 choudhury et al 2021 islam et al 2022 kader and narayan sinha 2018 ranjan et al 2018 shil et al 2017 at present environmental pressure along the estuarine ecosystem has been on the continuous rise due to the ongoing project for establishing a coal based power plant in its proximity khan et al 2018 this project is also accompanied by a plan to set up a significant number of industrial establishments near the proposed power plant area which will significantly impact the estuarine ecosystem khan et al 2019 it is anticipated that the level of pollution might be augmented by ongoing development activities now it is important to know how much the estuary is polluted and what can indicate pollution in this connection biomonitoring of tes levels through macroalgae might be a suitable ecological tool for assessing the contamination scenario within the sundarbans however such potentiality has remained out of sight by the scientific community although recently asha et al 2020 have reported the accumulation of trace metals in macroalgae from the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem there is still a deficiency of detailed and comprehensive studies highlighting the accumulation of tes by different mangrove macroalgae species of this regime which would have strong ecological relevance and potential future application for environmental monitoring and management such a study should encompass seasonality and environmental parameters which are not followed in the previous research works moreover for the assessment of the anthropogenic input within the estuarine ecosystem it is required to investigate the state of contamination from non essential tes along with the micronutrients it has been mentioned earlier that several studies have identified pb and cd as potential indicators of anthropogenic contamination of the marine environment consequently the inclusion of these two tes holds great relevance for the intended study therefore this study endeavors to fulfill the gaps by encompassing the investigation of tes contamination monitoring in the sub tropical mangrove estuary of sundarbans bangladesh with specific objectives viz i to assess the level of tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd in the region of interest ii to study the biomass production by macroalgal groups chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta and iii to quantify tes concentration fe mn zn cu pb and cd in tissues of macroalgal groups chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sundarbans is the world s largest contiguous mangrove forest located in the estuarine phase of the ganges brahmaputra gbm river system covering an area of 10 000 km2 of which 7000 km2 70 is land and the remaining 3000 km2 is underwater fig 1 around 60 6017 km2 area of the sundarbans are within the khulna division of bangladesh while the rest 40 4260 km2 in the west bengal india this forest mainly consists of a network of islands and estuaries dissected by innumerable tidal channels e g rivers creeks and channels and therefore it is classified as a tidal depositional ecosystem manna et al 2010 the forest has a humid sub tropical climate and the tropical southwest monsoon has a strong influence on the hydrodynamics of its rivers islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 the average annual humidity rainfall and temperature of sundarbans vary from 70 to 80 1640 2000 mm and 17 32 c respectively the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem is unique in its ecological value and a large portion of its mangrove forest has been declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 fao undp 1998 the pasur river of the rupsha pasur river system is the largest river within bangladesh s sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem prior to discharging its water in the bay of bengal the river meets the shibsa river while passing through the right side of the trikona and dubla the pasur river is about 142 km long with varying widths at different places 460 m at rupsha 790 m at bajuyan and 2 44 km at pasur shibsha the geology of the river basin contains tidal deltaic and mangrove swamp deposits in its southern part while marsh clay and peat deposits constitute the geology of the northern and western areas islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 on the shore of the pasur river it holds the second largest seaport of the country known as the mongla sea port and the mongla export processing zone epz fig 1 the river is also navigable by large ships and vessels throughout the year for having a greater underwater depth due to having such a convenient trade route around 49 small and large manufacturing and processing industries under the mongla seaport and epz area are situated on the bank of the pasur river that discharge waste and wastewater into the river without proper treatment islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 in addition there are recreation facilities e g tourist spots and local amenities e g boat ferry ghat local market ports etc around the study domain which are also considered as potential sources of tes in the pasur river fig 1 furthermore several studies have predicted that the present scenario of pollution within this estuarine ecosystem might get worse with the operation of a proposed coal based powerplant along the bank of pasur river situated only at 14 km upstream from the sundrabans chowdhury 2017 hossain 2019 mahmud et al 2020 2 2 sampling design surface and sediment pore water sediment and macroalgae samples were collected from the pasur river estuary encompassing five sampling sites at the jonga point of the sundarbans mangrove forest fig 1 at low tide during two seasons dry season december march and wet season june september of 2018 a long patch of the estuary was chosen for sampling covering the upstream midstream and downstream of the pasur river at the jonga point the selection of the sampling sites depended on the availability of macroalgae in the pneumatophores as the representative of the macroalgae assemblage asha et al 2020 the sampling sites were about 2 km apart from each other encompassing about a patch of 10 km and the sites were adjacent to the sundarbans mangrove forest the geographical location of sampling sites was determined using gps global positioning system in degree minutes and seconds dms coordinate system using the garmin handheld gps series to ease sampling points in the subsequent seasons 2 2 1 water sampling preparation and physicochemical properties analysis surface water samples from the estuary were collected for water nutrient and metal analysis whereas sediment pore water was collected for nutrient analysis only from each sampling site surface n 30 considering two sampling seasons i e the dry and wet and sediment pore water n 30 considering two sampling seasons i e the dry and wet samples were collected in triplicates in a 500 ml polyethylene bottles that had been pre washed in 10 nitric acid hno3 and rinsed 5 times in deionized water parween et al 2022 for avoiding contamination all sampling bottles were then separately bagged with labels and transported immediately to the laboratory on an icebox for analysis in the laboratory both surface and sediment pore water samples were filtered using the millipore filtering system mfs for tes analysis surface water samples were acidified with 2 ml of concentrated hno3 analytical grade sigma aldrich germany into each 100 ml sample and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator until further analysis the non acidified surface and sediment pore water samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and ammonium nh4 following the methods of parsons et al 1984 kitamura et al 1982 and weatherburn 1967 respectively besides in situ water quality indicators such as surface water temperature swt ph dissolved oxygen do and surface water salinity were measured for each of the surface water samples by using calibrated temperature and ph meter model no hi 8314 hanna usa do meter model no pdo 519 lutron usa and refractometer model no hi 96822 hanna usa respectively during each sampling survey 2 2 2 sediment sampling and preparation intertidal surface sediment top 5 cm samples were collected in triplicate from each sampling site using a plastic trowel during each sampling period n 30 considering two sampling seasons dry and wet and kept in a cooler box for transport to the laboratory after removing surface litter after that sediments samples were air dried at room temperature for 7 days prior to oven drying at 80 c for 24 h barik et al 2018 once dried the samples were ground with a mortar and pestle until all particles could pass through a 300 bss mesh sieve finally the samples were stored in zip lock polythene bags until further analysis for tes analysis about 10 g of finely grounded dried powdered sediment samples were digested in a 100 ml kjeldahl flask separately with 20 ml concentrated hno3 and 10 ml perchloric acid hclo4 at 100 5 c on a heating mantle under reflux condition hasan et al 2020 with the appearance of an almost transparent solution the flasks were removed from the heating mantle and cooled naturally these digested samples were then transferred to 50 ml previously cleaned volumetric flasks and diluted up to the mark with deionized water for homogeneity the samples were mixed well and filtered through whatman filter paper qualitative 1 125 mm dia 100 circles finally prepared samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c for tes analysis 2 2 3 macroalgae collection and processing pneumatophores containing macroalgae were collected using the quadrat sampling method at each of the five sampling sites for biomass and metal analysis pneumatophores were cut in the midline with a clipper from the sub littoral zone 0 5 3 0 m during the low tide period of each sampling season when the mangrove foreshore is exposed a total of 160 pneumatophores n 80 for tes analysis and n 80 for biomass analysis considering two sampling seasons dry and wet were collected in each sampling survey the collected pneumatophores were packed in a ziplock plastic and kept in an icebox for conveying to the laboratory immediately in the laboratory samples of macroalgae were washed with distilled water to remove various debris and later these were scrapped off from each pneumatophore taking care not to remove the pneumatophore tissue afterward algal samples were gently washed again to remove any adhering sediment particles and separated onto small glass petri dishes collected macroalgae samples were then separated based on the color viz chlorophyta for green algae phaeophyta for brown algae and rhodophyta for red algae following rakib et al 2021 chlorophyta was found at almost every sampling site during both seasons while phaeophyta and rhodophyta were not found during the dry sampling sites s2 and s5 and wet seasons sampling site s4 respectively for tes analysis macroalgal samples were first dried in an oven at 60 c for 48 h and then ground into the mortar with a pestle for obtaining powdered samples the dried powdered algal samples 2 5 g were then acid digested using hno3 hclo4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution following hasan et al 2020 the digested samples were utilized for elemental analysis in the case of biomass analysis macroalgal samples were dried overnight at 70 c in an oven followed by measuring the weights for dried samples billah et al 2016a representative pneumatophore s length and radius were diligently measured by a caliper for calculating the surface area for each pneumatophore through the equation stated below steinke and naidoo 1990 1 surface area π d h where π constant d radius of the pneumatophores and h length of the pneumatophores the biomass dry weight of macroalgae was expressed as gm m 2 based on the previously determined surface area of pneumatophores 2 3 trace elements tes analysis and quality control determination of tes in the water sediment and macroalgae samples was carried out at the institute of national analytical research and service inars an iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir dhaka bangladesh using atomic absorption spectrometer aas the concentration of fe mn zn and cu in all samples was analyzed using the flame technique in aas model aa240fs varian australia while pb and cd concentrations were analyzed using the zeeman furnace technique in aas model gta 120 aa240z varian australia during elemental analysis nist national institute of standards and technology traceable certified reference materials crm of individual metals 1000 mg l 1 obtained from fluka analytical sigma aldrich germany were used to prepare calibration working standards by dilution with deionized water conductivity 0 5 μs cm in the case of high concentrations the samples were diluted using deionized water an element specific hollow cathode lamp was used for each metal during instrumental analysis to ascertain the reliability of the analysis for each determination a standard solution crm after five samples with a reagent method blank after ten samples were determined the analytical accuracy and precision were ensured through the replicate measurements of the crm for each metal the expected value of the crm and the measured value were within a 5 difference and the average values of three consecutive replicates were taken for each determination in which relative standard deviation rsd was within 5 ensuring good instrumental precision to avoid the matrix effect in the samples spike recovery analysis was performed and found in the range of 97 102 for all tes all samples were analyzed in triplicates and the average value of the three replicate measurements rsd 5 was reported for each sample 2 4 geo environmental and ecological indices for assessing tes contamination and ecological risk for quantifying the contamination from tes in sediment and associated ecological risk the pollution indices approach was utilized and details of the tools are presented in table 1 due to the lack of local background values of studied tes upper continental crust values by rudnick and gao 2014 were used as baseline data in addition to that consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs were used to assess possible harmful biological effects of tes on aquatic biota macdonald et al 2000 these sqgs were categorized as threshold effect level tel below which adverse effects are not expected to occur probable effect level pel above which adverse effects are expected to occur more often effect range low erl represents the chemical concentration below which adverse effects would be rarely observed and effects range median erm above erm concentration adverse effects would frequently occur long and morgan 1991 2 5 biomonitoring performance evaluation index 2 5 1 bio concentration factors bcf for calculating the extent of tes sharing between macroalgae and the adjacent substrate sediment or water bcf analysis was employed and calculated using the following equation 8 bcf m algae m w s where malgae is the concentration of te in macroalgal tissue and mw s is the concentration of the same te in the water and sediment this tool is a facile method for revealing the contaminant loads in numerical granularity mishra et al 2020 a bcf value of 1 indicates that macroalgae actively uptake metals through phytoextraction and thus implying bioaccumulation jeong and ra 2022 2 5 2 comprehensive bio concentration index cbci the cbci was calculated to appraise the ability of studied macroalgal groups in storing different multiple tes from sediment and water rahman et al 2022 the following relationship was proposed to stand with the comprehensive metal accumulation ability of macroalgae zhao et al 2014 i the fuzzy set or the factor set u u u1 u2 u3 ui here u is the macroalgaes comprehensive accumulation ability level and ui are those various metal pollution factors ii the formula below was applied to calculate the level of fuzzy membership functions for macroalgaes accumulation as well as the capability of each bioconcentration factor bcf 9 μ x x x min x max x min where x is the average bcf of a certain metal pollution factor xmin and xmax are respectively the minimum and maximum values of the bcf of the tes among the investigated macroalgal groups maximum μ x is denoted as the fuzzy membership value 1 contributing the most to the macroalgae s cumulative accumulation ability of various pollution factors while the minimum value is 0 which has less contribution in this scenario finally the cbci evaluation index was calculated through the following equation 10 cbci 1 n i 1 n μ i where n is the total number of metals analyzed and μi is μ x of metal i 2 5 3 metal accumulation index mai to assess the overall performance of the tes accumulation in macroalgae the mai was used for the present study data following the equation developed by liu et al 2007 11 mai 1 n j 1 n i j where n is the total number of tes analyzed and ij is the sub index for variable j obtained through the equation below 12 i j x x where x is the mean concentration of each tes and δx is its standard deviation 2 6 statistical processing descriptive statistics mean median range and standard deviations were calculated and plotted through boxplots and bar plots using r studio 2022 02 0 by implementing the r language prior to statistical analyses studied data were pre checked for normality shapiro wilk and variance of homogeneity f test in the case of heterogeneous variance data were logarithmically transformed log10 x 1 to reduce the variance pearson correlation coefficient was used to ascertain the association between environmental parameters water quality indicators tes in surface water and sediment and tes in macroalgal tissue independent samples t test setting the significant level at p 0 05 were done for calculating the impact of seasonality on each of the studied parameters one way anova was carried out for determining the variation of metal concentration among macroalgae groups p 0 05 the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis using ward s method with squared euclidean distances were expressed in a dendrogram to show the similarity of tes accumulation fe mn zn cu pb and cd in macroalgal groups all statistical tests were performed by using statistical package for social science ibm spss statistics 26 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological variables the swt was found to range from 27 1 to 29 0 c and 31 0 to 33 2 c during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 2a which indicated the characteristics of sub tropical aquatic systems rahaman et al 2015 the water was found slightly alkaline ph 7 in nature throughout the study period indicating the presence of co3 2 ca2 and mg2 in the riverine system fig 2b billah et al 2016a besides the seasonal fluctuation of ph in the estuarine water might be attributed to the influx of freshwater removal of co2 by photosynthesis through hco3 degradation alteration of salinity and temperature with seasons and the decomposition of organic matter saifullah et al 2014a demonstrated significant negative association between water ph and surface water temperature r 0 85 p 0 01 was also previously reported by shefat et al 2021 for the pasur river table s1 the range of salinity fluctuated between 5 5 and 11 ppt during the dry season while a noticeable drop in the salinity level 1 5 to 3 5 ppt during the wet season which could be due to excessive rainfall and the dilution of coastal water through freshwater discharge fig 2c saifullah et al 2016 a significant positive relation between salinity and water ph r 0 89 p 0 01 was also reported by saifullah et al 2019 for the mangrove estuarine waterbody table s1 the do in water is significant for the survival of aquatic communities since it plays a crucial role in aerobic respiration akter et al 2018 uddin et al 2016 2017 uddin et al 2020a b in this study the average do content was higher during the dry season 6 11 mg l 1 than that of the wet season 5 06 mg l 1 fig 2d previous studies also stated similar variation of do in terms of seasonality rahaman et al 2014 increasing solar radiation followed by increased water temperature usually decreases the solubility of do in aquatic systems which explains the lower do level during the wet season liu et al 2020 besides this riverine hydrodynamic processes such as wind mixing and increased diffusion from the air have a profound influence on do levels dodds and whiles 2010 the significant seasonal difference was observable for swt t 5 39 p 0 05 ph t 16 32 p 0 05 salinity t 6 05 p 0 05 and do t 2 09 p 0 05 except for ph and do swt exceeded the upper threshold limit 25 c whereas salinity was found below the lower threshold limit 12 ppt of coastal water quality guidelines by epa for surface water table s2 epa 2001 uddin et al 2022b that could be due to the presence of sub tropical climate associated with solar radiation evaporation insulation and rainfall saifullah et al 2014b 3 2 dissolved nutrients in surface and sediment pore water the concentration of no3 in estuarine surface water was found to range from 0 03 to 0 09 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 0 05 mg l 1 in the dry season and 0 09 to 0 18 mg l 1 with an average of 0 14 mg l 1 during the wet season fig 2e oxidation of ammonia in a form of nitrogen to nitrite and consequently to nitrate is considered as the main controlling mechanism in mangrove estuaries saifullah et al 2014a an elevated level of no3 in surface water during the wet season could be associated with the freshwater influx land runoff and decomposition of mangrove leaf litterfall in the adjacent mangrove environments by the seasonal influence of the monsoon period nirmal kumar et al 2010 uddin et al 2018 nitrate is generally known to demonstrate a negative correlation with salinity which was also observed in this study r 0 82 p 0 01 table s1 philips 1972 the range of po4 3 concentration was higher 0 85 1 30 mg l 1 during the dry season whereas it was found to be lower 0 26 0 54 mg l 1 in the wet season for surface water fig 2f almost similar pattern of distribution in terms of seasonality in the pasur river was also reported by rahaman et al 2013 and nion et al 2020 application of fertilizers within arable lands discharge of sewage and municipal wastes are considered as the probable sources of po4 3 in estuarine water hasan et al 2022 phosphate in surface water demonstrates a significant positive association with ph r 0 92 p 0 01 which was previously well explained by asha et al 2020 for the estuarine water of pasur river table s1 like po4 3 nh4 was also found to be in higher range during the dry season 0 03 to 0 05 mg l 1 than that of during the wet season 0 01 0 04 mg l 1 fig 2g overall the distribution pattern of nutrients in the surface water followed the order of po4 3 no3 nh4 throughout the study period whereas significant seasonal variation was only found for po4 3 t 6 98 p 0 05 except po4 3 both no3 and nh4 were found within the guideline limits of coastal water quality for surface water table s2 epa 2001 uddin et al 2022c the intrusion of upwelling seawater into the estuary could be the plausible explanation for po4 3 to breach the standard threshold limit of coastal water quality saifullah et al 2014b uddin et al 2022d e unlike surface water the distribution pattern of nutrients in the sediment pore water followed the order of no3 po4 3 nh4 during the study period fig 2h i and j except for nh4 the remaining two nutrients were found to be higher during the dry season than the wet season and were found to be lower in the sediment pore water than the surface water seasonality was found significant for nitrate t 2 73 p 0 05 and ammonium t 2 37 p 0 05 in the sediment pore water through the remineralization process ammonia is released into the pore water system and later oxidized to nitrate whereas organic degradation from microbial activity releases phosphate in the pore waters nkotagu 1994 unfortunately there was no guideline available for sediment pore water quality and hence it was unable to compare the dissolved nutrients in sediment pore water with the acceptable limits 3 3 trace elements tes in estuarine surface water and sediment the average concentrations of investigated tes followed a decreasing order of fe pb zn mn cd for estuarine water the average concentration of fe fig 3a mn fig 3b and cd fig 3e was found higher during the wet season than that during the dry season while zn fig 3c and pb fig 3d concentration was in elevated range during the dry season in the estuarine water copper was below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 throughout the study period and therefore cu was excluded from the analysis significant seasonality was observed for mn t 3 36 p 0 05 and zn t 3 37 p 0 05 the minimum maximum except pb and cd and mean values of the studied tes were within the recommended values by epa and reported values are comparable with other estuaries in the world table s3 the majority of the cases tes concentrations in the pasur river coincided with studies presented in table s3 except in estuaries in australia and malaysia previously khan et al 2019 also reported elevated levels of pb and cd in the estuarine water of the pasur river which might be attributed to the discharged effluents from cement jute paper and pulp processing industries located upstream of pasur river besides ship breaking activities from the adjacent shipyard could be another factor since parts of the ship are usually coated with paints containing pb and cd hossain and islam 2006 this explains the higher levels of pb and cd from the present study domain the pearson correlation revealed a significant inter relation between the tes in surface water and with water quality indicators like fe with do r 0 64 p 0 05 mn with ph r 0 76 p 0 05 salinity r 0 70 p 0 05 and fe r 0 66 p 0 05 zn with ph r 0 76 p 0 05 and po4 3 r 0 82 p 0 01 pb with ph r 0 65 p 0 05 and mn r 0 77 p 0 01 and cd with no3 r 0 66 p 0 05 table s1 the concentrations of tes in estuarine water are governed by several processes like biological uptake scavenging by particulate matter release from bottom sediments advection mixing of water masses and the aeolian transportation of terrestrial materials leal et al 1997 the correlation between tes and nutrients in water was in line with the understanding of akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 the tes concentration in the intertidal sediment samples was found in an order of fe mn zn cu pb cd during two sampling periods the concentration of fe fig 3f cu fig 3i and pb fig 3j were found higher during the dry season while mn fig 3g zn fig 3h and cd fig 3k were higher during the wet season however a significant seasonal difference was only observed for mn t 4 02 p 0 05 and cd t 5 25 p 0 05 in the sediment samples moderate to high levels of fe is usually a characteristic of estuarine sediments and it could be regulated by the fe precipitation as iron sulfide and sediment oxidation celis hernandez et al 2022 prior to this study asha et al 2020 islam et al 2017 islam et al 2022 and mahfuz islam et al 2022 also reported a similar range of fe levels for this study area the concentration of tes was found lower than the upper continental crust ucc levels and is comparable with different geographic regions table s3 except for pb and cd the concentration of tes in sediment was found within a similar range at estuaries in bangladesh and sundarbans india table s3 however the concentration of pb and cd were found lower than in other estuaries presented in table s3 which indicated the natural origin of these two tes in the intertidal sediment the pearson correlation analysis pointed out a significant relationship of fe with zn r 0 77 p 0 01 cu r 0 72 p 0 05 and pb r 0 93 p 0 01 zn with cu r 0 84 p 0 01 and pb r 0 81 p 0 01 and cu with pb r 0 83 p 0 01 table s4 such interrelationships of trace metals indicated a similar source of origin for fe zn cu and pb siddique et al 2020 river runoff salinity profile sediment composition redox gradients and proximity to the sources of contamination are the main controlling factors of tes level in the estuarine surface sediment coynel et al 2016 3 4 indices approaches for assessing sediment contamination pollution indices are a quite straight forward and widely used method for quantifying contamination scenarios numerically from tes detailed of the applied pollution indices with classification schemes is presented in table 1 and the obtained results are visualized in fig 4 the enrichment factors efs of trace elements have been applied to ascertain the human made contamination in the sediment by standardizing a tested element against a reference element fe for this study for both sampling periods the ef values for mn and zn were 1 implying the non crustal origin of these elements while for cu the ef values were 1 5 indicating possible contamination from uncontrolled wastewater discharges and long transportation phenomena fig 4a choudhury et al 2021 rest two tes pb and cd exhibited ef 1 suggesting their abundance in sediments from natural weathering processes fig 4a the igeo is another tool for the quantitative measurement of metal pollution in aquatic sediments ridgway and shimmield 2002 except for fe igeo for the other five tes mn zn cu pb and cd showed uncontaminated status in the sediment samples for both seasons fig 4b the moderate to strongly contaminated status of fe indicated input from industrial waste ship breaking industries boats jetties etc rahman et al 2011 besides similar igeo values of fe were previously documented by ranjan et al 2018 for sundarbans mangrove estuarine sediment the estimated mean contamination factor cf values for the studied tes were low which coincided with the finding of islam et al 2017 for the mangrove sediment of the pasur river estuary fig 4c fig 3d shows the distribution of pli values for the sampling sites in both study periods pli values for the sampling sites ranged from 0 38 to 0 55 during the dry season and from 0 25 to 0 52 during the wet season fig 4d the 4 out of 5 sampling sites had higher pli values during the dry season nevertheless pli values were 1 which implied no sign of major pollution scenario within the sampling sites in the case of ecological risk all tes under the study demonstrated low risk for the ecological community in all the sampling sites fig 4e and f for assessing the potential biological effects of the tes in the mangrove sediments sqgs were used most tes have 100 of values below the lel level through the two seasons except fe mn and cu table s5 during the dry season fe had 80 mn had 7 and cu had 100 of values between the lel and sel levels while in the wet season the values reduced to 40 for fe 0 for mn and 93 for cu with reference to tel and pel sqgs any site is considered contaminated if 10 of the values exceed tel except for cu all other tes were found to have 100 of values less than the tel for both study periods copper had 100 and 80 values exceeding the tel table s5 however no tes concentrations were found above the pel and the erl the sqgs results suggested that fe mn zn pb and cd were not expected to have adverse biological effects upon the biological assemblage since values obtained were below tel and erl while the risk from cu could be anticipated due higher concentration of cu than the tel 3 5 algal biomass the order of the dominant macroalgal groups in terms of biomass was chlorophyta phaeophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and chlorophyta rhodophyta phaeophyta during the wet season fig 4 the highest mean algal biomass was recorded at 220 2 64 29 g m 2 and lowest 75 54 15 41 g m 2 for chlorophyta and rhodophyta respectively during the wet season fig 5 significant variation for biomass among macroalgae groups was confirmed through anova df 2 f 8 70 p 0 05 however biomass did not vary significantly in terms of seasonality for each algal groups except phaeophyta and the results are as follows chlorophyta t 0 86 p 0 05 rhodophyta t 1 70 p 0 05 and phaeophyta t 1 50 p 0 05 present findings for algal biomass were mostly similar to miri estuary of malaysia billah et al 2016b but were higher than that reported from the clyde river of australia melville and pulkownik 2007 which could be due to the factor of latitudinal gradients mejia et al 2012 the appearance of green red and brown algae is usually observed in unpolluted conditions while the highly eutrophic status of a site is usually indicated by the presence of filamentous green algae peckol and rivers 1995 biomass of chlorophyta demonstrated significant negative relation with cd in sediment r 0 67 p 0 05 table s7 while the biomass of phaeophyta showed a significant positive relation with surface water temperature r 0 72 p 0 05 mn in surface water r 0 68 p 0 05 showed negative relation with water ph r 0 66 p 0 05 and pb in surface water r 0 80 p 0 01 showed association with cd in sediment pore water r 0 73 p 0 05 table s8 biomass of rhodophyta displayed significant positive relation only with no3 in sediment pore water r 0 74 p 0 05 table s9 the such association highlighted the factors associated with the production of biomass in the macroalgal taxa predominately the availability of light turbidity salinity preference tidal level wave action immersion period and amount of shading plays a crucial role in biomass production in algal bodies el sharouny et al 2001 3 6 variability of tes in macroalgae groups 3 6 1 concentration of tes metal accumulation by the three mangrove macroalgae groups has been visualized through fig 6 the patterns of metal occurrences were fe mn zn cu pb cd for the three algal groups throughout the study period and such pattern of metal accumulation is usually exhibited by macroalgae from other tropical areas gopinath et al 2011 the higher accumulation of fe by macroalgae groups compared to other tes probably due to high rates of photosynthesis in typical tropical climate coastal habitats chakraborty et al 2014 it is also worth mentioning the aggregative effects of several factors such as the established need for fe for normal growth of marine plants the capability of most algal groups species to biomagnify fe from the adjacent environment and contamination from industrial and other operations eisler 1981 goldberg 1952 the one way anova test confirmed that concentrations of each of the studied metals except mn zn and cd varied among different macroalgal taxa which could be summarized as follows fe df 2 f 12 91 p 0 05 cu df 2 f 5 30 p 0 05 and pb df 2 f 4 42 p 0 05 morphological and physiological factors such as cell wall thickness age of thalli thalli structure a selective affinity for specific metals by species and growth dynamics among macroalgal species might have influenced the variation of tes within the studied algal groups billah et al 2017 rhodophyta exhibited higher fe 17 225 95 μg g 1 mn 500 19 μg g 1 and cu 37 65 μg g 1 content during the wet season and pb 7 45 μg g 1 during the dry season fig 6a b d and e higher zn 124 63 μg g 1 and cd 0 41 μg g 1 content were found in phaeophyta and chlorophyta respectively during the wet season fig 6c and f accumulation of tes in terms of seasonality differed significantly for mn in rhodophyta t 2 84 p 0 05 cu t 2 85 p 0 05 and cd in chlorophyta t 4 68 p 0 05 in algal samples most tes were found at higher levels during the wet season which could be due to the higher rates of photosynthesis and respiration that would favor the accumulation of metals in addition variations in environmental factors ph salinity tes etc and metabolic factors can influence the metal accumulation process in different seasons all tes were higher in the algal tissue than that of estuarine water and intertidal sediment except fe mn and pb which implied the capability of mangrove macroalgae to accumulate tes from their surrounding environment mostly water and sediment bonanno and orlando bonaca 2018 present findings for tes in macroalgal tissues are comparable with studies conducted on macroalgae from different geographic regions of the world table s6 accumulation of the studied tes in macroalgae was quite similar to a previous study in the corresponding study site asha et al 2020 moreover findings for the pattern of tes accumulation by macroalgae were identical with most of the studies presented in table s6 except for macroalgae from australia and malaysia this variation insinuates the tes uptake capacity of macroalgae which can differ due to variations in species and the geography of the study area billah et al 2014 the obtained results also suggested that different groups species of macroalgae have different affinities for different tes reflecting the competition between tes for binding or uptake sides in the algal body lobban and harrison 1997 3 6 2 correlation analysis the correlation among the tes in algal was not uniform and varied with the studied groups in the case of chlorophyta a significant association was observed for fe pb r 0 70 p 0 05 mn cu r 0 71 p 0 05 mn pb r 0 82 p 0 01 and cu cd r 0 76 p 0 05 table 2 prior to this study a positive association between cu and cd in the chlorophyta was observed from the palk bay coast of southeastern india rajaram et al 2020 for phaeophyta a significant relationship was found for mn zn r 0 69 p 0 05 while in rhodophyta fe mn r 0 64 p 0 05 fe cu r 0 84 p 0 01 and pb cd r 0 84 p 0 01 table 2 ali et al 2017 and billah et al 2017 previously reported a similar pattern of intra elemental correlation for phaeophyta and rhodophyta significant correlation between tes in the algal taxa usually indicates that these elements might have a similar source of origin in the algal tissue or by synergic interaction among them akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 several relationships were also obtained from the correlation analysis between tes in algal taxa and hydrological and hydrochemical parameters in chlorophyta all tes showed a significant positive association with swt except for fe and a negative association with po4 3 except fe and zn table s7 elements such as cu pb and cd in chlorophyta displayed significant association with nutrients in surface water and sediment pore water table s7 in addition cd in chlorophyta displayed a significant positive relationship with cd in sediment r 0 70 p 0 05 correlation results of tes in green algal tissue identified that the accumulation of tes was influenced by the combination of environmental variables and studied hydrochemical which are in complete agreement with scientific literature wangersky 1986 lee and wang 2001 in contrast tes in algal tissue of phaeophyta and rhodophyta mostly correlated with tes in water and sediment table s8 and s9 iron in sediment displayed a significant positive correlation with zn in phaeophyta r 0 76 p 0 05 table s8 and rhodophyta r 0 64 p 0 05 table s9 the correlation was also significant for cd in estuarine water and phaeophyta r 0 70 p 0 05 table s8 the correlation of tes in algae with sediment reflected that part of the metal might be scavenged from the sediment whereas the correlation with estuarine water reveals the bimodal process of metal accumulation i e rapid adsorption and slow absorption benkdad et al 2011 luoma et al 1982 3 6 3 cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was conducted to identify the statistical similarity for the accumulation of tes in the body of macroalgae groups and the results were depicted through a dendrogram previously alkan et al 2020 billah et al 2017 and pan et al 2018 applied ward s method based clustering with euclidean distance as a measure of similarity for tes in macroalgal samples for this study the phenon line was placed to a rescaled distance of about 15 to display statistical similarity that depicted 3 major clusters of accumulated tes in the studied algal groups fig 7 in chlorophyta cluster 1 included fe pb and mn cluster 2 included cu cd cluster 3 contained zn only fig 7a for phaeophyta there was a close cluster of mnzn cluster 1 cupb cluster 2 and fecd cluster 3 fig 7b for rhodophyta fe cu and mn were grouped in cluster 1 pbcd belonged to cluster 2 and like chlorophyta only zn constituted cluster 3 fig 7c both chlorophyta and rhodophyta had femn in one cluster and only zn in another cluster revealing statistically identical accumulation of fe mn and zn furthermore a pairwise significant association between the elements of each of the clusters was found in the correlation analysis for the studied macroalgal groups table 2 this agreement between these two analyses confirmed the similar source of origin for tes in algal tissue 3 7 bioaccumulation potential analysis for macroalgae 3 7 1 bio concentration factor bcf the bcf is the ratio of tes content in an aquatic organism and that in water sediment which indicates the capacity of aquatic organisms to accumulate single te the measured bcf values for chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta with respect to estuarine water bcfw and intertidal sediment bcfs are shown in fig 8 the bcfw values for tes were found 1 in all three groups and the bcfw was higher during the dry season except for zn and cd fig 8 among the tes studied bcfw associated with fe mn and zn were found higher in rhodophyta fig 8a c and e pb in chlorophyta fig 8h and cd in phaeophyta fig 8j values of bcfs were found lower than bcfw and in some cases values were found 1 unlike bcfw bcfs values were found higher during the wet season except pb in rhodophyta for all three algal groups fig 8 the bcfs values of fe mn cu and pb were found higher in phaeophyta fig 8b d g and i while values of zn and cd were found higher in chlorophyta fig 8f and k the average bcfs for fe were found 1 in all the macroalgae groups higher bcf values in water than that of sediment indicated active bioaccumulation from water than sediment which is not staggering since macroalgae can accumulate more metals than the estuarine water akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 previously billah et al 2017 and melville and pulkownik 2007 also reported higher bcf values in water higher bcf values for studied elements in the rhodophyta and phaeophyta pointed out the potentiality of these groups accumulating tes than the chlorophyta this finding is consistent with the finding of macroalgae from estuarine mangrove habitats in sarawak malaysia billah et al 2014 3 7 2 comprehensive bio concentration index cbci the cbci can express the accumulation results of several metal pollution factors into one numerical measurement index and this index has been used in various areas however no attempts have been made to evaluate the cumulative metal accumulation capabilities of macroalgae groups species through this method until this date therefore cbci was calculated for the three algal groups and the results were summarized in table 3 unlike bcf analysis the cbci values were found higher for sediment cbcis when compared with estuarine water cbciw which could be due to the absence of bcfw value for cu as the concentration of cu in surface water was below the detection limit figs 2 and 7 and therefore it didn t contribute to the calculation of cbciw on the contrary the concentration of cu in sediment contributed to the bcfs for cu and finally contributed to the calculation of cbcis therefore the cbci values were found higher for sediment than that for water a maximum cbciw of 0 50 was found in phaeophyta while the cbcis were found to be a maximum of 0 50 in rhodophyta both during the dry season the cbciw followed a decreasing order of phaeophyta chlorophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and phaeophyta rhodophyta chlorophyta during the wet season for sediment the cbcis followed a decreasing order of rhodophyta phaeophyta chlorophyta during the dry season and phaeophyta rhodophyta chlorophyta during the wet season higher cbci values indicated that the studied macroalgal groups in the pasur river estuary might be suitable biomonitors since they tend to show greater ability in terms of multi element accumulation 3 7 3 metal accumulation index mai the mai was applied to compare the overall performance of studied algal groups for accumulating tes usually groups species with high mai values have better tes accumulation properties and hence they can be used as a biomonitor for tes contamination in the estuarine ecosystem el amier et al 2018 both the maximum 13 71 and minimum 3 99 mai values were observed in phaeophyta during the dry and wet seasons respectively table 3 the mai values followed a decreasing order of phaeophyta chlorophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and chlorophyta rhodophyta phaeophyta during the wet season such variation in the mai sequence conspicuously revealed the impact of seasonality on the tes accumulation capacity in mangrove macroalgae therefore the selection of suitable macroalgal groups species for biomonitoring of tes contamination might vary with the sampling survey period 4 conclusions since studies concerned with the biomonitoring of trace elements tes through mangrove macroalgae for the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem of bangladesh is sparse this investigation showcased the seasonal biomass production and the potential of mangrove macroalgae to accumulate six tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd from the adjacent pasur river estuary of sundarbans the findings from this study disclosed that except for pb and cd in estuarine water all tes were found within the guideline values for both water and sediment the application of several indices approach revealed low to the minimal impact of the studied tes in the sediment on the ecosystem and biological community except for cu in the case of macroalgae the presence of chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta throughout the study period indicated the relatively unpolluted condition of the study domain whereas the algal biomass varied among the studied macroalgal groups in terms of tes accumulation the pattern of accumulation was identical for the studied macroalgal taxa and the tes in algal bodies demonstrated a significant relationship with environmental variables and hydrochemical in water and sediment in addition multi elemental accumulation exhibited dependency on seasonality which implied that the selection of suitable macroalgae as biomonitors might vary seasonally although inadequacy to assess the bioaccumulation in lower macroalgal taxa constitutes the limitations of this study findings of this study might serve as baseline information for biomonitoring of tes through macroalgae in the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem of bangladesh moreover the proposed biomonitoring performance index method might be useful for future research

1195,being a resourceful ecosystem mangrove estuaries have always been subjected to trace elements tes contamination and therefore the biomonitoring approach holds immense potential for surveilling the aquatic environment to investigate the potentiality of mangrove macroalgae as biomonitors estuarine water intertidal sediment and macroalgal samples were collected from the pasur river estuary of sundarbans mangrove ecosystem bangladesh and afterward studied through atomic absorption spectrometer to quantify the levels of six concerned tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd this study utilized the geo environmental and ecological indices and sediment characterization approaches sediment quality guidelines sqgs for assessing the contamination scenario of the adjacent environment to macroalgae whereas the performance of studied algal groups was evaluated using bio contamination factor comprehensive bio concentration index and metal accumulation index metal occurrence scheme in the water followed the order of fe zn mn pb cd while fe mn zn cu pb cd for both sediment and macroalgae both pb and cd exceeded the guideline limit in estuarine water and the indices approach manifested low to moderate contamination with enrichment from anthropogenic origin of mn zn and cu in sediment moreover the sqgs revealed rare biological effects of cu on an aquatic community within algal samples chlorophyta contributed the highest biomass production followed by phaeophyta and rhodophyta statistical relationship disclosed the influence of environmental variables on te s accumulation in chlorophyta by contrast hydrochemical s association showed prevalence over the tes accumulation process for phaeophyta and rhodophyta bioaccumulation performance analysis revealed that the ability to accumulate tes in macroalgal groups varied with seasons therefore biomonitoring with macroalgae for the region of interest might require further temporal considerations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords metal accumulation mangrove macroalgae environmental parameters seasonality sub tropical estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the mangrove ecosystem and adjacent estuaries are considered as world s most dynamic and productive ecosystem through facilitating numerous ecological and economical services such as breeding ground for fishery resources biogeochemical cycling carbon sequestration shorelines stabilization wood production and many more arofah et al 2021 gani et al 2023 kamal et al 2022 saifullah et al 2019 however areas adjacent to mangrove estuaries have always been favorable sites for extensive urban and industrial activities making this vulnerable ecosystem a reservoir for several organic and inorganic contaminants boerema and meire 2017 hermabessiere et al 2019 uddin et al 2022a among them trace elements tes contamination in mangrove ecosystems has become a contemporary environmental issue due to prosperous industrialization urbanization and overpopulation al solaimani et al 2022 rajaram et al 2020 sultana et al 2022 uddin et al 2021 2018 primarily agricultural runoff domestic waste industrial discharge oil spills and pollution from tourism and boat anchorage are the diverse anthropogenic sources of tes contamination in the mangrove estuarine ecosystem nazneen et al 2019 ourgaud et al 2018 unlike some organic pollutants tes are non degradable highly toxic and persistent in nature consequently tes tend to accumulate easily in organisms and even have the potentiality to bio magnify to superior trophic levels through the food chain ultimately posing potential threats to the aquatic ecosystem and human health bonanno and raccuia 2018 hu et al 2019 said et al 2022 even though some of the tes are natural components of the environment and are regarded as micronutrients fe mn zn and cu they have proven to be toxic above a certain threshold level of bioavailability fernandes et al 2020 furthermore many studies have found that non essential elements e g as cd cr co hg ni and pb can be noxious to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations especially pb and cd are considered as major markers of anthropogenic influence in the marine ecosystem for having a variety of emission sources e g atmospheric deposition effluent discharge agrochemical s runoff etc alam et al 2021 bonanno et al 2020a islam et al 2023 lakshmanna et al 2022 for monitoring the tes contamination in an aquatic ecosystem water column sediment and biota are widely utilized bonanno et al 2020a conti et al 2022 garcía seoane et al 2018 hossain et al 2023 masangkay et al 2022 evaluation of tes contamination through water and sediment is a classical approach nevertheless they do not reflect the absolute state of eco toxicologically available fractions since they depend on several factors bonanno et al 2020b usually the solubility bioavailability and toxicity of tes in water and sediment are influenced by physicochemical parameters e g dissolved oxygen ph salinity suspended particles and dissolved organic matter and hydrodynamic factors currents freshwater input tides and winds billah et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2014 uddin et al 2023a d such complications generate a stochastic pattern which is arduous for assessing the health impact on the surrounding organisms caused by the accumulation suspension and mobilization of sediments chuan and yunus 2019 ghosn et al 2020 hence aquatic biota has been increasingly used as biomonitors for monitoring local tes contamination as it can accumulate tes levels greater than that of corresponding water and sediments diop et al 2016 however for being considered as potential biomonitors they must i have a sessile lifestyle ii be easy to identify iii ensure relevance in terms of the food chain iv have widespread geographic distribution and v be able to accumulate elevated levels of contaminants without being deceased rainbow and phillips 1993 zhou et al 2008 to this date crustaceans macrophytes and mollusks have been found to be valuable for biomonitoring by fulfilling the required criteria whereas macroalgae are one of the widely used biomonitors for environmental contaminants especially for tes contamination bonsignore et al 2018 boutahar et al 2019 outa et al 2020 rouane hacene et al 2015 to date biomonitoring of metals by macroalgae has successfully been carried out in various geographic locations including todos os santos bay brazil brito et al 2012 indian coast chakraborty et al 2014 thermaikos gulf greece malea et al 2015 aughinish bay ireland reis et al 2016 miri estuary malaysia billah et al 2017 north west wales uk chalkley et al 2019 the eastern coast of the shandong peninsula china hu et al 2019 eastern sicily italy bonanno et al 2020a moín costa rica méndez et al 2021 and king george island antarctica lavergne et al 2022 naturally mangrove estuarine ecosystems are the habitat for diverse macroalgal assemblages that grow epiphytically on aerial roots or in the intertidal and subtidal portion of trees such as pneumatophores prop roots branches and other hard substrates billah et al 2016b the ecological connectivity of macroalgae along with epibiotic faunal assemblages including arthropods ascidians crustaceans and sponges create an intricate food network that supports the food chain of various trophic levels mishra and farooq 2022 based on thallus color macroalgae belong to three different groups green algae chlorophyta brown algae phaeophyta and red algae rhodophyta rakib et al 2021 being at the forefront of transitional ecosystems epiphytic macroalgae are continuously exposed to a wide range of contaminants nazneen et al 2022 however the cell wall of macroalgae is predominantly composed of peptidoglycan polysaccharides proteins and uronic acid some of them contain anionic carboxyl sulfate or phosphate groups which are known to be excellent binding sites for metal retention cunha and grenha 2016 davis et al 2003 these enable macroalgae to accumulate metals actively or passively by their thallus from adhering to the water column and sediment billah et al 2014 in the southwestern part of bangladesh the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem is the harbor of macroalgal diversity islam et al 2019 like other mangrove estuaries in the world the sundarbans is also experiencing elevated levels of tes in its river water intertidal sediments and organisms crustaceans fish macrobenthos plants and zooplankton via the loading from domestic and industrial discharges shipping and seaport activity and from the huge number of shrimp and agricultural farms situated in nearby areas borrell et al 2016 choudhury et al 2021 islam et al 2022 kader and narayan sinha 2018 ranjan et al 2018 shil et al 2017 at present environmental pressure along the estuarine ecosystem has been on the continuous rise due to the ongoing project for establishing a coal based power plant in its proximity khan et al 2018 this project is also accompanied by a plan to set up a significant number of industrial establishments near the proposed power plant area which will significantly impact the estuarine ecosystem khan et al 2019 it is anticipated that the level of pollution might be augmented by ongoing development activities now it is important to know how much the estuary is polluted and what can indicate pollution in this connection biomonitoring of tes levels through macroalgae might be a suitable ecological tool for assessing the contamination scenario within the sundarbans however such potentiality has remained out of sight by the scientific community although recently asha et al 2020 have reported the accumulation of trace metals in macroalgae from the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem there is still a deficiency of detailed and comprehensive studies highlighting the accumulation of tes by different mangrove macroalgae species of this regime which would have strong ecological relevance and potential future application for environmental monitoring and management such a study should encompass seasonality and environmental parameters which are not followed in the previous research works moreover for the assessment of the anthropogenic input within the estuarine ecosystem it is required to investigate the state of contamination from non essential tes along with the micronutrients it has been mentioned earlier that several studies have identified pb and cd as potential indicators of anthropogenic contamination of the marine environment consequently the inclusion of these two tes holds great relevance for the intended study therefore this study endeavors to fulfill the gaps by encompassing the investigation of tes contamination monitoring in the sub tropical mangrove estuary of sundarbans bangladesh with specific objectives viz i to assess the level of tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd in the region of interest ii to study the biomass production by macroalgal groups chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta and iii to quantify tes concentration fe mn zn cu pb and cd in tissues of macroalgal groups chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sundarbans is the world s largest contiguous mangrove forest located in the estuarine phase of the ganges brahmaputra gbm river system covering an area of 10 000 km2 of which 7000 km2 70 is land and the remaining 3000 km2 is underwater fig 1 around 60 6017 km2 area of the sundarbans are within the khulna division of bangladesh while the rest 40 4260 km2 in the west bengal india this forest mainly consists of a network of islands and estuaries dissected by innumerable tidal channels e g rivers creeks and channels and therefore it is classified as a tidal depositional ecosystem manna et al 2010 the forest has a humid sub tropical climate and the tropical southwest monsoon has a strong influence on the hydrodynamics of its rivers islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 the average annual humidity rainfall and temperature of sundarbans vary from 70 to 80 1640 2000 mm and 17 32 c respectively the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem is unique in its ecological value and a large portion of its mangrove forest has been declared a unesco world heritage site in 1997 fao undp 1998 the pasur river of the rupsha pasur river system is the largest river within bangladesh s sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem prior to discharging its water in the bay of bengal the river meets the shibsa river while passing through the right side of the trikona and dubla the pasur river is about 142 km long with varying widths at different places 460 m at rupsha 790 m at bajuyan and 2 44 km at pasur shibsha the geology of the river basin contains tidal deltaic and mangrove swamp deposits in its southern part while marsh clay and peat deposits constitute the geology of the northern and western areas islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 on the shore of the pasur river it holds the second largest seaport of the country known as the mongla sea port and the mongla export processing zone epz fig 1 the river is also navigable by large ships and vessels throughout the year for having a greater underwater depth due to having such a convenient trade route around 49 small and large manufacturing and processing industries under the mongla seaport and epz area are situated on the bank of the pasur river that discharge waste and wastewater into the river without proper treatment islam et al 2022 mahfuz islam et al 2022 in addition there are recreation facilities e g tourist spots and local amenities e g boat ferry ghat local market ports etc around the study domain which are also considered as potential sources of tes in the pasur river fig 1 furthermore several studies have predicted that the present scenario of pollution within this estuarine ecosystem might get worse with the operation of a proposed coal based powerplant along the bank of pasur river situated only at 14 km upstream from the sundrabans chowdhury 2017 hossain 2019 mahmud et al 2020 2 2 sampling design surface and sediment pore water sediment and macroalgae samples were collected from the pasur river estuary encompassing five sampling sites at the jonga point of the sundarbans mangrove forest fig 1 at low tide during two seasons dry season december march and wet season june september of 2018 a long patch of the estuary was chosen for sampling covering the upstream midstream and downstream of the pasur river at the jonga point the selection of the sampling sites depended on the availability of macroalgae in the pneumatophores as the representative of the macroalgae assemblage asha et al 2020 the sampling sites were about 2 km apart from each other encompassing about a patch of 10 km and the sites were adjacent to the sundarbans mangrove forest the geographical location of sampling sites was determined using gps global positioning system in degree minutes and seconds dms coordinate system using the garmin handheld gps series to ease sampling points in the subsequent seasons 2 2 1 water sampling preparation and physicochemical properties analysis surface water samples from the estuary were collected for water nutrient and metal analysis whereas sediment pore water was collected for nutrient analysis only from each sampling site surface n 30 considering two sampling seasons i e the dry and wet and sediment pore water n 30 considering two sampling seasons i e the dry and wet samples were collected in triplicates in a 500 ml polyethylene bottles that had been pre washed in 10 nitric acid hno3 and rinsed 5 times in deionized water parween et al 2022 for avoiding contamination all sampling bottles were then separately bagged with labels and transported immediately to the laboratory on an icebox for analysis in the laboratory both surface and sediment pore water samples were filtered using the millipore filtering system mfs for tes analysis surface water samples were acidified with 2 ml of concentrated hno3 analytical grade sigma aldrich germany into each 100 ml sample and stored at 4 c in the refrigerator until further analysis the non acidified surface and sediment pore water samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic nitrate no3 phosphate po4 3 and ammonium nh4 following the methods of parsons et al 1984 kitamura et al 1982 and weatherburn 1967 respectively besides in situ water quality indicators such as surface water temperature swt ph dissolved oxygen do and surface water salinity were measured for each of the surface water samples by using calibrated temperature and ph meter model no hi 8314 hanna usa do meter model no pdo 519 lutron usa and refractometer model no hi 96822 hanna usa respectively during each sampling survey 2 2 2 sediment sampling and preparation intertidal surface sediment top 5 cm samples were collected in triplicate from each sampling site using a plastic trowel during each sampling period n 30 considering two sampling seasons dry and wet and kept in a cooler box for transport to the laboratory after removing surface litter after that sediments samples were air dried at room temperature for 7 days prior to oven drying at 80 c for 24 h barik et al 2018 once dried the samples were ground with a mortar and pestle until all particles could pass through a 300 bss mesh sieve finally the samples were stored in zip lock polythene bags until further analysis for tes analysis about 10 g of finely grounded dried powdered sediment samples were digested in a 100 ml kjeldahl flask separately with 20 ml concentrated hno3 and 10 ml perchloric acid hclo4 at 100 5 c on a heating mantle under reflux condition hasan et al 2020 with the appearance of an almost transparent solution the flasks were removed from the heating mantle and cooled naturally these digested samples were then transferred to 50 ml previously cleaned volumetric flasks and diluted up to the mark with deionized water for homogeneity the samples were mixed well and filtered through whatman filter paper qualitative 1 125 mm dia 100 circles finally prepared samples were stored in the laboratory at 4 c for tes analysis 2 2 3 macroalgae collection and processing pneumatophores containing macroalgae were collected using the quadrat sampling method at each of the five sampling sites for biomass and metal analysis pneumatophores were cut in the midline with a clipper from the sub littoral zone 0 5 3 0 m during the low tide period of each sampling season when the mangrove foreshore is exposed a total of 160 pneumatophores n 80 for tes analysis and n 80 for biomass analysis considering two sampling seasons dry and wet were collected in each sampling survey the collected pneumatophores were packed in a ziplock plastic and kept in an icebox for conveying to the laboratory immediately in the laboratory samples of macroalgae were washed with distilled water to remove various debris and later these were scrapped off from each pneumatophore taking care not to remove the pneumatophore tissue afterward algal samples were gently washed again to remove any adhering sediment particles and separated onto small glass petri dishes collected macroalgae samples were then separated based on the color viz chlorophyta for green algae phaeophyta for brown algae and rhodophyta for red algae following rakib et al 2021 chlorophyta was found at almost every sampling site during both seasons while phaeophyta and rhodophyta were not found during the dry sampling sites s2 and s5 and wet seasons sampling site s4 respectively for tes analysis macroalgal samples were first dried in an oven at 60 c for 48 h and then ground into the mortar with a pestle for obtaining powdered samples the dried powdered algal samples 2 5 g were then acid digested using hno3 hclo4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 solution following hasan et al 2020 the digested samples were utilized for elemental analysis in the case of biomass analysis macroalgal samples were dried overnight at 70 c in an oven followed by measuring the weights for dried samples billah et al 2016a representative pneumatophore s length and radius were diligently measured by a caliper for calculating the surface area for each pneumatophore through the equation stated below steinke and naidoo 1990 1 surface area π d h where π constant d radius of the pneumatophores and h length of the pneumatophores the biomass dry weight of macroalgae was expressed as gm m 2 based on the previously determined surface area of pneumatophores 2 3 trace elements tes analysis and quality control determination of tes in the water sediment and macroalgae samples was carried out at the institute of national analytical research and service inars an iso iec 17025 2017 accredited laboratory bangladesh council of scientific and industrial research bcsir dhaka bangladesh using atomic absorption spectrometer aas the concentration of fe mn zn and cu in all samples was analyzed using the flame technique in aas model aa240fs varian australia while pb and cd concentrations were analyzed using the zeeman furnace technique in aas model gta 120 aa240z varian australia during elemental analysis nist national institute of standards and technology traceable certified reference materials crm of individual metals 1000 mg l 1 obtained from fluka analytical sigma aldrich germany were used to prepare calibration working standards by dilution with deionized water conductivity 0 5 μs cm in the case of high concentrations the samples were diluted using deionized water an element specific hollow cathode lamp was used for each metal during instrumental analysis to ascertain the reliability of the analysis for each determination a standard solution crm after five samples with a reagent method blank after ten samples were determined the analytical accuracy and precision were ensured through the replicate measurements of the crm for each metal the expected value of the crm and the measured value were within a 5 difference and the average values of three consecutive replicates were taken for each determination in which relative standard deviation rsd was within 5 ensuring good instrumental precision to avoid the matrix effect in the samples spike recovery analysis was performed and found in the range of 97 102 for all tes all samples were analyzed in triplicates and the average value of the three replicate measurements rsd 5 was reported for each sample 2 4 geo environmental and ecological indices for assessing tes contamination and ecological risk for quantifying the contamination from tes in sediment and associated ecological risk the pollution indices approach was utilized and details of the tools are presented in table 1 due to the lack of local background values of studied tes upper continental crust values by rudnick and gao 2014 were used as baseline data in addition to that consensus based sediment quality guidelines sqgs were used to assess possible harmful biological effects of tes on aquatic biota macdonald et al 2000 these sqgs were categorized as threshold effect level tel below which adverse effects are not expected to occur probable effect level pel above which adverse effects are expected to occur more often effect range low erl represents the chemical concentration below which adverse effects would be rarely observed and effects range median erm above erm concentration adverse effects would frequently occur long and morgan 1991 2 5 biomonitoring performance evaluation index 2 5 1 bio concentration factors bcf for calculating the extent of tes sharing between macroalgae and the adjacent substrate sediment or water bcf analysis was employed and calculated using the following equation 8 bcf m algae m w s where malgae is the concentration of te in macroalgal tissue and mw s is the concentration of the same te in the water and sediment this tool is a facile method for revealing the contaminant loads in numerical granularity mishra et al 2020 a bcf value of 1 indicates that macroalgae actively uptake metals through phytoextraction and thus implying bioaccumulation jeong and ra 2022 2 5 2 comprehensive bio concentration index cbci the cbci was calculated to appraise the ability of studied macroalgal groups in storing different multiple tes from sediment and water rahman et al 2022 the following relationship was proposed to stand with the comprehensive metal accumulation ability of macroalgae zhao et al 2014 i the fuzzy set or the factor set u u u1 u2 u3 ui here u is the macroalgaes comprehensive accumulation ability level and ui are those various metal pollution factors ii the formula below was applied to calculate the level of fuzzy membership functions for macroalgaes accumulation as well as the capability of each bioconcentration factor bcf 9 μ x x x min x max x min where x is the average bcf of a certain metal pollution factor xmin and xmax are respectively the minimum and maximum values of the bcf of the tes among the investigated macroalgal groups maximum μ x is denoted as the fuzzy membership value 1 contributing the most to the macroalgae s cumulative accumulation ability of various pollution factors while the minimum value is 0 which has less contribution in this scenario finally the cbci evaluation index was calculated through the following equation 10 cbci 1 n i 1 n μ i where n is the total number of metals analyzed and μi is μ x of metal i 2 5 3 metal accumulation index mai to assess the overall performance of the tes accumulation in macroalgae the mai was used for the present study data following the equation developed by liu et al 2007 11 mai 1 n j 1 n i j where n is the total number of tes analyzed and ij is the sub index for variable j obtained through the equation below 12 i j x x where x is the mean concentration of each tes and δx is its standard deviation 2 6 statistical processing descriptive statistics mean median range and standard deviations were calculated and plotted through boxplots and bar plots using r studio 2022 02 0 by implementing the r language prior to statistical analyses studied data were pre checked for normality shapiro wilk and variance of homogeneity f test in the case of heterogeneous variance data were logarithmically transformed log10 x 1 to reduce the variance pearson correlation coefficient was used to ascertain the association between environmental parameters water quality indicators tes in surface water and sediment and tes in macroalgal tissue independent samples t test setting the significant level at p 0 05 were done for calculating the impact of seasonality on each of the studied parameters one way anova was carried out for determining the variation of metal concentration among macroalgae groups p 0 05 the results of the hierarchical cluster analysis using ward s method with squared euclidean distances were expressed in a dendrogram to show the similarity of tes accumulation fe mn zn cu pb and cd in macroalgal groups all statistical tests were performed by using statistical package for social science ibm spss statistics 26 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological variables the swt was found to range from 27 1 to 29 0 c and 31 0 to 33 2 c during the dry and wet seasons respectively fig 2a which indicated the characteristics of sub tropical aquatic systems rahaman et al 2015 the water was found slightly alkaline ph 7 in nature throughout the study period indicating the presence of co3 2 ca2 and mg2 in the riverine system fig 2b billah et al 2016a besides the seasonal fluctuation of ph in the estuarine water might be attributed to the influx of freshwater removal of co2 by photosynthesis through hco3 degradation alteration of salinity and temperature with seasons and the decomposition of organic matter saifullah et al 2014a demonstrated significant negative association between water ph and surface water temperature r 0 85 p 0 01 was also previously reported by shefat et al 2021 for the pasur river table s1 the range of salinity fluctuated between 5 5 and 11 ppt during the dry season while a noticeable drop in the salinity level 1 5 to 3 5 ppt during the wet season which could be due to excessive rainfall and the dilution of coastal water through freshwater discharge fig 2c saifullah et al 2016 a significant positive relation between salinity and water ph r 0 89 p 0 01 was also reported by saifullah et al 2019 for the mangrove estuarine waterbody table s1 the do in water is significant for the survival of aquatic communities since it plays a crucial role in aerobic respiration akter et al 2018 uddin et al 2016 2017 uddin et al 2020a b in this study the average do content was higher during the dry season 6 11 mg l 1 than that of the wet season 5 06 mg l 1 fig 2d previous studies also stated similar variation of do in terms of seasonality rahaman et al 2014 increasing solar radiation followed by increased water temperature usually decreases the solubility of do in aquatic systems which explains the lower do level during the wet season liu et al 2020 besides this riverine hydrodynamic processes such as wind mixing and increased diffusion from the air have a profound influence on do levels dodds and whiles 2010 the significant seasonal difference was observable for swt t 5 39 p 0 05 ph t 16 32 p 0 05 salinity t 6 05 p 0 05 and do t 2 09 p 0 05 except for ph and do swt exceeded the upper threshold limit 25 c whereas salinity was found below the lower threshold limit 12 ppt of coastal water quality guidelines by epa for surface water table s2 epa 2001 uddin et al 2022b that could be due to the presence of sub tropical climate associated with solar radiation evaporation insulation and rainfall saifullah et al 2014b 3 2 dissolved nutrients in surface and sediment pore water the concentration of no3 in estuarine surface water was found to range from 0 03 to 0 09 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 0 05 mg l 1 in the dry season and 0 09 to 0 18 mg l 1 with an average of 0 14 mg l 1 during the wet season fig 2e oxidation of ammonia in a form of nitrogen to nitrite and consequently to nitrate is considered as the main controlling mechanism in mangrove estuaries saifullah et al 2014a an elevated level of no3 in surface water during the wet season could be associated with the freshwater influx land runoff and decomposition of mangrove leaf litterfall in the adjacent mangrove environments by the seasonal influence of the monsoon period nirmal kumar et al 2010 uddin et al 2018 nitrate is generally known to demonstrate a negative correlation with salinity which was also observed in this study r 0 82 p 0 01 table s1 philips 1972 the range of po4 3 concentration was higher 0 85 1 30 mg l 1 during the dry season whereas it was found to be lower 0 26 0 54 mg l 1 in the wet season for surface water fig 2f almost similar pattern of distribution in terms of seasonality in the pasur river was also reported by rahaman et al 2013 and nion et al 2020 application of fertilizers within arable lands discharge of sewage and municipal wastes are considered as the probable sources of po4 3 in estuarine water hasan et al 2022 phosphate in surface water demonstrates a significant positive association with ph r 0 92 p 0 01 which was previously well explained by asha et al 2020 for the estuarine water of pasur river table s1 like po4 3 nh4 was also found to be in higher range during the dry season 0 03 to 0 05 mg l 1 than that of during the wet season 0 01 0 04 mg l 1 fig 2g overall the distribution pattern of nutrients in the surface water followed the order of po4 3 no3 nh4 throughout the study period whereas significant seasonal variation was only found for po4 3 t 6 98 p 0 05 except po4 3 both no3 and nh4 were found within the guideline limits of coastal water quality for surface water table s2 epa 2001 uddin et al 2022c the intrusion of upwelling seawater into the estuary could be the plausible explanation for po4 3 to breach the standard threshold limit of coastal water quality saifullah et al 2014b uddin et al 2022d e unlike surface water the distribution pattern of nutrients in the sediment pore water followed the order of no3 po4 3 nh4 during the study period fig 2h i and j except for nh4 the remaining two nutrients were found to be higher during the dry season than the wet season and were found to be lower in the sediment pore water than the surface water seasonality was found significant for nitrate t 2 73 p 0 05 and ammonium t 2 37 p 0 05 in the sediment pore water through the remineralization process ammonia is released into the pore water system and later oxidized to nitrate whereas organic degradation from microbial activity releases phosphate in the pore waters nkotagu 1994 unfortunately there was no guideline available for sediment pore water quality and hence it was unable to compare the dissolved nutrients in sediment pore water with the acceptable limits 3 3 trace elements tes in estuarine surface water and sediment the average concentrations of investigated tes followed a decreasing order of fe pb zn mn cd for estuarine water the average concentration of fe fig 3a mn fig 3b and cd fig 3e was found higher during the wet season than that during the dry season while zn fig 3c and pb fig 3d concentration was in elevated range during the dry season in the estuarine water copper was below the detection limit 0 01 mg l 1 throughout the study period and therefore cu was excluded from the analysis significant seasonality was observed for mn t 3 36 p 0 05 and zn t 3 37 p 0 05 the minimum maximum except pb and cd and mean values of the studied tes were within the recommended values by epa and reported values are comparable with other estuaries in the world table s3 the majority of the cases tes concentrations in the pasur river coincided with studies presented in table s3 except in estuaries in australia and malaysia previously khan et al 2019 also reported elevated levels of pb and cd in the estuarine water of the pasur river which might be attributed to the discharged effluents from cement jute paper and pulp processing industries located upstream of pasur river besides ship breaking activities from the adjacent shipyard could be another factor since parts of the ship are usually coated with paints containing pb and cd hossain and islam 2006 this explains the higher levels of pb and cd from the present study domain the pearson correlation revealed a significant inter relation between the tes in surface water and with water quality indicators like fe with do r 0 64 p 0 05 mn with ph r 0 76 p 0 05 salinity r 0 70 p 0 05 and fe r 0 66 p 0 05 zn with ph r 0 76 p 0 05 and po4 3 r 0 82 p 0 01 pb with ph r 0 65 p 0 05 and mn r 0 77 p 0 01 and cd with no3 r 0 66 p 0 05 table s1 the concentrations of tes in estuarine water are governed by several processes like biological uptake scavenging by particulate matter release from bottom sediments advection mixing of water masses and the aeolian transportation of terrestrial materials leal et al 1997 the correlation between tes and nutrients in water was in line with the understanding of akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 the tes concentration in the intertidal sediment samples was found in an order of fe mn zn cu pb cd during two sampling periods the concentration of fe fig 3f cu fig 3i and pb fig 3j were found higher during the dry season while mn fig 3g zn fig 3h and cd fig 3k were higher during the wet season however a significant seasonal difference was only observed for mn t 4 02 p 0 05 and cd t 5 25 p 0 05 in the sediment samples moderate to high levels of fe is usually a characteristic of estuarine sediments and it could be regulated by the fe precipitation as iron sulfide and sediment oxidation celis hernandez et al 2022 prior to this study asha et al 2020 islam et al 2017 islam et al 2022 and mahfuz islam et al 2022 also reported a similar range of fe levels for this study area the concentration of tes was found lower than the upper continental crust ucc levels and is comparable with different geographic regions table s3 except for pb and cd the concentration of tes in sediment was found within a similar range at estuaries in bangladesh and sundarbans india table s3 however the concentration of pb and cd were found lower than in other estuaries presented in table s3 which indicated the natural origin of these two tes in the intertidal sediment the pearson correlation analysis pointed out a significant relationship of fe with zn r 0 77 p 0 01 cu r 0 72 p 0 05 and pb r 0 93 p 0 01 zn with cu r 0 84 p 0 01 and pb r 0 81 p 0 01 and cu with pb r 0 83 p 0 01 table s4 such interrelationships of trace metals indicated a similar source of origin for fe zn cu and pb siddique et al 2020 river runoff salinity profile sediment composition redox gradients and proximity to the sources of contamination are the main controlling factors of tes level in the estuarine surface sediment coynel et al 2016 3 4 indices approaches for assessing sediment contamination pollution indices are a quite straight forward and widely used method for quantifying contamination scenarios numerically from tes detailed of the applied pollution indices with classification schemes is presented in table 1 and the obtained results are visualized in fig 4 the enrichment factors efs of trace elements have been applied to ascertain the human made contamination in the sediment by standardizing a tested element against a reference element fe for this study for both sampling periods the ef values for mn and zn were 1 implying the non crustal origin of these elements while for cu the ef values were 1 5 indicating possible contamination from uncontrolled wastewater discharges and long transportation phenomena fig 4a choudhury et al 2021 rest two tes pb and cd exhibited ef 1 suggesting their abundance in sediments from natural weathering processes fig 4a the igeo is another tool for the quantitative measurement of metal pollution in aquatic sediments ridgway and shimmield 2002 except for fe igeo for the other five tes mn zn cu pb and cd showed uncontaminated status in the sediment samples for both seasons fig 4b the moderate to strongly contaminated status of fe indicated input from industrial waste ship breaking industries boats jetties etc rahman et al 2011 besides similar igeo values of fe were previously documented by ranjan et al 2018 for sundarbans mangrove estuarine sediment the estimated mean contamination factor cf values for the studied tes were low which coincided with the finding of islam et al 2017 for the mangrove sediment of the pasur river estuary fig 4c fig 3d shows the distribution of pli values for the sampling sites in both study periods pli values for the sampling sites ranged from 0 38 to 0 55 during the dry season and from 0 25 to 0 52 during the wet season fig 4d the 4 out of 5 sampling sites had higher pli values during the dry season nevertheless pli values were 1 which implied no sign of major pollution scenario within the sampling sites in the case of ecological risk all tes under the study demonstrated low risk for the ecological community in all the sampling sites fig 4e and f for assessing the potential biological effects of the tes in the mangrove sediments sqgs were used most tes have 100 of values below the lel level through the two seasons except fe mn and cu table s5 during the dry season fe had 80 mn had 7 and cu had 100 of values between the lel and sel levels while in the wet season the values reduced to 40 for fe 0 for mn and 93 for cu with reference to tel and pel sqgs any site is considered contaminated if 10 of the values exceed tel except for cu all other tes were found to have 100 of values less than the tel for both study periods copper had 100 and 80 values exceeding the tel table s5 however no tes concentrations were found above the pel and the erl the sqgs results suggested that fe mn zn pb and cd were not expected to have adverse biological effects upon the biological assemblage since values obtained were below tel and erl while the risk from cu could be anticipated due higher concentration of cu than the tel 3 5 algal biomass the order of the dominant macroalgal groups in terms of biomass was chlorophyta phaeophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and chlorophyta rhodophyta phaeophyta during the wet season fig 4 the highest mean algal biomass was recorded at 220 2 64 29 g m 2 and lowest 75 54 15 41 g m 2 for chlorophyta and rhodophyta respectively during the wet season fig 5 significant variation for biomass among macroalgae groups was confirmed through anova df 2 f 8 70 p 0 05 however biomass did not vary significantly in terms of seasonality for each algal groups except phaeophyta and the results are as follows chlorophyta t 0 86 p 0 05 rhodophyta t 1 70 p 0 05 and phaeophyta t 1 50 p 0 05 present findings for algal biomass were mostly similar to miri estuary of malaysia billah et al 2016b but were higher than that reported from the clyde river of australia melville and pulkownik 2007 which could be due to the factor of latitudinal gradients mejia et al 2012 the appearance of green red and brown algae is usually observed in unpolluted conditions while the highly eutrophic status of a site is usually indicated by the presence of filamentous green algae peckol and rivers 1995 biomass of chlorophyta demonstrated significant negative relation with cd in sediment r 0 67 p 0 05 table s7 while the biomass of phaeophyta showed a significant positive relation with surface water temperature r 0 72 p 0 05 mn in surface water r 0 68 p 0 05 showed negative relation with water ph r 0 66 p 0 05 and pb in surface water r 0 80 p 0 01 showed association with cd in sediment pore water r 0 73 p 0 05 table s8 biomass of rhodophyta displayed significant positive relation only with no3 in sediment pore water r 0 74 p 0 05 table s9 the such association highlighted the factors associated with the production of biomass in the macroalgal taxa predominately the availability of light turbidity salinity preference tidal level wave action immersion period and amount of shading plays a crucial role in biomass production in algal bodies el sharouny et al 2001 3 6 variability of tes in macroalgae groups 3 6 1 concentration of tes metal accumulation by the three mangrove macroalgae groups has been visualized through fig 6 the patterns of metal occurrences were fe mn zn cu pb cd for the three algal groups throughout the study period and such pattern of metal accumulation is usually exhibited by macroalgae from other tropical areas gopinath et al 2011 the higher accumulation of fe by macroalgae groups compared to other tes probably due to high rates of photosynthesis in typical tropical climate coastal habitats chakraborty et al 2014 it is also worth mentioning the aggregative effects of several factors such as the established need for fe for normal growth of marine plants the capability of most algal groups species to biomagnify fe from the adjacent environment and contamination from industrial and other operations eisler 1981 goldberg 1952 the one way anova test confirmed that concentrations of each of the studied metals except mn zn and cd varied among different macroalgal taxa which could be summarized as follows fe df 2 f 12 91 p 0 05 cu df 2 f 5 30 p 0 05 and pb df 2 f 4 42 p 0 05 morphological and physiological factors such as cell wall thickness age of thalli thalli structure a selective affinity for specific metals by species and growth dynamics among macroalgal species might have influenced the variation of tes within the studied algal groups billah et al 2017 rhodophyta exhibited higher fe 17 225 95 μg g 1 mn 500 19 μg g 1 and cu 37 65 μg g 1 content during the wet season and pb 7 45 μg g 1 during the dry season fig 6a b d and e higher zn 124 63 μg g 1 and cd 0 41 μg g 1 content were found in phaeophyta and chlorophyta respectively during the wet season fig 6c and f accumulation of tes in terms of seasonality differed significantly for mn in rhodophyta t 2 84 p 0 05 cu t 2 85 p 0 05 and cd in chlorophyta t 4 68 p 0 05 in algal samples most tes were found at higher levels during the wet season which could be due to the higher rates of photosynthesis and respiration that would favor the accumulation of metals in addition variations in environmental factors ph salinity tes etc and metabolic factors can influence the metal accumulation process in different seasons all tes were higher in the algal tissue than that of estuarine water and intertidal sediment except fe mn and pb which implied the capability of mangrove macroalgae to accumulate tes from their surrounding environment mostly water and sediment bonanno and orlando bonaca 2018 present findings for tes in macroalgal tissues are comparable with studies conducted on macroalgae from different geographic regions of the world table s6 accumulation of the studied tes in macroalgae was quite similar to a previous study in the corresponding study site asha et al 2020 moreover findings for the pattern of tes accumulation by macroalgae were identical with most of the studies presented in table s6 except for macroalgae from australia and malaysia this variation insinuates the tes uptake capacity of macroalgae which can differ due to variations in species and the geography of the study area billah et al 2014 the obtained results also suggested that different groups species of macroalgae have different affinities for different tes reflecting the competition between tes for binding or uptake sides in the algal body lobban and harrison 1997 3 6 2 correlation analysis the correlation among the tes in algal was not uniform and varied with the studied groups in the case of chlorophyta a significant association was observed for fe pb r 0 70 p 0 05 mn cu r 0 71 p 0 05 mn pb r 0 82 p 0 01 and cu cd r 0 76 p 0 05 table 2 prior to this study a positive association between cu and cd in the chlorophyta was observed from the palk bay coast of southeastern india rajaram et al 2020 for phaeophyta a significant relationship was found for mn zn r 0 69 p 0 05 while in rhodophyta fe mn r 0 64 p 0 05 fe cu r 0 84 p 0 01 and pb cd r 0 84 p 0 01 table 2 ali et al 2017 and billah et al 2017 previously reported a similar pattern of intra elemental correlation for phaeophyta and rhodophyta significant correlation between tes in the algal taxa usually indicates that these elements might have a similar source of origin in the algal tissue or by synergic interaction among them akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 several relationships were also obtained from the correlation analysis between tes in algal taxa and hydrological and hydrochemical parameters in chlorophyta all tes showed a significant positive association with swt except for fe and a negative association with po4 3 except fe and zn table s7 elements such as cu pb and cd in chlorophyta displayed significant association with nutrients in surface water and sediment pore water table s7 in addition cd in chlorophyta displayed a significant positive relationship with cd in sediment r 0 70 p 0 05 correlation results of tes in green algal tissue identified that the accumulation of tes was influenced by the combination of environmental variables and studied hydrochemical which are in complete agreement with scientific literature wangersky 1986 lee and wang 2001 in contrast tes in algal tissue of phaeophyta and rhodophyta mostly correlated with tes in water and sediment table s8 and s9 iron in sediment displayed a significant positive correlation with zn in phaeophyta r 0 76 p 0 05 table s8 and rhodophyta r 0 64 p 0 05 table s9 the correlation was also significant for cd in estuarine water and phaeophyta r 0 70 p 0 05 table s8 the correlation of tes in algae with sediment reflected that part of the metal might be scavenged from the sediment whereas the correlation with estuarine water reveals the bimodal process of metal accumulation i e rapid adsorption and slow absorption benkdad et al 2011 luoma et al 1982 3 6 3 cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was conducted to identify the statistical similarity for the accumulation of tes in the body of macroalgae groups and the results were depicted through a dendrogram previously alkan et al 2020 billah et al 2017 and pan et al 2018 applied ward s method based clustering with euclidean distance as a measure of similarity for tes in macroalgal samples for this study the phenon line was placed to a rescaled distance of about 15 to display statistical similarity that depicted 3 major clusters of accumulated tes in the studied algal groups fig 7 in chlorophyta cluster 1 included fe pb and mn cluster 2 included cu cd cluster 3 contained zn only fig 7a for phaeophyta there was a close cluster of mnzn cluster 1 cupb cluster 2 and fecd cluster 3 fig 7b for rhodophyta fe cu and mn were grouped in cluster 1 pbcd belonged to cluster 2 and like chlorophyta only zn constituted cluster 3 fig 7c both chlorophyta and rhodophyta had femn in one cluster and only zn in another cluster revealing statistically identical accumulation of fe mn and zn furthermore a pairwise significant association between the elements of each of the clusters was found in the correlation analysis for the studied macroalgal groups table 2 this agreement between these two analyses confirmed the similar source of origin for tes in algal tissue 3 7 bioaccumulation potential analysis for macroalgae 3 7 1 bio concentration factor bcf the bcf is the ratio of tes content in an aquatic organism and that in water sediment which indicates the capacity of aquatic organisms to accumulate single te the measured bcf values for chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta with respect to estuarine water bcfw and intertidal sediment bcfs are shown in fig 8 the bcfw values for tes were found 1 in all three groups and the bcfw was higher during the dry season except for zn and cd fig 8 among the tes studied bcfw associated with fe mn and zn were found higher in rhodophyta fig 8a c and e pb in chlorophyta fig 8h and cd in phaeophyta fig 8j values of bcfs were found lower than bcfw and in some cases values were found 1 unlike bcfw bcfs values were found higher during the wet season except pb in rhodophyta for all three algal groups fig 8 the bcfs values of fe mn cu and pb were found higher in phaeophyta fig 8b d g and i while values of zn and cd were found higher in chlorophyta fig 8f and k the average bcfs for fe were found 1 in all the macroalgae groups higher bcf values in water than that of sediment indicated active bioaccumulation from water than sediment which is not staggering since macroalgae can accumulate more metals than the estuarine water akcali and kucuksezgin 2011 previously billah et al 2017 and melville and pulkownik 2007 also reported higher bcf values in water higher bcf values for studied elements in the rhodophyta and phaeophyta pointed out the potentiality of these groups accumulating tes than the chlorophyta this finding is consistent with the finding of macroalgae from estuarine mangrove habitats in sarawak malaysia billah et al 2014 3 7 2 comprehensive bio concentration index cbci the cbci can express the accumulation results of several metal pollution factors into one numerical measurement index and this index has been used in various areas however no attempts have been made to evaluate the cumulative metal accumulation capabilities of macroalgae groups species through this method until this date therefore cbci was calculated for the three algal groups and the results were summarized in table 3 unlike bcf analysis the cbci values were found higher for sediment cbcis when compared with estuarine water cbciw which could be due to the absence of bcfw value for cu as the concentration of cu in surface water was below the detection limit figs 2 and 7 and therefore it didn t contribute to the calculation of cbciw on the contrary the concentration of cu in sediment contributed to the bcfs for cu and finally contributed to the calculation of cbcis therefore the cbci values were found higher for sediment than that for water a maximum cbciw of 0 50 was found in phaeophyta while the cbcis were found to be a maximum of 0 50 in rhodophyta both during the dry season the cbciw followed a decreasing order of phaeophyta chlorophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and phaeophyta rhodophyta chlorophyta during the wet season for sediment the cbcis followed a decreasing order of rhodophyta phaeophyta chlorophyta during the dry season and phaeophyta rhodophyta chlorophyta during the wet season higher cbci values indicated that the studied macroalgal groups in the pasur river estuary might be suitable biomonitors since they tend to show greater ability in terms of multi element accumulation 3 7 3 metal accumulation index mai the mai was applied to compare the overall performance of studied algal groups for accumulating tes usually groups species with high mai values have better tes accumulation properties and hence they can be used as a biomonitor for tes contamination in the estuarine ecosystem el amier et al 2018 both the maximum 13 71 and minimum 3 99 mai values were observed in phaeophyta during the dry and wet seasons respectively table 3 the mai values followed a decreasing order of phaeophyta chlorophyta rhodophyta during the dry season and chlorophyta rhodophyta phaeophyta during the wet season such variation in the mai sequence conspicuously revealed the impact of seasonality on the tes accumulation capacity in mangrove macroalgae therefore the selection of suitable macroalgal groups species for biomonitoring of tes contamination might vary with the sampling survey period 4 conclusions since studies concerned with the biomonitoring of trace elements tes through mangrove macroalgae for the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem of bangladesh is sparse this investigation showcased the seasonal biomass production and the potential of mangrove macroalgae to accumulate six tes fe mn zn cu pb and cd from the adjacent pasur river estuary of sundarbans the findings from this study disclosed that except for pb and cd in estuarine water all tes were found within the guideline values for both water and sediment the application of several indices approach revealed low to the minimal impact of the studied tes in the sediment on the ecosystem and biological community except for cu in the case of macroalgae the presence of chlorophyta phaeophyta and rhodophyta throughout the study period indicated the relatively unpolluted condition of the study domain whereas the algal biomass varied among the studied macroalgal groups in terms of tes accumulation the pattern of accumulation was identical for the studied macroalgal taxa and the tes in algal bodies demonstrated a significant relationship with environmental variables and hydrochemical in water and sediment in addition multi elemental accumulation exhibited dependency on seasonality which implied that the selection of suitable macroalgae as biomonitors might vary seasonally although inadequacy to assess the bioaccumulation in lower macroalgal taxa constitutes the limitations of this study findings of this study might serve as baseline information for biomonitoring of tes through macroalgae in the sundarbans estuarine mangrove ecosystem of bangladesh moreover the proposed biomonitoring performance index method might be useful for future research

assisted procedure for removal da farmany et al 2016 in this study we try to design an effective heterogeneous nanocomposite system for wastewater treatment in which polymeric textures with natural and synthesis resources had employed to form a composition with iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles lent had utilized as a natural polymeric part of the nanocomposite with several hydroxyl groups in the structure that play an essential role as a suitable substrate for adsorbing pollutants from aqua media however poly vinyl alcohol pva had been chosen as polymeric synthesis composition to modify nanocomposite and increase the capacity of pollution adsorption due to the difficulty of separating waste adsorbents from the reaction the magnetization of polymeric texture with a feasible strategy

finally the nanocomposite was dried at 55 c for 8 h under vacuum conditions and obtained powder had kept for the corresponding analyses taheri ledari et al 2020 mallakpour et al 2021 2 7 adsorption experiments the adsorption experiments were performed at room temperature using aqueous ma da and df solutions with fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposites all contaminants were investigated in detail and illustrated the efficiency of diverse variable parameters such as the amount of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposites ph contact time initial contaminants concentration and adsorption mechanism the contaminant s aqueous solution 10 115 ppm and the specific amount of the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposites 0 05 0 4 g l had added to the flasks and stirred at 400 rpm for 300 min also the solution ph condition had adjusted to diverse values of 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 after reaching equilibration the particles of the adsorbent system had magnetically removed and the concentration of contaminants in the solution had measured with a uv vis spectrophotometer finally the obtained results in the form of adsorption capacity qt and removal efficiency r had calculated using the following eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q t mg g v c 0 c t m 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 m g v l c 0 mg l and c t mg l were fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposites amount contaminant solution volume and the initial and final concentration of contaminant respectively zhou et al 2022 2 8 zeta potential to acquire zeta potential data at the point of zero charges phpzc 50 ml of nano3 solutions 0 1 m had prepared and various amounts of ph in ranges of 1 11 by adding naoh and hno3 solutions had gathered 0 2 g fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite was added to each solution and stirred for 48 h under equal conditions finally the gained result from the amount of ph for each solution had discovered and zeta potential diagram was plotted de bhowmick et al 2022 2 9 antibacterial method the antibacterial activities of the nanocomposite were studied using the disc diffusion procedure the e coli and s aureus bacteria were cultured in müeller hinton broth agar also the prepared agar was in temperature and pressure conditions to sterilize in an autoclave before the test after agar hardening bacterial grass culture had performed the nanocomposite was placed in bacterial cells for 18 24 h in an incubator at 37 c then the growth inhibition around each disk had investigated nosrati et al 2021 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ft ir spectroscopy the ft ir analysis had used to probe the construction of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite lent pva and fe3o4 to identify the presence of functional groups as shown in fig 1 the strong peak in the range 500 650 cm 1 was related to the feo in the fe3o4 structure also distinct absorbance bands for lent and pva had observed which were the absorption bands of approximately 1100 stretching bond co 1450 bending vibration oh 2900 stretching vibration ch and 3500 cm 1 stretching vibration oh finally the ft ir spectrum of the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite contains all absorption bands of the fe3o4 lent and pva that approve the synthesized nanocomposite hoque et al 2018 wang et al 2018 ghaemi and behroozi 2020 fashi et al 2021 additionally the ftir analyses of pure df ma da and after adsorption by adsorbent have been added to the supporting information section fig s1 s3 3 1 2 xrd analysis the xrd analysis had used to study the crystalline nature of the synthesized nanocomposite as shown in fig 2 the xrd pattern of the nanocomposite had adopted with a diffractogram of the standard fe3o4 with card no jcpds 01 075 0033 at 2ө 30 12 35 65 43 11 53 38 57 18 62 84 and 74 08 corresponding to 220 311 222 400 422 511 and 440 a broad characteristic peak at 2ө 17 26 had attributed to the presence of the polymeric part of the nanocomposite beiranvand and habibi 2022 3 1 3 tg analysis the thermal stability of lent pva and fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had performed by tg analysis fig 3 the tg curves approve that fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite thermal stability is higher than neat lent and pva curves in addition the higher heat capacity of the nanocomposite is due to the presence of magnetic nanoparticles also the weight loss in tg analyses had observed in several steps the first decrease in the tg curves of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had approximately 100 200 c and had attributed to the samples moisture also the weight loss at 200 360 c can be associated with the hydroxyl groups depolymerization and dehydration of saccharide rings finally the decomposition and weight decrease in the 360 800 c had related to the separation of the biopolymer linear methyl matrix and cross links among biopolymer chain to glucopyranosyl units esmaeili et al 2020a esmaeili et al 2020b 3 1 4 fe sem analysis fe sem analysis had performed to investigate the structural morphology and particle aggregation of the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite sample as shown in fig 4 the spherical shapes of the nanoparticles with approximately 15 40 nm size distribution can be observed also the uniformly and well distributed spherical nanoparticles improved the adsorbent activity during the adsorption process also the fesem of adsorbent after adsorption of contaminants have been found in supporting information section fig s4 3 1 5 eds analysis the constituent elements of the synthesized samples in the final adsorbent preparation route had carried out by using eds analyses and the acquired consequence had shown in fig 5 the elemental diagram approved the existence of the c o and fe with the weight percentage respectively 17 56 25 23 and 57 21 also the excellent dispersion of elements on the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite surface had determined by eds maps 3 1 6 bet analysis moreover as shown in fig 6 bet analysis had performed to study the specific surface area of the fe3o4 lent pva the analysis shows that specific surface area and total pore volume had found to be 47 m2 g and 0 15 cm3 g respectively also n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were determined to be of type iv according to the literature 3 1 7 vsm the magnetic behavior of fe3o4 nanoparticles before and after modifications by lent and pva with the field sweeping from 9000 to 9000 oe had shown in fig 7 as can be seen in the m h curves the magnetic saturation quantity of fe3o4 lent pva was 48 emu g fig 7 b that in comparison with a magnetic saturation value of neat fe3o4 with 77 emu g fig 7 a reductions of approximately 29 emu g had observed reductions in magnetization content had generally attributed to the modification of fe3o4 by lent and pva as non magnetic compounds in the composition of the synthesized nanocomposite however after modification of fe3o4 by lent and pva the nanocomposites have displayed adequate magnetization for magnetical isolation 3 2 adsorption studies adsorption experiments had performed to investigate the effect of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite adsorbents as remove pollutants from wastewater solution the nanocomposite had added to solutions containing df da and ma pollutants at ambient temperature and sealed conditions with continuous stirring after a defined time the nanocomposite had isolated from the solution by utilizing a magnet the samples had taken to determine the residual concentration by measuring adsorption at the maximum wavelength for ma λmax 210 nm df λmax 276 nm and da λmax 247 nm 3 2 1 effect of adsorbents and adsorbent dosages the effect of adsorption of pollutants by fe3o4 fe3o4 pva fe3o4 lent and fe3o4 lent pva adsorbents had shown in fig 8 a as can be seen all of the adsorbents affected pollutant adsorption but the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had shown higher adsorption capacities for df da and ma adsorption than fe3o4 fe3o4 pva and fe3o4 lent adsorbents these results had attributed to the difference in functional groups structure and behavior of each adsorbent in aqueous media also fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite contains the total properties of each adsorbent in unit structure also as depicted in fig 8 b the efficacy of different dosages of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite on the ma df and da contaminants adsorption had investigated between 0 05 and 0 40 g l according to the results when 0 20 g amount of nanocomposite had added the rate of the removal of the ma df and da pollutants was desired while the higher amount of nanocomposite than 0 20 had not shown any noticeable progress in increasing of removal also enhanced removal was due to an increased amount of active sites for the contaminant in the solution moreover upper the adsorbent dose over the optimum point enhanced the movement or interaction of nanoparticles causing accumulation and overlap in active sites that led to reduced activities of adsorbent and decreased adsorption capacity higgins et al 2022a aldahash et al 2022 higgins and siddiqui 2022 higgins et al 2022b 3 2 2 effect of ph the nanocomposite behavior for pollutants adsorption in acidic neutral and basic environments had investigated according to obtained zeta potential and pka of pollutants fig 9 as seen in fig 9 a the nanocomposite at ph 6 has a neutral charge phzpc zero potential of charge at a ph lower than the neutral point the adsorbent acquires a positive charge and at a ph higher than phzpc the nanocomposite acquires a negative charge according to fig 9 b the maximum amount of pollutant removal had observed at ph 5 df contaminant had a pka between 4 and 4 5 that found to be negative at phs above its dissociation constant on the other hand when the amount of ph increases and reaches ph 5 the dissociated and effective substance of diclofenac comes in the anionic form and becomes negatively charged the zeta potential of nanocomposite in this ph had shown that the surface contains a positive charge and subsequently attraction between negatively charged df and positively charged surface of nanocomposite occurred as a resulted at mentioned ph we will have the highest percentage of removal also these results had applied to ma and da pollutants ma and da have a pka of 3 6 and 2 6 respectively from a higher ph than the dissociation constant them dissociates in anionic form and interacted with the positively charged surface of nanocomposite this interaction had caused attraction between adsorbent and pollutant that increased the removal percentage 3 2 3 kinetics of adsorption and contact time the effect of contact time between nanocomposite and pollutants had investigated for 300 min at ambient temperature as shown in fig 10 by increasing the contact time from 50 min to 300 min the adsorption efficiency of df ma and da risen from 52 to 80 38 to 65 and 30 to 58 respectively kinetic studies are essential for the uptake of various contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals because they had reduced by increasing the time to reach the uptake equilibrium the nanocomposite active adsorption sites were initially readily available so the adsorption rate was much higher but as the adsorption process progressed the adsorption sites had saturated so the adsorption activity of nanocomposite gradually decreased the correlations of three common kinetics models are presented below in their non linear forms 3 pfo q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pso q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 5 ipd q t k i t 1 2 d i where q t is the amount of the tc adsorbed at time t in the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models k 1 and k 2 are the kinetics rate constants respectively in the intra particle diffusion ipd model k i and d i are the diffusion rate constant and intraparticle diffusion constant intercept of the curve respectively kinetic effect pfo pso and ipd of the adsorption process on the nanocomposite have been shown in fig 11 the kinetics of pollutants adsorption on nanocomposites followed the pso equation of velocity because r2 higher correlation shows the coefficient as shown in table 1 the application of the pso model shows that the pollutants adsorption on the nanocomposite surface is a chemical adsorption process in which the pollutants molecules are attached to the nanocomposite through a surface exchange reaction 3 2 4 thermodynamics and adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm experiments had performed to further investigation the nanocomposite during the adsorption process different concentrations of pollutants had examined along with the synthesized nanocomposite at optimum ph and 298 308 and 313 k as shown in fig 12 the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature which indicates the increase of adsorption capacity at higher temperatures this increase in adsorption can be justified as follows 1 breaking internal bonds on the surface which causes an increase in adsorption sites 2 pollutant molecules diffusion in the material s surface cavities showing the positive effect of temperature on pollutant adsorption the thermodynamic parameters of the pollutant absorption process which include gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were obtained through the eqs 6 8 the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kc dimensionless was obtained based on the langmuir constant kl as to solve the unit problem all concentrations units changed to molar form and took into account the standard state c 1 mol l as suggested by many scholars as a result the kc value unitless was obtained from eqs 9 tomul et al 2020 6 g rt ln k c 7 g h t s 8 ln k c h rt s r 9 k c k l m c 10 3 where kc is the adsorption equilibrium constant qe and ce are the same as for the isotherm equations t represents the temperature in kelvin and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k kl l mg is the langmuir constant m g mol is the contaminant s molar mass and c is the standard state c 1 mol l the 103 factor allows converting the unit from gram to milligram the obtained thermodynamic data had shown in table 2 the positive values of δh indicate that the absorption process of all three pollutants is endothermic and the increase in absorption with the increase in temperature confirms this on the other hand the negative values of δg indicate a spontaneous process in the case of all three pollutants the value of δg decreases with increasing temperature which indicates that the adsorption process is more favorable at high temperatures in addition positive values of δs indicate a random increase in the surface area of the solid solution interface due to some structural changes during the adsorption process according to fig 12 four models had examined for isotherms table 3 the langmuir model describes the monolayer coating on the surface of the adsorbent containing a limited number of similar sites which had created by homogeneous adsorption eq 10 10 langmuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e the other model is freundlich which examines and describes multilayer coverage also the adsorption pattern of multilayers had

isotherm models have been reviewed the obtained data for the above models had given in table 3 it had found that the correlation coefficients of the langmuir isotherm model for the removal of df da and ma contaminants are higher than the freundlich d r and temkin isotherm models which shows that the absorption of pollutants follows the langmuir isotherm on the other hand the adsorption of all three contaminants on the synthesized nanocomposite causes the creation of a single layer coating of pollutant molecules on the surface 3 2 5 comparison of the adsorbents the adsorption result of pollutants by the synthesized nanocomposite was compared to previously reported adsorbents in the literature table 4 as can be seen in the presence of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite the amount of

using the disc diffusion procedure the e coli and s aureus bacteria were cultured in müeller hinton broth agar also the prepared agar was in temperature and pressure conditions to sterilize in an autoclave before the test after agar hardening bacterial grass culture had performed the nanocomposite was placed in bacterial cells for 18 24 h in an incubator at 37 c then the growth inhibition around each disk had investigated nosrati et al 2021 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ft ir spectroscopy the ft ir analysis had used to probe the construction of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite lent pva and fe3o4 to identify the presence of functional groups as shown in fig 1 the strong peak in the range 500 650 cm 1 was related to the feo in the fe3o4 structure also distinct absorbance bands for lent and pva had observed which were the absorption bands of approximately 1100 stretching bond co 1450 bending vibration oh 2900 stretching vibration ch and 3500 cm 1 stretching vibration oh finally the ft ir spectrum of the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite contains all absorption bands of the fe3o4 lent and pva that approve the synthesized nanocomposite hoque et al 2018 wang et al 2018 ghaemi and behroozi 2020 fashi et al 2021 additionally the ftir analyses of pure df ma da and after adsorption by adsorbent have been added to the supporting information section fig s1 s3 3 1 2 xrd analysis the xrd analysis had used to study the crystalline nature of the synthesized nanocomposite as shown in fig 2 the xrd pattern of the nanocomposite had adopted with a diffractogram of the standard fe3o4 with card no jcpds 01 075 0033 at 2ө 30 12 35 65 43 11 53 38 57 18 62 84 and 74 08 corresponding to 220 311 222 400 422 511 and 440 a broad characteristic peak at 2ө 17 26 had attributed to the presence of the polymeric part of the nanocomposite beiranvand and habibi 2022 3 1 3 tg analysis the thermal stability of lent pva and fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had performed by tg analysis fig 3 the tg curves approve that fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite thermal stability is higher than neat lent and pva curves in addition the higher heat capacity of the nanocomposite is due to the presence of magnetic nanoparticles also the weight loss in tg analyses had observed in several steps the first decrease in the tg curves of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had approximately 100 200 c and had attributed to the samples moisture also the weight loss at 200 360 c can be associated with the hydroxyl groups depolymerization and dehydration of saccharide rings finally the decomposition and weight decrease in the 360 800 c had related to the separation of the biopolymer linear methyl matrix and cross links among biopolymer chain to glucopyranosyl units esmaeili et al 2020a esmaeili et al 2020b 3 1 4 fe sem analysis fe sem analysis had performed to investigate the structural morphology and particle aggregation of the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite sample as shown in fig 4 the spherical shapes of the nanoparticles with approximately 15 40 nm size distribution can be observed also the uniformly and well distributed spherical nanoparticles improved the adsorbent activity during the adsorption process also the fesem of adsorbent after adsorption of contaminants have been found in supporting information section fig s4 3 1 5 eds analysis the constituent elements of the synthesized samples in the final adsorbent preparation route had carried out by using eds analyses and the acquired consequence had shown in fig 5 the elemental diagram approved the existence of the c o and fe with the weight percentage respectively 17 56 25 23 and 57 21 also the excellent dispersion of elements on the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite surface had determined by eds maps 3 1 6 bet analysis moreover as shown in fig 6 bet analysis had performed to study the specific surface area of the fe3o4 lent pva the analysis shows that specific surface area and total pore volume had found to be 47 m2 g and 0 15 cm3 g respectively also n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were determined to be of type iv according to the literature 3 1 7 vsm the magnetic behavior of fe3o4 nanoparticles before and after modifications by lent and pva with the field sweeping from 9000 to 9000 oe had shown in fig 7 as can be seen in the m h curves the magnetic saturation quantity of fe3o4 lent pva was 48 emu g fig 7 b that in comparison with a magnetic saturation value of neat fe3o4 with 77 emu g fig 7 a reductions of approximately 29 emu g had observed reductions in magnetization content had generally attributed to the modification of fe3o4 by lent and pva as non magnetic compounds in the composition of the synthesized nanocomposite however after modification of fe3o4 by lent and pva the nanocomposites have displayed adequate magnetization for magnetical isolation 3 2 adsorption studies adsorption experiments had performed to investigate the effect of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite adsorbents as remove pollutants from wastewater solution the nanocomposite had added to solutions containing df da and ma pollutants at ambient temperature and sealed conditions with continuous stirring after a defined time the nanocomposite had isolated from the solution by utilizing a magnet the samples had taken to determine the residual concentration by measuring adsorption at the maximum wavelength for ma λmax 210 nm df λmax 276 nm and da λmax 247 nm 3 2 1 effect of adsorbents and adsorbent dosages the effect of adsorption of pollutants by fe3o4 fe3o4 pva fe3o4 lent and fe3o4 lent pva adsorbents had shown in fig 8 a as can be seen all of the adsorbents affected pollutant adsorption but the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite had shown higher adsorption capacities for df da and ma adsorption than fe3o4 fe3o4 pva and fe3o4 lent adsorbents these results had attributed to the difference in functional groups structure and behavior of each adsorbent in aqueous media also fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite contains the total properties of each adsorbent in unit structure also as depicted in fig 8 b the efficacy of different dosages of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite on the ma df and da contaminants adsorption had investigated between 0 05 and 0 40 g l according to the results when 0 20 g amount of nanocomposite had added the rate of the removal of the ma df and da pollutants was desired while the higher amount of nanocomposite than 0 20 had not shown any noticeable progress in increasing of removal also enhanced removal was due to an increased amount of active sites for the contaminant in the solution moreover upper the adsorbent dose over the optimum point enhanced the movement or interaction of nanoparticles causing accumulation and overlap in active sites that led to reduced activities of adsorbent and decreased adsorption capacity higgins et al 2022a aldahash et al 2022 higgins and siddiqui 2022 higgins et al 2022b 3 2 2 effect of ph the nanocomposite behavior for pollutants adsorption in acidic neutral and basic environments had investigated according to obtained zeta potential and pka of pollutants fig 9 as seen in fig 9 a the nanocomposite at ph 6 has a neutral charge phzpc zero potential of charge at a ph lower than the neutral point the adsorbent acquires a positive charge and at a ph higher than phzpc the nanocomposite acquires a negative charge according to fig 9 b the maximum amount of pollutant removal had observed at ph 5 df contaminant had a pka between 4 and 4 5 that found to be negative at phs above its dissociation constant on the other hand when the amount of ph increases and reaches ph 5 the dissociated and effective substance of diclofenac comes in the anionic form and becomes negatively charged the zeta potential of nanocomposite in this ph had shown that the surface contains a positive charge and subsequently attraction between negatively charged df and positively charged surface of nanocomposite occurred as a resulted at mentioned ph we will have the highest percentage of removal also these results had applied to ma and da pollutants ma and da have a pka of 3 6 and 2 6 respectively from a higher ph than the dissociation constant them dissociates in anionic form and interacted with the positively charged surface of nanocomposite this interaction had caused attraction between adsorbent and pollutant that increased the removal percentage 3 2 3 kinetics of adsorption and contact time the effect of contact time between nanocomposite and pollutants had investigated for 300 min at ambient temperature as shown in fig 10 by increasing the contact time from 50 min to 300 min the adsorption efficiency of df ma and da risen from 52 to 80 38 to 65 and 30 to 58 respectively kinetic studies are essential for the uptake of various contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals because they had reduced by increasing the time to reach the uptake equilibrium the nanocomposite active adsorption sites were initially readily available so the adsorption rate was much higher but as the adsorption process progressed the adsorption sites had saturated so the adsorption activity of nanocomposite gradually decreased the correlations of three common kinetics models are presented below in their non linear forms 3 pfo q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pso q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 5 ipd q t k i t 1 2 d i where q t is the amount of the tc adsorbed at time t in the pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso models k 1 and k 2 are the kinetics rate constants respectively in the intra particle diffusion ipd model k i and d i are the diffusion rate constant and intraparticle diffusion constant intercept of the curve respectively kinetic effect pfo pso and ipd of the adsorption process on the nanocomposite have been shown in fig 11 the kinetics of pollutants adsorption on nanocomposites followed the pso equation of velocity because r2 higher correlation shows the coefficient as shown in table 1 the application of the pso model shows that the pollutants adsorption on the nanocomposite surface is a chemical adsorption process in which the pollutants molecules are attached to the nanocomposite through a surface exchange reaction 3 2 4 thermodynamics and adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm experiments had performed to further investigation the nanocomposite during the adsorption process different concentrations of pollutants had examined along with the synthesized nanocomposite at optimum ph and 298 308 and 313 k as shown in fig 12 the adsorption capacity increased with increasing temperature which indicates the increase of adsorption capacity at higher temperatures this increase in adsorption can be justified as follows 1 breaking internal bonds on the surface which causes an increase in adsorption sites 2 pollutant molecules diffusion in the material s surface cavities showing the positive effect of temperature on pollutant adsorption the thermodynamic parameters of the pollutant absorption process which include gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs were obtained through the eqs 6 8 the thermodynamic equilibrium constant kc dimensionless was obtained based on the langmuir constant kl as to solve the unit problem all concentrations units changed to molar form and took into account the standard state c 1 mol l as suggested by many scholars as a result the kc value unitless was obtained from eqs 9 tomul et al 2020 6 g rt ln k c 7 g h t s 8 ln k c h rt s r 9 k c k l m c 10 3 where kc is the adsorption equilibrium constant qe and ce are the same as for the isotherm equations t represents the temperature in kelvin and r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k kl l mg is the langmuir constant m g mol is the contaminant s molar mass and c is the standard state c 1 mol l the 103 factor allows converting the unit from gram to milligram the obtained thermodynamic data had shown in table 2 the positive values of δh indicate that the absorption process of all three pollutants is endothermic and the increase in absorption with the increase in temperature confirms this on the other hand the negative values of δg indicate a spontaneous process in the case of all three pollutants the value of δg decreases with increasing temperature which indicates that the adsorption process is more favorable at high temperatures in addition positive values of δs indicate a random increase in the surface area of the solid solution interface due to some structural changes during the adsorption process according to fig 12 four models had examined for isotherms table 3 the langmuir model describes the monolayer coating on the surface of the adsorbent containing a limited number of similar sites which had created by homogeneous adsorption eq 10 10 langmuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e the other model is freundlich which examines and describes multilayer coverage also the adsorption pattern of multilayers had expressed by the freundlich isotherm eq 11 11 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n additionally the dubbin radushkevich d r and temkin models as more investigation have been expressed by the eq 12 and 13 12 dubinin radushkevich q e q m exp k d rt ln 1 1 c e 2 13 temkin q e rt b t ln k t c e in all equations above q e mg g is the amount of the ma da and df adsorbed at equilibrium in the langmuir model q m mg g is the monolayer adsorption capacity and k l l mg is the isotherm constant in the freundlich model k f mg g l mg 1 n is the isotherm constant and n dimensionless is the exponent in the dubbin radushkevich d r model k d mol2 kj2 is the isotherm constant in the thermodynamic equilibrium constant in the adsorption process r 8 314 j mol k is the gas constant and t k is the adsorption temperature in the temkin model k t l g and b t j mol are the isotherm constant and a constant associated with the heat of adsorption respectively tran and tomul 2020 the experimental results of these isotherm models have been reviewed the obtained data for the above models had given in table 3 it had found that the correlation coefficients of the langmuir isotherm model for the removal of df da and ma contaminants are higher than the freundlich d r and temkin isotherm models which shows that the absorption of pollutants follows the langmuir isotherm on the other hand the adsorption of all three contaminants on the synthesized nanocomposite causes the creation of a single layer coating of pollutant molecules on the surface 3 2 5 comparison of the adsorbents the adsorption result of pollutants by the synthesized nanocomposite was compared to previously reported adsorbents in the literature table 4 as can be seen in the presence of fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite the amount of contaminant from aqueous media relative to the previous adsorbent has higher qm and removal 3 3 reusability based on the strategy for recycling and reusing the fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite the acquired consequence showed that it could be quickly recovered and reused for five continuous cycles with a negligible decrease in removal adsorption fig 13 a the fe sem image xrd and ft ir spectra analyses of the reused fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite after five times in the adsorption optimized model reaction were displayed in fig 13 b d respectively however after five reuses of the adsorbent the token analyzes do not show any changes in their morphology or structure features 3 4 proposed mechanism for contaminants adsorption the pesticides and pharmaceutical contaminants adsorption mechanism by the prepared fe3o4 lent pva nanocomposite is also shown in fig 14 due to the numerous hydroxyl functional groups of polymeric texture of the nanocomposite the most contributive forces are electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions dipole dipole and yoshida the contribution of each force in contaminants adsorption differs at different phs as its details are reported in the literature george and saravanakumar 2018 3 5 antibacterial e coli and s aureus had used as bacterial samples with negative and positive strains to evaluate the antibacterial properties of the fe 3 o 4 lent pva nanocomposite as shown in fig 15 as can be visualized from the results the synthesized nanocomposite does not have antibacterial properties 4 conclusion in this investigation the magnetic

1197,coastal beaches are the most important part of the marine environment and are highly influenced by the interactions taking place between groundwater and surface water of any form generally the purity index of the groundwater is based on the concentration of total dissolved solids tds in it analytical solutions are the best tools for groundwater flow and transport modeling however contaminant transport along the sloping coastal beaches with complex boundaries cannot be addressed with available analytical solutions in the present study new analytical models are developed for groundwater flow and contaminant transport for sloping coastal beaches with continuity and tidal boundary conditions to assess the performance of the new analytical solution and to validate the range of aquifer parameters numerical simulation is performed using du fort frankel dff scheme numerical experimentation is carried out using the tchebycheff and l2 norms it is observed that the new analytical solution for the contaminant transport gives acceptable results over the wide range of the aquifer parameters to show the effectiveness of the developed models two case studies from indian coastal aquifers namely kalpakkam tamil nadu and bhavnagar gujarat are considered the profiles of the contaminant concentration are obtained to study the tds behavior along these complex coastal beaches in the spatiotemporal directions the results are compared with numerical model results and found to be satisfactory the combined effect of the initial rainfall and rainfall decay constants showed a significant impact on the concentration of tds tds concentrations are observed to be varying highly with the variation in the tidal constituents and bed slope keywords analytical solution dff scheme exponential rainfall infiltration mixed semidiurnal tide tds unconfined sloping aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater and seawater interaction can result in saltwater intrusion coastal restructuring marine contamination and water clogging due to the chemical waste discharged from agriculture and industries to nearby coastal aquifers the quality of groundwater is deteriorating over the past few decades the quality of groundwater is determined using the eight factors namely total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total suspended solids tss ph salinity chloride and turbidity focusing on the factor tds it is shown that if its level crosses 1000 ppm in groundwater then it is highly contaminated and unsafe for drinking purpose consumption of water with high tds values for a long duration leads to the deposition of chemicals and toxins in the living being which may turn to severe medical conditions such as liver and kidney damage and cancer hence the assessments of tds contamination due to saltwater intrusion in the nearby coastal areas are very important many analytical solutions have been obtained to investigate the tide induced periodic groundwater flow in various coastal aquifers jacob 1950 jeng et al 2002 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2002 sun 1997 van der kamp 1972 the contamination in coastal waters occurred due to tds stormwater combined sewer overflows cso municipal industrial discharges and atmospheric deposition ippen 1966 and fischer et al 1979 discussed the contaminant transport as well as other environmental problems encountered in the estuarine waters along most of the coastal beaches the contaminants are released directly to the adjoining surface water bodies such as a river estuary or sea the groundwater containing contaminants penetrates the ground and underlying aquifer system of the coastal area the coastal ecosystem is more prone to the major concentration of pollutants in the groundwater environment and a large quantity of submarine groundwater discharge sgwd many studies showed that the major component of the total outflow or inflow in the coastal environment is groundwater seepage flow churchill 1971 moore 1999 1996 reilly and goodman 1985 the marine environment along the coastal side became endangered with the tds and pollutant migration through groundwater caused by various human activities and hazardous industrial wastes various studies shed light on such coastal water areas which included the guam fringing reef flat marsh 1977 great south bay new york capone and bautista 1985 and mid atlantic coastal waters gallagher et al 1996 richter and kreitler 1986 provided the discussion of ions chemistry for various hydrogeological environments the impact on the nutrient level can be seen in these areas via groundwater seepage flow similarly johannes 1980 sewell 1982 simmons 1990 and simmons jr et al 1992 described the pollution of coastal beaches due to other pollutants hence a proper study of the path and concentration of contaminants along coastal areas is very important the significance includes good management of water resources to protect the pollution which depends on contaminated groundwater supply successful soil and groundwater remediation pollution source release control and pursuing potentially responsible polluters sarath prasanth et al 2012 studied the quality of groundwater by focusing on the tds and cations along the coastal area of alappuzha district kerala india the study of tide induced contaminant transport along the coastal side is complicated due to saltwater intrusion tidal oscillations beach slopes etc geng et al 2020 2017 hsieh et al 2015 nielsen 1990 zhang et al 2001 this study focused on understanding the transport of tds concentrations in coastal aquifers subject to tidal fluctuations the parameters on groundwater flow affect the tds pollutants migrating with groundwater hence tidal oscillations highly influence tds transport yim and mohsen 1992 observed that the contaminant concentration gets diluted along coastal boundaries due to tidal fluctuation li et al 2003 showed that chemical flux arose in the ocean over a small period due to tidal fluctuation mao et al 2006 considered a low relief estuary along a mildly sloping coastal beach to address the saltwater intrusion sgd using the seawat model robinson and gallagher 1999 showed that the contaminant discharge rate gets lessened with the reduction in chemical transfer rate due to tides at the sloping coastal boundaries karmegam et al 2010 studied all the factors affecting the quality of groundwater in kalpakkam aquifer india as a field study kuan et al 2012 conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the influence of tidal oscillations on the behavior of the saltwater wedge in the tamilnadu district of india the concentrations of ec tds and cl are observed to be high along the coastal side from tiruchendur to koodankulam the experiment and field study was carried out in the regions along the coasts of tamilnadu to study the tds and other cations transport chandrasekar et al 2014 evans and wilson 2016 discussed the plume formation along a one dimensional sloping coastal beach similarly singh et al 2017 observed that 72 of the collected samples have brackish water indicating the high amounts of tds and cations of different minerals you et al 2018 studied the effect of various tides on contaminant transport samantara et al 2017 carried out experimentation in kalpakkam tamilnadu india to study contamination of the heavy metal the chemistry of major ions etc he et al 2017 derived a one dimensional analytical solution for the groundwater flow model and a numerical solution for the contaminant transport model along a tidally influenced aquifer chen et al 2019 carried out the numerical simulations for the discussion of the recovering head and tds along the low permeable two dimensional coastal side geng et al 2020 discussed the evaporation and rainfall influence on the salinity along tide induced coastal beaches mehdizadeh et al 2020 investigated the effect of artificial recharge of freshwater through the dam on saltwater intrusion shaikh and eldho 2021 studied the groundwater flow properties along various complex sloping aquifers in presence of tidal waves carrión mero et al 2021 developed the flow and transport numerical model to study the hydraulic heads and tds transport dodangeh et al 2022 studied the contaminant source characteristics along with aquifer characterization which included hydraulic conductivity along coastal aquifers mustafa et al 2022 obtained the three dimensional analytical solutions of contaminant transport for groundwater flow in the three dimensions their study showed that the groundwater flow velocities have a high impact on the spreading of contaminants xie et al 2022 obtained the analytical solution for the leachate head along the landfill liner the detailed literature review showed that there are no analytical modeling studies available for analysis of contaminant transport problems for aquifers with bed slope rainfall infiltration and tide induced groundwater variations in the present study a new analytical solution for one dimensional contaminant transport is derived for the tide induced groundwater flow along sloping coastal beaches in the presence of exponential rainfall infiltration the one dimensional hydrodynamic model is developed using a non linear boussinesq equation for the finite sloping unconfined aquifer system in the presence of tidal oscillations and exponential recharge further the nonlinear governing equation of the flow model is linearized and solved using various transforms to obtain the closed form of the analytical solution further the contaminant transport problem is solved analytically to obtain the concentration of tds along the sloping beaches the groundwater velocity is obtained from the results of water table height from the hydrodynamic equation and these velocity values are used in the contaminant transport model both analytical and numerical solutions are verified using tchebycheff and l2 norms and found to be compatible with each other further the effects of hydrological and tidal parameters on the movement of the tds are illustrated using case studies with graphical interpretations the present study focused on the tds concentration in the homogeneous isotropic one dimensional aquifer system it can be extended further for the study of contaminant concentration in the heterogeneous anisotropic and two dimensional sloping aquifer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 problem description and mathematical formulation the physical problem of the interaction between groundwater tidal water and contaminant transport is presented using a diagrammatic representation as shown in fig 1 tidal waves are on the left side of the coastal aquifer the upward sloping aquifer is considered with the bed slope β to the aquifer system during rainfall the concentration of the tds is generally low however after infiltrating into the soil and thereafter into the groundwater it starts increasing hence while considering tds in groundwater it is necessary to include rainfall infiltration the initial exponential rainfall infiltration n 0 over the unconfined coastal aquifer is adopted along the coastal area in the present study as shown in fig 1 in the present study for model development the following assumptions are used 1 the groundwater flow is in the upward sloping aquifer 2 the exponential rainfall infiltration is considered 3 extended dupuit forchheimer df assumption asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 shaikh et al 2018 is used to develop the model 4 it is assumed that the water table height above the impermeable base and average head over the mean depth of saturation are nearly equal the spatial and temporal variables are given as x and t respectively the groundwater table fluctuations are measured above the impermeable slope as well as above the horizontal base and are denoted as h x t and h x t respectively as observed in fig 1 tds input is released at the boundary x l of the finite aquifer of length l the mean water table height at any time t is supposed to be h 0 the basis of formulating a model is based on the methodology of chapman 1980 the groundwater flow model is developed using a non linear boussinesq equation the flow rates per unit width of the aquifer along the inland side can be obtained using extended df assumptions and the vertical heights connections as 1 q x kh x h x tan β cos 2 β using the principle of mass balance and continuity equation for the vertical slice in the model domain chapman 1980 the resulting equation for the flow with the source and sink term is given as 2 q x x s y h t n where h h x tan β where n n 0 exp rt denotes the exponential rainfall infiltration with initial rainfall n 0 and the rainfall decay constant r ramana et al 1995 based on the above assumptions the groundwater flow equations can be obtained in a one dimensional aquifer for a given upward bed slope as childs 1971 3 k cos 2 β x h h x tan β h x n 0 exp rt s y h t the bed slope is assumed to be β for the unconfined aquifer with the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield s y for a nonreactive contaminant such as tds the transport equation for one dimensional flow can be written as 4 x d x c x u c x c t where c denotes tds concentration with the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which is denoted as d x and is defined as d x α l u where α l is termed as longitudinal dispersivity and u is the groundwater flow velocity there are few empirical relations to obtain the value of hydraulic dispersitivity along different aquifers ansarifar et al 2023 if the porosity of an unconfined aquifer is denoted as n the groundwater velocity can be written as 5 u kh h x tan β cos 2 β 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the boundary and initial conditions for both groundwater flow and contaminant transport problems are given as 6 h 0 t h 0 a cos ω t 7 h x l h x l 8 h x 0 h 0 9 c x 0 c 0 c x l c l at t 0 10 c t 0 0 2 3 linearization and analytical solution for groundwater flow in this study the non linear hydrodynamic governing equations are linearized using marino s technique for obtaining the analytical solution of groundwater flow equations marino 1973 this technique is dynamic in which the average saturated depth is obtained after many iterations using h avg h 0 h 2 to carry out the first iteration the initial saturated depth d of the aquifer is substituted in the place of water table height h using h avg h 0 d 2 the linearization process is used and the water table height h is substituted using the expression h h h 0 the final governing equation is given as 11

validation of two dimensional solutions with complex boundary conditions in the present study for assessing the one dimensional analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport models we solved the nonlinear governing equations using dff numerical scheme to assess the effects of linearization and to validate the analytical solution non linear parabolic eq 5 and 7 are solved numerically using dff numerical scheme du fort and frankel 1953 upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 the dff scheme is based on the forward finite difference method fdm and is an explicit scheme rewriting nonlinear eq 3 as 60 h t k 1 x h x h x tan β k 2 where k 1 s y k cos2 β k 2 n 0 exp rt k cos2 β it is a non dissipative explicit scheme and is unconditionally stable o x 2 o t 2 o t x 2 is the truncation error the forward and central difference formulas are used to discretize the equations at the intermediate time level and hence it is called a three time level scheme 2 5 1 discretization of the hydrodynamic governing equation the governing eq 60 can be rewritten as 61 h t k 1 h x 2 tan β h x h 2 h x 2 k 2 in the dff scheme the central difference is used for first order derivative terms and the forward difference is used for second order derivatives accordingly the first order and second order derivatives are separated in eq 61 and it can be rewritten as 62 h t k 1 h x 2 h 2 h x 2 k 1 tan β h x k 2 two advective terms are involved in the discretization process due to slope hence eq 61 is discretized for p 2 as 63 h m p 1 h m p 1 2 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 h m p h m 1 p 2 h m p h m 1 p δx 2 k 1 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx k 2 the term h p m of central differences in eq 63 is replaced using the average of h p 1 m and h p 1 m as 64 h m p 1 h m p 1 2 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 h m p h m 1 p h m p 1 h m p 1 h m 1 p δx 2 k 1 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx k 2 the final discretized equation after rearranging and expressing h p 1 m in terms h p m and h p 1 m as 65 h 1 2 δt k 1 h m p δx 2 k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx h m p h m 1 p h m p 1 h m 1 p δx 2 h m p 1 2 δt k 2 the forward difference scheme is applied on eq 61 for obtaining h m p 1 at p 1 and simplifying it results in 66 h 1 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx h m p h m 1 p 2 h m p h m 1 p δx 2 h m p δt k 2 substituting p 1 in eq 66 we get 67 h 1 δt k 1 h m 1 1 h m 1 1 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 1 h m 1 1 2 δx h m 1 h m 1 1 2 h m 1 h m 1 1 δx 2 h m 1 δt the above procedure is used to obtain the numerical solution for groundwater table height h at any time step p and grid point m 2 5 2 discretization of boundary and initial conditions the boundary and initial conditions 6 and 8 are discretized using the grid point m and time steps p by using the dff scheme as follows 68 h 0 p h 0 a cos ωt 69 h m 0 h 0 the continuity condition is discretized as given in eq 69 70 h m 1 p m 1 l h m 2 p m 2 l 2 5 3 discretization of the contaminant transport equation using the discretization procedure for the groundwater flow model as discussed earlier the groundwater flow velocity is obtained rewriting eq 5 using grid point m and time step p we get 71 u m p k h m p cos 2 β n h m 1 p h m p δx tan β the governing eq 4 can be rewritten as 72 c t d x x c x u c x in a similar way as described earlier for p 2 in the hydrodynamic model the discretization is carried out for the contaminant transport model only one advective term is involved in the discretization process the final discretized equation after rearranging and expressing h p 1 m in terms h p m and h p 1 m as 73 c m p 1 1 2 δt d x c m p δx 2 d x c m 1 p c m p 1 c m 1 p δx 2 u c m 1 p c m 1 p 2 δx c m p 1 2 δt at p 1 the forward difference scheme is used for obtaining c m p 1 which results in 74 c m p 1 1 δt d x c m 1 p 2 c m p c m 1 p δx 2 u c m 1 p c m 1 p 2 δx c m p δt substituting p 1 in eq 74 we get 75 c m 2 1 δt d x c m 1 1 2 c m 1 c m 1 1 δx 2 u c m 1 1 c m 1 1 2 δx c m 1 δt the above procedure is used to obtain the numerical solution for the contaminant transport at a given time step p and grid point m 2 5 4 discretization of boundary and initial conditions for the non reactive contaminant transport problem the boundary and initial conditions 9 and 10 are discretized for the grid point m and time steps p by using the dff scheme as 76 c m 0 p c 0 77 c m l p c l 78 c m 0 p 0 2 6 convergence of the dff scheme the convergence of the dff scheme is briefly discussed in shaikh et al 2018 the scheme is unconditionally stable and it is conditionally consistent δx and δt are the step sizes along spatial and temporal directions to be consistent the term δt δx in the truncation error o x 2 o t 2 o t x 2 should tend to zero with the refinement of step sizes hence to obtain a consistent solution we need to choose the step sizes in such a way that the condition t x 2 will be satisfied this is further simplified as δt δx x 0 as x t 0 hence in this study we have chosen the step sizes as t 0 002 x 0 2 and hence we obtained a consistent solution for the given nonlinear equation of groundwater flow similarly for the contaminant transport model we have used the step sizes as t 0 001 x 0 1 to get a consistent solution if the condition is not satisfied then it may give an inconsistent solution the numerical solution tends to approach convergence if it is consistent and stable hence by choosing appropriate step sizes one can achieve convergence for a numerical solution though it is an explicit scheme 3 discussion of l2 and tchebycheff norms for comparison of solutions the numerical experimentation is carried out to check the wide range of aquifer parameters over which the analytical solution remains valid for this purpose the two norms namely l2 and tchebycheff are calculated to measure the error between the analytical and numerical solutions shaikh et al 2018 the maximum difference between the solutions is obtained using the tchebycheff norm and the average distance between the solutions is calculated with the l2 norm the formulas for calculating the norms are stated here for the groundwater flow and contaminant transport models tchebycheff

solutions for the concentration of tds are demoted as c ana and c num respectively as shown in eq 80 and 82 the definite integrals involved in both the norms can be solved using the trapezoidal or simpson s methods 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the analytical solution of groundwater flow model jacob 1950 can be obtained from the groundwater flow model of the present study in the absence of rainfall infiltration n 0 0 m day and the bed slope β 0o and by writing transmissivity as t k x d and using h avg d the modified form of the governing equation from eq 3 is obtained and rewritten as follows 83 t 2 h x 2 s y h t eq 83 signifies the model equation from the investigation of jacob 1950 boundary conditions from jacob 1950 were used by considering that the tidal effect on groundwater flow vanishes far inland in the aquifer system mancuso et al 2016 hence the solution for the semi infinite aquifer system was obtained as follows 84 h x t h 0 a exp x ω s y 2 t cos ωt c ω s y 2 t 0 x l similarly the solution is obtained from eq 45 in the absence of bed slope and rainfall infiltration and is found to be similar to eq 84 hence the earlier studies can be treated as specific cases of the present one 4 2 case study 1 in this study the main focus is on the non reactive transport of contaminants such as tds with complex boundary and initial conditions the analytical solutions are derived for groundwater flow and contaminant transport problems the aquifer under consideration is an unconfined one and hence the tidal waves are damped on the water table height nearly up to 20 to 30 m or maximum it can last up to 60 m mancuso et al 2016 according to central ground water board the tds concentration is highest along the tamilnadu coastal side cgwb 2014 the case study of the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india kaviyarasan et al 2013 is used for obtaining the results from the present derived analytical solution the study area as per kaviyarasan et al 2013 is situated nearly 75 km south of chennai city india it has three water bodies around namely the bay of bengal buckingham canal and edaiyur backwaters the unconfined aquifer of length x 30 m is considered in this case study and the time domain is adopted as t 10 days the average saturated thickness of the aquifer is considered to be 3 m and is denoted as d the other hydrological parameters are adopted from the case study in which the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is k 43 2 m day specific yield s y 0 34 and effective porosity n 0 3 the coastal aquifer under consideration is an alluvial sandy and its hydraulic dispersivity is taken as α l 6 m the tidal data along the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india is taken from the indian tide forecast for the chennai region the mixed semidiurnal pattern is observed along the coast of the kalpakkam aquifer in the present study we have considered the semidiurnal crest value a 0 37 m it is observed from the forecast data that the tidal speed is denoted and given as ω 12 5664 day 1 for the tidal period of 12 h the phase shift for the tide under consideration is c 0 as depicted in fig 1 the overall rainfall in the present study is an exponential one it is evident from the case study data of kaviyarasan et al 2013 that the initial rainfall infiltration value n 0 varies from 0 024 m day to 0 096 m day the time varying rainfall infiltration is considered with the rainfall decay constant r and it can vary from 0 2 to 0 8 day 1 the beach slope along this site is found to be β 5o to 10o the highest concentration of tds along the kalpakkam aquifer is 1643 ppm cgwb 2014 hence in this study the maximum concentration of tds released is assumed to be 1643 ppm at x l the concentration at the other end proximity surface area x 0 m is 1000 ppm 4 3 comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions in the present study closed form of analytical and numerical solutions are compared using l2 and tchebycheff norms in this regard the bed slope β 5o initial rainfall n 0 0 024 m day and rainfall decay constant r 0 57 day 1 are considered the difference and average distance between the analytical and numerical solutions for the hydrodynamic and numerical models are calculated using the above mentioned l2 and tchebycheff norms the results from analytical and numerical models are compared and given in table 1 the integral contained in eq 88 and 89 is calculated using the trapezoidal method it is observed from table 1 that the maximum difference and the average distance are observed to be highest for the downward sloping aquifer in both the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport models at t 8 days the lowest difference is observed in the upward sloping aquifer at t 2 days as we shift from the upward sloping aquifer to a downward one the difference increases all over days for both models it can be observed from table 1 that the two solutions show close agreement as the tchebycheff and l2 norms are within the range it can be noticed that the bed slope exponential rainfall infiltration aquifer and tidal parameters showed a significant impact on the performance of the analytical solutions it is observed from the previous field studies of the tamilnadu coast cgwb 2014 that the results of the present study are within the range the accuracy of the analytical model is verified as shown in fig 2 it represents the comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions of tds concentrations with time at x 15 m it is observed from fig 2 that both the solutions show closely match with each other 4 4 spatial and temporal distribution of tds the tds concentration profile is depicted in figs 3 and 4 at the bed slopes β 0o 5o and 10o for given α l 6 m and n 0 0 024 m day for the mixed semi diurnal tide at its crest with respect to spatial and temporal distributions respectively the sinusoidal pattern in the concentration profile of tds can be observed in fig 3 as it moves toward the coastal beach proximity surface the concentrations show the increase or decrease with the increase in the bed slope as the contaminant moves toward the coastal beach the contaminant concentration is plotted against time t 0 to 10 days in fig 4 a it is observed that the concentration is at the zero value for t 0 day and it increases over time for varying bed slopes the concentrations of tds are more in a moderate sloping aquifer as shown in fig 4 b the concentration is observed to be very less in the higher sloping aquifer at x 15 m it is observed that the contaminant concentration decreases near the proximal surface as observed in fig 3 the variations in the concentrations of the tds are observed due to the groundwater velocity tidal amplitude and exponential rainfall infiltration the concentration profiles of the contaminant after t 1 day can be discussed using fig 4 b the effect of exponential rainfall infiltration is discussed in the present study by using initial rainfall n 0 and rainfall decay constant r the graph is plotted against the temporal variable as the exponential rainfall varies with time tds concentration profiles at t 0 day is zero as observed in fig 5 a and 6 a for the varying parameters of the rainfall infiltration the decrease in the concentrations of tds can be observed with the increase in the initial rainfall as shown in fig 5 b at x 15 m for a given moderate sloping aquifer at the start of the contaminant release period variations are observed due to an increase in the initial rainfall the concentrations of tds are observed to attain the fixed value after a few days of the contaminant release irrespective of the increase in the initial rainfall the changes in the exponential rainfall take place with the variations in the rainfall decay constant r the effect of rainfall decay constant on the concentration of tds is shown in fig 6 b for given constant initial rainfall the contaminant shows a decrease in concentrations as the rainfall decay constant increases this shows that the concentration of tds is heavily dependent on the parameters involved in the exponential rainfall infiltration the change in the concentration of tds with the variation in the hydraulic dispersivity is observed in fig 7 the increase in the hydraulic dispersivity increases the contaminant concentration as observed in fig 6 dispersion of contaminant increases with the increase in hydraulic dispersivity the length of the aquifer considered in this case study is 30 m and hence based on the study of ansarifar et al 2023 the range of hydraulic dispersivity is taken for discussing its effects on tds concentration 4 5 case study 2 the coastal aquifer of the bhavnagar district gujarat in india is considered to discuss the contaminants such as the tds profile along the west coast of india the area is located on the west side of the gulf of khambhat and to the south east of saurashtra prajapati et al 2021 the aquifer of length x 40 m is considered the time period of t 10 days are considered for observing the contaminant concentration profiles the aquifer parameters are adopted from the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 and prajapati et al 2021 the parameter details are given as d 3 m k 20 m day s y 0 00016 and n 0 1 the hydraulic dispersivity is taken to be α l 6 m as the aquifer is basalt and alluvial sandy coast the mixed semidiurnal tides with the highest amplitudes are observed from the indian tide forecast for the gujarat region in the present case study the high tide with the crest is considered with tidal amplitude a 9 43 m phase shift c 7 and tidal speed ω 12 5664 day 1 the initial rainfall n 0 is taken within the range of 0 024 to 0 072 m day and the rainfall decay constant r is considered in the range of 0 2 to 0 8 day 1 the upward sloping aquifer is considered in the present study the upward slope to the beach is assumed to vary as β 5o and 10o the initial concentration of tds at x l is taken as 6000 ppm the groundwater is observed to be contaminated with tds from the reports of the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 and prajapati et al 2021 hence the final concentration at the proximity of the beach at x 0 m is considered 2000 ppm the distributions of tds profiles along the bhavnagar coastal aquifer are discussed as shown in figs 8 to 11 it is observed from fig 7 that the concentration of tds is the maximum in the high sloping aquifers as compared to moderate and horizontal sloping aquifers in horizontal aquifer the concentrations of tds are observed in the range of 0 to 6000 ppm as shown in fig 8 the concentration profiles of tds are plotted against temporal variables as shown in figs 9 to 11 at x 15 m it is observed in fig 9 a and 9 b that at x 15 m the concentration of tds shows the lower values for all sloping and horizontal aquifers it is observed from fig 9 a that the concentration of tds is lowest in the horizontal aquifer the concentration of tds increases after t 0 day and then it shows a decrease for the period of t 10 days the concentration decreases and attains the constant value as observed in fig 9 a and 9 b the dominant factors for variations in the concentration of tds profile are amplitude of the tidal wave and exponential rainfall infiltration it is observed in fig 10 that the concentrations of tds decrease with the time period of t 10 days and attains the lowest value in a high rainfall period the concentration of the tds is the minimum and it is the highest in low rainfall time the changes in the rainfall are dependent on rainfall decay constant r as well for higher rainfall decay constant the concentration of tds is observed to be more the exponential decrease of concentration of the tds profile is observed after t 1 days for all the rainfall decay constants considered in this study as shown in fig 11 it is observed from figs 9 to 11 that the concentration of tds is zero at t 0 day the effect of change in hydraulic dispersivity on the tds concentration is observed in fig 12 the variations in the hydraulic dispersivity highly influence the dispersion of the tds lesser the longitudinal dispersivity the less tds concentration is observed as shown in fig 12 the concentration of tds shows a large variation in bhavnagar coastal aquifer and it shows similarities with the field study from the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 it can be concluded from both case studies that as the initial rainfall increases it dispersed the contaminant spread along the inland side it results in the dilution of the concentration of contaminants however the rainfall decay decreases the total amount of rainfall and it leads to the lesser dispersion of the contaminants though the rainfall decay values are increased it doesn t contribute to the spread of contaminants the dispersion of contaminants at higher bed slopes is less than the steep sloped coastal beaches the dispersion for higher dispersivity is more as discussed earlier it is observed from the graphical presentation that the concentrations of tds are observed to be higher or lower depending on the initial release of the contaminant source along the spatial direction the dispersion of the contaminant is more in the upward sloping aquifer as it offers a high hydraulic gradient to groundwater flow the highest water table fluctuation leads to the maximum dispersion of contaminants the concentration of tds is more for the variations in the initial rainfall values as compared to changes in rainfall decay constants both of these factors have strong dominance on the tds movement in combination similarly the effect of bed slope can be observed to a great extent from all the graphs it is observed that tidal speed exponential rainfall infiltration longitudinal dispersivity and bed slope constituents to the maximum variations in the tds concentrations 5 conclusions in the present study the non reactive contaminant transport along the sloping coastal aquifer near the tidally influenced coastal beaches is considered the one dimensional hydrodynamic model with the non linear boussinesq equations represented the groundwater flow along with the head continuity condition which is further linearized to obtain the approximate analytical solution the expression for groundwater velocity is obtained using the approximate analytical solution the contaminant transport problem is solved with the obtained values of groundwater velocity to study the variation of concentration of tds to check the efficiency of the linearization method the numerical simulation using the dff scheme is carried out it is found that both solutions show close resemblance with each other with the help of tchebycheff and l2 norms the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india and the bhavnagar aquifer gujarat india are considered as case studies and the solutions for contaminants along spatial and temporal variations for various bed slopes are studied the effects of hydrological geological and tidal parameters are obtained and it is found that all these have a significant impact on the concentration values it is observed that variations in the concentration of the tds are distinguished in the kalpakkam and the bhavnagar aquifers the head boundary condition plays a significant role in the variation of concentration of tds along with the bed slope to the aquifer the variation in the concentration is observed with the changes in the hydrological parameters in addition to this it is concluded that the increase or decrease in the rainfall decay constant and the effect of initial rainfall show a huge impact on the concentration of tds the developed study will be useful to hydrologists and scientists for practical application with continuity head and tidal boundary conditions along sloping coastal aquifer problems credit authorship contribution statement bushra y shaikh conceptualization formal analysis investigation data

1197,coastal beaches are the most important part of the marine environment and are highly influenced by the interactions taking place between groundwater and surface water of any form generally the purity index of the groundwater is based on the concentration of total dissolved solids tds in it analytical solutions are the best tools for groundwater flow and transport modeling however contaminant transport along the sloping coastal beaches with complex boundaries cannot be addressed with available analytical solutions in the present study new analytical models are developed for groundwater flow and contaminant transport for sloping coastal beaches with continuity and tidal boundary conditions to assess the performance of the new analytical solution and to validate the range of aquifer parameters numerical simulation is performed using du fort frankel dff scheme numerical experimentation is carried out using the tchebycheff and l2 norms it is observed that the new analytical solution for the contaminant transport gives acceptable results over the wide range of the aquifer parameters to show the effectiveness of the developed models two case studies from indian coastal aquifers namely kalpakkam tamil nadu and bhavnagar gujarat are considered the profiles of the contaminant concentration are obtained to study the tds behavior along these complex coastal beaches in the spatiotemporal directions the results are compared with numerical model results and found to be satisfactory the combined effect of the initial rainfall and rainfall decay constants showed a significant impact on the concentration of tds tds concentrations are observed to be varying highly with the variation in the tidal constituents and bed slope keywords analytical solution dff scheme exponential rainfall infiltration mixed semidiurnal tide tds unconfined sloping aquifer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater and seawater interaction can result in saltwater intrusion coastal restructuring marine contamination and water clogging due to the chemical waste discharged from agriculture and industries to nearby coastal aquifers the quality of groundwater is deteriorating over the past few decades the quality of groundwater is determined using the eight factors namely total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total suspended solids tss ph salinity chloride and turbidity focusing on the factor tds it is shown that if its level crosses 1000 ppm in groundwater then it is highly contaminated and unsafe for drinking purpose consumption of water with high tds values for a long duration leads to the deposition of chemicals and toxins in the living being which may turn to severe medical conditions such as liver and kidney damage and cancer hence the assessments of tds contamination due to saltwater intrusion in the nearby coastal areas are very important many analytical solutions have been obtained to investigate the tide induced periodic groundwater flow in various coastal aquifers jacob 1950 jeng et al 2002 jiao and tang 1999 li and jiao 2002 sun 1997 van der kamp 1972 the contamination in coastal waters occurred due to tds stormwater combined sewer overflows cso municipal industrial discharges and atmospheric deposition ippen 1966 and fischer et al 1979 discussed the contaminant transport as well as other environmental problems encountered in the estuarine waters along most of the coastal beaches the contaminants are released directly to the adjoining surface water bodies such as a river estuary or sea the groundwater containing contaminants penetrates the ground and underlying aquifer system of the coastal area the coastal ecosystem is more prone to the major concentration of pollutants in the groundwater environment and a large quantity of submarine groundwater discharge sgwd many studies showed that the major component of the total outflow or inflow in the coastal environment is groundwater seepage flow churchill 1971 moore 1999 1996 reilly and goodman 1985 the marine environment along the coastal side became endangered with the tds and pollutant migration through groundwater caused by various human activities and hazardous industrial wastes various studies shed light on such coastal water areas which included the guam fringing reef flat marsh 1977 great south bay new york capone and bautista 1985 and mid atlantic coastal waters gallagher et al 1996 richter and kreitler 1986 provided the discussion of ions chemistry for various hydrogeological environments the impact on the nutrient level can be seen in these areas via groundwater seepage flow similarly johannes 1980 sewell 1982 simmons 1990 and simmons jr et al 1992 described the pollution of coastal beaches due to other pollutants hence a proper study of the path and concentration of contaminants along coastal areas is very important the significance includes good management of water resources to protect the pollution which depends on contaminated groundwater supply successful soil and groundwater remediation pollution source release control and pursuing potentially responsible polluters sarath prasanth et al 2012 studied the quality of groundwater by focusing on the tds and cations along the coastal area of alappuzha district kerala india the study of tide induced contaminant transport along the coastal side is complicated due to saltwater intrusion tidal oscillations beach slopes etc geng et al 2020 2017 hsieh et al 2015 nielsen 1990 zhang et al 2001 this study focused on understanding the transport of tds concentrations in coastal aquifers subject to tidal fluctuations the parameters on groundwater flow affect the tds pollutants migrating with groundwater hence tidal oscillations highly influence tds transport yim and mohsen 1992 observed that the contaminant concentration gets diluted along coastal boundaries due to tidal fluctuation li et al 2003 showed that chemical flux arose in the ocean over a small period due to tidal fluctuation mao et al 2006 considered a low relief estuary along a mildly sloping coastal beach to address the saltwater intrusion sgd using the seawat model robinson and gallagher 1999 showed that the contaminant discharge rate gets lessened with the reduction in chemical transfer rate due to tides at the sloping coastal boundaries karmegam et al 2010 studied all the factors affecting the quality of groundwater in kalpakkam aquifer india as a field study kuan et al 2012 conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to investigate the influence of tidal oscillations on the behavior of the saltwater wedge in the tamilnadu district of india the concentrations of ec tds and cl are observed to be high along the coastal side from tiruchendur to koodankulam the experiment and field study was carried out in the regions along the coasts of tamilnadu to study the tds and other cations transport chandrasekar et al 2014 evans and wilson 2016 discussed the plume formation along a one dimensional sloping coastal beach similarly singh et al 2017 observed that 72 of the collected samples have brackish water indicating the high amounts of tds and cations of different minerals you et al 2018 studied the effect of various tides on contaminant transport samantara et al 2017 carried out experimentation in kalpakkam tamilnadu india to study contamination of the heavy metal the chemistry of major ions etc he et al 2017 derived a one dimensional analytical solution for the groundwater flow model and a numerical solution for the contaminant transport model along a tidally influenced aquifer chen et al 2019 carried out the numerical simulations for the discussion of the recovering head and tds along the low permeable two dimensional coastal side geng et al 2020 discussed the evaporation and rainfall influence on the salinity along tide induced coastal beaches mehdizadeh et al 2020 investigated the effect of artificial recharge of freshwater through the dam on saltwater intrusion shaikh and eldho 2021 studied the groundwater flow properties along various complex sloping aquifers in presence of tidal waves carrión mero et al 2021 developed the flow and transport numerical model to study the hydraulic heads and tds transport dodangeh et al 2022 studied the contaminant source characteristics along with aquifer characterization which included hydraulic conductivity along coastal aquifers mustafa et al 2022 obtained the three dimensional analytical solutions of contaminant transport for groundwater flow in the three dimensions their study showed that the groundwater flow velocities have a high impact on the spreading of contaminants xie et al 2022 obtained the analytical solution for the leachate head along the landfill liner the detailed literature review showed that there are no analytical modeling studies available for analysis of contaminant transport problems for aquifers with bed slope rainfall infiltration and tide induced groundwater variations in the present study a new analytical solution for one dimensional contaminant transport is derived for the tide induced groundwater flow along sloping coastal beaches in the presence of exponential rainfall infiltration the one dimensional hydrodynamic model is developed using a non linear boussinesq equation for the finite sloping unconfined aquifer system in the presence of tidal oscillations and exponential recharge further the nonlinear governing equation of the flow model is linearized and solved using various transforms to obtain the closed form of the analytical solution further the contaminant transport problem is solved analytically to obtain the concentration of tds along the sloping beaches the groundwater velocity is obtained from the results of water table height from the hydrodynamic equation and these velocity values are used in the contaminant transport model both analytical and numerical solutions are verified using tchebycheff and l2 norms and found to be compatible with each other further the effects of hydrological and tidal parameters on the movement of the tds are illustrated using case studies with graphical interpretations the present study focused on the tds concentration in the homogeneous isotropic one dimensional aquifer system it can be extended further for the study of contaminant concentration in the heterogeneous anisotropic and two dimensional sloping aquifer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 problem description and mathematical formulation the physical problem of the interaction between groundwater tidal water and contaminant transport is presented using a diagrammatic representation as shown in fig 1 tidal waves are on the left side of the coastal aquifer the upward sloping aquifer is considered with the bed slope β to the aquifer system during rainfall the concentration of the tds is generally low however after infiltrating into the soil and thereafter into the groundwater it starts increasing hence while considering tds in groundwater it is necessary to include rainfall infiltration the initial exponential rainfall infiltration n 0 over the unconfined coastal aquifer is adopted along the coastal area in the present study as shown in fig 1 in the present study for model development the following assumptions are used 1 the groundwater flow is in the upward sloping aquifer 2 the exponential rainfall infiltration is considered 3 extended dupuit forchheimer df assumption asadi aghbolaghi et al 2012 shaikh et al 2018 is used to develop the model 4 it is assumed that the water table height above the impermeable base and average head over the mean depth of saturation are nearly equal the spatial and temporal variables are given as x and t respectively the groundwater table fluctuations are measured above the impermeable slope as well as above the horizontal base and are denoted as h x t and h x t respectively as observed in fig 1 tds input is released at the boundary x l of the finite aquifer of length l the mean water table height at any time t is supposed to be h 0 the basis of formulating a model is based on the methodology of chapman 1980 the groundwater flow model is developed using a non linear boussinesq equation the flow rates per unit width of the aquifer along the inland side can be obtained using extended df assumptions and the vertical heights connections as 1 q x kh x h x tan β cos 2 β using the principle of mass balance and continuity equation for the vertical slice in the model domain chapman 1980 the resulting equation for the flow with the source and sink term is given as 2 q x x s y h t

groundwater flow equations can be obtained in a one dimensional aquifer for a given upward bed slope as childs 1971 3 k cos 2 β x h h x tan β h x n 0 exp rt s y h t the bed slope is assumed to be β for the unconfined aquifer with the hydraulic conductivity k and the specific yield s y for a nonreactive contaminant such as tds the transport equation for one dimensional flow can be written as 4 x d x c x u c x c t where c denotes tds concentration with the longitudinal dispersion coefficient which is denoted as d x and is defined as d x α l u where α l is termed as longitudinal dispersivity and u is the groundwater flow velocity there are few empirical relations to obtain the value of hydraulic dispersitivity along different aquifers ansarifar et al 2023 if the porosity of an unconfined aquifer is denoted as n the groundwater velocity can be written as 5 u kh h x tan β cos 2 β 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the boundary and initial conditions for both groundwater flow and

this study the non linear hydrodynamic governing equations are linearized using marino s technique for obtaining the analytical solution of groundwater flow equations marino 1973 this technique is dynamic in which the average saturated depth is obtained after many iterations using h avg h 0 h 2 to carry out the first iteration the initial saturated depth d of the aquifer is substituted in the place of water table height h using h avg h 0 d 2 the linearization process is used and the water table height h is substituted using the expression h h h 0 the final governing equation is given as 11

validation of two dimensional solutions with complex boundary conditions in the present study for assessing the one dimensional analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport models we solved the nonlinear governing equations using dff numerical scheme to assess the effects of linearization and to validate the analytical solution non linear parabolic eq 5 and 7 are solved numerically using dff numerical scheme du fort and frankel 1953 upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 the dff scheme is based on the forward finite difference method fdm and is an explicit scheme rewriting nonlinear eq 3 as 60 h t k 1 x h x h x tan β k 2 where k 1 s y k cos2 β k 2 n 0 exp rt k cos2 β it is a non dissipative explicit scheme and is unconditionally stable o x 2 o t 2 o t x 2 is the truncation error the forward and central difference formulas are used to discretize the equations at the intermediate time level and hence it is called a three time level scheme 2 5 1 discretization of the hydrodynamic governing equation the governing eq 60 can be rewritten as 61 h t k 1 h x 2 tan β h x h 2 h x 2 k 2 in the dff scheme the central difference is used for first order derivative terms and the forward difference is used for second order derivatives accordingly the first order and second order derivatives are separated in eq 61 and it can be rewritten as 62 h t k 1 h x 2 h 2 h x 2 k 1 tan β h x k 2 two advective terms are involved in the discretization process due to slope hence eq 61 is discretized for p 2 as 63 h m p 1 h m p 1 2 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 h m p h m 1 p 2 h m p h m 1 p δx 2 k 1 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx k 2 the term h p m of central differences in eq 63 is replaced using the average of h p 1 m and h p 1 m as 64 h m p 1 h m p 1 2 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 h m p h m 1 p h m p 1 h m p 1 h m 1 p δx 2 k 1 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx k 2 the final discretized equation after rearranging and expressing h p 1 m in terms h p m and h p 1 m as 65 h 1 2 δt k 1 h m p δx 2 k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx h m p h m 1 p h m p 1 h m 1 p δx 2 h m p 1 2 δt k 2 the forward difference scheme is applied on eq 61 for obtaining h m p 1 at p 1 and simplifying it results in 66 h 1 δt k 1 h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 p h m 1 p 2 δx h m p h m 1 p 2 h m p h m 1 p δx 2 h m p δt k 2 substituting p 1 in eq 66 we get 67 h 1 δt k 1 h m 1 1 h m 1 1 2 δx 2 tan β h m 1 1 h m 1 1 2 δx h m 1 h m 1 1 2 h m 1 h m 1 1 δx 2 h m 1 δt the above procedure is used to obtain the numerical solution for groundwater table height h at any time step p and grid point m 2 5 2 discretization of boundary and initial conditions the boundary and initial conditions 6 and 8 are discretized using the grid point m and time steps p by using the dff scheme as follows 68 h 0 p h 0 a cos ωt 69 h m 0 h 0 the continuity condition is discretized as given in eq 69 70 h m 1 p m 1 l h m 2 p m 2 l 2 5 3 discretization of the contaminant transport equation using the discretization procedure for the groundwater flow model as discussed earlier the groundwater flow velocity is obtained rewriting eq 5 using grid point m and time step p we get 71 u m p k h m p cos 2 β n h m 1 p h m p δx tan β the governing eq 4 can be rewritten as 72 c t d x x c x u c x in a similar way as described earlier for p 2 in the hydrodynamic model the discretization is carried out for the contaminant transport model only one advective term is involved in the discretization process the final discretized equation after rearranging and expressing h p 1 m in terms h p m and h p 1 m as 73 c m p 1 1 2 δt d x c m p δx 2 d x c m 1 p c m p 1 c m 1 p δx 2 u c m 1 p c m 1 p 2 δx c m p 1 2 δt at p 1 the forward difference scheme is used for obtaining c m p 1 which results in 74 c m p 1 1 δt d x c m 1 p 2 c m p c m 1 p δx 2 u c m 1 p c m 1 p 2 δx c m p δt substituting p 1 in eq 74 we get 75 c m 2 1 δt d x c m 1 1 2 c m 1 c m 1 1 δx 2 u c m 1 1 c m 1 1 2 δx c m 1 δt the above procedure is used to obtain the numerical solution for the contaminant transport at a given time step p and grid point m 2 5 4 discretization of boundary and initial conditions for the non reactive contaminant transport problem the boundary and initial conditions 9 and 10 are discretized for the grid point m and time steps p by using the dff scheme as 76 c m 0 p c 0 77 c m l p c l 78 c m 0 p 0 2 6 convergence of the dff scheme the convergence of the dff scheme is briefly discussed in shaikh et al 2018 the scheme is unconditionally stable and it is conditionally consistent δx and δt are the step sizes along spatial and temporal directions to be consistent the term δt δx in the truncation error o x 2 o t 2 o t x 2 should tend to zero with the refinement of step sizes hence to obtain a consistent solution we need to choose the step sizes in such a way that the condition t x 2 will be satisfied this is further simplified as δt δx x 0 as x t 0 hence in this study we have chosen the step sizes as t 0 002 x 0 2 and hence we obtained a consistent solution for the given nonlinear equation of groundwater flow similarly for the contaminant transport model we have used the step sizes as t 0 001 x 0 1 to get a consistent solution if the condition is not satisfied then it may give an inconsistent solution the numerical solution tends to approach convergence if it is consistent and stable hence by choosing appropriate step sizes one can achieve convergence for a numerical solution though it is an explicit scheme 3 discussion of l2 and tchebycheff norms for comparison of solutions the numerical experimentation is carried out to check the wide range of aquifer parameters over which the analytical solution remains valid for this purpose the two norms namely l2 and tchebycheff are calculated to measure the error between the analytical and numerical solutions shaikh et al 2018 the maximum difference between the solutions is obtained using the tchebycheff norm and the average distance between the solutions is calculated with the l2 norm the formulas for calculating the norms are stated here for the groundwater flow and contaminant transport models tchebycheff norm 79 h num h ana max 0 x l h num h ana 80 c num c ana max 0 x l c num c ana l2 norm 81 1 l h num h ana 1 l x 0 x l h num x t h ana x t 2 dx 1 2 82 1 l c num c ana 1 l x 0 x l c num x t c ana x t 2 dx 1 2 the water table heights from the analytical and numerical solutions are denoted as h ana and h num respectively as shown in the eq 79 and 81 on a similar line the analytical and numerical solutions for the concentration of tds are demoted as c ana and c num respectively as shown in eq 80 and 82 the definite integrals involved in both the norms can be solved using the trapezoidal or simpson s methods 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the analytical solution of groundwater flow model jacob 1950 can be obtained from the groundwater flow model of the present study in the absence of rainfall infiltration n 0 0 m day and the bed slope β 0o and by writing transmissivity as t k x d and using h avg d the modified form of the governing equation from eq 3 is obtained and rewritten as follows 83 t 2 h x 2 s y h t eq 83 signifies the model equation from the investigation of jacob 1950 boundary conditions from jacob 1950 were used by considering that the tidal effect on groundwater flow vanishes far inland in the aquifer system mancuso et al 2016 hence the solution for the semi infinite aquifer system was obtained as follows 84 h x t h 0 a exp x ω s y 2 t cos ωt c ω s y 2 t 0 x l similarly the solution is obtained from eq 45 in the absence of bed slope and rainfall infiltration and is found to be similar to eq 84 hence the earlier studies can be treated as specific cases of the present one 4 2 case study 1 in this study the main focus is on the non reactive transport of contaminants such as tds with complex boundary and initial conditions the analytical solutions are derived for groundwater flow and contaminant transport problems the aquifer under consideration is an unconfined one and hence the tidal waves are damped on the water table height nearly up to 20 to 30 m or maximum it can last up to 60 m mancuso et al 2016 according to central ground water board the tds concentration is highest along the tamilnadu coastal side cgwb 2014 the case study of the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india kaviyarasan et al 2013 is used for obtaining the results from the present derived analytical solution the study area as per kaviyarasan et al 2013 is situated nearly 75 km south of chennai city india it has three water bodies around namely the bay of bengal buckingham canal and edaiyur backwaters the unconfined aquifer of length x 30 m is considered in this case study and the time domain is adopted as t 10 days the average saturated thickness of the aquifer is considered to be 3 m and is denoted as d the other hydrological parameters are adopted from the case study in which the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is k 43 2 m day specific yield s y 0 34 and effective porosity n 0 3 the coastal aquifer under consideration is an alluvial sandy and its hydraulic dispersivity is taken as α l 6 m the tidal data along the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india is taken from the indian tide forecast for the chennai region the mixed semidiurnal pattern is observed along the coast of the kalpakkam aquifer in the present study we have considered the semidiurnal crest value a 0 37 m it is observed from the forecast data that the tidal speed is denoted and given as ω 12 5664 day 1 for the tidal period of 12 h the phase shift for the tide under consideration is c 0 as depicted in fig 1 the overall rainfall in the present study is an exponential one it is evident from the case study data of kaviyarasan et al 2013 that the initial rainfall infiltration value n 0 varies from 0 024 m day to 0 096 m day the time varying rainfall infiltration is considered with the rainfall decay constant r and it can vary from 0 2 to 0 8 day 1 the beach slope along this site is found to be β 5o to 10o the highest concentration of tds along the kalpakkam aquifer is 1643 ppm cgwb 2014 hence in this study the maximum concentration of tds released is assumed to be 1643 ppm at x l the concentration at the other end proximity surface area x 0 m is 1000 ppm 4 3 comparison of the analytical and numerical solutions in the present study closed form of analytical and numerical solutions are compared using l2 and tchebycheff norms in this regard the bed slope β 5o initial rainfall n 0 0 024 m day and rainfall decay constant r 0 57 day 1 are considered the difference and average distance between the analytical and numerical solutions for the hydrodynamic and numerical models are calculated using the above mentioned l2 and tchebycheff norms the results from analytical and numerical models are compared and given in table 1 the integral contained in eq 88 and 89 is calculated using the trapezoidal method it is observed from table 1 that the maximum difference and the average distance are observed to be highest for the downward sloping aquifer in both the hydrodynamic and contaminant transport models at t 8 days the lowest difference is observed in the upward sloping aquifer at t 2 days as we shift from the upward sloping aquifer to a downward one the difference increases all over days for both models it can be observed from table 1 that the two solutions show close agreement as the tchebycheff and l2 norms are within the range it can be noticed that the bed slope exponential rainfall infiltration aquifer and tidal parameters showed a significant impact on the performance of the analytical solutions it is observed from the previous field studies of the tamilnadu coast cgwb 2014 that the results of the present study are within the range the accuracy of the analytical model is verified as shown in fig 2 it represents the comparison between the analytical and numerical solutions of tds concentrations with time at x 15 m it is observed from fig 2 that both the solutions show closely match with each other 4 4 spatial and temporal distribution of tds the tds concentration profile is depicted in figs 3 and 4 at the bed slopes β 0o 5o and 10o for given α l 6 m and n 0 0 024 m day for the mixed semi diurnal tide at its crest with respect to spatial and temporal distributions respectively the sinusoidal pattern in the concentration profile of tds can be observed in fig 3 as it moves toward the coastal beach proximity surface the concentrations show the increase or decrease with the increase in the bed slope as the contaminant moves toward the coastal beach the contaminant concentration is plotted against time t 0 to 10 days in fig 4 a it is observed that the concentration is at the zero value for t 0 day and it increases over time for varying bed slopes the concentrations of tds are more in a moderate sloping aquifer as shown in fig 4 b the concentration is observed to be very less in the higher sloping aquifer at x 15 m it is observed that the contaminant concentration decreases near the proximal surface as observed in fig 3 the variations in the concentrations of the tds are observed due to the groundwater velocity tidal amplitude and exponential rainfall infiltration the concentration profiles of the contaminant after t 1 day can be discussed using fig 4 b the effect of exponential rainfall infiltration is discussed in the present study by using initial rainfall n 0 and rainfall decay constant r the graph is plotted against the temporal variable as the exponential rainfall varies with time tds concentration profiles at t 0 day is zero as observed in fig 5 a and 6 a for the varying parameters of the rainfall infiltration the decrease in the concentrations of tds can be observed with the increase in the initial rainfall as shown in fig 5 b at x 15 m for a given moderate sloping aquifer at the start of the contaminant release period variations are observed due to an increase in the initial rainfall the concentrations of tds are observed to attain the fixed value after a few days of the contaminant release irrespective of the increase in the initial rainfall the changes in the exponential rainfall take place with the variations in the rainfall decay constant r the effect of rainfall decay constant on the concentration of tds is shown in fig 6 b for given constant initial rainfall the contaminant shows a decrease in concentrations as the rainfall decay constant increases this shows that the concentration of tds is heavily dependent on the parameters involved in the exponential rainfall infiltration the change in the concentration of tds with the variation in the hydraulic dispersivity is observed in fig 7 the increase in the hydraulic dispersivity increases the contaminant concentration as observed in fig 6 dispersion of contaminant increases with the increase in hydraulic dispersivity the length of the aquifer considered in this case study is 30 m and hence based on the study of ansarifar et al 2023 the range of hydraulic dispersivity is taken for discussing its effects on tds concentration 4 5 case study 2 the coastal aquifer of the bhavnagar district gujarat in india is considered to discuss the contaminants such as the tds profile along the west coast of india the area is located on the west side of the gulf of khambhat and to the south east of saurashtra prajapati et al 2021 the aquifer of length x 40 m is considered the time period of t 10 days are considered for observing the contaminant concentration profiles the aquifer parameters are adopted from the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 and prajapati et al 2021 the parameter details are given as d 3 m k 20 m day s y 0 00016 and n 0 1 the hydraulic dispersivity is taken to be α l 6 m as the aquifer is basalt and alluvial sandy coast the mixed semidiurnal tides with the highest amplitudes are observed from the indian tide forecast for the gujarat region in the present case study the high tide with the crest is considered with tidal amplitude a 9 43 m phase shift c 7 and tidal speed ω 12 5664 day 1 the initial rainfall n 0 is taken within the range of 0 024 to 0 072 m day and the rainfall decay constant r is considered in the range of 0 2 to 0 8 day 1 the upward sloping aquifer is considered in the present study the upward slope to the beach is assumed to vary as β 5o and 10o the initial concentration of tds at x l is taken as 6000 ppm the groundwater is observed to be contaminated with tds from the reports of the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 and prajapati et al 2021 hence the final concentration at the proximity of the beach at x 0 m is considered 2000 ppm the distributions of tds profiles along the bhavnagar coastal aquifer are discussed as shown in figs 8 to 11 it is observed from fig 7 that the concentration of tds is the maximum in the high sloping aquifers as compared to moderate and horizontal sloping aquifers in horizontal aquifer the concentrations of tds are observed in the range of 0 to 6000 ppm as shown in fig 8 the concentration profiles of tds are plotted against temporal variables as shown in figs 9 to 11 at x 15 m it is observed in fig 9 a and 9 b that at x 15 m the concentration of tds shows the lower values for all sloping and horizontal aquifers it is observed from fig 9 a that the concentration of tds is lowest in the horizontal aquifer the concentration of tds increases after t 0 day and then it shows a decrease for the period of t 10 days the concentration decreases and attains the constant value as observed in fig 9 a and 9 b the dominant factors for variations in the concentration of tds profile are amplitude of the tidal wave and exponential rainfall infiltration it is observed in fig 10 that the concentrations of tds decrease with the time period of t 10 days and attains the lowest value in a high rainfall period the concentration of the tds is the minimum and it is the highest in low rainfall time the changes in the rainfall are dependent on rainfall decay constant r as well for higher rainfall decay constant the concentration of tds is observed to be more the exponential decrease of concentration of the tds profile is observed after t 1 days for all the rainfall decay constants considered in this study as shown in fig 11 it is observed from figs 9 to 11 that the concentration of tds is zero at t 0 day the effect of change in hydraulic dispersivity on the tds concentration is observed in fig 12 the variations in the hydraulic dispersivity highly influence the dispersion of the tds lesser the longitudinal dispersivity the less tds concentration is observed as shown in fig 12 the concentration of tds shows a large variation in bhavnagar coastal aquifer and it shows similarities with the field study from the ministry of jal shakti and d of w r 2022 it can be concluded from both case studies that as the initial rainfall increases it dispersed the contaminant spread along the inland side it results in the dilution of the concentration of contaminants however the rainfall decay decreases the total amount of rainfall and it leads to the lesser dispersion of the contaminants though the rainfall decay values are increased it doesn t contribute to the spread of contaminants the dispersion of contaminants at higher bed slopes is less than the steep sloped coastal beaches the dispersion for higher dispersivity is more as discussed earlier it is observed from the graphical presentation that the concentrations of tds are observed to be higher or lower depending on the initial release of the contaminant source along the spatial direction the dispersion of the contaminant is more in the upward sloping aquifer as it offers a high hydraulic gradient to groundwater flow the highest water table fluctuation leads to the maximum dispersion of contaminants the concentration of tds is more for the variations in the initial rainfall values as compared to changes in rainfall decay constants both of these factors have strong dominance on the tds movement in combination similarly the effect of bed slope can be observed to a great extent from all the graphs it is observed that tidal speed exponential rainfall infiltration longitudinal dispersivity and bed slope constituents to the maximum variations in the tds concentrations 5 conclusions in the present study the non reactive contaminant transport along the sloping coastal aquifer near the tidally influenced coastal beaches is considered the one dimensional hydrodynamic model with the non linear boussinesq equations represented the groundwater flow along with the head continuity condition which is further linearized to obtain the approximate analytical solution the expression for groundwater velocity is obtained using the approximate analytical solution the contaminant transport problem is solved with the obtained values of groundwater velocity to study the variation of concentration of tds to check the efficiency of the linearization method the numerical simulation using the dff scheme is carried out it is found that both solutions show close resemblance with each other with the help of tchebycheff and l2 norms the kalpakkam aquifer chennai india and the bhavnagar aquifer gujarat india are considered as case studies and the solutions for contaminants along spatial and temporal variations for various bed slopes are studied the effects of hydrological geological and tidal parameters are obtained and it is found that all these have a significant impact on the concentration values it is observed that variations in the concentration of the tds are distinguished in the kalpakkam and the bhavnagar aquifers the head boundary condition plays a significant role in the variation of concentration of tds along with the bed slope to the aquifer the variation in the concentration is observed with the changes in the hydrological parameters in addition to this it is concluded that the increase or decrease in the rainfall decay constant and the effect of initial rainfall show a huge impact on the concentration of tds the developed study will be useful to hydrologists and scientists for practical application with continuity head and tidal boundary conditions along sloping coastal aquifer problems credit authorship contribution statement bushra y shaikh conceptualization formal analysis investigation data

groundwater as in west bengal chattopadhyay et al 2020 roy et al 2014 mazumder and dasgupta 2011 on the other hand groundwater quality monitoring and assessment is a rigorous and time consuming task due to sluggish mobility of groundwater in subsurface aquifer nevertheless vulnerability zonation mapping due to geogenic aspects is a much essential as well as beneficial key to decision making

area i e murshidabad district is situated on the left bank of the ganga river again river ganges is majorly subdivided into two branches i e vagirathi in india and padma in bangladsh near to dhulian murshidabad therefore geographically murshidabad district lies in the major floodplains of the river ganges the total area cover is of the murshidabad district is 5324 km2 where 6 million people are affected by the severity of arsenic 3 3000 μg l according to indian census report 2011 halder 2019 another subject of concern about murshidabad districts geological constituents is the holocene and pleistocene aged dominating sediments those are mainly constitute with iron fe and manganese mn along with organic matter in aquifers of gray sand mishra et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is expected that arsenic may easily mobilize in the reducing environment with the association of both iron and manganese reza et al 2010 rowland et al 2005 however previous researchers chowdhury and paul 2019 dey 2016 halder 2019 rahman et al 2021 mahmudur rahman et al 2005 majumdar 2018 mandal et al 1996 samadder et al 2014 reported their research outcomes as quantification of groundwater as well as surface water arsenic level health survey outcomes and population risk in selected areas of murshidabad district after reviewing said research findings it was realized that there is still a lack of in depth study of the current scenario of arsenic vulnerability in murshidabad district nevertheless the local people of murshidabad district might be more exposed day after day by the elevated arsenic toxicity due to consumption of arsenic contaminated groundwater again the unavailability of methodological data statistically only a moderate application of groundwater vulnerability in murshidabad district can relate on the basis of climate conditions and drainage pattern therefore present study is much needed one to monitor the vulnerable zones of arsenic indigenousness the specific objectives of present study are i estimation of the idiosyncratically groundwater vulnerability by physiographic parameters assessed through alos palser dem stream and drainage density with multi collinearity assessment ii to evaluate the hydro geochemical causal factors leading to groundwater as vulnerability by physicochemical analysis and 3das lithological transport model validated with cgwb 2017 18 data iii prediction of groundwater vulnerability by both of the primary data machine learning model and subsequent spatiotemporal distribution to assess the arsenic and subsequent heavy metals i e fe mn se and cd load in groundwater in areas of murshidabad district gangetic plain the main novelty of the present study is to find out the arsenic vulnerability zone through the application of gis machine learning model such as support vector machine svm random forest rf and support vector regression svr moreover as sensitive zones will be predicted by the 3d lithological as transport modelling

used to determine the value of tol and vif respectively 1 tol 1 r j 2 2 vif 1 tol where r j 2 denotes regression coefficient of j on added conditioning factors 2 6 groundwater flow and as transport assessment in aquifer the volume speed and orientation of groundwater flow in a particular place are reflected in physical characteristics markstrom et al 2008 previous literature highlighted that various types of established groundwater flow model were used for groundwater flow mapping such as contour diagram 3d geological model hydro stratigraphic model gms mudflow model etc from the last three decades åberg et al 2021 desbarats et al 2014 hussein et al 2020 salinas rodríguez et al 2021 scheidler et al 2021 in present study the area of murshidabad district is represented by the

to zero 2 7 groundwater vulnerability assessment 2 7 1 random forest random forest model is stated to have lower generalization errors from existing researches than any other machine learning model approaches islam et al 2022 such a framework is a highly optimistic and powerful ensemble method that has been applied in present study generated by breiman 2001 rf generates various trees for training dataset depending on a random bootstrapped sample the lope bt binary trees algorithm that used a division of the observation over bootstrapping framework random selections of the training data are chosen from the early dataset and executed to generate the model data that is not incorporated is subscribed as from bag catani et al 2013 the rf envisioned the value of components by seeming to allow the degree of inconsistency of projections resulting from bag data for the components while others have gone predictable liaw and wiener 2002 to be updated with the number of trees random

and avoidance of consistent marin et al 2020 vapnik et al 1995 two ideas on statistically mediated issues used through svm modelling fig 6b the said svm modelling classes were described in the following section singh et al 2018 yilmaz 2010 regard as a set of linear separate training vectors x i i 1 2 n training vectors have two classes i e y i 1 the primary aim of the svm is to look for an n dimensional hyperplane which differentiate two classes by using maximum gap this can be expressed as 9 1 2 w 2 the following constraints of subject is 10 y i w x i b 1 where w represents the hyperplane b represent scalar base represent the scalar product the cost function of svm can be defined by using lagrangian multiplier such as 11 l 1 2 w 2 i 1 n λi y i w x i b 1 where λi represent lagrangian multiplier in the case of non separable function the constraints can be modified by introducing slack variables 12 y i w x i b 1 ζ i and finally the equation becomes as follow 13 l 1 2 w 2 1 vn i 1 n ζ i where v 0 1 is generated in order to account for misclassification hastie et al 2009 in addition to this kernel function k x i x j was introduced by vapnik in the year of 1995 to explanation for non linear decision boundary 2 7 3 support vector regression svr is an agreed machine learning supervised algorithm for optimal regression problems to maximize the definite margin of the training data sets employed fig 6a su et al 2018 the svr approach widely considered in the nonlinear problem solving method was introduced by vapnik in the year 2000 göbel and göbel 2009 an modification of a new advanced ml approach based on the classification of supporting vector machines is the svr algorithm hence said model has been used in present study lu et al 2009 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2017 in structured data types the use of svr is also true as this regression provides several curved margins kalantar et al 2018 the svr measurement is therefore essential and is carried out by adopting the equations 14 y k z v z c where input data represent through z z 1 z 2 z n and the resultant value represent by y b r l in addition to this v r l indicates the weight factor c r l indicates constant number of mathematical function and l represent dataset size in the model whereas z shows an irregular function for mapping the input datasets the underneath equation uses to

vulnerability due to elevated level of geogenic arsenic a variety of validated and analyzed machine learning algorithm models were performed through a number of statistical analyses islam et al 2022 nath et al 2018 whereas five quantitative techniques in this analysis namely sensitivity sst specificity spf positive predictive values ppv negative predictive values npv and receiver operating

literatures related to this field different topographic hydrological geological and environmental parameter has a prominent function on occurrences and distribution of groundwater resources arulbalaji et al 2019 pal et al 2022 there are five geomorphological features i e water bodies pediment pediplain complex deltaic plain alluvial plain and flood plain has been confirmed in this region fig 2g the topographical parameters i e elevation of this region are ranges from 16 to 68 m and slope of this region are ranges into 0 31 68 respectively fig 2a whereas most of the high slope is associated along the river bank and its surrounding areas fig 2b geological constituents of an area are a major causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability aquifers structural properties demonstrate resistance to pollutants moving from the surface to the water table zhang et al 2020 nyer 1992 the geological unit like fluvial sediment and rajmahal trap are found in the study area whereas fluvial sediment made up of late pleistocene to late holocene aged sand silt and hard clays rock domains fig 2h the lithological constituents of pleistocene aged sediments are semi consolidated deltaic alluvium ferruginous concretion lithomarge clay gravels pebbles cobbles mishra et al 2022 on the other hand the rajmahal trap lithological formation belongs to jurassic to late holocene aged rajmahal basalt sand silt fine soft and hard clays with caliche nodules chatterjee et al 2020 lineament is considered as an important aspect for the occurrences and storage of water resources in this perspective the distance from lineament is considered as a causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability assessment goyal et al 2021 saunders et al 2016 the ranges of distance from lineament for this region are between 0 and 26 123 73 m fig 2f the occurrences of stream network are favourable for storage of groundwater resources in more optimal way in this perspective the distance from stream is considered as an important determining element for groundwater vulnerability assessment voutchkova et al 2021 the amount of distance from stream of this region are ranges from 0 to 17 489 76 m fig 2c the causal relationship between recharge rate and drainage density significantly leads the mobility of geogenic contaminants aggregating from surface water runoff and subsequent infiltration thus the drainage density can also be a causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability dong et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 the amount of drainage density of this region are ranges from 0 00 to 0 81 m fig 2d groundwater is carried in unconfined circumstances by fractured and eroded rocks and rainfall is the primary cause of water recharge hence the annual rainfall is a causal factor of groundwater vulnerability bagherzadeh et al 2018 polya et al 2019 the average rainfall of the region lies between 1320 and 1380 mm fig 2e the state of groundwater is determined by a combination of physical biological and chemical characteristics that are impacted by both natural and anthropogenic sources so land use and land cover are the causal parameter to assess groundwater vulnerability das et al 2020 stevenazzi et al 2017 various land use and land cover features like deciduous forest agricultural land built up land shrubland fallow land waste land water bodies plantations grassland and permanent wetlands are associated in this region which have a dissimilar function on groundwater resources fig 2i 3 2 physicochemical analysis of vulnerability 3 2 1 general physicochemical analysis the physicochemical attributes of the groundwater of murshidabad district are depicted in table 4 result revealed that the ph of the collected samples ranges from neutral to moderate alkaline in both pre and post monsoon season where mean ph level of groundwater is 3 5 higher in the post monsoon compare to pre monsoon season the oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solid tds are also important factors of arsenic enrichment and mobility in groundwater results revealed that in pre monsoon the nature of water is more oxic than post monsoon season the increasing of orp in the post monsoon season is perhaps due to the higher rain fall and subsequent higher solubility with lower saturation time mcgrory et al 2020 the mean decreasing of two fold for the tds ec and hardness in post monsoon season also highlights the monsoonal precipitation and less rock water interaction huang et al 2022 however mean dissolve oxygen and salinity level in water samples is decreased in post monsoon about 16 and 45 respectively the decreasing trend of these parameters also suggests the enrichment of precipitation and leaching to water table in post monsoon than pre monsoon huang et al 2022 nevertheless the mean temperature value of the post monsoonal groundwater sample depicts almost 35 increased comparing pre monsoon season 3 2 2 cation anion analysis the availability of ionic species in groundwater and subsequent variation in quantity is predominantly controlled by the hydro geochemistry of the aquifer material alam et al 2015 planer friedrich et al 2012 in present study the cationic appearance in groundwater of murshidabad district showed diverse result in both pre and post monsoon seasons where the mean value of sodium and calcium is twofold increased along with 20 and 5 increase of potassium and magnesium found in post monsoon respectively whereas lithium and ammonium mean value depicts 1 fold and 5 decrease in post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon season table 4 the increase and decreasing of cations are may be the result of mix up consequences of agricultural runoff and presence of anaerobic bacteria in the aquifer constituents mishra et al 2022 liao et al 2011 on the other hand anionic load in the groundwater of the observed samples revealed that only mean bicarbonate concentration is 10 increase in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season whereas the concentration of other anions such as fluoride chloride sulphate phosphate and nitrate showed decreasing pattern as 10 fold 2 fold 6 2 fold and 22 fold respectively table 4 the upsurge and down surge of the anions are due to the consequences of precipitation and pyrite oxidation mcgrory et al 2020 mishra et al 2022 3 2 3 heavy metal analysis groundwater samples have been collected from the depth range 24 38 106 68 m for the both of pre monsoon and post monsoon season where 36 samples lie in below 30 m 58 samples from below 60 m and 6 samples are from below 106 68 m previous study report highlighted that the groundwater arsenic load is significantly varied corresponding to aquifer depth chowdhury and paul 2019 kulkarni et al 2018 present study results also revealed that the arsenic concentration varies from 0 10 to 0 30 mg l and 0 06 0 30 mg l during pre and post monsoon depth 30 m 0 08 0 51 mg l and 0 06 0 43 mg l during pre and post monsoon depth 60 m 0 09 0 30 mg l during pre and post monsoon 106 68 m respectively moreover mean arsenic concentration is almost two fold increase in post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon it can also concern that the mean concentration of fe and mn were also 20 and 30 higher in post monsoon season in accordance with pre monsoon season respectively whereas mean concentration cd and se does not exhibit such seasonal incremental or decremental variation in groundwater for both of pre and post monsoon season table 4 3 3 multi collinearity assessment the multi collinearity of the all selected variables were performed with the help of vif and tol from this analysis it is indicated that all the variables are free from the multi collinearity pal et al 2022 all the parameters in both of the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon are selected with considering the vif and tol limit 3 4 geochemical processes ionic controlling mechanism and arsenic mobilization in present study the hydrogeochemical causal relationship and their controlling mechanism were measured in both of pre and post monsoon seasons by using tds and ratios of na k na k ca2 or cl cl hco3 respectively as shown in the gibbs diagram in fig 3 a d fig 3 highlighted the dominancy of rock cation and anion in the studied samples this is attributed as the primary source of felsic rocks into the lesser himalayan formations shinjo et al 2020 the amount of various dissolved ions in groundwater depends on their presence in the bedrock and on their rate of dissolution herein mg2 na and ca2 na weathering processes are demonstrated fig 3e leading to evaporate dissolution and silicate weathering where silicate weathering predominates singh et al 2022 similarly in pre monsoon 99 98 of sample silicate weathering ratio of geogenic ca2 na against the plot of hco3 na fig 3f increased to a maximum of 4 67 8 33 in silicate mineral interactions during monsoon on the other hand ca2 mg2 shows lower ratio than hco3 na due to carbonate precipitation with other anions however bi carbonate increased possibly due to dolomite dissolution kumar et al 2022 the dissolution of dolomite and calcite can be explained by the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 dolomite will dissolve if the ca2 mg2 molar ratio is equal to 1 while calcite will dissolve if molar ratio belongs 1 2 and silicate minerals will dissolve if molar ratio is above 2 fig 3 g demonstrates that under the presumptive scenario of dolomite dominance and silicate dissolving minerals 1 1 or 1 2 moreover in present study the majority of the groundwater samples in both of pre and post monsoon seasons belongs in the molar ratio of 1 2 while 4 5 of the samples depicts calcite dissolution das et al 2020 22 cac o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 2 hc o 3 calcite dissolution 23 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 4 hc o 3 dolomite dissolution whereas ca2 mg2 vs total cations tc exhibited that all samples were below the 1 1 equiline fig 3 h which emphasizes the silicate weathering process carbonic acid induced silicate weathering prevails the said ions presence in groundwater then again the scatter plot of na k vs tc fig 4a revealed the majority of samples lies below and or closer to the 1 1 equiline with linear trends of 0 91 and 0 94 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the said phenomena illustrate the dominance of na and k ions in groundwater which are further increased by the weathering of silicates analogously when the ratio of ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 is 1 the ion exchange mechanism dominates during recharging which is implied as 1 4 relationship fig 4b where possible constituent of minerals comprises with anhydrite or gypsum dissolution interferences kumar et al 2022 24 caso 4 2 h 2 o ca 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o according to this viewpoint the presence of cations and anions causes ionic species to compete with one another supported by adsorption or ion exchange with cations alkaline earth metals and anions singh et al 2020 thus the plot of as and hco3 in fig 4 c d suggests the fundamental mechanism ion exchange for as mobilization during recharging comes from a variety of sources for mineral dissolution reductive dissolution associated with various minerals precipitation of carbonate in both pre and post monsoon seasons singh et al 2022 the aquifer s redox conditions determines the ease of minerals phases along with as mobilization chakraborty et al 2015 from the pourbaix diagram fig 4 e f it is observed that the oxidizing conditions is due to arsenate species which are prevalently support as oxy anions as v arsenate and as iii arsenite both of which are present in the ph range of 5 9 the stability patterns of both arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 and arsenite h3aso3 have shown their presence in the studied groundwater samples in post monsoon arsenite oxidizes and forms arsenate haso4 2 farooq et al 2011 kumar et al 2022 again arsenic that has been adsorbed on specific regions surfaces of the minerals used to release during the reductive dissolution of iron oxides singh et al 2020 since pyrites and iron oxides are significant arsenic sinks the formation of these minerals can subordinate groundwater arsenic concentrations the most significant geochemical triggers for the desorption of as from fe and or mn oxyhydroxide phases in sedimentary plain aquifers that are thought to be strongly redox conditions feng et al 2023 according to fig 4 g h the distribution of fe and availability of mn compared to as in both pre and post monsoon seasons are depicted which are demonstrated in fig s8 c d yet other than fe oxyhydroxides important sources of as also includes fe sulphide minerals like pyrite fes2 and arsenopyrite feass whereby oxidation can leads to a high as content in groundwater as stated neil et al 2014 in eq 25 and 26 25 feass s h 2 o o 2 aq f e 2 aq h 3 as o 3 aq s o 4 2 aq 26 fe a s s 2 s n o 3 aq h 2 o h aq f e 2 aq has o 4 2 aq s o 4 2 aq n h 4 aq 3 5 lithological assessment of arsenic transport groundwater flow regime the entire district of murshidabad is covered by unconsolidated sediments of late pleistocene and holocene times whereas a cluster of locations have sandy and silty clay as the dominant lithology to form the rajmahal trap it has been reported that aquifers mineral leads contamination and have the potentialities in controlling geochemical mobility nath et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 present 3d lithological study has been illustrated in fig 5 a whereas aquifer i phreatic encountered at 30 40 m below ground level mbgl persisting the younger alluvium which leads the arsenic contamination sporadically those shallow aquifers closer to the ganga river basin are easily recharged with river water and increases the as contamination das et al 2020 singh et al 2022 at its core the intermediates layer of clay i and ii where the contaminants are percolated the mobility of contaminant are restricted for discharging or adsorption by said clay layers basically the dominating clay sediments are overlapped with each other considering to holocene flood plains thus arsenic present in pocket form on the other hand clay iii and iv boundaries of aquifer 2 vulnerable to as contamination due to the increase in permeability in aquifer ii intermediate it has been observed that water level barrier extended to 100 m in depth presenting all block of murshidabad district thus the areas of farakka samserganj suti i suti ii raghunathganj i sagardighi nabagram khargram and kandi observed water level fluctuation water level fluctuations during pre and post monsoon water were 1 97 m and 1 10 m respectively hence recharging could enhance 0 87 m under rainy season in aquifer 2 the clay v and vi are the lenticular clay beds originated from old alluvial sediments persisting the slow recharging owing to less permeability and high adsorption thus the contaminant decreases in aquifer iii sathe et al 2018 sathe and mahanta 2019 therefore the groundwater of aquifer iii deeper is significantly safe of elevated arsenic due to its non iniquitousness and low permeability index sathe et al 2018 sathe and mahanta 2019 nevertheless higher level of as contamination spot values observed in groundwater from holocene aquifers rather than oxidized pleistocene aquifers in murshidabad district thus the bagri region found lower availability of geogenic as sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the boundary condition in the two dimensional linear numerical modflow model for groundwater simulation is head dependent flux in these instances groundwater flow regimes have been modelled using riv river and surface water flow routing awfr fig s11 for riv s boundary condition the output water stage has been simulated using the modflow equation the groundwater gw head specifies the boundary conditions on the north and south boundaries of the model grid the gw head fits the north east to south west limit between 56 24 m to 155 5 m above sea level the river ganga in mushidabad is truncated by the model s eastern and northern boundaries the river s edge can be depicted in two different ways first assuming that water does not flow laterally under the river by isolating the side of the model below the two rivers with a vertical flow barrier the second step is to place a prescribed head along the river until it reaches the model s base allowing groundwater to enter or exit the model below the rivers das et al 2020 when groundwater is vertically recharged during the monsoon season or through the deposition of river sediments surface water flow routing awfr is typically imposed which easily transports as by redox mobilization sikdar and chakraborty 2017 takai et al 2022 these flow channels frequently deposit as minerals while transporting groundwater that is rich in as and other chalcophile elements furtherly the as transporting fluid interacts with a reactive aquifer matrix or a fluid with a different hydrochemical make up deposition may be encouraged sathe and mahanta 2019 these fluid flow systems are most prevalent in tectonically active zones where a delicate equilibrium of hydrostatic lithostatic and geodynamic gradients supports the metamorphic fluid fluxes the re mobilization and dissolution of already precipitated arsenian minerals may result in enhanced dissolved as concentrations in many of these aquifers that host as bearing fluid flow which might then be used as groundwater sources mukherjee et al 2014 the isolines from the riv module simulation were displayed in fig s11 the three distinct boundary conditions in mudflow are head dependent fluxes specified heads and specified fluxes sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the head is fixed at defined head limits in order to maintain the desired head the fluid is simulated as entering or exiting the groundwater at a rate that is appropriate aghlmand and abbasi 2019 the flow transits into eastern region raghunathganj lalgola to south western region nabipur sagarpara jalangi madhubona of murshidabad district as horizontal dispersion the model explanation for the observed and predicted head using mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse provided in table s3 due to a residual error of 0 001 with me is identical to zero thus the results demonstrate high precision again the aforesaid result may also support the impression of groundwater flow regime of the study area that the truly heterogeneous anisotropic porous medium in this region is simulated as a homogeneous anisotropic porous medium sikdar and chakraborty 2017 on the other hand newer alluvial and older alluvial both can be more sensitive to face as contamination due to as mobility in presence of organic matter 10 20 and higher humification index in the study area zahid et al 2015 this phenomenon followed the plume in as contamination channel the plume direction was applied through the hydraulic head which has been shown in fig 5 b and results showed approximately 80 of as enriched of 0 5 mg l finally the model flow paths for discharging particles have been estimated by modepath in fig 5 c where the water table follows the general topology according to the terminal report of cgwb govt of india 2017 2018 furtherly fig 5 c showed the x axis as western and y southern of the utm projection with z as the elevation mbgl general results shows the higher transmissivity observed in southern region 1378 33 m2 day and additionally observed that the transmissivity is inversely proportional to the elevation in this region furthermore the contour plot observed hydraulic conductivity which has been measured by hydraulic head depicted in fig s10 a results revealed that 92 37 of conductivity goes to 0 08 0 115 m day and the higher flow is observed in gopgram and salar region due to new alluvial sediments of the ganges basin in accordance with flooding on the other way in pest model calibration the initial parameters such as hydraulic conductivity recharge observation of yield are attributed in the sensitive analysis which depicts the response of aquifer system as recharging and discharging condition table 4 mcarthur et al 2008 the results showed that observation heads versus calculated heads in fig s10 b both are closer and the model is significant r2 0 9611 herein training datasets carried with aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 with the vertical distribution and it is showing specific yield in aquifer 1 due to new alluvial made of sand and clay thus lucidly increased the permeability 3 6 groundwater vulnerability assessment trough predictive model the groundwater vulnerability has been estimated with the help of different machine learning approaches i e svr rf and svm table 2 the spatial coverage of very low low moderate high and very high groundwater vulnerability zones in svr model are 20 25 20 70 30 55 22 33 and 6 17 respectively in rf model are 18 68 38 06 29 97 7 43 and 5 86 respectively and in svm model are 20 25 20 70 19 28 19 53 and 20 24 respectively 3 7 validation of model the validation of the all predictive models have been done with the help of auc and roc and different statistical indices fig 7 a b islam et al 2022 das et al 2020 in accordance with the training datasets the results of auc of svr rf and svm are 0 923 0 901 and 0 897 respectively the values of auc with considering the validation datasets of svr rf and svm are 0 910 0 899 and 0 891 respectively here the svr is the best model in terms of predictive ability and robustness of the classifier roy et al 2020 in svr model the values of sensitivity specificity npv and ppv with considering the training datasets are 0 83 0 87 0 80 and 0 90 respectively the values of sensitivity specificity npv and ppv in svr model with considering validation datasets are 0 76 0 86 0 86 and 0 90 respectively table 1 4 discussion for anthropogenic needs and economic growth groundwater is the much needed natural resource rahman et al 2021 again the underlying bedrock of the basin has a significant impact on regulating the geochemistry of the groundwater groundwater genesis is also significantly influenced by groundwater residence time in the aquifer and interactions between water and the sediment in the aquifer khan et al 2023 verma et al 2016 the presence of highly weatherable rock causes a considerable shift in the concentration of dissolved ions such na mg2 and ca2 making it a crucial component of the weathering process chakraborty et al 2015 khan et al 2023 the relative contributions of various weathering mechanisms including silicate carbonate weathering and evaporate dissolution were seen as the contribution of normalized molar ratio of na ions ca2 na mg2 na and hco3 na chakraborty et al 2022 kumar et al 2010 adhering to present study results physicochemical parameters like ph shows neutral to alkaline nature in groundwater dey et al 2016 due the presence of different cationic species followed by the redox nature caused by rock water interaction chowdhury and paul 2019 singh et al 2022 earlier studies also highlighted that both the arsenic iii and v co exist in the ph range of 6 to 9 in both oxidized and unoxidized aquifer in the form of h2aso2 and haso2 2 respectively bhowmick et al 2018 adhering to the monsoonal precipitation rainwater leached into the aquifer leads the significant increase of the tds ec and hardness levels in post monsoon season chatterjee et al 2013 samadder et al 2014 similarly salinity level significantly decreased at the same time because of the monsoonal recharge of groundwater kulkarni et al 2018 majumder et al 2016 the marginal decrease of dissolve oxygen in the post monsoonal season emphasized the role of microbial activity on sedimental organic matter anning et al 2012 dey et al 2016 however the increased groundwater temperature in pre monsoon season may be due to the higher solar radiation and subsequent clear atmospheric condition bretzler et al 2019 pre monsoonal decrease of cations in groundwater depicts the consequences of lower oxygen availability presence of anaerobic microbes and low permeability of aquifer sediments mohammed aslam and rizvi 2020 whereas increased level of cations in post monsoon may be due to the runoff from surface water and contamination from agricultural field amwele et al 2021 the anionic constituents in post monsoon were decreased significantly likewise pre monsoon however variation of bicarbonate level is the exception ayotte et al 2017 borah et al 2018 the said increase of bicarbonate in groundwater is due to the oxidation of pyrites which subsequently released bicarbonate ion from sediments ghosh et al 2020 mohammed aslam and rizvi 2020 on the other hand significant increase of nitrate concentration in pre monsoon season is may be due to activity of nitrifying bacteria pedretti et al 2019 as a whole inorganic fertilizers waste disposal spread to the land and sediment sinks are a few of sources where nitrates can come in groundwater although the cation and anion balance also play a significant part in the production of nitrate additionally nitrifying bacteria in soil or sediment are other aspects that convert different types of nitrogen into nitrate which also leached through the subsurface layers with the rain water chakraborty et al 2015 vaiphei and kurakalva 2021 considering the major finding of the study it is highlighted that the majority of the groundwater samples were contaminated with higher level of as this association of as in the groundwater is dominated by redox dependent phenomenon fig s12 a b strongly suggested that mobilization of as in the groundwater depends on redox dependent manner traditionally organic matter decomposition in subterranean sediments played a significant role in the development of anoxic conditions in the alluvial aquifer chakraborty et al 2022 singh et al 2022 however the assumption of a number of anthropogenic activities such as the use of agricultural fertilizers and the disposal of household waste that take place in the study area may be attributed the favourable attainment of biogeochemical conditions that can result in the release of as from fe mn oxyhydroxides thus the output of the studied aquifer s redox conditions was primarily oxidizing however the upshots of as concentrations were found while the aquifer environment turns into reducing nature the research area s lulc map fig 2i which appears a significant portion of the area is classified as agricultural land proved the presence of widespread anthropogenic activity in the region chakraborty et al 2022 moreover in few region residential waste is directly discharges into the surface water singh et al 2020 on a regional scale the genesis of high as loaded groundwater is result of the interaction of two key components first the potential geochemical trigger that could release as from the aquifer s mineral phases into the groundwater and secondly the as that has been released must remain in the groundwater and not be washed away herath et al 2016 khan et al 2023 according to reports younger sediments were often unoxidized and had higher amounts of naturally occurring organic carbon and as containing fe or mn oxyhydroxides this impact subsided with increasing burial age as this context the palaeo weathering to support the enrichment of as associated with different minerals in underneath pleistocene aquifer bonsor et al 2017 khan et al 2023 however other factors such as subsurface lithology iron oxide content dissolved organic matter in sediments regional topography existence or disappearance of confined aquifers prevailing redox conditions in aquifers and extent of groundwater flushing could be the significant contributors towards enrichments of as shaji et al 2020 literatures also highlighted that the aquifer s redox condition is a key geochemical factor towards distribution of as in the gangetic basin chakraborty et al 2015 shaji et al 2020 where the upper and middle gangetic plain s redox environment was generally reported to be regionally varied with mild to high oxidizing aquifer conditions due to restricted recharge of hydrostratigraphic heterogeneity mukherjee et al 2007 singh et al 2020 however the aquifers of the lower gangetic plain were initially depleted with as favoring the conversion of ferric iron to ferrous iron and as a result some highly contaminated groundwater has been identified to be present there in lithology mudflows are generally predicated on aquifer 1 2 and 3 usually in some areas with weakening of as contamination due to recharging and aquifer deposition minerals banerji et al 2019 kazmierczak et al 2022 previous research enlightened that the main water budget of murshidabad district is dominated by river and monsoon water where as mineral reach fluvial sediment is primarily responsible for as mobility deposited by flood or an aggregation of precipitation das 2020 farooq et al 2011 thus shallow groundwater has greater quantities of arsenic than deep aquifers majumder et al 2016 and zhang et al 2020 furthermore as and when a suitable geochemical sink is not immediately accessible the mobilized as remains in the groundwater at its core the reductive dissolution of metal oxides and hydroxides seen in the unconsolidated sediments of the bengal basin mobilizes through rain water percolation however literature also highlighted that the as mineral mobilization is also caused by other processes including pyrite oxidation redox cycling in surface soils and competitive ion exchange ziegler et al 2017 several of these processes may work together to mobilize as at the same time which significantly triggered by complicated redox fluxes in the bengal basin aquifers chakraborty et al 2015 furthermore significant positive correlation p 0 99 of manganese and iron with arsenic were found due to the catalytic activity of colloidal aggregates on monsoonal recharge water and subsequent mobilization in aquifer planer friedrich et al 2012 ghosh et al 2020 as a sum up present study output portrays that as contamination plume is significantly triggered by flood enriched sediments of gangetic floodplain i e the new alluvium holocene in essence significant amounts of as are carried in the said sediment that are deposited and transported through groundwater principally in recharging areas chakraborty et al 2015 huang et al 2022 however the minimal increase and decrease of cadmium and selenium in both pre and post monsoon may be due to the contamination with diverse agricultural runoff ghosh and rolee 2011 borah et al 2018 as a whole the highly populated regions in various parts of the world were facing scarcity of the geogenic contaminants elevated vulnerability of groundwater resources fuoco et al 2022 where robustness of most appropriate classifier is the significant determining element in probability modelling adhere to data scare region richards et al 2019 das et al 2020 in this perspective focus of the present study on the prediction of geogenic as vulnerable regions in the gangetic plain by both of ml approaches and lithological as transport approaches to get suitable output marin et al 2020 huq et al 2020 considering the present study applied ml models svr rf and svm output auc value and different statistical indices the svr is the most optimal model then rf and svm the auc value of svr model for the training and validation datasets are 0 923 and 0 910 according to present study results it has been predicted through svr model that some portions of these blocks i e jalangli raninagrar ii bhagawangola i bhagawangola ii beldanga i and ii bharatpur i and ii suti i and suti ii are associated with higher vulnerabilities and rest of the blocks are associated with moderate to low vulnerability of elevated arsenic level in groundwater previous literature highlights that main causes of increased vulnerability in the bengal basin aquifers resulted from the stratified flow systems and stand with interleaved discontinuous clay layers sathe and mahanta 2019 here pleistocene aquifers are little imposed of as contamination due to deep aquifer intervention holocene aquifers are further weakened by burial ages of aquifers younger than 2 9 ka von brömssen et al 2014 principally iron hydroxide and detrital sulfide minerals such as pyrite which binds solid phase arsenic in sediments in pleistocene aquifer chakraborty et al 2015 rahman et al 2022 thus in the bengal basin aquifers iron iii hydroxide harbors mostly as additionally pleistocene sediments have enriched with iron oxide that has a strong potential to adsorb as and reduce arsenic concentrations however holocene aquifers have higher sorption capacity and lower iron oxides than pleistocene ones which may cause the release of as into groundwater bhowmick et al 2018 similar results were found in modpath as transport model also aggregately the outputs of modpath hydraulic conductivity and pest sensitivity analysis revealed that ganga river basin sediment composition sand and clay in newer alluvium leads to higher permeability sikdar and chakraborty 2017 takai et al 2022 the advective dispersive reactive transport mechanism of as in modpath highlights higher transmissivity in southern region and moderate in northern region comparing to other parts of murshidabad district finally the pest sensitivity analysis validated that the observation heads and calculated heads are significantly closer thus the north eastern and the south western parts of the present study area faces higher as vulnerability in groundwater sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the said results also support the outputs of ml models predicted vulnerable regions this type of information may be helpful to the liaising authority to the respective field for adopting the most appropriate sustainable measures to deal with present scenario of murshidabad district 5 conclusion the identification of vulnerable regions and subsequent contaminant hydrogeology is a sensitive issue in most of the regions of the world while groundwater vulnerability due to geogenic contaminants is highly needed for adopting the suitable measures in regard with the vulnerability of water resource due to uncertainty of the climatic condition and its associated parameters the actual estimation of geogenic arsenic as concentration is very crucial issues in terms of predictive capacities all over the world in this perspective different machine learning approaches i e svr rf and svm have been considered in present study for assessing the as vulnerability in groundwater of murshidabad district the results of the current study showed that the best optimal capacity was achieved from svr model moreover model outcomes also predicted that both eastern and western parts of the murshidabad district are more as vulnerable areas again from lithological study it has been observed that the major source of as contamination in the sediments is mainly aggregates from the alluvial plain during groundwater recharging and the concentration of arsenic nearly increased to twofold in post monsoon season moreover geochemical parameter which primarily influencing the as distribution is the gangetic basin which considered as the aquifer redox state again the redox environment of the lower gangetic plain is recognized to be locally diverse where as variability depending on the oxidizing level in the water while with increasing burial age this effect becomes diminished younger sediments can be oxidized and comprised with more organic carbon leads the mobilization of as along with mn bearing fe oxyhydroxides present results also revealed that the average concentrations of fe and mn were 20 and 30 higher in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season however the mean concentration of cd and se does not show any significant seasonal variability on the other hand among the various anions only bicarbonate showed 10 increment in post monsoon season over pre monsoon again rainwater percolation leads the decreasing of tds ec and hardness in post monsoon season the outcomes of the mudflow hydraulic conductivity and lithological parameters observed in murshidabad district concluded that the northeastern part and southwestern part is major vulnerable in aquifer 1 made up of holocene aged sediments due to higher water conductivity 61 76 m day which can deposit arsenic minerals comparatively the contamination area in the aquifer 2 also depicts the holocene age sediments and transmission of as possesses through river channels of ganga floodplain contrastingly aquifer 3 demarks pleistocene age aquifer which can accumulate low levels of as comparing to holocene aged in india most of the management strategies regarding the groundwater resources are carried out by the administrative units so this type of outcome can be helpful for the regional planner to take the appropriate remedies for the present study region of west bengal india the aggregative methodologies i e geomorphological

1198,deterioration of groundwater quality is a long term incident which leads unending vulnerability of groundwater the present work was carried out in murshidabad district west bengal india to assess groundwater vulnerability due to elevated arsenic as and other heavy metal contamination in this area the geographic distribution of arsenic and other heavy metals including physicochemical parameters of groundwater in both pre monsoon and post monsoon season and different physical factors were performed gis machine learning model such as support vector machine svm random forest rf and support vector regression svr were used for this study results revealed that the concentration of groundwater arsenic compasses from 0 093 to 0 448 mg l in pre monsoon and 0 078 to 0 539 mg l in post monsoon throughout the district which indicate that all water samples of the murshidabad district exceed the who s permissible limit 0 01 mg l the gis machine learning model outcomes states the values of area under the curve auc of svr rf and svm are 0 923 0 901 and 0 897 training datasets and 0 910 0 899 and 0 891 validation datasets respectively hence support vector regression model is best fitted to predict the arsenic vulnerable zones of murshidabad district then again groundwater flow paths and arsenic transport was assessed by three dimensions underlying transport model modpath the particles discharging trends clearly revealed that the holocene age aquifers are major contributor of as than pleistocene age aquifers and this may be the main cause of as vulnerability of both northeast and southwest parts of murshidabad district therefore special attention should be paid on the predicted vulnerable areas for the safeguard of the public health moreover this study can help to make a proper framework towards sustainable groundwater management graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater arsenic vulnerability physical factors spatiotemporal distribution machine learning models arsenic transport models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction by virtue every biological system needs safe drinking water since the inception in contrast groundwater pollution due to elevated geogenic contamination is an emerging global problem mukherjee and singh 2022 shaji et al 2020 the indian scenario of catastrophic geogenic contaminants revealed several inculpates like arsenic as fluoride f iron fe manganese mn uranium u nitrate no3 radon rn strontium sn chromium cr selenium se etc das et al 2020 cgwb 2014 whereas the ganga meghna bhramhaputra river basin originating from the himalayan range significantly affected central and north east states assam uttar pradesh bihar jharkhand chattisgarh and west bengal etc by the mineralogical presence of arsenic patel et al 2019 pradhan et al 2021 the major points of concerning are the natural process reported as a result of water rock interaction on particular environment climatic consequences geochemical redox potential of aquifer and flow of groundwater related to water table which leads arsenic pollution as 0 01 mg l largely confined to groundwater of bengal basin aquifer chakraborti et al 2017 mcarthur et al 2008 from a last few decades various systemic manifestations were reported like chronic lung disease chronic obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease non cirrhotic portal fibrosis polyneuropathy peripheral vascular disease hypertension nonpitting edema of feet hands conjunctival congestion weakness and anemia due to immense concentrations of groundwater as in west bengal chattopadhyay et al 2020 roy et al 2014 mazumder and dasgupta 2011 on the other hand groundwater quality monitoring and assessment is a rigorous and time consuming task due to sluggish mobility of groundwater in subsurface aquifer nevertheless vulnerability zonation mapping due to geogenic aspects is a much essential as well as beneficial key to decision making process for the proper management of contaminated groundwater mhanna et al 2021 at its core vulnerability deals with collective approach assembling intrinsic factors within a system thus the vulnerability and resilience research has become a key tool of modern day science scientists also been encourages their attention to vulnerability indexed based pollution studies to stand upon adverse situation hussam et al 2021 huan et al 2012 since last few decades different types of conceptual statistical numerical and stochastic modelling systems have been established for the management of groundwater as well as surface water resources jang et al 2020 however the execution of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml modelling techniques spread own wings in groundwater applied hydrology of both surface and groundwater el bilali et al 2021 rajaee et al 2019 previous research highlights the application of rf in different aspects on applied studies of water resources along with remote sensing and vulnerability mapping castrillo and garcía 2020 naghibi et al 2016 pourghasemi et al 2020 the said researchers expressed their views on the novelty of rf model as it can be a deterministic modelling tool due to the robustness of this model in decision making expressions elsewhere svm was developed on the basis of statistical learning theory vapnik et al 1995 day by day svm model raise its way to the advanced level machine learning research due to its appropriate prediction results and versatility the diverse applicability of svm algorithm has been executed in susceptibility studied reported as flood susceptibility assessment tehrany et al 2015 landslide susceptibility assessment tien bui et al 2012 ecological and climatic modelling along with remote sensing studies gharekhani et al 2022 however svr model s algorithm relies advance developed exploratory techniques in artificial intelligence founded on statistical learning theory introduced by cortes and vapnik kalantar et al 2018 svr model now a days is widely applied in different field of hydrological science and groundwater engineering studies li 2009 sattari et al 2018 present study area i e murshidabad district is situated on the left bank of the ganga river again river ganges is majorly subdivided into two branches i e vagirathi in india and padma in bangladsh near to dhulian murshidabad therefore geographically murshidabad district lies in the major floodplains of the river ganges the total area cover is of the murshidabad district is 5324 km2 where 6 million people are affected by the severity of arsenic 3 3000 μg l according to indian census report 2011 halder 2019 another subject of concern about murshidabad districts geological constituents is the holocene and pleistocene aged dominating sediments those are mainly constitute with iron fe and manganese mn along with organic matter in aquifers of gray sand mishra et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is expected that arsenic may easily mobilize in the reducing environment with the association of both iron and manganese reza et al 2010 rowland et al 2005 however previous researchers chowdhury and paul 2019 dey 2016 halder 2019 rahman et al 2021 mahmudur rahman et al 2005 majumdar 2018 mandal et al 1996 samadder et al 2014 reported their research outcomes as quantification of groundwater as well as surface water arsenic level health survey outcomes and population risk in selected areas of murshidabad district after reviewing said research findings it was realized that there is still a lack of in depth study of the current scenario of arsenic vulnerability in murshidabad district nevertheless the local people of murshidabad district might be more exposed day after day by the elevated arsenic toxicity due to consumption of arsenic contaminated groundwater again the unavailability of methodological data statistically only a moderate application of groundwater vulnerability in murshidabad district can relate on the basis of climate conditions and drainage pattern therefore present study is much needed one to monitor the vulnerable zones of arsenic indigenousness the specific objectives of present study are i estimation of the idiosyncratically groundwater vulnerability by physiographic parameters assessed through alos palser dem stream and drainage density with multi collinearity assessment ii to evaluate the hydro geochemical causal factors leading to groundwater as vulnerability by physicochemical analysis and 3das lithological transport model validated with cgwb 2017 18 data iii prediction of groundwater vulnerability by both of the primary data machine learning model and subsequent spatiotemporal distribution to assess the arsenic and subsequent heavy metals i e fe mn se and cd load in groundwater in areas of murshidabad district gangetic plain the main novelty of the present study is to find out the arsenic vulnerability zone through the application of gis machine learning model such as support vector machine svm random forest rf and support vector regression svr moreover as sensitive zones will be predicted by the 3d lithological as transport modelling

rsr 2018 2 6 1 groundwater flow model calibration for calibration the hydraulic head of observation wells are taken to import into study region trial and error approach has been applied for the healthier assimilation of observation head moreover calibration was distinguished using mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse using following equations salinas

to zero 2 7 groundwater vulnerability assessment 2 7 1 random forest random forest model is stated to have lower generalization errors from existing researches than any other machine learning model approaches islam et al 2022 such a framework is a highly optimistic and powerful ensemble method that has been applied in present study generated by breiman 2001 rf generates various trees for training dataset depending on a random bootstrapped sample the lope bt binary trees algorithm that used a division of the observation over bootstrapping framework random selections of the training data are chosen from the early dataset and executed to generate the model data that is not incorporated is subscribed as from bag catani et al 2013 the rf envisioned the value of components by seeming to allow the degree of inconsistency of projections resulting from bag data for the components while others have gone predictable liaw and wiener 2002 to be updated with the number of trees random

and avoidance of consistent marin et al 2020 vapnik et al 1995 two ideas on statistically mediated issues used through svm modelling fig 6b the said svm modelling classes were described in the following section singh et al 2018 yilmaz 2010 regard as a set of linear separate training vectors x i i 1 2 n training vectors have two classes i e y i 1 the primary aim of the svm is to look for an n dimensional hyperplane which differentiate two classes by using maximum gap this can be expressed as 9 1 2 w 2 the following constraints of subject is 10 y i w x i b 1 where w represents the hyperplane b represent scalar base represent the scalar product the cost function of svm can be defined by using lagrangian multiplier such as 11 l 1 2 w 2 i 1 n λi y i w x i b 1 where λi represent lagrangian multiplier in the case of non separable function the constraints can be modified by introducing slack variables 12 y i w x i b 1 ζ i and finally the equation becomes as follow 13 l 1 2 w 2 1 vn i 1 n ζ i where v 0 1 is generated in order to account for misclassification hastie et al 2009 in addition to this kernel function k x i x j was introduced by vapnik in the year of 1995 to explanation for non linear decision boundary 2 7 3 support vector regression svr is an agreed machine learning supervised algorithm for optimal regression problems to maximize the definite margin of the training data sets employed fig 6a su et al 2018 the svr approach widely considered in the nonlinear problem solving method was introduced by vapnik in the year 2000 göbel and göbel 2009 an modification of a new advanced ml approach based on the classification of supporting vector machines is the svr algorithm hence said model has been used in present study lu et al 2009 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2017 in structured data types the use of svr is also true as this regression provides several curved margins kalantar et al 2018 the svr measurement is therefore essential and is carried out by adopting the equations 14 y k z v z c where input data represent through z z 1 z 2 z n and the resultant value represent by y b r l in addition to this v r l indicates the weight factor

vulnerability due to elevated level of geogenic arsenic a variety of validated and analyzed machine learning algorithm models were performed through a number of statistical analyses islam et al 2022

literatures related to this field different topographic hydrological geological and environmental parameter has a prominent function on occurrences and distribution of groundwater resources arulbalaji et al 2019 pal et al 2022 there are five geomorphological features i e water bodies pediment pediplain complex deltaic plain alluvial plain and flood plain has been confirmed in this region fig 2g the topographical parameters i e elevation of this region are ranges from 16 to 68 m and slope of this region are ranges into 0 31 68 respectively fig 2a whereas most of the high slope is associated along the river bank and its surrounding areas fig 2b geological constituents of an area are a major causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability aquifers structural properties demonstrate resistance to pollutants moving from the surface to the water table zhang et al 2020 nyer 1992 the geological unit like fluvial sediment and rajmahal trap are found in the study area whereas fluvial sediment made up of late pleistocene to late holocene aged sand silt and hard clays rock domains fig 2h the lithological constituents of pleistocene aged sediments are semi consolidated deltaic alluvium ferruginous concretion lithomarge clay gravels pebbles cobbles mishra et al 2022 on the other hand the rajmahal trap lithological formation belongs to jurassic to late holocene aged rajmahal basalt sand silt fine soft and hard clays with caliche nodules chatterjee et al 2020 lineament is considered as an important aspect for the occurrences and storage of water resources in this perspective the distance from lineament is considered as a causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability assessment goyal et al 2021 saunders et al 2016 the ranges of distance from lineament for this region are between 0 and 26 123 73 m fig 2f the occurrences of stream network are favourable for storage of groundwater resources in more optimal way in this perspective the distance from stream is considered as an important determining element for groundwater vulnerability assessment voutchkova et al 2021 the amount of distance from stream of this region are ranges from 0 to 17 489 76 m fig 2c the causal relationship between recharge rate and drainage density significantly leads the mobility of geogenic contaminants aggregating from surface water runoff and subsequent infiltration thus the drainage density can also be a causal parameter of groundwater vulnerability dong et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 the amount of drainage density of this region are ranges from 0 00 to 0 81 m fig 2d groundwater is carried in unconfined circumstances by fractured and eroded rocks and rainfall is the primary cause of water recharge hence the annual rainfall is a causal factor of groundwater vulnerability bagherzadeh et al 2018 polya et al 2019 the average rainfall of the region lies between 1320 and 1380 mm fig 2e the state of groundwater is determined by a combination of physical biological and chemical characteristics that are impacted by both natural and anthropogenic sources so land use and land cover are the causal parameter to assess groundwater vulnerability das et al 2020 stevenazzi et al 2017 various land use and land cover features like deciduous forest agricultural land built up land shrubland fallow land waste land water bodies plantations grassland and permanent wetlands are associated in this region which have a dissimilar function on groundwater resources fig 2i 3 2 physicochemical analysis of vulnerability 3 2 1 general physicochemical analysis the physicochemical attributes of the groundwater of murshidabad district are depicted in table 4 result revealed that the ph of the collected samples ranges from neutral to moderate alkaline in both pre and post monsoon season where mean ph level of groundwater is 3 5 higher in the post monsoon compare to pre monsoon season the oxidation reduction potential orp electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solid tds are also important factors of arsenic enrichment and mobility in groundwater results revealed that in pre monsoon the nature of water is more oxic than post monsoon season the increasing of orp in the post monsoon season is perhaps due to the higher rain fall and subsequent higher solubility with lower saturation time mcgrory et al 2020 the mean decreasing of two fold for the tds ec and hardness in post monsoon season also highlights the monsoonal precipitation and less rock water interaction huang et al 2022 however mean dissolve oxygen and salinity level in water samples is decreased in post monsoon about 16 and 45 respectively the decreasing trend of these parameters also suggests the enrichment of precipitation and leaching to water table in post monsoon than pre monsoon huang et al 2022 nevertheless the mean temperature value of the post monsoonal groundwater sample depicts almost 35 increased comparing pre monsoon season 3 2 2 cation anion analysis the availability of ionic species in groundwater and subsequent variation in quantity is predominantly controlled by the hydro geochemistry of the aquifer material alam et al 2015 planer friedrich et al 2012 in present study the cationic appearance in groundwater of murshidabad district showed diverse result in both pre and post monsoon seasons where the mean value of sodium and calcium is twofold increased along with 20 and 5 increase of potassium and magnesium found in post monsoon respectively whereas lithium and ammonium mean value depicts 1 fold and 5 decrease in post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon season table 4 the increase and decreasing of cations are may be the result of mix up consequences of agricultural runoff and presence of anaerobic bacteria in the aquifer constituents mishra et al 2022 liao et al 2011 on the other hand anionic load in the groundwater of the observed samples revealed that only mean bicarbonate concentration is 10 increase in post monsoon season than pre monsoon season whereas the concentration of other anions such as fluoride chloride sulphate phosphate and nitrate showed decreasing pattern as 10 fold 2 fold 6 2 fold and 22 fold respectively table 4 the upsurge and down surge of the anions are due to the consequences of precipitation and pyrite oxidation mcgrory et al 2020 mishra et al 2022 3 2 3 heavy metal analysis groundwater samples have been collected from the depth range 24 38 106 68 m for the both of pre monsoon and post monsoon season where 36 samples lie in below 30 m 58 samples from below 60 m and 6 samples are from below 106 68 m previous study report highlighted that the groundwater arsenic load is significantly varied corresponding to aquifer depth chowdhury and paul 2019 kulkarni et al 2018 present study results also revealed that the arsenic concentration varies from 0 10 to 0 30 mg l and 0 06 0 30 mg l during pre and post monsoon depth 30 m 0 08 0 51 mg l and 0 06 0 43 mg l during pre and post monsoon depth 60 m 0 09 0 30 mg l during pre and post monsoon 106 68 m respectively moreover mean arsenic concentration is almost two fold increase in post monsoon in comparison to pre monsoon it can also concern that the mean concentration of fe and mn were also 20 and 30 higher in post monsoon season in accordance with pre monsoon season respectively whereas mean concentration cd and se does not exhibit such seasonal incremental or decremental variation in groundwater for both of pre and post monsoon season table 4 3 3 multi collinearity assessment the multi collinearity of the all selected variables were performed with the help of vif and tol from this analysis it is indicated that all the variables are free from the multi collinearity pal et al 2022 all the parameters in both of the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon are selected with considering the vif and tol limit 3 4 geochemical processes ionic controlling mechanism and arsenic mobilization in present study the hydrogeochemical causal relationship and their controlling mechanism were measured in both of pre and post monsoon seasons by using tds and ratios of na k na k ca2 or cl cl hco3 respectively as shown in the gibbs diagram in fig 3 a d fig 3 highlighted the dominancy of rock cation and anion in the studied samples this is attributed as the primary source of felsic rocks into the lesser himalayan formations shinjo et al 2020 the amount of various dissolved ions in groundwater depends on their presence in the bedrock and on their rate of dissolution herein mg2 na and ca2 na weathering processes are demonstrated fig 3e leading to evaporate dissolution and silicate weathering where silicate weathering predominates singh et al 2022 similarly in pre monsoon 99 98 of sample silicate weathering ratio of geogenic ca2 na against the plot of hco3 na fig 3f increased to a maximum of 4 67 8 33 in silicate mineral interactions during monsoon on the other hand ca2 mg2 shows lower ratio than hco3 na due to carbonate precipitation with other anions however bi carbonate increased possibly due to dolomite dissolution kumar et al 2022 the dissolution of dolomite and calcite can be explained by the molar ratio of ca2 mg2 dolomite will dissolve if the ca2 mg2 molar ratio is equal to 1 while calcite will dissolve if molar ratio belongs 1 2 and silicate minerals will dissolve if molar ratio is above 2 fig 3 g demonstrates that under the presumptive scenario of dolomite dominance and silicate dissolving minerals 1 1 or 1 2 moreover in present study the majority of the groundwater samples in both of pre and post monsoon seasons belongs in the molar ratio of 1 2 while 4 5 of the samples depicts calcite dissolution das et al 2020 22 cac o 3 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 2 hc o 3 calcite dissolution 23 camg c o 3 2 2 h 2 c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 4 hc o 3 dolomite dissolution whereas ca2 mg2 vs total cations tc exhibited that all samples were below the 1 1 equiline fig 3 h which emphasizes the silicate weathering process carbonic acid induced silicate weathering prevails the said ions presence in groundwater then again the scatter plot of na k vs tc fig 4a revealed the majority of samples lies below and or closer to the 1 1 equiline with linear trends of 0 91 and 0 94 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon respectively the said phenomena illustrate the dominance of na and k ions in groundwater which are further increased by the weathering of silicates analogously when the ratio of ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 is 1 the ion exchange mechanism dominates during recharging which is implied as 1 4 relationship fig 4b where possible constituent of minerals comprises with anhydrite or gypsum dissolution interferences kumar et al 2022 24 caso 4 2 h 2 o ca 2 so 4 2 2 h 2 o according to this viewpoint the presence of cations and anions causes ionic species to compete with one another supported by adsorption or ion exchange with cations alkaline earth metals and anions singh et al 2020 thus the plot of as and hco3 in fig 4 c d suggests the fundamental mechanism ion exchange for as mobilization during recharging comes from a variety of sources for mineral dissolution reductive dissolution associated with various minerals precipitation of carbonate in both pre and post monsoon seasons singh et al 2022 the aquifer s redox conditions determines the ease of minerals phases along with as mobilization chakraborty et al 2015 from the pourbaix diagram fig 4 e f it is observed that the oxidizing conditions is due to arsenate species which are prevalently support as oxy anions as v arsenate and as iii arsenite both of which are present in the ph range of 5 9 the stability patterns of both arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 and arsenite h3aso3 have shown their presence in the studied groundwater samples in post monsoon arsenite oxidizes and forms arsenate haso4 2 farooq et al 2011 kumar et al 2022 again arsenic that has been adsorbed on specific regions surfaces of the minerals used to release during the reductive dissolution of iron oxides singh et al 2020 since pyrites and iron oxides are significant arsenic sinks the formation of these minerals can subordinate groundwater arsenic concentrations the most significant geochemical triggers for the desorption of as from fe and or mn oxyhydroxide phases in sedimentary plain aquifers that are thought to be strongly redox conditions feng et al 2023 according to fig 4 g h the distribution of fe and availability of mn compared to as in both pre and post monsoon seasons are depicted which are demonstrated in fig s8 c d yet other than fe oxyhydroxides important sources of as also includes fe sulphide minerals like pyrite fes2 and arsenopyrite feass whereby oxidation can leads to a high as content in groundwater as stated neil et al 2014 in eq 25 and 26 25 feass s h 2 o o 2 aq f e 2 aq h 3 as o 3 aq s o 4 2 aq 26 fe a s s 2 s n o 3 aq h 2 o h aq f e 2 aq has o 4 2 aq s o 4 2 aq n h 4 aq 3 5 lithological assessment of arsenic transport groundwater flow regime the entire district of murshidabad is covered by unconsolidated sediments of late pleistocene and holocene times whereas a cluster of locations have sandy and silty clay as the dominant lithology to form the rajmahal trap it has been reported that aquifers mineral leads contamination and have the potentialities in controlling geochemical mobility nath et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 present 3d lithological study has been illustrated in fig 5 a whereas aquifer i phreatic encountered at 30 40 m below ground level mbgl persisting the younger alluvium which leads the arsenic contamination sporadically those shallow aquifers closer to the ganga river basin are easily recharged with river water and increases the as contamination das et al 2020 singh et al 2022 at its core the intermediates layer of clay i and ii where the contaminants are percolated the mobility of contaminant are restricted for discharging or adsorption by said clay layers basically the dominating clay sediments are overlapped with each other considering to holocene flood plains thus arsenic present in pocket form on the other hand clay iii and iv boundaries of aquifer 2 vulnerable to as contamination due to the increase in permeability in aquifer ii intermediate it has been observed that water level barrier extended to 100 m in depth presenting all block of murshidabad district thus the areas of farakka samserganj suti i suti ii raghunathganj i sagardighi nabagram khargram and kandi observed water level fluctuation water level fluctuations during pre and post monsoon water were 1 97 m and 1 10 m respectively hence recharging could enhance 0 87 m under rainy season in aquifer 2 the clay v and vi are the lenticular clay beds originated from old alluvial sediments persisting the slow recharging owing to less permeability and high adsorption thus the contaminant decreases in aquifer iii sathe et al 2018 sathe and mahanta 2019 therefore the groundwater of aquifer iii deeper is significantly safe of elevated arsenic due to its non iniquitousness and low permeability index sathe et al 2018 sathe and mahanta 2019 nevertheless higher level of as contamination spot values observed in groundwater from holocene aquifers rather than oxidized pleistocene aquifers in murshidabad district thus the bagri region found lower availability of geogenic as sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the boundary condition in the two dimensional linear numerical modflow model for groundwater simulation is head dependent flux in these instances groundwater flow regimes have been modelled using riv river and surface water flow routing awfr fig s11 for riv s boundary condition the output water stage has been simulated using the modflow equation the groundwater gw head specifies the boundary conditions on the north and south boundaries of the model grid the gw head fits the north east to south west limit between 56 24 m to 155 5 m above sea level the river ganga in mushidabad is truncated by the model s eastern and northern boundaries the river s edge can be depicted in two different ways first assuming that water does not flow laterally under the river by isolating the side of the model below the two rivers with a vertical flow barrier the second step is to place a prescribed head along the river until it reaches the model s base allowing groundwater to enter or exit the model below the rivers das et al 2020 when groundwater is vertically recharged during the monsoon season or through the deposition of river sediments surface water flow routing awfr is typically imposed which easily transports as by redox mobilization sikdar and chakraborty 2017 takai et al 2022 these flow channels frequently deposit as minerals while transporting groundwater that is rich in as and other chalcophile elements furtherly the as transporting fluid interacts with a reactive aquifer matrix or a fluid with a different hydrochemical make up deposition may be encouraged sathe and mahanta 2019 these fluid flow systems are most prevalent in tectonically active zones where a delicate equilibrium of hydrostatic lithostatic and geodynamic gradients supports the metamorphic fluid fluxes the re mobilization and dissolution of already precipitated arsenian minerals may result in enhanced dissolved as concentrations in many of these aquifers that host as bearing fluid flow which might then be used as groundwater sources mukherjee et al 2014 the isolines from the riv module simulation were displayed in fig s11 the three distinct boundary conditions in mudflow are head dependent fluxes specified heads and specified fluxes sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the head is fixed at defined head limits in order to maintain the desired head the fluid is simulated as entering or exiting the groundwater at a rate that is appropriate aghlmand and abbasi 2019 the flow transits into eastern region raghunathganj lalgola to south western region nabipur sagarpara jalangi madhubona of murshidabad district as horizontal dispersion the model explanation for the observed and predicted head using mean error me mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse provided in table s3 due to a residual error of 0 001 with me is identical to zero thus the results demonstrate high precision again the aforesaid result may also support the impression of groundwater flow regime of the study area that the truly heterogeneous anisotropic porous medium in this region is simulated as a homogeneous anisotropic porous medium sikdar and chakraborty 2017 on the other hand newer alluvial and older alluvial both can be more sensitive to face as contamination due to as mobility in presence of organic matter 10 20 and higher humification index in the study area zahid et al 2015 this phenomenon followed the plume in as contamination channel the plume direction was applied through the hydraulic head which has been shown in fig 5 b and results showed approximately 80 of as enriched of 0 5 mg l finally the model flow paths for discharging particles have been estimated by modepath in fig 5 c where the water table follows the general topology according to the terminal report of cgwb govt of india 2017 2018 furtherly fig 5 c showed the x axis as western and y southern of the utm projection with z as the elevation mbgl general results shows the higher transmissivity observed in southern region 1378 33 m2 day and additionally observed that the transmissivity is inversely proportional to the elevation in this region furthermore the contour plot observed hydraulic conductivity which has been measured by hydraulic head depicted in fig s10 a results revealed that 92 37 of conductivity goes to 0 08 0 115 m day and the higher flow is observed in gopgram and salar region due to new alluvial sediments of the ganges basin in accordance with flooding on the other way in pest model calibration the initial parameters such as hydraulic conductivity recharge observation of yield are attributed in the sensitive analysis which depicts the response of aquifer system as recharging and discharging condition table 4 mcarthur et al 2008 the results showed that observation heads versus calculated heads in fig s10 b both are closer and the model is significant r2 0 9611 herein training datasets carried with aquifer 1 aquifer 2 and aquifer 3 with the vertical distribution and it is showing specific yield in aquifer 1 due to new alluvial made of sand and clay thus lucidly increased the permeability 3 6 groundwater vulnerability assessment trough predictive model the groundwater vulnerability has been estimated with the help of different machine learning approaches i e svr rf and svm table 2 the spatial coverage of very low low moderate high and very high groundwater vulnerability zones in svr model are 20 25 20 70 30 55 22 33 and 6 17 respectively in rf model are 18 68 38 06 29 97 7 43 and 5 86 respectively and in svm model are 20 25 20 70 19 28 19 53 and 20 24 respectively 3 7 validation of model the validation of the all predictive models have been done with the help of auc and roc and different statistical indices fig 7 a b islam et al 2022 das et al 2020 in accordance with the training datasets the results of auc of svr rf and svm are 0 923 0 901 and 0 897 respectively the values of auc with considering the validation datasets of svr rf and svm are 0 910 0 899 and 0 891 respectively here the svr is the best model in terms of predictive ability and robustness of the classifier roy et al 2020 in svr model the values of sensitivity specificity npv and ppv with considering the training datasets are 0 83 0 87 0 80 and 0 90 respectively the values of sensitivity specificity npv and ppv in svr model with considering validation datasets are 0 76 0 86 0 86 and 0 90 respectively table 1 4 discussion for anthropogenic needs and economic growth groundwater is the much needed natural resource rahman et al 2021 again the underlying bedrock of the basin has a significant impact on regulating the geochemistry of the groundwater groundwater genesis is also significantly influenced by groundwater residence time in the aquifer and interactions between water and the sediment in the aquifer khan et al 2023 verma et al 2016 the presence of highly weatherable rock causes a considerable shift in the concentration of dissolved ions such na mg2 and ca2 making it a crucial component of the weathering process chakraborty et al 2015 khan et al 2023 the relative contributions of various weathering mechanisms including silicate carbonate weathering and evaporate dissolution were seen as the contribution of normalized molar ratio of na ions ca2 na mg2 na and hco3 na chakraborty et al 2022 kumar et al 2010 adhering to present study results physicochemical parameters like ph shows neutral to alkaline nature in groundwater dey et al 2016 due the presence of different cationic species followed by the redox nature caused by rock water interaction chowdhury and paul 2019 singh et al 2022 earlier studies also highlighted that both the arsenic iii and v co exist in the ph range of 6 to 9 in both oxidized and unoxidized aquifer in the form of h2aso2 and haso2 2 respectively bhowmick et al 2018 adhering to the monsoonal precipitation rainwater leached into the aquifer leads the significant increase of the tds ec and hardness levels in post monsoon season chatterjee et al 2013 samadder et al 2014 similarly salinity level significantly decreased at the same time because of the monsoonal recharge of groundwater kulkarni et al 2018 majumder et al 2016 the marginal decrease of dissolve oxygen in the post monsoonal season emphasized the role of microbial activity on sedimental organic matter anning et al 2012 dey et al 2016 however the increased groundwater temperature in pre monsoon season may be due to the higher solar radiation and subsequent clear atmospheric condition bretzler et al 2019 pre monsoonal decrease of cations in groundwater depicts the consequences of lower oxygen availability presence of anaerobic microbes and low permeability of aquifer sediments mohammed aslam and rizvi 2020 whereas increased level of cations in post monsoon may be due to the runoff from surface water and contamination from agricultural field amwele et al 2021 the anionic constituents in post monsoon were decreased significantly likewise pre monsoon however variation of bicarbonate level is the exception ayotte et al 2017 borah et al 2018 the said increase of bicarbonate in groundwater is due to the oxidation of pyrites which subsequently released bicarbonate ion from sediments ghosh et al 2020 mohammed aslam and rizvi 2020 on the other hand significant increase of nitrate concentration in pre monsoon season is may be due to activity of nitrifying bacteria pedretti et al 2019 as a whole inorganic fertilizers waste disposal spread to the land and sediment sinks are a few of sources where nitrates can come in groundwater although the cation and anion balance also play a significant part in the production of nitrate additionally nitrifying bacteria in soil or sediment are other aspects that convert different types of nitrogen into nitrate which also leached through the subsurface layers with the rain water chakraborty et al 2015 vaiphei and kurakalva 2021 considering the major finding of the study it is highlighted that the majority of the groundwater samples were contaminated with higher level of as this association of as in the groundwater is dominated by redox dependent phenomenon fig s12 a b strongly suggested that mobilization of as in the groundwater depends on redox dependent manner traditionally organic matter decomposition in subterranean sediments played a significant role in the development of anoxic conditions in the alluvial aquifer chakraborty et al 2022 singh et al 2022 however the assumption of a number of anthropogenic activities such as the use of agricultural fertilizers and the disposal of household waste that take place in the study area may be attributed the favourable attainment of biogeochemical conditions that can result in the release of as from fe mn oxyhydroxides thus the output of the studied aquifer s redox conditions was primarily oxidizing however the upshots of as concentrations were found while the aquifer environment turns into reducing nature the research area s lulc map fig 2i which appears a significant portion of the area is classified as agricultural land proved the presence of widespread anthropogenic activity in the region chakraborty et al 2022 moreover in few region residential waste is directly discharges into the surface water singh et al 2020 on a regional scale the genesis of high as loaded groundwater is result of the interaction of two key components first the potential geochemical trigger that could release as from the aquifer s mineral phases into the groundwater and secondly the as that has been released must remain in the groundwater and not be washed away herath et al 2016 khan et al 2023 according to reports younger sediments were often unoxidized and had higher amounts of naturally occurring organic carbon and as containing fe or mn oxyhydroxides this impact subsided with increasing burial age as this context the palaeo weathering to support the enrichment of as associated with different minerals in underneath pleistocene aquifer bonsor et al 2017 khan et al 2023 however other factors such as subsurface lithology iron oxide content dissolved organic matter in sediments regional topography existence or disappearance of confined aquifers prevailing redox conditions in aquifers and extent of groundwater flushing could be the significant contributors towards enrichments of as shaji et al 2020 literatures also highlighted that the aquifer s redox condition is a key geochemical factor towards distribution of as in the gangetic basin chakraborty et al 2015 shaji et al 2020 where the upper and middle gangetic plain s redox environment was generally reported to be regionally varied with mild to high oxidizing aquifer conditions due to restricted recharge of hydrostratigraphic heterogeneity mukherjee et al 2007 singh et al 2020 however the aquifers of the lower gangetic plain were initially depleted with as favoring the conversion of ferric iron to ferrous iron and as a result some highly contaminated groundwater has been identified to be present there in lithology mudflows are generally predicated on aquifer 1 2 and 3 usually in some areas with weakening of as contamination due to recharging and aquifer deposition minerals banerji et al 2019 kazmierczak et al 2022 previous research enlightened that the main water budget of murshidabad district is dominated by river and monsoon water where as mineral reach fluvial sediment is primarily responsible for as mobility deposited by flood or an aggregation of precipitation das 2020 farooq et al 2011 thus shallow groundwater has greater quantities of arsenic than deep aquifers majumder et al 2016 and zhang et al 2020 furthermore as and when a suitable geochemical sink is not immediately accessible the mobilized as remains in the groundwater at its core the reductive dissolution of metal oxides and hydroxides seen in the unconsolidated sediments of the bengal basin mobilizes through rain water percolation however literature also highlighted that the as mineral mobilization is also caused by other processes including pyrite oxidation redox cycling in surface soils and competitive ion exchange ziegler et al 2017 several of these processes may work together to mobilize as at the same time which significantly triggered by complicated redox fluxes in the bengal basin aquifers chakraborty et al 2015 furthermore significant positive correlation p 0 99 of manganese and iron with arsenic were found due to the catalytic activity of colloidal aggregates on monsoonal recharge water and subsequent mobilization in aquifer planer friedrich et al 2012 ghosh et al 2020 as a sum up present study output portrays that as contamination plume is significantly triggered by flood enriched sediments of gangetic floodplain i e the new alluvium holocene in essence significant amounts of as are carried in the said sediment that are deposited and transported through groundwater principally in recharging areas chakraborty et al 2015 huang et al 2022 however the minimal increase and decrease of cadmium and selenium in both pre and post monsoon may be due to the contamination with diverse agricultural runoff ghosh and rolee 2011 borah et al 2018 as a whole the highly populated regions in various parts of the world were facing scarcity of the geogenic contaminants elevated vulnerability of groundwater resources fuoco et al 2022 where robustness of most appropriate classifier is the significant determining element in probability modelling adhere to data scare region richards et al 2019 das et al 2020 in this perspective focus of the present study on the prediction of geogenic as vulnerable regions in the gangetic plain by both of ml approaches and lithological as transport approaches to get suitable output marin et al 2020 huq et al 2020 considering the present study applied ml models svr rf and svm output auc value and different statistical indices the svr is the most optimal model then rf and svm the auc value of svr model for the training and validation datasets are 0 923 and 0 910 according to present study results it has been predicted through svr model that some portions of these blocks i e jalangli raninagrar ii bhagawangola i bhagawangola ii beldanga i and ii bharatpur i and ii suti i and suti ii are associated with higher vulnerabilities and rest of the blocks are associated with moderate to low vulnerability of elevated arsenic level in groundwater previous literature highlights that main causes of increased vulnerability in the bengal basin aquifers resulted from the stratified flow systems and stand with interleaved discontinuous clay layers sathe and mahanta 2019 here pleistocene aquifers are little imposed of as contamination due to deep aquifer intervention holocene aquifers are further weakened by burial ages of aquifers younger than 2 9 ka von brömssen et al 2014 principally iron hydroxide and detrital sulfide minerals such as pyrite which binds solid phase arsenic in sediments in pleistocene aquifer chakraborty et al 2015 rahman et al 2022 thus in the bengal basin aquifers iron iii hydroxide harbors mostly as additionally pleistocene sediments have enriched with iron oxide that has a strong potential to adsorb as and reduce arsenic concentrations however holocene aquifers have higher sorption capacity and lower iron oxides than pleistocene ones which may cause the release of as into groundwater bhowmick et al 2018 similar results were found in modpath as transport model also aggregately the outputs of modpath hydraulic conductivity and pest sensitivity analysis revealed that ganga river basin sediment composition sand and clay in newer alluvium leads to higher permeability sikdar and chakraborty 2017 takai et al 2022 the advective dispersive reactive transport mechanism of as in modpath highlights higher transmissivity in southern region and moderate in northern region comparing to other parts of murshidabad district finally the pest sensitivity analysis validated that the observation heads and calculated heads are significantly closer thus the north eastern and the south western parts of the present study area faces higher as vulnerability in groundwater sikdar and chakraborty 2017 the said results also support the outputs of ml models predicted vulnerable regions this type of information may be helpful to the liaising authority to the respective field for adopting the most appropriate sustainable measures to deal with present scenario of murshidabad district 5 conclusion the identification of vulnerable regions and subsequent contaminant hydrogeology is a sensitive issue in most of the regions of the world while groundwater vulnerability due to geogenic contaminants is highly needed for adopting the suitable measures in regard with the vulnerability of water resource due to uncertainty of the climatic condition and its associated parameters the actual estimation of geogenic arsenic as concentration is very crucial issues in terms of predictive capacities all over the world in this perspective different machine learning approaches i e svr rf and svm have been considered in present study for assessing the as vulnerability in groundwater of murshidabad district the results of the current study showed that the best optimal capacity was achieved from svr model moreover model outcomes also predicted that both eastern and western parts of the murshidabad district are more as vulnerable areas again from lithological study it has been observed that the major source of as contamination in the sediments is mainly aggregates from the alluvial plain during groundwater recharging and the concentration of arsenic nearly increased to twofold in post monsoon season moreover geochemical parameter which primarily influencing the as distribution is the gangetic basin which considered as the aquifer redox state again the redox environment of the lower gangetic plain is recognized to be locally diverse where as variability depending on the oxidizing level in the water while with increasing burial age this effect becomes diminished younger sediments can be oxidized and comprised with more organic carbon leads the mobilization of as along with mn bearing fe oxyhydroxides present results also revealed that the average concentrations of fe and mn were 20 and 30 higher in the post monsoon season compared to the pre monsoon season however the mean concentration of cd and se does not show any significant seasonal variability on the other hand among the various anions only bicarbonate showed 10 increment in post monsoon season over pre monsoon again rainwater percolation leads the decreasing of tds ec and hardness in post monsoon season the outcomes of the mudflow hydraulic conductivity and lithological parameters observed in murshidabad district concluded that the northeastern part and southwestern part is major vulnerable in aquifer 1 made up of holocene aged sediments due to higher water conductivity 61 76 m day which can deposit arsenic minerals comparatively the contamination area in the aquifer 2 also depicts the holocene age sediments and transmission of as possesses through river channels of ganga floodplain contrastingly aquifer 3 demarks pleistocene age aquifer which can accumulate low levels of as comparing to holocene aged in india most of the management strategies regarding the groundwater resources are carried out by the administrative units so this type of outcome can be helpful for the regional planner to take the appropriate remedies for the present study region of west bengal india the aggregative methodologies i e geomorphological hydrogeochemical gis ml models and contamination pathway analysis of the present study may be helpful for the future researchers to select the optimal framework on groundwater research author

a temperature of 4 c and pressure of 50 bar for 7 cycles was used for observing the cells immobilized on the support particles and recording with a feg nova nanosem 230 scanning electron microscope fei europe eindhoven the netherlands 2 5 in depth study of the influence of growth conditions on the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate the biodegradation experiments under aerobic conditions were done in 100 ml of mm sterile solutions the ph was maintained at 7 0 and the sterile bottles were closed with air permeable cotton 2 5 1 initial concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate optimization different concentrations of clopidogrel bisulfate between 5 mg l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 as the sole carbon source were prepared to study the effect of clopidogrel bisulfate high concentrations in mixed cultures media inoculated with the two bacterial strains the bottles were then placed in a heidolph unimax 2010 incubator shaker schwabach germany at 30 c and a shaking rate of 150 rpm for 96 h the initial optimal concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate 100 mg l 1 was selected for all the rest of the experiments by its better elimination level of clopidogrel bisulfate in mixed culture media 2 5 2 ph and temperature optimization the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by the two bacterial strains was improved by examining the effect of initial ph on the culture media and incubation temperature biodegradation tests were carried out at various initial ph values 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 and a fixed temperature of 30 c similarly the influence of the incubation temperature on the use of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed bacterial culture was also studied with incubation at temperatures of 20 30 and 40 c to 100 mg l 1 of initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration and ph of 7 0 samples were collected regularly to monitor the bacterial growth and the elimination rate of clopidogrel bisulfate the optimal ph and incubation temperature were recorded by the maximum optical density value of the bacterial strains measured at 600 nm on a jasco uv vis spectrophotometer v 630 pfungstadt germany 2 5 3 effects of carbon and nitrogen sources concentrations on biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate the aerobic conditions determined at an initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration of 100 mg l 1 ph 7 0 and 30 c were applied to the study of the effect of the concentration of the carbon and nitrogen source on biodegradation in the mixed culture media the experiments were carried out at different concentrations of glucose 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l 1 saccharose 0 0 0 1 0 2

analysis of clopidogrel bisulfate in biodegradation tests the samples of clopidogrel bisulfate in the culture media were taken at regular intervals under sterile conditions in order to eliminate cell debris a microfiltration 0 45 μm was performed hplc analyzes were done on a varian prostar hplc system ontario canada equipped with a varian 230 prostar solvent delivery module a varian 410 prostar

control and data acquisition and processing 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of bacterial strains two strains were isolated from industrial effluents of el harrach algeria and stored on lb agar solid media at 4 c the morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial isolates were determined table 1 the 16s rrna sequences were obtained and compared using blast search to find nearly identical sequences for the 16s rrna sequences determined the two bacterial strains isolated in this work 1m and 5m were identified with the primer pair 27f and 1488r of the 16s rrna gen the sequences were compared with the more similar sequence of the gen bank database resulting in 95 similarity to pseudomonas aeruginosa strain gen bank accession no kt444586 1 and 95 to pseudomonas putida strain gen bank accession no kx817236 1 for 1m and 5m strains respectively the electron micrographs revealing the morphology and surface characteristics of the cells were recorded in a scanning electron microscope fig 1 3 2 toxicity level of clopidogrel bisulfate to the bacterial isolates to study the level of toxicity of clopidogrel bisulfate to the isolated strains in mixed culture media an increase in clopidogrel bisulfate concentration over a range of 5 25 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 in the biodegradation tests at ph 7 0 and temperature of 30 c was carried out on the one hand the results showed that the biodegradation rate of clopidogrel bisulfate as sole carbon source in the mixed bacterial cultures was relatively low for a significant initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration such as those within the range from 200 mg l 1 up to 1500 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 on the other hand biodegradation rates were high at low concentrations 5 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate fig 2 that indicates that the inhibition of bacterial growth of the mixed cultures by clopidogrel bisulfate is significant from approximately 200 mg l 1 the study of the effect of the initial concentration of organic pollutants on biodegradation rate and bacterial growth in pure and mixed cultures has been reported in several previous works chung et al 2003 dastager et al 2009 christen et al 2012 bera et al 2017 bera et al 2017 showed that phenol presented a relatively high inhibitory effect on a mixed culture of stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila brevibacterium sp and brucella sp above 400 mg l 1 the bacterial growth of the two mixed strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m was better at 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate showing a high elimination rate this was the reason why this initial concentration was selected for all subsequent biodegradation experiments 3 3 effect of ph and temperature on clopidogrel bisulfate biodegradation the effect of ph on the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate was also studied at fixed temperature of 30 c and a clopidogrel bisulfate concentration of 100 mg l 1 the biodegradation plot shown in fig 3 indicates that the bacterial consortium consisting of p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m slightly used clopidogrel bisulfate 31 52 at ph 6 0 increasing the rate to 53 06 at ph 6 5 a remarkable increase in the rate of biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate was observed over the ph range of 7 0 8 5 with 75 23 of elimination rate at ph 7 0 followed by 92 42 of biodegradation at ph 7 5 not only but again degradation of 98 16 and 99 08 was noted at ph 8 0 and 8 5 respectively fig 3 proving that these two bacterial strains showed an alkalophilic nature as previously described bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 at more basic ph exceeding 8 5 a decrease in the biodegradation rate was noted the influence of temperature has been studied in order to review the literature data which show that the strains of the genus pseudomonas have optimal bacterial growth at 30 c guangyu et al 2013 bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 ashis et al 2017 at this temperature the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate at ph 7 0 was maximal with a removal rate of 75 23 and decreased at 40 c 50 82 fig 4 however fig 4 shows that the rate of biodegradation clearly decreased to 41 under the same growth conditions except for the temperature which was lowered to 20 c the optimal growth temperature of strains of the genus pseudomonas has already been studied in several previous works and estimated at 30 37 c guangyu et al 2013 bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 ashis et al 2017 the results obtained in the present work agree with the literature and confirm well that the bacterial strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m are effective in the biodegradation reactions at an optimum growth temperature of 30 c 3 4 effect of supplemental carbon and nitrogen source concentrations on clopidogrel bisulfate biodegradation the biodegradation tests of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed culture were carried out as a function of the variation in the concentration of glucose and saccharose the results obtained are shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively these figures show that clopidogrel bisulfate was almost entirely used by bacteria when the concentration of glucose or saccharose increased 4 g l 1 indeed elimination of 96 13 and 97 98 of clopidogrel bisulfate was noted at the concentration of 4 g l 1 of glucose and saccharose respectively also high biodegradation rates were observed 94 23 84 36 and 80 for glucose concentrations of 3 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively similarly eliminations of 91 90 2 and 89 95 were performed for saccharose concentrations of 3 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively however a decrease in the rate of biodegradation was recorded in the absence of glucose and saccharose 75 23 elimination a very influential factor on the biodegradation of organic pollutants by microorganisms which consists in enriching the culture media with a nitrogen source has been studied previously in numerous research abboud et al 2007 lin et al 2013 in order to improve the efficiency of the microorganisms in the biodegradation processes of organic molecules the work carried out by these researchers showed that the enrichment of the culture media with optimal concentrations of nitrogen sources has effectively increased the rate of elimination of certain organic pollutants the biodegradation rates of clopidogrel bisulfate in mixed culture media recorded at different concentrations of the nitrogen source nh4no3 are shown in fig 6 the total absence of ammonium nitrate in the culture media disadvantaged the biodegradation processes of clopidogrel bisulfate 24 88 of degradation nevertheless a progressive increase in the rate of biodegradation was observed when the concentration of ammonium nitrate increases in the culture media an optimal concentration of ammonium nitrate 2 g l 1 allowed to reach the maximum biodegradation rate of clopidogrel bisulfate was taken for all biodegradation tests 3 5 biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate at a laboratory scale and kinetic study the bacterial growth of p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m strains in mixed culture enriched with clopidogrel bisulfate as the sole carbon source at ph 7 0 30 c and aerobic shaking 150 rpm was sufficient to remove most of the clopidogrel bisulfate the hplc chromatograms fig 8 indicate the decrease of the peak relative to the clopidogrel bisulfate after the biodegradation processes are carried out furthermore fig 7 shows the experimental and fitted biodegradation curves of clopidogrel bisulfate at different concentrations thus 84 36 79 65 and 75 23 of degradation were obtained respectively for concentrations of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate the biodegradation of organic pollutants by bacterial strains isolated from sewage is often described by a first order kinetic model xu et al 2005 lin et al 2013 xu et al 2005 fitted the biodegradation of di n butyl phthalate ester dbp by pseudomonas fluorescens b 1 isolated from a mangrove sediment to a first order kinetic equation however a second order kinetic model has been developed by fedeila et al 2018 to describe the biodegradation of three anionic surfactants i e sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium lauryl ether sulfate sles by alcaligenes faecalis enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens isolated from industrial wastewater the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m is fitted to a second order kinetic equation of the form 1 1 clopidogrel bisulfate t kt 1 clopidogrel bisulfate 0 clopidogrel bisulfate t represents the concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate mg l 1 at time t h k is the second order kinetic constant l mg 1 h 1 and clopidogrel bisulfate 0 expresses the initial concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate mg l 1 at the initial time t0 the half life of clopidogrel bisulfate in biodegradation tests at a laboratory scale is therefore expressed as 2 t 1 2 1 k clopidogrel bisulfate 0 the second order kinetic model proposed to describe the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m strains in mixed cultures under aerobic conditions shows that the relationships between the initial concentration of organic pollutant and the kinetic constant were inversely proportional the kinetic parameters calculated for the degradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed culture are reported in table 2 the analysis of these kinetic data and their comparison to those obtained previously by fedeila et al 2018 for anionic surfactants biodegradation show a linear relationship between the half life of clopidogrel bisulfate in biodegradation tests and initial carbon substrate concentration table 2 the results obtained in the present work indicate that the strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m isolated from industrial effluents of oued el harrach algiers were able to eliminate in mixed cultures significant quantities of clopidogrel bisulfate at a laboratory scale the study and application of this process in municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment plant are one of our potential prospects 4 conclusion two bacterial strains isolated from industrial wastewater in el harrach algeria were able to degrade clopidogrel bisulfate at the laboratory scale under aerobic conditions significant quantities of this organic pollutant were eliminated in mixed cultures the 16s rrna sequences of these strains identified them as p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m the properties of the cell s surface were determined biodegradation is the primary path on which algerian wastewater treatment plants are based therefore searching for bacterial strains that degrade organic matter such as drugs and the development of the biodegradation process will undoubtedly contribute to the prior treatment of aquatic pollution declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that no known conflicts of interest are associated with this publication

present in a wide range of concentrations from ng l 1 to μg l 1 ellis 2006 baena nogueras et al 2017 ahmed et al 2017 in municipal and industrial sewage water due to a low human metabolization capacity and subsequent excretion by the human body or as a residual compound of an industrial process ecs are not efficiently removed by conventional methods in wastewater treatment plants wwtps so a significant amount of these compounds are identified in natural aquatic environments and drinking water luo et al 2014 yang et al 2017 tarpani and azapagic 2018 it has been reported the numerous adverse effects that these compounds have on ecological systems the environment and human health chopra and kumar 2018 that could be aggravated by their chemical properties and their environmental bioaccumulation i e tijani et al 2013 however despite a significant increase in their occurrence and concentration these relatively new groups of compounds remain without a clear regulation worldwide garcia rodríguez et al 2014 the scientific community have focused their efforts to develop an effective method to remove ecs from wastewater beyond conventional treatments different physical chemical and biological technologies have been developed to remove and degrade the ecs from water ahmed et al 2017 in addition the low or non biodegradability of some of them has raised the development of hybrid systems that combine biological and chemical techniques ahmed et al 2017 grandclément et al 2017 biodegradation methods in some of their diverse modalities ahmed et al 2017 have been traditionally applied in wastewater to remove ecs aerobic biodegradation usually mediated by bacteria is one of the most effective methods to eliminate some biodegradable pharmaceuticals and personal care products from water wang and wang 2018 and chen et al 2018 previously reported de degradation capability of some pure and mixed cultures to degrade antibiotics and an antimicrobial agent used in personal care products respectively furthermore some authors have reported an effective degradation of drugs such as naproxen or diclofenac by consortia extracted from natural media such as forest soil and river water or water and sludges from a wwtp grenni et al 2013 molina et al 2016 aissaoui et al 2017 facey et al 2017 most of the ppcps degradation works are focused on the study of hormones anti inflammatories and antibiotics conversely there is little or no information about the biological removal of other pharmaceutical compounds such as clopidogrel bisulfate which is relevant in the waters of some countries ibáñez et al 2017 chinnaiyan et al 2018 clopidogrel bisulfate is not significantly removed in conventional wastewater treatment plants although a high degree of degradation up to 95 has been reported at low concentration 130 ng l 1 in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor subedi et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge no aerobic treatment has been reported for the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate in waters thus the development of new research focused on the study of the elimination of this pollutant is a priority the present study aims to investigate the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate to achieve this goal two indigenous bacterial strains were isolated from industrial wastewater in algeria oued el harrach algiers these were identified by biochemical tests 16s rrna gene sequencing and scanning electron microscopy sem the biodegradation process has been optimized the elimination rates of clopidogrel bisulfate by the two bacteria in

a temperature of 4 c and pressure of 50 bar for 7 cycles was used for observing the cells immobilized on the support particles and recording with a feg nova nanosem 230 scanning electron microscope fei europe eindhoven the netherlands 2 5 in depth study of the influence of growth conditions on the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate the biodegradation experiments under aerobic conditions were done in 100 ml of mm sterile solutions the ph was maintained at 7 0 and the sterile bottles were closed with air permeable cotton 2 5 1 initial concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate optimization different concentrations of clopidogrel bisulfate between 5 mg l 1 and 1500 mg l 1 as the sole carbon source were prepared to study the effect of clopidogrel bisulfate high concentrations in mixed cultures media inoculated with the two bacterial strains the bottles were then placed in a heidolph unimax 2010 incubator shaker schwabach germany at 30 c and a shaking rate of 150 rpm for 96 h the initial optimal concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate 100 mg l 1 was selected for all the rest of the experiments by its better elimination level of clopidogrel bisulfate in mixed culture media 2 5 2 ph and temperature optimization the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by the two bacterial strains was improved by examining the effect of initial ph on the culture media and incubation temperature biodegradation tests were carried out at various initial ph values 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 and a fixed temperature of 30 c similarly the influence of the incubation temperature on the use of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed bacterial culture was also studied with incubation at temperatures of 20 30 and 40 c to 100 mg l 1 of initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration and ph of 7 0 samples were collected regularly to monitor the bacterial growth and the elimination rate of clopidogrel bisulfate the optimal ph and incubation temperature were recorded by the maximum optical density value of the bacterial strains measured at 600 nm on a jasco uv vis spectrophotometer v 630 pfungstadt germany 2 5 3 effects of carbon and nitrogen sources concentrations on biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate the aerobic conditions determined at an initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration of 100 mg l 1 ph 7 0 and 30 c were applied to the study of the effect of the concentration of the carbon and nitrogen source on biodegradation in the mixed culture media the experiments were carried out at different concentrations of glucose 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l 1 saccharose 0 0 0 1 0 2

control and data acquisition and processing 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of bacterial strains two strains were isolated from industrial effluents of el harrach algeria and stored on lb agar solid media at 4 c the morphological physiological and biochemical characteristics of the bacterial isolates were determined table 1 the 16s rrna sequences were obtained and compared using blast search to find nearly identical sequences for the 16s rrna sequences determined the two bacterial strains isolated in this work 1m and 5m were identified with the primer pair 27f and 1488r of the 16s rrna gen the sequences were compared with the more similar sequence of the gen bank database resulting in 95 similarity to pseudomonas aeruginosa strain gen bank accession no kt444586 1 and 95 to pseudomonas putida strain gen bank accession no kx817236 1 for 1m and 5m strains respectively the electron micrographs revealing the morphology and surface characteristics of the cells were recorded in a scanning electron microscope fig 1 3 2 toxicity level of clopidogrel bisulfate to the bacterial isolates to study the level of toxicity of clopidogrel bisulfate to the isolated strains in mixed culture media an increase in clopidogrel bisulfate concentration over a range of 5 25 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 in the biodegradation tests at ph 7 0 and temperature of 30 c was carried out on the one hand the results showed that the biodegradation rate of clopidogrel bisulfate as sole carbon source in the mixed bacterial cultures was relatively low for a significant initial clopidogrel bisulfate concentration such as those within the range from 200 mg l 1 up to 1500 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 on the other hand biodegradation rates were high at low concentrations 5 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate fig 2 that indicates that the inhibition of bacterial growth of the mixed cultures by clopidogrel bisulfate is significant from approximately 200 mg l 1 the study of the effect of the initial concentration of organic pollutants on biodegradation rate and bacterial growth in pure and mixed cultures has been reported in several previous works chung et al 2003 dastager et al 2009 christen et al 2012 bera et al 2017 bera et al 2017 showed that phenol presented a relatively high inhibitory effect on a mixed culture of stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila brevibacterium sp and brucella sp above 400 mg l 1 the bacterial growth of the two mixed strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m was better at 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate showing a high elimination rate this was the reason why this initial concentration was selected for all subsequent biodegradation experiments 3 3 effect of ph and temperature on clopidogrel bisulfate biodegradation the effect of ph on the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate was also studied at fixed temperature of 30 c and a clopidogrel bisulfate concentration of 100 mg l 1 the biodegradation plot shown in fig 3 indicates that the bacterial consortium consisting of p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m slightly used clopidogrel bisulfate 31 52 at ph 6 0 increasing the rate to 53 06 at ph 6 5 a remarkable increase in the rate of biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate was observed over the ph range of 7 0 8 5 with 75 23 of elimination rate at ph 7 0 followed by 92 42 of biodegradation at ph 7 5 not only but again degradation of 98 16 and 99 08 was noted at ph 8 0 and 8 5 respectively fig 3 proving that these two bacterial strains showed an alkalophilic nature as previously described bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 at more basic ph exceeding 8 5 a decrease in the biodegradation rate was noted the influence of temperature has been studied in order to review the literature data which show that the strains of the genus pseudomonas have optimal bacterial growth at 30 c guangyu et al 2013 bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 ashis et al 2017 at this temperature the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate at ph 7 0 was maximal with a removal rate of 75 23 and decreased at 40 c 50 82 fig 4 however fig 4 shows that the rate of biodegradation clearly decreased to 41 under the same growth conditions except for the temperature which was lowered to 20 c the optimal growth temperature of strains of the genus pseudomonas has already been studied in several previous works and estimated at 30 37 c guangyu et al 2013 bum et al 2014 jin et al 2016 ashis et al 2017 the results obtained in the present work agree with the literature and confirm well that the bacterial strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m are effective in the biodegradation reactions at an optimum growth temperature of 30 c 3 4 effect of supplemental carbon and nitrogen source concentrations on clopidogrel bisulfate biodegradation the biodegradation tests of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed culture were carried out as a function of the variation in the concentration of glucose and saccharose the results obtained are shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b respectively these figures show that clopidogrel bisulfate was almost entirely used by bacteria when the concentration of glucose or saccharose increased 4 g l 1 indeed elimination of 96 13 and 97 98 of clopidogrel bisulfate was noted at the concentration of 4 g l 1 of glucose and saccharose respectively also high biodegradation rates were observed 94 23 84 36 and 80 for glucose concentrations of 3 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively similarly eliminations of 91 90 2 and 89 95 were performed for saccharose concentrations of 3 2 and 1 g l 1 respectively however a decrease in the rate of biodegradation was recorded in the absence of glucose and saccharose 75 23 elimination a very influential factor on the biodegradation of organic pollutants by microorganisms which consists in enriching the culture media with a nitrogen source has been studied previously in numerous research abboud et al 2007 lin et al 2013 in order to improve the efficiency of the microorganisms in the biodegradation processes of organic molecules the work carried out by these researchers showed that the enrichment of the culture media with optimal concentrations of nitrogen sources has effectively increased the rate of elimination of certain organic pollutants the biodegradation rates of clopidogrel bisulfate in mixed culture media recorded at different concentrations of the nitrogen source nh4no3 are shown in fig 6 the total absence of ammonium nitrate in the culture media disadvantaged the biodegradation processes of clopidogrel bisulfate 24 88 of degradation nevertheless a progressive increase in the rate of biodegradation was observed when the concentration of ammonium nitrate increases in the culture media an optimal concentration of ammonium nitrate 2 g l 1 allowed to reach the maximum biodegradation rate of clopidogrel bisulfate was taken for all biodegradation tests 3 5 biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate at a laboratory scale and kinetic study the bacterial growth of p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m strains in mixed culture enriched with clopidogrel bisulfate as the sole carbon source at ph 7 0 30 c and aerobic shaking 150 rpm was sufficient to remove most of the clopidogrel bisulfate the hplc chromatograms fig 8 indicate the decrease of the peak relative to the clopidogrel bisulfate after the biodegradation processes are carried out furthermore fig 7 shows the experimental and fitted biodegradation curves of clopidogrel bisulfate at different concentrations thus 84 36 79 65 and 75 23 of degradation were obtained respectively for concentrations of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 of clopidogrel bisulfate the biodegradation of organic pollutants by bacterial strains isolated from sewage is often described by a first order kinetic model xu et al 2005 lin et al 2013 xu et al 2005 fitted the biodegradation of di n butyl phthalate ester dbp by pseudomonas fluorescens b 1 isolated from a mangrove sediment to a first order kinetic equation however a second order kinetic model has been developed by fedeila et al 2018 to describe the biodegradation of three anionic surfactants i e sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and sodium lauryl ether sulfate sles by alcaligenes faecalis enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens isolated from industrial wastewater the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m is fitted to a second order kinetic equation of the form 1 1 clopidogrel bisulfate t kt 1 clopidogrel bisulfate 0 clopidogrel bisulfate t represents the concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate mg l 1 at time t h k is the second order kinetic constant l mg 1 h 1 and clopidogrel bisulfate 0 expresses the initial concentration of clopidogrel bisulfate mg l 1 at the initial time t0 the half life of clopidogrel bisulfate in biodegradation tests at a laboratory scale is therefore expressed as 2 t 1 2 1 k clopidogrel bisulfate 0 the second order kinetic model proposed to describe the biodegradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m strains in mixed cultures under aerobic conditions shows that the relationships between the initial concentration of organic pollutant and the kinetic constant were inversely proportional the kinetic parameters calculated for the degradation of clopidogrel bisulfate by the mixed culture are reported in table 2 the analysis of these kinetic data and their comparison to those obtained previously by fedeila et al 2018 for anionic surfactants biodegradation show a linear relationship between the half life of clopidogrel bisulfate in biodegradation tests and initial carbon substrate concentration table 2 the results obtained in the present work indicate that the strains p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m isolated from industrial effluents of oued el harrach algiers were able to eliminate in mixed cultures significant quantities of clopidogrel bisulfate at a laboratory scale the study and application of this process in municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment plant are one of our potential prospects 4 conclusion two bacterial strains isolated from industrial wastewater in el harrach algeria were able to degrade clopidogrel bisulfate at the laboratory scale under aerobic conditions significant quantities of this organic pollutant were eliminated in mixed cultures the 16s rrna sequences of these strains identified them as p aeruginosa 1m and p putida 5m the properties of the cell s surface were determined biodegradation is the primary path on which algerian wastewater treatment plants are based therefore searching for bacterial strains that degrade organic matter such as drugs and the development of the biodegradation process will undoubtedly contribute to the prior treatment of aquatic pollution declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that no known conflicts of interest are associated with this publication
